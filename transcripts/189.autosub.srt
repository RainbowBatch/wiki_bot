00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,888
Baffled as to why other people listen to it and somebody recommended

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824

My Jordan this is so big

This is so big for the longest time

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,127
Flirting around with the idea of

74
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:36,223
Being able to take phone calls

75
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759

76
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039

For now how is not doing a lot of episodes live or any Prince

00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,095
On a trial may be

80
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
But we have a phone line now

81
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:57,215
People can call in and leave messages

82
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,591
Right now we have a situation

83
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,895
If you call this number at any time

84
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,199
You can leave a message

85
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:13,599
We might scream them before we play them we also might not there's a low probability

86
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,791
Jordan going through phone numbers trying to find acronym

87
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887

112
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,295
Do people give the thing to remember and then the actual numbers to it's like a reinforcement

113
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:50,879
Okay

114
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415

121
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,295
No but they would have to reference when they wanted to call

122
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,183
They also have a f****** phone that has the letters on it it's a lot of 6 it'll take

123
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Probably should have written it down.

00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
I like I like

194
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,207
The sentiments

195
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:20,863
But you know what's going on

196
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,215
About forever and evens

197
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,239
Even had

198
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,775
To say we can't do this

199
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
No

200
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Defame

201
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,991
Is from like way early in his career

202
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,807
Kion are opened up like a cable box

203
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Show that there was like a microphone

204
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Like it being one of these things

205
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,023
Was one of my first Rebellion

206
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,631
Make sure course it's from like way to backup

207
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,167
Far back if there's any video of

208
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,287
Me to go find Alex's cell

209
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:04,383
So the idea that this guy is putting out a viral video that's very similar

210
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,175
Alex's greatest hits

211
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Say something

212
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:12,319
Police he's got a police that space shuttle B

213
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,719
Remedial

214
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,559
I do enjoy how Lowe's

215
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,607
Yeah yeah

216
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:28,703
I'm taking this guy down

217
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,287
Beautiful was

218
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Believer

219
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
BlogTalkRadio show would probably like 20 listeners of America

220
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
Like mixed up with Trump really engaged with us probably before all this

221
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,351
Love his show when he's not trying to defend

222
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
But its fake steak

223
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:13,759
It's like chopsticks

224
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
Leon nip

225
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Illusion

226
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,023
Does fuel mistakes

227
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,375
Fuel hire for him but we know it's all a charade

228
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Emotional

229
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,751
I don't mean that I mean as far as

230
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Somebody who's listening to it

231
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
The stakes are much higher in that

232
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,455
I can listen to him talk about this s*** or whatever it is

233
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
2009

234
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,271
And I'm so emotionally detached

235
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,063
Random nonsense

236
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,903
Talking about anything if he's lying about it

237
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,535
President it still reminds me that the president is not going to reunite those f******

238
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Can kids with

239
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Starkid

240
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,959
You're defending of

241
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
Legitimate monster who will go down in history

242
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
As being the dumbest person

243
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,895
And also the first person

244
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,687
1974

245
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,759
3 burnt alive by the entirety of America at the same

246
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,879
340 million people all standing around in a big circle

247
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,671
He's a

248
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
How tall do you think it would have to be to get

249
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,743
Everybody to be able see

250
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,863
Like the tower that pyre

251
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
In order to make sure that the rains come

252
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
Sears Tower is really big

253
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
More than

254
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,639
3 miles away

255
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,687
Super Bass

256
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,927
Well I know if we build it too tall God will Aquarius feel like

257
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Again

258
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Yeah I don't know

259
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Where you're trying to

260
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
Articulating

261
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Like

262
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Back then

263
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
2009

264
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
His rhetoric is very similar in

265
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Like that

266
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,151
But it's kind of important

267
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,223
Defeat throwing out into the world

268
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,015
Where is now everything he does

269
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Isn't service

270
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:23,807
Reinforcing

271
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Even if he isn't

272
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Really apart

273
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
He's just trying to attach himself

274
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Personal gain

275
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
It's still

276
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
Is there

277
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,359
Get rid of that and then go back to that feeling

278
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,735
That's why I like to start the week

279
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,623
2009 stuffed Rosie got worse as the week goes on

280
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
We jump back to the present

281
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Bummed out

282
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,655
Here Alex talk a little bit about what happened during the

283
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
The election

284
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:13,215
Therein

285
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:13,983
2008

286
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,335
I didn't know about this

287
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Dial tickets

288
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
But man

289
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Bedtime

290
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
Rumors

291
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,863
German

292
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Like it's been a month

293
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,431
At this point

294
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
I have to stress that

295
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,783
You're not Eurasian was like literally a month before

296
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
So

297
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,623
There's a difference between criticizing

298
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
The president

299
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
And then burning an effigy

300
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,743
Yeah one of those

301
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
And the other one is is is pretty cool

302
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,447
Generally the time. Immediately following Obama being elected

303
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,567
It was more the latter that people were doing

304
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,967
Puppets

305
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,759
Later than where we are

306
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,295
Because a lot of that was part and parcel of

307
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,319
The Tea Party protest

308
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
Broken

309
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
Images

310
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,999
People's hearts already a month but perhaps that wasn't being

311
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Publicly done

312
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
Have time stamps

313
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
I do a picture

314
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
Oh yeah

315
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,359
Alex is so excited about the Obama Deception

316
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
Coming out in March

317
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,175
Coming up March 5th

318
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
He's an ounce

319
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,783
Yeah he's so excited about it that what he does

320
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
If he decides

321
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
C-SPAN

322
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:13,279
Entire

323
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839
He spends an entire commercial to commercial break

324
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Goes to commercial

325
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Does another half segment

326
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,543
Just reading from the script and one of the things that really struck stuck out to me was like

327
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
This is

328
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Same topic

329
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Endgame

330
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,687
It's all the same

331
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,391
Cool of the things that I talked about

332
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
I'm going to just repeat my material

333
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
Burn that material

334
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,351
Late night again

335
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:51,167
That is dirty pool man

336
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
This stuff on TV

337
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
Put it on TV it's burned so

338
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
That cut that out cuz

339
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,895
Who needs to look for that if you want

340
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,967
Does he do a good voice over

341
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
Since I haven't watched any of his documentaries into endgame

342
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,415
Never will

343
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:18,815
Hankering

344
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
He does say

345
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:32,639
The whole lotta

346
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:42,111
He's released

347
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Maybe second-to-last

348
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,535
Kimberly squatting documentary Loose Change

349
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Purdue student director write that one

350
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:57,471
Robert Evans

351
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,591
Great movies Watertown Rosemary's Baby

352
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,967
Great movies directed by Jason bermas

353
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,831
Rosemary's Baby

354
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,367
Another one of those but

355
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,440
People who are satanic

356
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
Donuts

357
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:26,400
Download a documentary like we should never cover them

358
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Cuz they were made on like

359
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:30,496
Shoulder cameras

360
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Very

361
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
DIY

362
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,872
Like shoulder cameras from like the 90s

363
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
For my broadcast products

364
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Respect

365
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
The hell out of that muscle

366
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
Cuz when I was in high school

367
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:50,208
Who's program and like you are the coolest

368
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
Circle

369
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,816
In doing it we have those cameras you put on your shoulder

370
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Father super-heavy

371
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
And you had to go for

372
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,288
VHS tape to tape

373
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,568
Like you had

374
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
It would

375
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Was a disaster

376
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:10,176
Time consuming

377
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Compared to like digital item

378
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Really put in the times

379
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
To do all that

380
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,416
I took my captured the content is terrible you know that's why I professionally

381
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:25,536
That's why professional operations used beta long past the beta Wars had ended

382
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Because Beta had

383
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Timestamps

384
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Make editing a lot easier

385
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,728
Look up even back then

386
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:53,696
We live in Chicago Illinois

387
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
Michelle

388
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:57,536
Alex

389
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Call from a guy names

390
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Chicago

391
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:00,864
And I'll tell you

392
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,680
From Chicago is from Chicago

393
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
But he's one of the bad sounds a bit like he's from

394
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:18,528
Sounds like one of those apples that you mean

395
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
Welcome

396
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
I hear a lot of music

397
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,656
Okay cartoon

398
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
It's just lunch

399
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,520
Cartoon satire about the chimpanzee

400
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,056
This is a like a

401
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,664
This is like an editorial cartoon that come out where Al Sharpton is a chimpanzee

402
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,528
So keep that in mind.

403
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Al Sharpton

404
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,624
You might just be using that as a jump

405
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,928
But what I'm calling about is that

406
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,328
There's an article in the Washington times has u.s. powered Leon rate

407
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,424
Back about six months ago or whenever it was

408
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,032
I kind of figured that this was going to be a black power grab and I said it was

409
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
I could go

410
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,360
Excerpt some of the comments here

411
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Criticism from conservatives

412
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,688
Tom fitton

413
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,736
Conservative Judicial Watch

414
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
He says

415
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Quoting I think we're going back

416
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:27,648
Going to revert back to the old days of the federal government pushing quotas and race

417
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
Consciousness

418
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,952
Policy

419
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Public policy

420
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:36,096
Yeah that's terrible.

421
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
He just Rambles from there

422
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:49,152
Pick you up. You're going to drop the clothes

423
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:57,856
Like I love to let you go

424
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Realtor

425
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:05,024
A branch of Chicago racism is very rich

426
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,776
I've smelled that before

427
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,480
Oh my God I'm having flashbacks and up and then

428
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,832
At least after the show

429
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
You're talking to

430
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,536
Chicago you're a real funny guy

431
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
You heard this joke

432
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
Steve's from like some sort of weird. I'm guessing

433
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Chicago

434
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,432
Alright

435
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,016
Anyway my my issue here is like

436
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
I think I was let him talk

437
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:04,416
Too long I think once he said this is a black power grab Alex more like

438
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Cuz you can tell kids response

439
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,352
Has nothing to do with

440
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:15,168
We don't listen to the news on my news program

441
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
Before it got too harsh

442
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,176
Real bat you and I both heard after the first sentence but the n-word was coming

443
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,968
It was around the corner

444
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Hard

445
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,600
And who's going to be the Chicago or which is even worse than the regular

446
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
The deep dish

447
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,256
And talk about

448
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Nothing

449
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Primarily

450
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
And then he gets

451
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:43,840
Back to the topic

452
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,608
Race

453
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
And racism

454
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Gets

455
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
Trouble

456
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
Modern multiculturalism

457
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,304
Shrive

458
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:26,336
Problem

459
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
I would say

460
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:31,968
Most of what Alex talks about about his childhood

461
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,528
Is either how many people he had sex with

462
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,136
How he's never been

463
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,976
Alternating I've never seen whites do racism

464
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
And then I was such a

465
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,560
Victim of racist

466
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:49,120
Also just as Monterey

467
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,448
I don't have a parcel

468
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
That is so like

469
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,776
If there is a wrong place

470
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
To take this that's probably yet

471
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
Licking

472
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:02,432
Like I said earlier I admire him shutting down

473
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,272
Introspective

474
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,368
And that was the worst that he's like

475
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
Look the moment

476
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Feeling like

477
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,048
So you know how racist is whenever they get something

478
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
So obviously wrong

479
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,424
What he said so called differences in Pigman

480
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
No

481
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
Difference

482
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:37,248
That's a normal thing I don't have to speak politically correct out

483
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,392
We're all cool with that if you're starting from a

484
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,976
Let's put this whole called pigment difference out of the plate

485
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,280
You're like oh you're super race

486
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
It's a little facetious a little glitch

487
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,144
Preemptive

488
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
I would definitely

489
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,128
In response to this

490
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
Brought by Steve

491
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,176
Chicago

492
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,224
Right

493
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
Whatever but then he says that

494
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,880
Austin Texas

495
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,792
That that

496
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
Your people want to be around

497
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,752
The bordering areas words

498
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
English

499
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Couple problems

500
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
The French Duo

501
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,792
Definition of

502
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
But Alex's

503
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Just throwing around all flippantly

504
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,424
Legitimately

505
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
He said tomorrow

506
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:08,384
He's Mexican.

507
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:14,528
Mario is a quarter of a town or city especially one with

508
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
High poverty level

509
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
It's essentially Club

510
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,024
Still a lot of these.

511
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,824
Water move it I like to see of redlining that is existence inside

512
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,224
They want to move there

513
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
It's a it's a choice

514
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:51,136
Also think about what exactly you're comparing this do

515
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:56,256
Cuz they're art Barrios or the English speakers in like a

516
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
Quebec

517
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,352
You say that

518
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
And you're right

519
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,448
Poor areas

520
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,008
Exclusively one

521
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,056
Mississippi living there in

522
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:13,408
Quebec French Barrios

523
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:24,160
Yeah where you going where you got what you got

524
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
Take that

525
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,248
Show me

526
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
Alright

527
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
I know a little bit of French

528
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,720
Guillain-Barre emphasis on little

529
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:04,608
You are revealing this up

530
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
Thursday. Thursday on Friday

531
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:19,712
That's pretty solid might have enough

532
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,480
If only we had

533
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,016
Endless possibilities

534
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,600
Friday I was like

535
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,928
Single serve coffee

536
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
I might have

537
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Have to move

538
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,232
At the end of it

539
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Where am I

540
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
My living

541
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,096
Situation is a little bit up in the air right now

542
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
To the point of on Friday I was

543
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
Legitimately looking at

544
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
I would like

545
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
Legitimately on websites

546
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Conversion

547
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Euros to

548
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:57,600
I believe the text I received was that the rent in Lehigh

549
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Countries

550
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,696
Blown Away

551
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
Your Healthcare

552
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
You have to get a job

553
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,936
Alright alright

554
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,544
Tuesday

555
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,408
Trying to dance around. Talk about Alex being more racist

556
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
You do continuous.

557
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,888
Turn it up

558
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
Programs

559
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,416
Just a huge distraction and diversion

560
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Talk about race

561
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,072
You

562
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Individually

563
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,496
I think emotionally equipped to deal with when I have a massive chip on their shoulder and think that

564
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,056
Anybody who's talking about race relations

565
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,336
Systemic racism

566
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
Power imbalances

567
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
Are just trying to create

568
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:30,272
I think it's in your world you you probably already for it

569
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
But

570
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
Everyone else I could handle it

571
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,904
And I think that's our conversations about race are not like

572
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,256
Hey look at you looking at skin on here

573
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,584
Look at yours

574
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
Some sort of weird like

575
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,728
It's about like hey you know it be interesting to understand

576
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
The world

577
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:56,128
On an empathic level 100

578
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
That you don't have access to

579
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,224
The top part of your experience

580
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
All the time

581
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,088
Keeps on repeating over and over and over again

582
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,880
I saw story just on

583
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,928
End of last week on democracy

584
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,488
A girl who was eating lunch

585
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
For college

586
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
And someone called the police

587
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,584
They said that she didn't look like

588
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Black

589
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
She posted about it

590
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,728
The only thing I was doing was

591
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,776
Black

592
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
Like I know that

593
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
Stories keep happening

594
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
But there are those things

595
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
Outside of your Experian

596
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
And if you don't talk to Pete

597
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
People about racial issues

598
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
Everything is about white guilt

599
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
You'll never be able to understand

600
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,440
Always have

601
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
And then

602
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
You end up like Alex

603
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:48,352
Well just just on Saturday my

604
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,216
Girlfriend my parents came up to visit we we went out to take

605
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
Eat lunch with them

606
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,752
Afterwards

607
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
We had to

608
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Continue talking

609
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,848
Because

610
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
Hyundai

611
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
My my girlfriend just

612
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,760
Told my parents because she grew up in South Africa

613
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,344
And so she told my parents the story where

614
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,368
This

615
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
Boots black

616
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
Person who worked on there

617
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Just how everybody

618
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Did stuff

619
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
And her dad

620
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,656
M11

621
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,216
And the ambulance that shows up says oh I'm sorry

622
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:27,520
We don't handle blackface

623
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
You're going to have to take

624
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
And my parents just heard that and we're like

625
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
I saw their faces and it was legitimately they never thought it was real because they've never heard of a person who

626
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,864
Neversoft

627
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
You always been

628
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,680
Defensive whenever you heard exactly

629
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Troubling

630
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Sad

631
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,080
Reply to sexuality

632
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,872
Nationality

633
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
Immigrant status

634
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:14,368
They make me feel like genuinely if I just brought all of my friends

635
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,952
From varying backgrounds in to talk to my parents and tell them

636
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
Tell them one story they

637
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,024
Like

638
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,120
In a week maybe like oh shoot I think there might be something to this whole

639
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:32,800
We are years behind on this thing

640
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,592
Not only didn't help

641
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
It made you want to

642
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,944
Kill yourself

643
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,344
Great God

644
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
To put a button on all that cuz we're out of the races

645
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
For now although there's another one

646
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
Coming up don't get me wrong

647
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,680
There's just a Lackey

648
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,496
Willingness to engage that's all

649
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Narrative

650
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Just someone new

651
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Just is like

652
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
This is my opinion

653
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
I'm going to take it

654
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
The front on myself

655
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,968
Outside of

656
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
Whatever I believe and also I'm

657
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
Supernaut

658
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Black

659
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Just don't like him for other

660
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Totally not

661
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:24,000
Having a so-called different pigments

662
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,352
Really long

663
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
Becca problems

664
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,240
Is the idea that Obama said that

665
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
He wasn't going to

666
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Having a bunch of

667
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
And I would say

668
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,040
We agree but is that guy

669
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Entirety

670
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
Complaining about

671
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,928
Facts about Obama

672
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,696
There is like

673
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
He was going to bring

674
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Home day 1

675
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,840
I maybe he aspired to but then when he got in here Eliza

676
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
That would be

677
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
What

678
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
Follow through with

679
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,640
Closing Guantanamo course

680
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,456
Quagmire is it

681
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,320
Which I think you still should have done

682
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,344
Take the hit

683
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
Bite the bullet

684
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,304
I mean that's something we can relieve we can read litigate Obama's presidency for forever

685
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,888
Possibly understand

686
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
Exactly

687
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Complained

688
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
About

689
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:57,952
Obama

690
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
You should have the same

691
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Complaints about

692
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Zoe

693
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
False

694
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
I don't I don't

695
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,424
Because it's a black bread

696
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Get away from that

697
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Has to be a part of

698
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
The way he interacts with race

699
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Beatles

700
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
About being made

701
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
Feel guilty about white.

702
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
And the fact

703
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Plane

704
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
About Obama

705
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
You should complain about trucks

706
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Will get the f******

707
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
But like it just doesn't

708
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,416
Track for me

709
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
It can't there has to be a bigger

710
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:31,744
Reason

711
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,768
And it's not

712
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:38,144
It's not that Trump is against the globalist

713
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
No

714
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,008
But Thursday row way to look at Trump is Perez president and not sink

715
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
This is

716
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,056
Because

717
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
A black guy with president

718
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
And the white panda

719
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
F****** rise up or whatever it is

720
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
Alien

721
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:55,808
Get rid of

722
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,600
Transition

723
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,136
The Thinker

724
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
Awesome talks

725
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
About

726
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:07,072
The alien Rodin

727
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
The space monster Rodan

728
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Both of the rapper

729
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,008
So I can wrap reference about the

730
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
The Sculptor

731
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,176
What do you mean you didn't realize that

732
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,736
What do you mean

733
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,088
Which one was Rodin

734
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,136
Brodin wasn't the Dragon

735
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
No

736
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:36,768
Monster

737
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,072
Know the King Ghidorah came from a volcano

738
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
What's

739
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,400
From deep within

740
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,216
The monster is zero

741
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:48,544
Destroy All Monsters

742
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
How dare you

743
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
Trying to pick

744
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Mothra was mop

745
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,551
Mothra was about Mothra was actually the

746
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
I have a lot of thoughts

747
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
About the Catherine

748
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:21,823
Characters in the Godzilla universe but also was specifically

749
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
By Pharoahe Monch

750
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
That's why I call right

751
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
That's what I started

752
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:44,607
Infowars

753
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:52,287
But is on

754
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
And

755
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
We made this point

756
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,455
Before but I think that Alex got a lot of his early narrative

757
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
From Alan Watts

758
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,807
I think that he is responsible for a great deal of these

759
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Fake

760
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
Information that Alex

761
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,463
Because their interview is just rehashing engaged

762
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,023
We talked about him

763
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,559
We have the exact same

764
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,375
The lights just went out a little bit

765
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
Resigned

766
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
It did that earlier today too

767
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,175
The global is coming to get us trying to turn off the light

768
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
I wish I was exploitative

769
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
Just like

770
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
Power

771
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,695
I want to go to France

772
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Just calling

773
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:49,119
That's what I'm saying

774
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Neon nips also

775
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,191
French

776
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
Naomi

777
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,055
Alan Watts

778
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,871
Also like the thing that really stuck out to me

779
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Because we covered it so much

780
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Endgame cover

781
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
If you want to go listen to that

782
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:05,503
Sony archives

783
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
Yep

784
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,599
We don't need to ask we learned our lesson the last episode of like

785
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
Doing too much

786
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,183
We covered this already

787
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Cuz they

788
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Alan Watts

789
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Has a very specific

790
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,559
Reading on the club

791
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,119
Chrome because I've read there

792
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
I know that he's wrong

793
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
But I also know that

794
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Exactly what Alex

795
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
So I have a working theory that Island

796
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Is the one who has like let him

797
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
Ocala map

798
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,663
A so-so he's Alex

799
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:36,479
Is Pez

800
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
Yeah little bit

801
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,343
Because I don't know what he's like in the same thing

802
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,647
He's much less famous

803
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
So there is this

804
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
He's also

805
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,511
Clearly

806
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,303
Appliance

807
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,143
Kind of like if you're like a famous, can you have a friend

808
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
New spot

809
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
But he never made it

810
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Who's like yeah you're like

811
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Never heard of that situation

812
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
I think it's been a lot of movies about stand up

813
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
What but I wanted to let him

814
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
Presented on this episode

815
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,271
So I have one clip

816
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,551
Alan Watt

817
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
Which we have not heard

818
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,855
Before

819
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:14,879
Is Ludacris

820
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,999
Something that was discussed over 100 years ago at World meeting

821
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,791
And and that was

822
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,751
And go against their agenda and and get it published

823
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
All of them

824
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,799
That's also part of

825
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Extreme process

826
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,919
The same thing with a drugging of children mini young meals

827
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,247
School betrothal different Roxy get them Redlin excetera

828
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:47,391
This is to Giant

829
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
Their diagnosis being hyper because it

830
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:52,511
Questions about Happy with advances to get

831
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,351
Nakagawa has leadership affect agenda

832
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Has never ever faltered from

833
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,983
Set down a hundred years ago there they're right on track

834
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:06,335
So yeah

835
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
The end of the clip

836
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:10,431
Why are you so focused on

837
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
Maybe it's because

838
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
Leadership

839
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,807
Is that leadership only exist

840
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,343
Within the male of the species

841
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,975
And it's just it's

842
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
Fear is more than

843
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
But

844
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,263
Christina's Restaurant Moore

845
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,543
Current

846
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,615
In 2009

847
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
2009 but

848
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,431
He is not as like

849
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
He doesn't have

850
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
2000

851
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
He does not trust

852
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
He doesn't hate them

853
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Really weird

854
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
2000

855
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
I hit a lick in my

856
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:01,631
I would like every episode being like

857
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:08,287
Alex does not think Muslims are demons

858
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,359
I wanted to keep a running tally of it but I have

859
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:13,919
Prison cell

860
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,271
He's still not brought up Soros

861
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
And of course it did

862
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
He thinks that

863
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:50,015
National sovereignty of an intellectual Elite and world bankers is surely preferable

864
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Termination practice

865
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:57,439
New World Order

866
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,071
From David Rockefeller

867
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
What do you think about that

868
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,447
That first especially what do you think of that last word

869
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:14,335
I mean generally called an ombudsman

870
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,615
He's trying to combine

871
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
Omni budsman

872
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:26,111
Rockefeller in the definition

873
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:31,487
Administration

874
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,095
Even more Petty

875
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,167
Supranational not super Nash

876
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,799
To be further Petty

877
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Sometimes

878
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,551
Really shaky attribution

879
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,647
Just started appearing

880
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
The year or two after

881
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
The most from

882
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,655
Where did this quote originate

883
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
Cuz it's not recorded anywhere it's not

884
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:19,359
Like like solid reporting it was pushed very strongly by

885
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,639
The national front

886
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,223
A publication run

887
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
National front

888
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,039
Which is

889
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:33,439
Political party that was run by Marine Le Pen

890
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
And what they mean is

891
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
Vichyssoise

892
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
Dude I don't

893
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:47,775
I don't know I just wonder why I don't want to I just want Alex to f****** pick a side on the Nazi

894
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
Why is why is it

895
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,479
Ronnie's like I love Hitler

896
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,807
If you're going to do the Nazi thing then just

897
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Embracive

898
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,135
Living the

899
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:03,903
Half-measure

900
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Bulshit

901
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,743
Because everyone

902
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Pizza nosh

903
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,559
Yeah so they have to publicly.

904
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:15,423
And complain that who they don't like are the actual

905
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:24,127
Jesus people rhetoric brilliant

906
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Against your

907
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,431
Globalist anime

908
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
What have you

909
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
I mean it's

910
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
It's a good game

911
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
No nothing

912
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
Always punch

913
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:33,599
I agree

914
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
I agree

915
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
And

916
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
If you can find

917
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
When cops are

918
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,815
Four Season anti-anti

919
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
I thought

920
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Weird footage

921
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,655
ProTech

922
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,151
It's almost like there's a concerted effort

923
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,967
I meant predictable

924
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
I know right

925
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,343
You rat you I read that Guardian report.

926
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
Oh you guys are surprised

927
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,791
So I have a couple of film crew

928
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
In the studio

929
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:15,839
At this point

930
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,959
Cuz apparently the IFC is doing like an episode of something

931
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
About

932
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,263
Conspiracy theories

933
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
The independent film Channel. Correct

934
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:34,527
He also has been Aunt Australia

935
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,111
Who are doing the show called

936
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
Hunter

937
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,951
Which dried

938
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:44,511
Very hard to find online

939
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,679
Number one answer on the board

940
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
Subaru

941
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,271
Didn't become a shows because it was actually about a guy who hunted conspiracy theorists and Alex

942
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
You can't you can make sure about it

943
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,415
Conspiracy Hunter if he gets killed by ex first

944
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,999
Van Helsing the shooting Van Helsing

945
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
It's a difference

946
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
You guys were working on spec

947
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
And then they got the footage together and people like

948
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,383
For the History Channel guys

949
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,783
Not going to wait around another five years and then you know Alex was on that show bread

950
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Meltzer's decoded

951
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
I think I

952
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,463
There's two guys named Meltzer one is a wrestling journalists in the others

953
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Conspiracy theory dude

954
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
I can't remember which one is open

955
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:54,399
Smeltery bubble titles

956
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
I only noticed

957
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Those are two

958
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
Topics that I talk

959
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,543
To Marty DeRosa about a lot and that's why they become

960
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:10,015
Consulted on that show and it was on the History Channel

961
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
History Channel

962
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,063
Alex

963
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,415
He also was on Jesse Ventura show

964
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
Fair enough

965
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Also

966
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
I want to go

967
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,071
Embarrass

968
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:27,423
But I was just thrilled that he has this film crew in studio

969
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,727
And he accidentally let something slip

970
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,519
That works into one of my theories

971
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,311
That had been out till this point

972
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:40,479
Everything that's not strong.

973
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,631
Jamaican look like

974
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
What's going on in here

975
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,783
Transit time

976
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,319
The new studio

977
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:22,975
This is only important because it works into my theory of they moved into a new studio around the time

978
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:28,095
Yeah yeah

979
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
So

980
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,167
It works from a timeline stamp

981
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,215
I have nothing concrete

982
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,287
Keep this up but man the circumstantial evidence is starting to pile up

983
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,663
Boil

984
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,479
Is always actually including Transit time

985
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
Even when he's saying

986
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,831
Nada

987
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,879
18 hours a day plus

988
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,279
You know it's no Dinklage

989
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
You're digging around half the

990
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
The time being race

991
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,679
Right you're just texting weird

992
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
I don't know

993
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
Now that

994
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
That's our history

995
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:17,759
Episodes of naked and afraid be like episode

996
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
Miracle Whip

997
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Why did you do it

998
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,415
Tastees dip

999
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:26,463
Premier equipment

1000
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:31,071
So you sweat macaroni and cheese what is that smell

1001
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
In my life

1002
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,191
Because of

1003
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
Time and we couldn't enjoy all the

1004
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
Eclipse

1005
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
Suggest that Austin

1006
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,359
Police chief

1007
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,687
Art Acevedo

1008
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,991
Turned out like the only

1009
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,551
He's the only police chief I've ever liked

1010
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:59,487
Talk about how is this going to end

1011
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,023
Which is a Quinn

1012
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,095
It's been a month

1013
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,119
But then

1014
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
Further

1015
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
This guy named Bob.

1016
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
Who's Austin

1017
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
Local

1018
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,663
You say his name I hear Bob Fosse

1019
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Right

1020
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Cannot

1021
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
Not think about it like there is

1022
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
The only thing I see

1023
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:25,599
There's also a great improvisers been on improv4humans

1024
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,879
Name is Bob.

1025
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:28,927
Bucket list

1026
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,487
The great episode with just ham and

1027
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
He's actually Brendan dassey

1028
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,031
Problem

1029
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
Finding out what the

1030
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
Murderer is

1031
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Within

1032
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,783
What is a murder podcast but if you want

1033
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
My buddy Kyle Ayers

1034
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
Has made a podcast called

1035
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
Give the word other cop

1036
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
To do a podcast about making a murderer

1037
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,327
But you never told them that he had not watched it

1038
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,143
Watched

1039
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
We did a miniseries of that

1040
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,031
It's really fun

1041
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,079
I recommend

1042
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
And also Mike Rivero

1043
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,295
Mike Rivero is calling in from Hawaii

1044
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
He's the guy who has

1045
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,855
Is the show called what really happened

1046
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
Send with Mike Rivero

1047
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,415
GM's up maybe

1048
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,231
Leaving

1049
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
Alex

1050
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,815
Because he's like this guy

1051
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,095
Puppet of Israel

1052
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,375
Mike Rivero hates

1053
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
Cuz that makes

1054
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
This progression works out

1055
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,799
Yeah but anyway

1056
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,079
Hawaii

1057
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
Is in studio

1058
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,919
Bull session

1059
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,455
Weather today in Obama sucks

1060
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,503
Nothing substantial nothing mean

1061
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,271
Meaningful

1062
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,319
We learned that Bob.

1063
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,111
Runs hardware store

1064
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,695
Wait right

1065
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
Wait what

1066
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,743
So he runs a hardware store

1067
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,839
Hardware store

1068
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:14,911
I don't give a s***

1069
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
They presented as a

1070
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,519
Mom and pop place

1071
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,847
He's just a manager doesn't run

1072
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Perhaps

1073
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
Alex

1074
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,575
Maybe has a stroke

1075
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,903
I'm turns into a character

1076
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
Much like someone might do on him

1077
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,535
The other one was

1078
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:44,607
He might do a character that goes this f****** long

1079
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:49,983
Hardware store

1080
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,271
We have a hardware store in New Mexico

1081
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Real quick work disco's on Wild

1082
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:26,591
Dixie not there's nothing no this is this is nothing set up at all before

1083
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:31,967
Resist that leads to believe about to do a British guy

1084
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,015
I'm just trying to talk about

1085
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,319
Screen doors

1086
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
And I sell guns

1087
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,695
That's how I restore anymore

1088
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:46,815
Google call Guns hardware store

1089
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:47,839
Yeah probably

1090
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:54,495
I would like a Whole Foods gun

1091
00:59:54,751 --> 01:00:00,639
Still going on my displays

1092
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:07,039
Barack Obama

1093
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:18,303
Civilian

1094
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:31,103
A rattle spider

1095
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:37,503
Are you okay

1096
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:42,111
Mike Rivero still hanging out on

1097
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
Are you

1098
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,207
Should I

1099
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:52,607
Asking if you're okay is your home

1100
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:59,007
Another minute of this character

1101
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
Got the taste

1102
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
Is ironically saying that

1103
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:09,247
Play shouldn't have actually

1104
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
Literally saying that

1105
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
Because

1106
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:17,183
Look at people and other this Associated groups have power now

1107
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,743
They're saying that I have done

1108
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,047
Enter with Echo

1109
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,607
The very real crimes that white people commit

1110
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Actually happening

1111
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:29,727
Person once again saying

1112
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,335
Of course you are doing this to me because this is exactly what I would do to you

1113
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
So Def

1114
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
The only other thing that happens

1115
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,551
Predict very specifically

1116
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
That within a

1117
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,367
A few years the dollar is going to go

1118
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
Arrow

1119
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,439
Which

1120
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
9 years old should my watch nine years later

1121
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,511
Still got dollars

1122
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,303
What is the conversion rate

1123
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
To the Amero

1124
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
I mean it

1125
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Infinity

1126
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:03,007
1 million percent

1127
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,311
So now we move onto the 20th

1128
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Is the Friday

1129
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
To get the week.

1130
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,919
A w come

1131
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,223
What's come hard on this

1132
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,247
This Friday

1133
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
Notice

1134
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
There wasn't a lot of talk

1135
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,087
What is

1136
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
The predominant narrative

1137
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
In dispatch

1138
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671

2009

1140
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,743
Which is all of these states

1141
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
But their sovereignty bill

1142
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
He's naughty get back to it

1143
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Start up the

1144
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,727
But we have more gas

1145
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:36,543
Representative

1146
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Berman

1147
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,295
Rights declaration

1148
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
Amtrak

1149
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:55,231
Why are using radio show and others the last two weeks

1150
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,655
What is

1151
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,679
What is that

1152
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
What does intent

1153
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,775
Better

1154
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,591
I don't know what he isn't

1155
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,639
I don't know what his goals are half

1156
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
He's just

1157
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
What was that British voice

1158
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:22,111
That's true he is having fun

1159
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
There's no call he's just

1160
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:30,303
Really matters right about isn't real

1161
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,887
He's just drumming up theater in order to sell his Wares

1162
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,935
And you've got a stable operation going

1163
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,471
But it don't

1164
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
It's this weird

1165
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,335
Like terrifying grounded he must be walking on wherein

1166
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
In order for him to stay

1167
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
Okay

1168
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
As the economy gets worse

1169
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,039
He has to pretend that the economy is going

1170
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,111
So he has to

1171
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,975
Keep being really negative if things are going to stay positive on

1172
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,743
So

1173
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:02,559
It's a very weird

1174
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
For him you like everything

1175
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,911
I don't really care and that's why he allows himself to do

1176
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:07,935
3 minute long British

1177
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:08,703
Compression

1178
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
Yelling about you entry

1179
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
Texas

1180
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,919
House concurrent resolution that doesn't mean anything

1181
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:18,943
What do ya

1182
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,271
Untethered

1183
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,159
He has no agenda with this other than just the like

1184
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:30,207
Is bigotry

1185
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,767
But I mean like

1186
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,143
We can we can let that go because now he's just being a

1187
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,423
Dick for no reason

1188
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,263
Guys even coming on a Shell Knob like

1189
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,359
Stewart's from Revolution

1190
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,687
But I don't think it was an elitist

1191
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,991
Doing there I think

1192
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
Like it's almost text me with

1193
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,599
This bill is getting introduced because

1194
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,623
They're so powerful

1195
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,719
State Legislature and make the

1196
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511
That's what I

1197
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
That voice

1198
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
I don't understand

1199
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,095
Is British accent

1200
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,167
This is

1201
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
I think it was one sounds British

1202
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Alright

1203
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,847
We have more gas

1204
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,919
Plural

1205
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
Berman

1206
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:34,975
Rights declaration

1207
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:41,375
Because

1208
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:49,567
Alright do you know what

1209
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,847
Because we're coming right up

1210
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:51,871
The heels of the British Acts

1211
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
That was on me

1212
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,223
I apologize I appreciate

1213
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
I accept

1214
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:02,623
My incorrect

1215
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,439
I really care about this he's just talking about how

1216
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,511
Their people are cracking down on Swiss banking

1217
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,095
Workout

1218
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:17,215
No but I would also say that most people

1219
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
Because of

1220
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,055
Banking laws

1221
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,871
The only reason to have a Swiss bank account

1222
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,639
Is if you want to

1223
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
Nouveau riche or not

1224
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,015
You know what

1225
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,063
And it's not even popular anymore

1226
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
A great way to hide money

1227
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
Unless you are

1228
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,743
And you are about to go.

1229
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,119
Or incorporating in Ireland

1230
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
Over it

1231
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,287
530 neon net

1232
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Dumb

1233
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Super

1234
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,175
This might be drama

1235
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,479
Okay

1236
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:04,063
College Doctrine

1237
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
I am 2,000

1238
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,767
It's all public

1239
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
This is sick

1240
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,687
But

1241
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,487
Pentagon

1242
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,255
Wham

1243
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,887
1 problems

1244
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:57,567
No I can't think of any problems

1245
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:03,967
I mean I know I can't think of any reason why that would be different also big problem is I read a bunch of interviews with the witch

1246
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:06,271
Lisa bling about this

1247
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
About

1248
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,575
You know the inspiration

1249
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,671
Any thinks like that might be

1250
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Hinted at

1251
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,743
Sister Sister

1252
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
You know what I mean

1253
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:23,167
Conspiracy theorist with The Shining you're still like

1254
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,519
He's raising his eyebrows all the time

1255
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:33,919
Use that I read they were all about the

1256
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:36,735
Ideas of Buddhism quantum physics mathematics

1257
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,015
A lot of cyber

1258
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,415
Punk influences and stuff like that there's a Akira anime comics

1259
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
They were saying

1260
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,071
Is there a bunch of direct references

1261
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,607
Point of people

1262
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:59,007
Kind of Justice remix movie

1263
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,799
Alex

1264
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,335
Is the idea of

1265
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:03,871
Like it comes in

1266
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,943
Into his concept of predictive programming

1267
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
Where you put up

1268
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:08,991
Movie The

1269
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
The science-fiction

1270
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,855
And it's just preparing the public for the reality

1271
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,391
And if that were the case

1272
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,183
I would argue

1273
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
Would have had a

1274
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
Much easier time making

1275
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:27,679
Cuz if you go look at it

1276
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,471
The interview

1277
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
Hear about what

1278
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,543
It took to get that movie made

1279
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,871
They were not able to secure funding until they had

1280
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,151
Design

1281
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,455
Like the idea that they were able to act

1282
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,831
And then also had Keanu Reeves signed on

1283
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
Funding it was a predictive

1284
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,719
Programming situation where the government wanted this

1285
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,559
Message to get out they probably would have fast-tracked it and made it a lot easier

1286
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,631
How did you

1287
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,911
Get the funding

1288
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,215
Right I think it was Lana

1289
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,031
We have to go all over the world

1290
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
They had to go

1291
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:10,687
Had to be jump through in order to make that move

1292
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,223
I'm not into

1293
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,503
It's a way that's like

1294
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:17,855
Thank God they did it's the best thing ever but if you think that that was a cakewalk

1295
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
You are an idiot

1296
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Siri

1297
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,951
Keanu Reeves works with

1298
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,535
That's possible every movie he's made has been predictive programming

1299
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
Because what else what else has he made

1300
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:35,775
Underground fight movie

1301
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:44,479
Now Doug store does not

1302
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
That's just Joy

1303
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,319
They work for

1304
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
That's what they work for

1305
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,671
What was it

1306
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:55,743
Remember I can't even remember the name

1307
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
That one is not from the

1308
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,119
Okay about that project

1309
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:07,775
I actually emailed the envious track 43 November

1310
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,967
No cuz we're eventually going to live in a world where John Wick is

1311
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
Who isn't going to be

1312
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:23,391
At the end of June

1313
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
So that's fine

1314
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,975
I should say I've Not Seen

1315
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:28,767
Anyway

1316
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
I'll see you then

1317
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,351
Every single person listening to this podcast

1318
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,887
Through their headphones on.

1319
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:40,287
They threw their headphones to the ground

1320
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,639
Netflix

1321
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,527
Rosenthal and Confused

1322
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
I want to finish it

1323
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:01,023
I realized the other day that I spend a disorder that amount of my time doing things that I can watch

1324
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,047
Things that

1325
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,071
I'm not a

1326
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,983
Clip

1327
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,007
We meet again

1328
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,823
Legislator

1329
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,103
But it is another guy

1330
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,687
Did the Texas legislator show up though. Comes in late

1331
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,735
But before we meet him

1332
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,527
We need a Montana Legend

1333
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,599
A discount do they have lunch

1334
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
But this guy

1335
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,695
Learning about this man

1336
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,095
Stories in the past

1337
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,655
Did I didn't realize he was a PR all

1338
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,471
F****** connected god dammit

1339
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,543
In just one second

1340
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:47,359
The charts

1341
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,087
Now

1342
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,415

I have the courage

1422
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,391

01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,743
His protection I stand on my integrity

1425
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:22,815
That's all

1426
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
One defensive man

1427
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:31,007
Defensive state representative

1428
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,591
I need to I need to tell you that

1429
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,151
This story goes

Yeah and from the court case

1433
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:50,207

01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,231
Partnership

1435
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023

1436
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:58,143
A 2012 propublica came out with an expose about the wtp West

1437
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Tradition partnership

1438
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:02,495
It is downright surreal

1439
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
And I quote

1440
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:08,639
The boxes landed in the office of the Montana investigator in March 2011

1441
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:14,527
Found in a meth house in Colorado they were somewhat of a mystery holding files on 23

Interstate races in Montana

1443
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,391

Paid for by the campaign

1445
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,743
High-flyers and bank records from outside spending group

1446
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:26,815
One folder was labeled quote Montana money bomb

1447
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,655
The documents pointed to one outside group Springs

1448
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,239
A social welfare nonprofit called Western tradition partnership

1449
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,263
For the WTF

1450
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,847
So are you tracking what's going on here

1451
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
There's a money bomb

1452
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:41,919
Apparently the wpp is

1453
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
Record

1454
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:48,575
And all of these conservative politicians in order to eventually later on

1455
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:54,975
The influence influence

1456
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,535
The sort of

1457
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:03,935
Get the paperwork that without the box of evidence accidentally mail

1458
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,727
Build it to somebody

1459
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
But it isn't a mess house

1460
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,175

01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:26,207
Legally speaking is the

1463
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,743
It's against the law for them to

1464
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,375
Many investigators and experts who look at the documents

1465
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:34,655
Recovered from The Smokehouse

1466
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,935
Say that is a very

1467
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,983
Conclusion to come to the WT

1468
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,007
Teepee with essential

The nonprofit should have read

1476
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
Political

1477
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,879

This month

1483
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
This month

1484
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:15,616
It sent Montana voters a mailer in the form of a newsletter called the Montana Statesman

1485
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:19,200
The claim to be the largest and most trusted news source

1486
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:25,344
The front page of the democratic gubernatorial candidate

1487
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,208
They were just like that's not good

1488
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,256
Names to this

1489
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:37,120
And then we're going to pretend to be a news organization

1490
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
Can you show me

1491
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,984
Can you use lie like that

I feel like you can't just lie like that right

1493
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,872
You can just lie like that like you can just send everybody

1494
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:54,272
Everybody in Chicago if I want if I had enough money I could send them a newspaper

1495
01:20:54,528 --> 01:21:00,672
Say it was the most trusted news source in Chicago every never existed before

1496
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:07,072
Chicago I mean you're not wrong

1497
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:12,192
This ended up going to the Supreme Court

1498
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,216
And

1499
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:20,128
They won did they win five

1500
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:24,992
Before he died

1501
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,208
It was an issue where they're like no

1502
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,072
It would infringe on this company's free speech to not be able to give unlimited money

1503
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,608
And like

1504
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
Pretend that they're not actually

1505
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:42,656

The documents 2008

1512
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,856
Prudential Grassroots membership

1513
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:06,720
Confidential Grassroots membership development proposal

1514
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:09,280
28 Montana State Legislature

1515
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
Rode into office

1516
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,120
In one hundred percent support of w

1517
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,168

01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,848
Where he weirdly raised

1522
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,176
$9,060

1523
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,296
Progressive

1524
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:36,160
For his campaign efforts

1525
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:41,536
In a race where he was running unopposed

1526
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,984
That's always going to be a little bit suspicious if you're running unopposed and someone just gives you about 10

1527
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,824
Generally speaking

1528
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,664
They clearly were

1529
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,968
That's one of the reasons

1530
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,272
For me to like

1531
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,320
We are hook this story back

1532
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
Because

1533
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:12,000
You could be telling yourself like this happened later in his career Scott corrupt

1534
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:18,400
No no offense in the first place he was from the jump

1535
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:22,496
Note for 10 Grand Am that

1536
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,056
Way too low to be able to buy some

1537
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,104
You shouldn't be

1538
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,128
Look

1539
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:34,272
Show me make a lot of other money through other side Hopper

1540
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
I don't want to be correct

1541
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,624
But there's a number

1542
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,672
You know there's probably a number for me

1543
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:47,328
Correct myself or some number I just hope it's enough to feel justifiable

1544
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,376
Tulo I want to be corrupt

1545
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:55,264
I mean I want to do an album with Dez Dillinger

1546
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,080
Now anyway Jordan that we're going to take those away from

1547
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,456
Tire push

1548
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,528
F****** weird man

1549
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,344
A felon found documents in a meth house

1550
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
Right

1551
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,464
And asked around at the meth house and no one really knew where they came from

1552
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:20,352
Eventually he gets to talk into somebody and they say that they think they were found in a car that someone hits

1553
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:29,568
Accidentally found a treasure Trove of documents

1554
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:33,920
Proving massive corruption on a Statewide scale

1555
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:39,552
Wandering around a meth house right

1556
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:46,464
No no I actually think that they were getting a little bit creative

1557
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,744
Night Like This

1558
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,048
The dude is he was looking through the document

1559
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,704
And he contacted the Democratic people who were being smeared by the WTOP

1560
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:03,104
Will know I don't think so

1561
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:08,480
I want to find

1562
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,368
America's first

1563
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,184
You should at least get a little

1564
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,512
You should get a vehicle 8950

1565
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,656
Houston's it to one of the democratic people who was the target of these people's campaign

1566
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
And they're like

1567
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,984
That's f***** up

1568
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:36,384
The Minnesota and the Montana investigators already had an open case about

1569
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,992
Like rampant corruption

1570
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,272
Escalated

1571
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,576
It again appealed to the Supreme Court

1572
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:55,584
If that's okay

1573
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,936
Who was the guy who might have stolen the car

1574
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:06,336
Whose car was it was the car stolen or was the guy left

1575
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
Well a lot of it is

1576
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Kind of vague

1577
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,224
And I can't really Park

1578
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
What it is

1579
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,880
I read the full propublica story in like trying

1580
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,440
Put the pieces of the puzzle together your site

1581
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:26,304
But if you want more information as to why Brett Kavanaugh should never be allowed to BC

1582
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
Supreme Court Justice

1583
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:32,704
Let's just go with this b******* story of what's goalie has brought upon Humanity

1584
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,008
More about jobana

1585
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,664
I'm not nearly done nearly done

1586
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:50,880
He's the guy who I talked about before you guys famous for

1587
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:57,280
Always this guy the guy who repeatedly calls himself the living man and accused the judge of not being qualified

1588
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,376
This is the guy who win the judge leaves the court

1589
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:07,776
Cuz you so frustrated with him he's like and leaves and goes out to

1590
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,336
Another

1591
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,128
Contempt of court charge

1592
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
So you get the charger

1593
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
Contempt of court for leaving

1594
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:22,624
Handcuffed

1595
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
I'm taking it to the observation room

1596
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,696
The trial I love it

1597
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
He's the Prosecco

1598
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
Because he was a lawyer

1599
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:35,680
Because right I don't know if you know this

1600
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,288
Sovereign citizens believe that because they use the

1601
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
The honorific

1602
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,336
Title Esquire

1603
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,384
That means that they are British nobility

1604
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,760
Does esquire originally was a title under British nobility

1605
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,064
Part of

1606
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
Is that the

1607
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,160
Federal government

1608
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,976
Can give no nobility titles to anybody

1609
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,536
And even though Esquire is not

1610
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
A formal

1611
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
Title for lawyers

1612
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,120
Sometimes they take it on

1613
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,400
Weird tradition that

1614
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,960
No one really knows exactly why they do it

1615
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,520
Sovereign citizen

1616
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,288
Hate lawyers

1617
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,824
Cuz I work for the British

1618
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
It's amazing

1619
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,384
And this guy Joel

1620
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,248
I think literacy is

1621
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
The good thing

1622
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,832
There are times

1623
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:25,856
Where that belief

1624
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:30,208
Because what if I couldn't read maybe we'd all be better

1625
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,024
Well know he is a big binders full of things

1626
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,816
You claim to read

1627
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,864
I don't want him to be able to read

1628
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:41,216
If he's if he's only capable of likes

1629
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:44,544
Whenever he was prosecuted

1630
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,104
Design little drawing

1631
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
Here's what I

1632
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:52,224
Let's go back in time and just destroy the Gutenberg

1633
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,504
Alex

1634
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,832
I don't want people to be able to

1635
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,880
I will be

1636
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:04,512
Whoever's whoever's listening

1637
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,304
I want people to be able to read well

1638
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,096
That's what I want

1639
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:11,168
Like if you are able to just

1640
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:11,936
Read a sentence

1641
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,240
I mean that's good that's a starting point

1642
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,288
But if you can't understand what

1643
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,312
You are reading

1644
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,848
You end up being sovereign

1645
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,384
You might as well not be able to read

1646
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,152
In the first place

1647
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,688
Exactly

1648
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,296
We're not. That's a great insult your a waste of literal

1649
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,136
I like it

1650
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:34,464
Courtroom

1651
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
He was holding

1652
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,304
Ever associated with me ever

1653
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:41,376
Wait for it

1654
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,912
Wait for it

1655
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:49,568
He was hauled into court last year to answer charges

1656
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,200
To get to his house but it's area where a forest fire was burning

1657
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:58,272
I've had been evacuated and blocked off due to the emergency

1658
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:04,672
As a devoted

1659
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,696
Authority of the police

1660
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,488
To keep him away from his private property

1661
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:11,328
Also during his encounter with the officer before he crashed the barrier

1662
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,608
Gun

1663
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:20,032
Prosecutor

1664
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,360
Such a menacing way that they fled the courtroom

1665
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:30,016
Over the courtroom

1666
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,368
No no no

1667
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
No

1668
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:39,232
What he's declared himself

1669
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:45,632
Music video of this guy

1670
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,032
Decreed himself innocent of all the charges

1671
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,056
Eminem parentheses

1672
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:59,200
Before the bailiff otherwise brandishing his own before the bailiff to run

1673
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,504
The bailiffs told him otherwise

1674
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,600
It was like get down I mean

1675
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:08,928
I love the bailiff told him otherwise as opposed to

1676
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,952
Did the bailiff being like

1677
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,768
F****** dude I'm here all day

1678
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:15,840
Come on man

1679
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:21,472
Guilty and given a fine

1680
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,336
Is giving a fee of pine of chips over $1,000

1681
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:29,408
About what you got from the wtpa

1682
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
10 days in jail

1683
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
What you didn't end up having

1684
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,808
I mean I get like that kind of crazy

1685
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:40,416
If you see that video I wasn't able to find it again but I have seen that video

1686
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,488
Is pretty amazing

1687
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,536
I don't think the judge and prosecutor

1688
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,352
Scooters that have to flee for their in a courtroom

1689
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:52,192
But get killed

1690
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,496
Murdered by the cops

1691
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,776
For selling

1692
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,800
Cigarettes

1693
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:01,152
Don't forget it

1694
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,784
He actually stands up on a table

1695
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,112
We need to clear some self to Regents goddamnit

1696
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,672
Like god dammit little boy

1697
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,976
Just want a basketball tournament a hard yet

1698
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,560
There's a bunch of room

1699
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,352
Bananas

1700
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:22,400
Genocide

1701
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:24,704
Some folks

1702
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,728
I know is it like

1703
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,056
I know from all his language and I'm the Regent

Discord

1705
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:37,760
Much like his friend the living human who

1706
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,808
Bolo ties right

1707
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,576
The best

1708
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,624
The hardest laugh that I've had

1709
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,160
Probably in the last

1710
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
Few weeks

1711
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,744
I was watching the videos of the living man

1712
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
Horror movie

1713
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,680
When is Slender Man a real thing that have

1714
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:56,960
When he has to come back

1715
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:00,288
2 quart getting handcuffed and taken away

1716
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,312
Cuz he won't stop interrupting

1717
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:08,224
I cannot stand up do I recognize your Authority

1718
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,624
Pick me up as I pick him up

1719
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:17,696
Eminem

1720
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:24,352
I would like you to give my bolo tie to a friend of mine.

1721
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,936
So glad he called out the bowl

1722
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,728
At least he's a man who knows with him for

1723
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:30,752
Alright

1724
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,312
Christ

1725
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,592
Are wild

1726
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,640
Chillum

1727
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,688
Shobhana

1728
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Caleb

1729
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
I love

1730
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:47,392
Whenever we get a guest at pops up like I can really sink my teeth into you like that

1731
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,976
You didn't get reelected

1732
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:55,840
Lieutenant governor in 2000

1733
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Because

1734
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,400
Sexton come down

1735
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:04,800
2012

1736
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,080
An advance but he lost

1737
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,640
Z's Auto

1738
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,432
He is

1739
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:11,968
He's dead

1740
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:13,760
Deprived

1741
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:15,040
Republic

1742
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,600
So at this point Alex's bow head

1743
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,880
This weirdo on

1744
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:22,464
F*** that was a fresh weirdo

1745
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,744
Familiar weirdo on

1746
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
And

1747
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,352
This is

1748
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
Nuts

1749
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
Because I think Alex is in a bad mood

1750
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:36,032
From gen-i Temptations interview is not

1751
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,080
These are all very pretty

1752
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,384
For the most part

1753
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,664
The second half of this

1754
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
Interview is very pretty

1755
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,528
But generally when

1756
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:47,552
It's all business

1757
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,832
Because it's a commercial

1758
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:49,856
That's why he's there

1759
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
What's going on with

1760
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,024
Good mood and so he just

1761
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
Freaks out at 10

1762
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
For a while which is kind of fun

1763
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:02,912
A lot of my guests

1764
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,448
I know you're a pushover

1765
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:07,520
And you know that I sell all your gold tonight

1766
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:12,640
I'm texting you for a little while

1767
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:20,064
Dirt bikes

1768
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:27,232
Yep and you take away the guns of the people and then

1769
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
You gained full control

1770
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
Let me nuts

1771
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,424
That's where you ready for the concentration

1772
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,104
I'm sorry I mean they're arresting they're arresting the people that are using guns to defend themselves

1773
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,128
And

1774
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,432
And letting the criminals out of jail

1775
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,504
I mean that's what's going on over there that's what that kind of Logwood do here

1776
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,600
I mean we need to have our

1777
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:04,608
Vase over someone's head when they're raping them they don't want

1778
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,760
Government is Criminal

1779
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:29,184
I'm sorry Ted

1780
01:36:56,832 --> 01:37:01,952
I think that might be one of the commercial breaks where you ended up throwing a chair or something like that

1781
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,792
Real mad

1782
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,328
Steel pitched

1783
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:12,448
And ruining my day

1784
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,776
We hate doing this but this isn't instance of like

1785
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,544
You got it

1786
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,592
You got to give it up to Alex

1787
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
Tiny bit

1788
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
In terms of like

1789
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,688
He's not lying about gold prices

1790
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
He's lying a little bit

1791
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,296
Besides that they're over $1,000

1792
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:33,696
I've been up over $1,000 for a little bit during the day

1793
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:36,512
2009

1794
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
9:50 or so

1795
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,584
And that might be a small distinction

1796
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,632
Because it never reached

1797
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Until like

1798
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:50,080
Like as a stable prices throughout the day

1799
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
Closing price

1800
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:54,944
Soho

1801
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,480
You bought gold in February

1802
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,016
And then sold it

1803
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,296
Number

1804
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,112
Even if you had bought it from

1805
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,416
You might have made money

1806
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,208
Please because of their like service

1807
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:10,816
Still have made money

1808
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
We have to talk about

1809
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,376
The logistics of gold

1810
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:15,936
Which I still don't

1811
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:20,544
If you're not a failure because

1812
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,824
Do it right

1813
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,848
Yes

1814
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:26,176
Crazy different arrangement

1815
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,968
But yeah

1816
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,248
They do have like lockers

1817
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,576
When when were looking at this

1818
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:35,648
Chicken

1819
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,184
September of 2011 about 8

1820
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
850

1821
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
Announce

1822
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:42,816
I'm so if you bought it when Alex is telling it down there at like

1823
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
900

1824
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:48,448
I guess I made $900

1825
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,728
From that out

1826
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,264
Over 2 years

1827
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,800
Yeah cuz I'm terrible

1828
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,128
If you're going to drop that money

1829
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,664
You have to have money

1830
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
You know what I mean

1831
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,456
Like

1832
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:02,016
We are getting a 100%

1833
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Return

1834
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,392
12:00

1835
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,672
After

1836
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
But like

1837
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,000
You would have made nine

1838
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
A hundred dollars on this

1839
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
You cashed out

1840
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
In September of

1841
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
2011

1842
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,632
Covid-19

1843
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,656
Hundred dollar invest

1844
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:21,216
If you're not buying in bulk

1845
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:25,568
If you're not buying in bulk that's not a meaningful transaction over to

1846
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,688
Anyway

1847
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,992
To the consumers that are probably listening

1848
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,296
You know I'm saying

1849
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:38,112
Like Ira

1850
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,928
Well I'm telling you the gold is rising

1851
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,464
And they're not lying about that

1852
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,024
They are kind of lying about

1853
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
Is it that means

1854
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,632
Did the game

1855
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,912
To buy any meaningful

1856
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,728
Cuz like you know whatever money

1857
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,544
You have around like I say you have $300 tip

1858
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,616
$300

1859
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
At this point

1860
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,176
Sturtevant

1861
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,968
And then

1862
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,248
2 years later

1863
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,272
It's worth six

1864
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:09,344
Is that really life-changing

1865
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Even though the

1866
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,392
Prices gone up

1867
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,160
Double

1868
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,232
It's not really no to buy a lot of it

1869
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,256
For that

1870
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,280
To make a

1871
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,072
So

1872
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,120
Screwing over these

1873
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,656
Buying a little bit

1874
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:31,360
Get out of the wiper

1875
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
Understand the gold Commodities Market

1876
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:35,968
No matter how many times you explain it to me

1877
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:39,552
I'm still going to get stuck on like it's for very very

1878
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,392
Bromas Sunken Treasures

1879
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:49,792
Understand understand how it makes any sense

1880
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
4

1881
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,168
You know

1882
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,448
Traders

1883
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,984
Maybe on like our goals

1884
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:03,616
Something like that and I do not understand this

1885
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,152
When we could do

1886
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:05,920
Sometime

1887
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
Okay

1888
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,832
One piece that I think

1889
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,368
We've been remiss and talk

1890
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,464
The EPA massive

1891
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,768
Ambassador

1892
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,888
It makes sense if you're a billionaire

1893
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:32,032
Gold coin

1894
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,080
Vampiric Lisa

1895
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:34,848
Exactly

1896
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
But at the same time

1897
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:36,896
Like

1898
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,176
Pretty similar

1899
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:39,200
To a stock

1900
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,224
It's already

1901
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,784
Like even if let's say

1902
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:47,392
The First trillion-dollar Corporation stock

1903
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:56,352
Years ago you really a investor

1904
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,400
Make enough money off of

1905
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,448
Them being a trillion-dollar company

1906
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:03,264
In order for it to make any sense for you to do so in the

1907
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:06,848
First appointed inaccessible to most of Alex

1908
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,408
The funnel

1909
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,944
Conduit with which they

1910
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,224
Gideon is a shade

1911
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,504
Business called Mike

1912
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
So they're screwed on both ends

1913
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,088
I got the third thing today

1914
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:19,648
Is it

1915
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,952
This is exactly what you would expect

1916
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,512
This track upward of gold

1917
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:26,816
It what you would

1918
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,352
Expectancy after

1919
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,376
A financial crash

1920
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,912
Let you know after 10

1921
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:32,704
People are panicking a little bit

1922
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,240
Gold prices

1923
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Ashley wood rot

1924
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,336
Has gold prices are just f****** gold prices

1925
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:41,664
It seemed almost untethered

1926
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,480
Guess what you see

1927
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,272
A lot of time

1928
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,576
Price

1929
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,416
And some of that scares

1930
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,952
A little bit artificial

1931
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:57,792
Always talking about how it's really hard to get it done

1932
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,608
Well it's not because the government doesn't want you to have a gun

1933
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
Because all you're creating all this

1934
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:08,800
Sphere in everyone's going in buying gone yet and then there's no more

1935
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:11,872
Versiti is why Venezuela has a 1 million percent

1936
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:14,176
Inflation rate right now is because OPAC

1937
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,456
And other oils

1938
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,016
Producers have

1939
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,064
Artificially deflated the prices

1940
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,136
Productive

1941
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
Tobacco

1942
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
What he's doing

1943
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,680
Whether or not

1944
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,216
It's not just him

1945
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:43,360
This gold

1946
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,128
When there is

1947
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,920
Beer in when there's anxiety

1948
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,736
So what they do is they end up having a lot of pee

1949
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,016
People who are buying gold

1950
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,296
And that makes the price

1951
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,320
The goal to go up

1952
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,088
Yonce

1953
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,928
In the same way that they're artificially creating

1954
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,696
This

1955
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,488
Pretend scarcity of gun

1956
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,256
They are

1957
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,280
Feeding into

1958
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,048
The scarcity

1959
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
Gold

1960
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,608
That ends up raising the bicycle

1961
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
It's kind of a selfie

1962
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:09,216
Perpetuating

1963
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,240
Ends up hurting

1964
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,288
The customers of Midas resource

1965
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:13,312
I just

1966
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
So

1967
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
Let me get this

1968
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,408
Let me get this

1969
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:20,224
Really really straight like down from the very bottom

1970
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:24,064
Gold is expensive because the shot

1971
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,856
Well and because of it

1972
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Electronics

1973
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,464
They're a bunch of like a cables

1974
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,232
And stuff like that

1975
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
We need gold

1976
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,144
For gold hasn't like a semiconductor

1977
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,448
There are like

1978
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,728
Functional reason

1979
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
Gold

1980
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,408
Is it because of his idea that it

1981
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,432
Invaluable

1982
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:55,296
For a long time

1983
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,856
You still really

1984
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
Sharp

1985
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:06,304
I know about the hunt for escape

1986
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,888
But that's not the primary driver of the right

1987
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:12,192
Is that there are people come from

1988
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
A million years ago whenever it was like

1989
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:17,312
This is shining and there's not a ton of

1990
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,664
Easier to get

1991
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:22,944
It was hard to get

1992
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,224
For you and I but

1993
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,504
The companies who could get it

1994
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
Controlled

1995
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
Supply

1996
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,112
Write in order to raise them

1997
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:33,952
Did everybody kind of know that our economy is built on

1998
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:34,720
Magic

1999
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,256
I think

2000
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,024
I think I want

2001
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:41,376
The idea that our economy is just like

2002
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,168
Smoke and mirrors

2003
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:48,800
And if everybody just realized it like a refrigerator was more valuable than gold we would

2004
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,592
Lose our minds crazy

2005
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:53,664
Flex Foundation

2006
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,456
I was in

2007
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
Freshman soccer

2008
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,600
My buddy

2009
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
About my buddy John

2010
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,184
I found out that his dad

2011
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,464
Carnival

2012
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,024
And it was usable

2013
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,560
The government

2014
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,840
Need him not gross

2015
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,888
Because if

2016
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,168
Did grow thing

2017
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,216
Reply

2018
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:22,336
Corn prices

2019
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,360
And so in order to

2020
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:24,128
To offset

2021
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,664
The government pays a lot

2022
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,248
I'm so he had the thought of

2023
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Weather

2024
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320
Out there and we would go

2025
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,440
I guess his dad

2026
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,000
We kill a deer every now and again

2027
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,048
Immediately

2028
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,632
Loser

2029
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,912
Add note like because of

2030
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:49,984
Best of that idea

2031
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,776
But that was part of

2032
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,568
Modifying

2033
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,640
Price

2034
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,920
Vic goes into

2035
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,200
The food

2036
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,016
2 gold

2037
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
Obvious

2038
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,648
Getting everything

2039
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,928
It's not an evil man

2040
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,720
It's a stabilizing

2041
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:15,072
It's that I think that I think that that is an important line to draw because

2042
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:16,096
Any manipulation

2043
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,376
Could be seen as.

2044
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,168
No I get that but

2045
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:23,008
Even that manipulation is a test

2046
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:26,336
Acknowledgement of the meaninglessness of the entire

2047
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
We are doing this

2048
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,712
Because we know

2049
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,248
That if you know

2050
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,552
That this all means nothing

2051
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,904
Assignment

2052
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,232
Like you know

2053
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,144
90%

2054
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,496
Society appointment

2055
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:58,080
We all live in imaginary world

2056
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,104
Because of maintain

2057
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:01,920
Status quo in a pleasurable way forever

2058
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:04,736
Ideal

2059
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:07,040
Ideal

2060
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:15,488
Where is pleasurable comfortable

2061
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,256
Sad forever

2062
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:17,280
You hope to get

2063
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
Get to that point

2064
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:18,816
With the

2065
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,424
The illusions of society

2066
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,192
Because whatever

2067
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,240
I don't think any of this

2068
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,800
Where is Chicago at

2069
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,848
South suburbs

2070
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:38,272
Giving you the Orland Park

2071
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,832
Call PizzaMan

2072
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,880
I think I might have met him

2073
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:48,512
Local jokes means local

2074
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:49,536
Local

2075
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,912
530 neon net

2076
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,728
We have now

2077
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,520
A very large story

2078
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,544
But Alex is going

2079
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:02,848
To get into he has a big narrative

2080
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,176
But

2081
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
Intero Iowa

2082
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,696
Pause real quick

2083
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,512
I don't know if you've heard but Alex gets going

2084
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,536
Yeah

2085
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,304
I don't know why

2086
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:27,424
I tried to track through the episode of some sort I think YouTube

2087
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,216
He's just got

2088
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:31,776
You think he's just playing his Michael Jordan Flu Game

2089
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:35,104
Like he's bringing it even though his is

2090
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,408
His skill level isn't at the level of

2091
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:41,760
16/2 hours a day

2092
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,112
He's fighting

2093
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,696
45 minutes

2094
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:51,232
I actually

2095
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:58,144
Probably would be able to find out exactly I know his address.

2096
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,056
Bulshit

2097
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,336
Figure it out

2098
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,408
So

2099
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:20,416
Training

2100
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:23,744
Careful

2101
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:30,400
The National Guard

2102
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:32,960
The purpose of

2103
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:41,152
They suspected weapons dealer

2104
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:45,504
According to Sergeant Mike Notch Readiness NCO for Alpha Company

2105
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,576
Marine Corps officer

2106
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:54,720
Nothing

2107
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,256
In Virginia

2108
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:08,544
Northwest

2109
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:13,408
They are zoman they are I read this article that he's talking about

2110
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,528
To find weapons dealer

2111
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:19,808
Living

2112
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:21,600
Really close to Alex Jones

2113
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:28,256
Crossing the Rubicon going to solve all of our problems to call the Omni

2114
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,560
Barrio

2115
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,008
Is from

2116
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:42,080
Daily Times Herald probably but he's actually reading

2117
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:43,872
Not daylight

2118
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:48,480
Doesn't really backup

2119
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,248
Inflamed

2120
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:52,576
Role-playing operation where

2121
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,112
Small town

2122
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:56,160
In this case Arcadia Iowa

2123
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
Who's playing an illegal gun dealer

2124
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,976
Like

2125
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:01,280
So is he

2126
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,560
Is he like a half-orc

2127
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,096
No

2128
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:04,864
Straight human

2129
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:05,632
Street view

2130
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:12,032
That kind of role playing in role-play

2131
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,944
Okay so give me a rundown of his skills and abilities

2132
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,504
Charisma charisma

2133
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,272
He's a rogue

2134
01:52:22,528 --> 01:52:23,040
He's a rogue

2135
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:32,768
I don't play these games all I wish I had a child

2136
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,376
Business

2137
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,984
That means that his wisdom has very pretty

2138
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,312
Is going to come into this town

2139
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:46,592
And whichever has it

2140
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:48,384
Consent be involved in the role play

2141
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:55,040
The issue is it the Iowa National Guard needs

2142
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,832
Train but quote

2143
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,392
There are no active duty bases in Iowa

2144
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:04,256
Right

2145
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,328
In order to get that large neighborhoods

2146
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,352
Steeler Citi Field

2147
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:10,912
We have to be creative in partner with our community

2148
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:15,264
So the way the roleplay would go is like let's say we live

2149
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,824
We say no we don't want to be involved

2150
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,360
Right

2151
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,640
Inconvenience of tiny bit

2152
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,200
While they're running around town doing that

2153
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,504
Write this is a

2154
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,816
But where are they

2155
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,376
Just go around the roadblock on the grill

2156
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,144
So do they

2157
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:43,936
Start with a hundred gold pieces

2158
01:53:44,192 --> 01:53:44,704
Scizor

2159
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,984
Like 50

2160
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,752
Be prohibitively

2161
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:47,776
Okay alright

2162
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:54,944
Alright

2163
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:02,880
Not in the mood

2164
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,696
Not in the mood for RPG talk

2165
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:08,256
I'm not I got no references man

2166
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:12,352
I'm going to let it go

2167
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:15,424
Just felt the country

2168
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,704
Where you couldn't

2169
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:20,288
That's just all I needed I just needed it for my soul

2170
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,592
Feels like that very often.

2171
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,992
This is fun

2172
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,528
I would

2173
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,296
Love it

2174
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,024
Point out to like the way it works

2175
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,816
Is that like the people

2176
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,608
Who are

2177
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:46,144
Disregard

2178
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,192
Officers were coming into the town

2179
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
Don't know

2180
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:50,752
The person inserted is

2181
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:53,568
Who's playing the dealer

2182
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,592
I'm so they'll go to the

2183
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,872
The houses that can

2184
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:58,432
Ml like knock on the door and other picture and like

2185
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:01,760
Missguided

2186
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,296
The house but like

2187
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:10,464
All right it's like a whole fun party

2188
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,328
But also the wave

2189
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,096
Runza

2190
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,376
The searching of the home

2191
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,912
One of the things they're training

2192
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
There is

2193
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:20,960
How to do that

2194
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,728
Respectfully

2195
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:25,312
Because when you're in Wartime overseas

2196
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
You might not

2197
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:28,640
Treat that foreign citizen with

2198
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,176
Respect

2199
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,712
So doing it with

2200
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:35,552
Fellow citizens

2201
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:39,392
To do this safely and responsibly you treat people like people because you

2202
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:44,000
The people who look like that training for

2203
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:49,376
I wish it wasn't like that

2204
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,144
If it is you

2205
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,168
Your first time

2206
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,704
Catching a house let's say

2207
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,472
When is

2208
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:55,008
Hi state

2209
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,032
You might

2210
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,312
Really fuk up

2211
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,848
I would much rather

2212
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,408
People in America

2213
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:03,456
Do a fake search of their house

2214
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,736
To train troops

2215
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:06,528
Do not murder foreign citizen

2216
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:08,064
No I don't think

2217
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,344
Is anything wrong with this

2218
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:10,368
And I mean

2219
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:12,928
All of the fears that Alex has certainly haven't been

2220
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,696
Materialized

2221
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:15,744
Question

2222
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,512
Do you have to

2223
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,280
Recorded them as well

2224
01:56:17,792 --> 01:56:21,376
No okay well then

2225
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,656
Probably a Ramada Inn

2226
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:26,240
More about this situation

2227
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:27,008

2232
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:56,448
Brainwashing

Kind of agree with no I know it's tough because

01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:45,152
Still on hold no he's not. What the f***

2274
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:48,480
It is also a half an hour later in the

2275
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,784
Alex Rambles a tongue about that Iowa shed

2276
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,160
National Guard on

2277
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:00,256
Guys like

2278
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,304
Because the guy is just like

2279
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,096
That no

2280
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:08,960
No I've been a member of the Iowa National Guard for 20-something years

2281
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,496
In Public Communication

2282
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:13,312
Know what you're saying

2283
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,200
National Guard

2284
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:24,576
Trying to

2285
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:27,904
Issaquah

2286
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:29,696
The National Guard has now been

2287
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,464
Federal

2288
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,024
How is

2289
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,048
Well yes

2290
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:36,352
We exist as a federal entity

2291
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:39,424
When we are activated

2292
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:40,192
Gargos

2293
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,752
We are in some sort of

2294
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,776
Defensive capability

2295
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,544
Yes we become

2296
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,080
Come-a Federline

2297
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:48,384
99

2298
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:50,432
10% of the time we are under the direct

2299
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,712
Action of governor

2300
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:53,248
Of whatever state we are the

2301
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,320
So we're kind of like Federal

2302
02:00:56,576 --> 02:00:57,088
Yeah

2303
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:58,880
And he keep

2304
02:00:59,136 --> 02:00:59,648
Bring that up

2305
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:01,184
Malik has nowhere to go with it

2306
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,208
Any complete

2307
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,232
Conquers all

2308
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,000
His narrative

2309
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,048
Like the idea that these people are all just

2310
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,584
Under the sway of the

2311
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:13,984
Yeah which is essentially

2312
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:16,032
Black president going to make white people feel

2313
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,080
It doesn't

2314
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:19,360
Really really

2315
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,896
Disappointing interview

2316
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,176
I thought about cutting

2317
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,200
Some clips from just

2318
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:29,088
But it wasn't

2319
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:31,904
Although

2320
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,672
I do wish I had

2321
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:33,696
Just One Last clip

2322
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:34,720
Like literally

2323
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,560
Right at 4 hour mark the end of the show

2324
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:39,328
Alex

2325
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,120
Chucky here's the exit music playing

2326
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,424
God is still on the phone I don't know how

2327
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,192
Hung up yet

2328
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,008
No regrets

2329
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:49,824
Vietnam is very polite

2330
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:57,760
I'm So at the end of it I was like well you've been lied to and I'm sorry that I'm sorry that I

2331
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:04,928
Rehiring hopefully one day you'll see the light to joining us

Multiple

2358
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:31,968
Essentially

2359
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,296
You know you know when you know when enough is in power

2360
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:40,416

I appreciate you

2362
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:48,608
That's not a negative one

2363
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:50,400
That's good bro go push

2364
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,728
Alex makes

2365
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:54,496
What I can

2366
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:56,032
Can only describe

2367
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,104
Something good I'm so glad

2368
02:04:01,152 --> 02:04:04,480
I'm looking at the March 23rd 1770

2369
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,464
I'm so glad he did

2370
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,744
Oh yeah

2371
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
What happened

2372
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,840
I know that he's better at Reading

2373
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:20,864
2009

2374
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:21,632
Then he is

2375
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,912
Present

2376
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:27,264
Would you call that the war is inevitable speech when it's really the

2377
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,288
Give me liberty or give

2378
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,056
Give me

2379
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,592
The Warriors

2380
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:36,224
Inevitable War inevitable

2381
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:40,832
Andy says Give me liberty or give me death

2382
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:41,600
Because the word

2383
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,368
Isn't it

2384
02:04:42,624 --> 02:04:43,136
No

2385
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,672
No I remember that speech

2386
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:47,232
Give me liberty or give me death

2387
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,792
Think of the word totally

2388
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:55,168
Even that totally that was a weird thing to say

2389
02:04:55,424 --> 02:05:00,032
#inevitable paragraph

2390
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:04,896
It's an answer to extenuate the matter piece

2391
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:10,784
Is actually begun the next Gale that sweeps from North will bring our ears.

2392
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:12,320
Clash of resounding arms

2393
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:14,368
Our Brethren may already be in the field

2394
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:17,440
Here idle

2395
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:19,232
What is a gentleman

2396
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,512
What would they have

2397
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:23,840
If life is so dear our peace so sweet as to be purchased

2398
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,864
Purchased at the price

2399
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,888
Chains and slavery

2400
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,424
Almighty God

2401
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:32,032
I know not what course others may take but as for me Give me liberty or give me death

2402
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:34,848
Paragraphs

2403
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:40,480
It's not bad it is inevitable and also the title is the war

2404
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:44,064
But be there

2405
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:45,344
All like

2406
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:47,392
Look he's not wrong

2407
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:48,672
All I care about

2408
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:53,536
A couple words

2409
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:54,304
You did fine

2410
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:57,888
You did good so we'll give you two or three more read-throughs in your f******

2411
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,168
Yeah just voice over

2412
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:05,312
Not everything kind of comes full circle

2413
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:12,224

See you next week bye-bye

2418

Coming back on

2419
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
No

2420
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:42,944
Cuz he comes back

2421
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,224
And Bob is gone now

2422
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,088
The guy who has to make you afraid of everything needs

2423
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:51,136
To come on before the guy who tells you what

2424
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,416
The solution to everything

2425
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:57,792
There is no doubt that Bob spent the last appearance on the market

2426
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,472
Incredibles

2427
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,496
Before that clip

2428
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:07,520
I think it's so

2429
02:07:08,032 --> 02:07:10,080
It's not I've never heard

2430
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,360
In my life

2431
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:12,896
He brought Ted on

2432
02:07:13,152 --> 02:07:14,688
Just yell at him for a little bit

2433
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,736
We got to talk about gold price

2434
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,016
Dude after the break

2435
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:19,040
I've been

2436
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:21,088
After

2437
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,880
They do the thing that they do

2438
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:23,904
All the time

2439
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,184
Maybe Bob was at

2440
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:26,208
The f****** store

2441
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,656
Kroger

2442
02:07:34,912 --> 02:07:36,960
Humanic that's when Joel banach called

2443
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:44,640
Called in 5 minutes yeah there is some sort

2444
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:51,040
Most reasonable situation here is Bob was

2445
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:53,344
Sidelines

2446
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,624
And then

2447
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:56,160
For whatever reason

2448
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,440
I mean what is this

2449
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,720
Like if you if you

2450
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:01,280
You consider the episodes on Saturday

2451
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:04,096
He's probably the 45th episode that I've listened to

2452
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:06,144
2 from 2009

2453
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,448
And every time Bob Chapman is on

2454
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,984
It's to set up 10

2455
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,776
Saudi ideas

2456
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:15,104
Kind of f*** that game up a little bit on this one episode is

2457
02:08:17,664 --> 02:08:18,176
You like that

2458
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,224
Alex G

2459
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,600
I feel bad

2460
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:34,304
I'm telling you this world is going to hell in a handbasket 10

2461
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:37,120

02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:57,856
Kroger

2467
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:06,304

Call Kroger

2469
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,144
For no reason

2470
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,704
We both pulled Kroger

2471
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:23,200
Kroger in Idaho

2472
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:31,136
For whatever reason

2473
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,160

2474
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:34,208

Columbus Ohio

2476

When I told ya

2477
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:43,424
I could have said

2478
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:47,520
Tonight's grocery chain in Central Missouri

2479
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:49,312

02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,080
What about it

2481
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:51,104
What about

2482
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:51,872
Anyway

2483
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,016
Snook

02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:00,576
We could we could sell your double coupon

2485
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:04,160
I would have said but they are out of business

2486
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:04,928
Jjp

2487
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,000
I always

2488
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,024
Feel like there's

2489
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:10,560
Business

2490
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,144
So this

2491
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,472
There's another guy

2492
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,240
It was the text

2493
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:19,008
Does legislator

2494
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:19,776
Who's still

2495
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:20,544
Coming up

2496
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,848
But also throughout the show

2497
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,640
Teasing that there's a surprise guest

2498
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,432
That he's hoping can come on

2499
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:28,224
Okay turns out that guy

2500
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:29,760
All right but

2501
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:30,784
Get that guy's friend

2502
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:36,160
Alex I can come on I'm still here I've been on hold this entire goddamn show

2503
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:38,720
Steve from Chicago

2504
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,256
This guy is

2505
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,024
Friend

2506
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,304
Guess that Alex hope

2507
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,328
Skit on rich

2508
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,864
Disappointing yourself

2509
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:48,192
Friend very disappointed

2510
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,984
I was trying to make it work out

2511
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,152
Mailed it out

2512
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:13,536
From now from England he was supposed to get out today

2513
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:18,656
What is happening right now

2514
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:22,752
Good afternoon Alex is nice to be with you

2515
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:27,360
Actually as we speak

2516
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:29,920
Anthony John Hill has been released

2517
02:11:30,944 --> 02:11:32,992
And he was allowed

2518
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:35,040
He was actually Ransom

2519
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:37,344
For the sum of 3500 euros

2520
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:40,416
Again this is for sending out a

2521
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:41,440
DVD

2522
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:42,464
Are you sure it's not just

2523
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,816
Isabel

2524
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,352
For sending out a DVD

2525
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:50,912
Who he sent

2526
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:59,360
A jury

2527
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,688
A77

2528
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:06,528
Jury tampering

2529
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:08,576
There is there's like a law

2530
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:11,392
Voila juries in deliberation

2531
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,416
You can't

2532
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:16,000
Influence them because that would be some sort of like

2533
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:24,704
Find out how to contact

2534
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:25,472
To the judge

2535
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:27,008
All this is like

2536
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,800
Looks

2537
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:34,176
That's just bad jury tampering

2538
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:35,968
Kind of

2539
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,760
Real Jason

2540
02:12:38,016 --> 02:12:39,808
Two jury harassment

2541
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,576
If you got to go to the

2542
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:43,904
You got to find out what jurors kind of react with

2543
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,184
What facial expression

2544
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:48,512
And then only send it to those jurors after doing a lot of

2545
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:50,816
Every search and finding out where they live

2546
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:59,776
Come on man you all right

2547
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:04,128
I'm just I'm not angry about the tempering I'm angry about the encompass

2548
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:05,920
Guy friend

2549
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:07,712
Anthony John Hill

2550
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:10,016
You made this documentary called

2551
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,296
772

2552
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:15,648
And what's interesting about that is if there's a group of 7/7 bombings

2553
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,440
Text called the set on July 7th

2554
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:18,464
Truth campaign

2555
02:13:18,720 --> 02:13:20,256
Let this to say about his.

2556
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,560
As far as I can

2557
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:25,120
Materials in the ripple effect

2558
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:26,144
Available for a good

2559
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,960
Two years so I'm curious as to why

2560
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:29,984
This film has been really

2561
02:13:30,496 --> 02:13:32,032
They believe that the official account of the sub

2562
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,568
77

2563
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:37,408
Tire website catalog mysterious inconsistent

2564
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,944
And irresponsible or something

2565
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,224
He'll make the news

2566
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:43,296
There's literally no way that she's in prison for revealing

2567
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:45,088
Forbidden information

2568
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:48,928
It's because he was jury tampering even the skeptic

2569
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,952
Are like

2570
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,232
You're wrong

2571
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,256
Yep

2572
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:56,608
Even to people who make us believe that we're wrong

2573
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,168
That's how wrong you are

2574
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:04,288
Now you cannot I will actually

2575
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,056
To give you mine

2576
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:06,592
Now I would have left

2577
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,640
And said this is irrelevant

2578
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:13,248
To talk about this guy

2579
02:14:13,504 --> 02:14:14,272
Friend

2580
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,296
But

2581
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
This guy

2582
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:26,304
And his other friend

2583
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,840
Dance

2584
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:28,608
My list

2585
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:30,912
Bad

2586
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:36,032
Have a good rest you got mine is 1

2587
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:39,616
He is the guy who we talked about in the past

2588
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:40,896
Who calls himself guwahati

2589
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:45,248
Yep

2590
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:48,320
Couple episodes

2591
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:52,160
Return to a Goddamn

2592
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,560
This

2593
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:02,656
If this goes down ass and Wormhole I will tell you that right now.

2594
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,704
So that's the first reason that epicenter

2595
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:15,712
Text breakstone

2596
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:20,832
And not only that but

2597
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,416
For people that don't know much about him

2598
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,512
This is the same man who spent the last 10 years

2599
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:30,816
Trying to raise the Ark of the Covenant

2600
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:34,656
In Ireland and knows the exact location of the

2601
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:37,728
Tyrrhenian Margate

2602
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,568
Down to a 6 ft by

2603
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:43,104
Put G2

2604
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:45,408
And they're not about to let him dig it

2605
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,944
Because they know

2606
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:50,272
It is there and they know that he would be the one to bring it up

2607
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:56,672
British Lord

2608
02:15:56,928 --> 02:15:59,232
Research

2609
02:15:59,744 --> 02:16:00,512
Could you save Alex

2610
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:07,680
Good good cover-up

2611
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,032
Bass

2612
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:17,920
And he also knows where the Subterranean entrance.

2613
02:16:19,456 --> 02:16:21,248
I'm going to say this right now

2614
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,528
That was the

2615
02:16:22,784 --> 02:16:23,808
Best job Alex

2616
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:24,576
Does Everett

2617
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:27,392
Ever ever

2618
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:32,768
That was incredible engaged with that

2619
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:33,792
None at all and

2620
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:35,072
I barely notice

2621
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:38,656
I barely noticed we had been watching the show for a long

2622
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:45,056
If we hadn't been listening for the whole time out of in life

2623
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:47,616
Is where the mergaite is I've never realized

2624
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:48,384
He just

2625
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,664
Pivot it away with

2626
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:51,968
No

2627
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:58,368
Was that

2628
02:16:58,624 --> 02:17:00,672
Project

2629
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:02,976
From Chicago safe

2630
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,728
You didn't cut it off immediately

2631
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:15,520
The Strokes

2632
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,288
Group

2633
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,080
It's much like jackass

2634
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:19,104
First episode

2635
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:22,432
I let myself

2636
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:25,248
Absorb

2637
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:30,112
It's like it's like how Paul is

2638
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:32,928
If you're going to make a reference I get to make

2639
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:35,232
Find

2640
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:40,096
Brit-brat loggerhead

2641
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:43,936
For now

2642
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:46,496
We sorted that out

2643
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,568
Nothing is wrong

2644
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,104
Denmark here

2645
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:57,248
So now we move on

2646
02:17:57,504 --> 02:17:58,528
If you don't tell bobcat mix

2647
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:08,768
Stick roller coaster

2648
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:13,376
The friend of God

2649
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:19,520
Frankly I'm mad that that wasn't what he led with

2650
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,568
I'm so now we get to the last

2651
02:18:23,872 --> 02:18:25,408
Clips from this guy

2652
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:26,944
He is Leo Burma

2653
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:30,016
The guy from the legislature

2654
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:31,040
At the top of the show

2655
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:35,904
Not to be confused with wonderful person and friend of the show Leah Berman

2656
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:37,952
Fantastic

2657
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,000
Atomic

2658
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:41,024
Chicago

2659
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,328
She's not one of those

2660
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:48,448
Chicago Chicago

2661
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:50,496
So here's Leo Berman

2662
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:09,440
Martial law

2663
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,368
ER

2664
02:19:46,304 --> 02:19:46,816
Alex

2665
02:19:47,072 --> 02:19:49,632
Play can't be with you at actually next week I'm going to

2666
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:50,656
Defile another Reza

2667
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:52,960
And now that resolution

2668
02:19:53,216 --> 02:19:56,032
Same thing however it's going to cover both the 9th

2669
02:19:56,544 --> 02:19:57,568
And the Tenth Amendment

2670
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:59,360
The US Constitution

2671
02:19:59,616 --> 02:20:01,664
Great I mean they're already in the concert

2672
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:02,432
Institution

2673
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:09,856
They're already in

2674
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:11,136
You need to do that

2675
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:13,184
Nobody

2676
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:15,488
It's absurd

2677
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:17,792
Okay

2678
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:20,352
You know the 9th and 10th Revolution

2679
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:24,448
You think you know the 9th

2680
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,264
You think

2681
02:20:27,520 --> 02:20:30,592
This ain't your daddy's next

2682
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:33,408
Has anybody ever covered them for you

2683
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:40,064
Has anybody ever written into law cover of the 9th Amendment

2684
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:45,440
Nobody ever really sat down and wrote

2685
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:53,376
How long was

2686
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:54,656
White desk

2687
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:58,496
Shcr

2688
02:20:58,752 --> 02:20:59,264
Not very long

2689
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:03,104
Not very long I can read the whole thing if you want

2690
02:21:07,712 --> 02:21:11,040
Compare it with the length of the war

2691
02:21:11,552 --> 02:21:16,928
But it's all good

2692
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:19,232
Using this longer

2693
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,792
At least this

2694
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:23,328
In Texas distance

2695
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,096
Really funny

2696
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,120
I looked into

2697
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:27,936
I am too like a lot of those other ones

2698
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:29,472
What about these house resolution

2699
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:30,752
Concurrent resolution

2700
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:34,336
The committee never got brought for a vote that's okay

2701
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:35,616
This one

2702
02:21:36,128 --> 02:21:36,640
Cuz it's

2703
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:37,408
Well

2704
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:39,200
Well they passed

2705
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,736
Because it was required

2706
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:42,528
To have a bunch of rewrite

2707
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:51,744
And so what it ended up doing is this

2708
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:56,096
Basically

2709
02:21:56,352 --> 02:21:57,632
Davis talked about like

2710
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:01,728
So we like being a part of

2711
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:02,752
The United States

2712
02:22:03,008 --> 02:22:03,520
That's everything

2713
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:05,824
Resolve the House of Representatives

2714
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:06,592
Concurring

2715
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:09,408
That the 81st legislature of the

2716
02:22:09,664 --> 02:22:10,176
Reaffirmed

2717
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:13,760
Both are one and indivisible National

2718
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
Union

2719
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:19,648
$90 one and indivisible

2720
02:22:19,904 --> 02:22:22,720
Resolved that the clerk of the House of Representatives

2721
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:23,488
Is direct

2722
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:25,024
Send a copy of this resolution

2723
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:26,816
The president of the United States of America

2724
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:31,680
The vice president of the United States of America

2725
02:22:31,936 --> 02:22:32,448
The governor of

2726
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:33,472
Sister State as a

2727
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:34,240
Expression

2728
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:37,824
Of the affection for R1

2729
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:41,664
National and indivisible Union

2730
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:42,944
I heard that

2731
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:44,992
And all I heard was Tex

2732
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,528
Secede from the Union

2733
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:48,064
And declares its sovereignty

2734
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:51,136
No my buddy it's the opposite

2735
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:56,000
Henry Wright

2736
02:22:56,256 --> 02:22:58,304
Being like no no no

2737
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,096
We're not going to vote Yes for this

2738
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,632
Until you rewrite it

2739
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:05,472
All this is a declaration of love for the one

2740
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:11,104
National electronic elevation of love

2741
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:13,920
Never heard of states secede more

2742
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,688
If the Opera

2743
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:21,344
It is them saying that we are sending this as a proclamation that we love.

2744
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:26,464
No

2745
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:30,048
Where are you guys

2746
02:23:30,304 --> 02:23:31,840
We love all of you

2747
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:33,888
The Attorney General from all of these days

2748
02:23:34,400 --> 02:23:34,912
To get a note

2749
02:23:35,424 --> 02:23:36,448
I want the president

2750
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,728
You got to know God

2751
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,008
We love you

2752
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:40,800
Also

2753
02:23:43,616 --> 02:23:44,128
All the time

2754
02:23:44,640 --> 02:23:45,152
Meaning of this house

2755
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,200
Resolution is

2756
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:52,576
Hey

2757
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:55,648
The federal government is

2758
02:23:56,416 --> 02:23:59,488
Because the big part of the Constitution

2759
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:04,864
The idea that like we know what happened

2760
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:07,168
Kansas Bill gets a touchdown

2761
02:24:07,424 --> 02:24:08,448
To being like we loved

2762
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,752
This is really awesome

2763
02:24:11,264 --> 02:24:12,800
But unfortunately Leo

2764
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,080
Talkin

2765
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:16,640
He said something

2766
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,504
I want to see like damn I want to

2767
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:23,552
N-word

2768
02:24:23,808 --> 02:24:24,320
Stuck out

2769
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:30,464
And if you're going to mandate anything on the state of Texas

2770
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:32,512
If it's not fully

2771
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:34,048
U.s.

2772
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:34,816
The tution

2773
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:36,096
We're not going to do it

2774
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:38,912
And the reason we're doing this with taking a

2775
02:24:39,168 --> 02:24:40,192
Because of the

2776
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:44,288
We understand there's going to be a federal handgun registration

2777
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,056
We don't want

2778
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:47,872
To know where all of our guns are here in Texas

2779
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,152
What's the word

2780
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,248
Show me to go with ham

2781
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,320
Call Manny

2782
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:58,368
I'm going to go with

2783
02:24:59,136 --> 02:24:59,648
Him

2784
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,744
Him

2785
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,816
Did you not want the government to know or did you not want

2786
02:25:07,584 --> 02:25:09,120
Helio

2787
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:12,704
You're showing whatever it is you're showing

2788
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:18,080
Sniffles and four of them

2789
02:25:18,336 --> 02:25:19,360
F****** face

2790
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:20,640
Are obvious

2791
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,176
This is bananas

2792
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:23,968
Man that's a mess

2793
02:25:24,736 --> 02:25:26,016
Him

2794
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:27,040
We don't want

2795
02:25:27,296 --> 02:25:33,440
That made me say so he would have said that obviously during the any other way

2796
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:42,144
I want to find out about Leo Berman what's up with him

2797
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:47,520
I bet this goes down a very short Rabbit Hole of a man who is loves his family

2798
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:50,848
Has never committed any gross

2799
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:53,152
I regret to inform you

2800
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:57,504
I don't regret that

2801
02:25:58,016 --> 02:26:02,880
2011 Texas monthly

2802
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:08,256
After he appeared on CNN's combative

2803
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,280
Leo Berman

2804
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,048
Is a birther

2805
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:14,400
What produces birth certificate

2806
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:19,776
It will take someone like Donald Trump to really determine whether the president has pulled the greatest swindle

2807
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:23,104
The greatest hoax in the history of the United States

2808
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:24,384
What

2809
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,152
What year was

2810
02:26:29,504 --> 02:26:31,808
Cuz that was when Trump was on his birth or s***

2811
02:26:32,064 --> 02:26:34,880
You start leading the charge along with now

2812
02:26:35,136 --> 02:26:38,720
I know that all the big monsters I know.

2813
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:40,256
Just don't

2814
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:41,024
Understand

2815
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,048
The ideas

2816
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,072
Human being

2817
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:45,376
I would say it would

2818
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:46,656
Someone like Donna

2819
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:49,216
Pittsburgh

2820
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:51,008
Statement really to make

2821
02:26:51,264 --> 02:26:53,824
Because it would take someone would like Donald Trump

2822
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:55,360
Lack of character

2823
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:56,640
Ciro

2824
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:58,944
0

2825
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:02,016
Truther or anything like that

2826
02:27:02,272 --> 02:27:04,576
Jesse would take a pure cycle

2827
02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:05,600
It would take

2828
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:11,744
F****** Unabomber

2829
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:14,304
Serial killer

2830
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:18,656
To have zero human empathy or actions whatsoever

2831
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:21,728
In order to reveal this

2832
02:27:21,984 --> 02:27:23,776
It would take Leo Berman

2833
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,568
Uline garbage

2834
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:26,336
Pilum

2835
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:27,360
F****** s***

2836
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:29,152

2849
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:04,736
He also made Headlines by claiming Court the judge

2850
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:11,136
Also in England

2851
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:13,696
The use of sharia law is being allowed as well

2852
02:28:13,952 --> 02:28:20,096
This claim was made almost

2853
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:24,448
Creeping Sharia

2854
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:28,288
Christian missionaries were

2855
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:30,080
The annual Arabic International

2856
02:28:30,336 --> 02:28:30,848
Festival

2857
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:32,896
What if

2858
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:33,920
Discover

2859
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:38,528
Nocuous

2860
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:39,808
Soto

2861
02:28:40,832 --> 02:28:42,368
What creeping Sharia and

2862
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:48,768
The Christians were charged with disorderly conduct after police received

2863
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:50,816
Volunteer

2864
02:28:51,072 --> 02:28:54,912
Working at the raft by the group

2865
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,752
It wasn't even the Muslims or the area

2866
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:02,080
It was a question of course

2867
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:07,712
Coming to America

2868
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:10,784
31 more clipped ear to listen to

2869
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:13,344
Pile of s***

2870
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:17,952
And also there's another bill a federal hate-crimes bill

2871
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:19,488
Open up your old test

2872
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,536
The Bible and read the book of Acts

2873
02:29:21,792 --> 02:29:24,352
That homosexuality is an abomination

2874
02:29:24,864 --> 02:29:28,704
Wikipedia charged with crime under that bill and Robbie what's happening

2875
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,984
Canada right now

2876
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:32,032
Could have been the wind

2877
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:33,056
Stop the Constitution

2878
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:34,592
Don't tell us about it

2879
02:29:35,104 --> 02:29:37,664
Don't ask us to do it

2880
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:39,200
Milk

2881
02:29:39,712 --> 02:29:41,248
I just never liked was the Bible in the

2882
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:45,600
Like you're talkin about government

2883
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:50,720
It's like that one of your first go to Zyzz

2884
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:53,280
The book of Exodus

2885
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:56,352
Hey look

2886
02:29:56,608 --> 02:29:57,888
This old ass book

2887
02:29:58,144 --> 02:29:59,936
Abomination

2888
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:02,240
Is that a hate crime

2889
02:30:02,496 --> 02:30:03,264
I would say

2890
02:30:08,896 --> 02:30:10,432
No ice

2891
02:30:12,736 --> 02:30:15,040
If you're privately enjoying

2892
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,320
I don't give a s***

2893
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:17,856
Enjoy your life

2894
02:30:18,112 --> 02:30:19,904
If your

2895
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:22,208
When you're yelling it at

2896
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:24,000
People that it becomes an issue

2897
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,024
You know what

2898
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:26,816
Bring out that it is

2899
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:36,800
To lay with another man is an abomination

2900
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:39,360
But if someone who right

2901
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:40,384
Part of the LGB

2902
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:41,408
Community

2903
02:30:41,664 --> 02:30:43,456
Baby you are harassing them

2904
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:48,576
Being a dick around privately believe it I wish you would

2905
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:49,344
What you going to do

2906
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:50,880
That's your right

2907
02:30:51,136 --> 02:30:51,648
To believe whatever

2908
02:30:52,928 --> 02:30:53,696
So

2909
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:54,720
I would

2910
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,024
I've never read any

2911
02:30:57,280 --> 02:30:57,792
Hate crime

2912
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:01,376
Legislation

2913
02:31:01,888 --> 02:31:06,496
You doing something to someone else

2914
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:09,056
This idea of like

2915
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:10,848
Go fuc yourself

2916
02:31:11,360 --> 02:31:13,152
Hello fear

2917
02:31:13,408 --> 02:31:19,296
Yeah but I ran out of steam.

2918
02:31:19,552 --> 02:31:20,832
Little bit

2919
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:23,648
That is exactly what is going on

2920
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,416
I don't

2921
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:25,952
Okay

2922
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,232
Okay

2923
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:34,912
What is this what is this guy thinking is how is going how is this supposed

2924
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,984
Do it so if you think if you

2925
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,568
How can you both believe that the constitution is absolute

2926
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:47,712
The Bible in Exodus

2927
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:50,784
Committing hate crimes

2928
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:52,576
As being an overreach under the

2929
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:54,624
This doesn't make any

2930
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:58,464
Read any book

2931
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,744
This makes no sense

2932
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,768
This is

2933
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:01,536
Wheatley

2934
02:32:02,048 --> 02:32:04,864
Separated

2935
02:32:05,376 --> 02:32:07,936
I'd like Concepts from all directions

2936
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:09,216
Somehow being

2937
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:11,008
Like I don't understand

2938
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:16,128
He'll let gay people

2939
02:32:16,384 --> 02:32:18,944
A washer doesn't make any

2940
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,224
F****** sense

2941
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:23,040
You think you need to engage one of the realities

2942
02:32:23,296 --> 02:32:26,624
Or something like that the only thing that person

2943
02:32:27,648 --> 02:32:28,160
To yell at gate

2944
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:29,952
And I think I can't

2945
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:33,024
Why are you protecting you make it

2946
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,304
I don't understand

2947
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:40,704
Well I do understand is because on some level they realize that other human beings are like

2948
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:42,496
You can't do that anymore

2949
02:32:42,752 --> 02:32:44,800
So they have to say

2950
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:47,360
But since you are going to let me do it

2951
02:32:47,616 --> 02:32:50,176
I have to create some sort of Fantastical reasoning

2952
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:51,968
That might convince you

2953
02:32:52,224 --> 02:32:53,504
As to why I should be able

2954
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:57,344
Feelings about themselves

2955
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,160
You know other people's emotions

2956
02:33:00,416 --> 02:33:01,440
Feel-Rite

2957
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:04,768
They still care about themselves not being able to

2958
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:05,792
Do do certain things

2959
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:08,096
When's like

2960
02:33:08,352 --> 02:33:09,120
Legislation

2961
02:33:11,424 --> 02:33:11,936
They don't

2962
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:16,544
See you later the sensitive like understanding what

2963
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:18,848
Yeah

2964
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,224
Field

2965
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,504
So because they can

2966
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:27,040
Experience any kind of

2967
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:28,832
For other human beings all they can

2968
02:33:29,088 --> 02:33:29,600
Experience

2969
02:33:29,856 --> 02:33:30,368
Is

2970
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,720
So

2971
02:33:36,768 --> 02:33:38,304
Used to be able to

2972
02:33:38,816 --> 02:33:39,840
And nobody would stop

2973
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:42,912
So you're taking something away from me

2974
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:44,192
Even though

2975
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:45,216
You're not

2976
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:47,008
And I shouldn't have been doing it in the first place

2977
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:50,336
And I can totally live without it

2978
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:51,360
Do they

2979
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:53,920
These people know that like

2980
02:33:54,432 --> 02:33:54,944
Their lives

2981
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:55,968
Be unchanged

2982
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:00,064
Lego

2983
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:02,112
Like how many people are there

2984
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:03,904
How many people who are like

2985
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:06,208
All the worst thing that you can call

2986
02:34:06,464 --> 02:34:07,488
White person is racist

2987
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:09,792
And if that's in a slur against us

2988
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:11,072
How many people

2989
02:34:11,328 --> 02:34:13,120
But how many of them Regis realize like

2990
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:15,168
No you can just be fine

2991
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:17,728
Like your day wouldn't

2992
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:21,568
I know

2993
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:23,104
Bother you with it

2994
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,384
I think that

2995
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,432
Modernaire

2996
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:27,968
So much

2997
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,504
The advice

2998
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:30,784
It is

2999
02:34:31,040 --> 02:34:31,808
Letgo

3000
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:33,344
But it's not that

3001
02:34:34,368 --> 02:34:34,880
But that is

3002
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:37,696
Like what you're saying these

3003
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:40,512
Help

3004
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:42,816
People who were like

3005
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:44,864
Just realized

3006
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:45,632
Stop being

3007
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:46,912
Everything would be

3008
02:34:47,936 --> 02:34:49,472
Yeah but that really isn't letting

3009
02:34:49,728 --> 02:34:50,496
Bingo

3010
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:52,032
They don't know they're holding on

3011
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,568
And that's the same

3012
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:55,104
For a lot of people with

3013
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:56,384
Unresolved

3014
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,408
Issues

3015
02:34:58,688 --> 02:34:59,456
Play Simple

3016
02:34:59,712 --> 02:35:01,760
I don't care anymore

3017
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,552
There's a process UK

3018
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:04,320
Can go through

3019
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:05,600
Involved

3020
02:35:05,856 --> 02:35:06,368
Go

3021
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:07,904
Shaking off the bird

3022
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:10,720
Whatever you don't need any

3023
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:12,768
Red erasing old soft

3024
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:14,048
Where are the senior operator

3025
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:14,816
System

3026
02:35:16,864 --> 02:35:17,632
But it did

3027
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:18,400
You don't need it

3028
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:19,168
Run your computer

3029
02:35:20,448 --> 02:35:21,216
One of them big

3030
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:22,752
Misogyny

3031
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:23,520
Is one of them big

3032
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:26,848
Those are those are homophobia those aren't those are

3033
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:27,872
System

3034
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:29,408
I've been updated

3035
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:32,736
Because they're their Antiquated and they're glitching

3036
02:35:32,992 --> 02:35:33,760
They're glitching and people

3037
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:35,040
Computers and date

3038
02:35:36,576 --> 02:35:38,368
I kind of

3039
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:42,720
Actually I'm going to go back to an argument that Alex made my metaphor

3040
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:48,352
I think you did a great job

3041
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:50,400
I'm going to go

3042
02:35:50,656 --> 02:35:51,424
Back to Ashley

3043
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:53,216
Weirdly enough something out

3044
02:35:53,984 --> 02:35:55,776
In order to explain why

3045
02:35:56,288 --> 02:35:57,568
It is not something that they can just

3046
02:35:59,360 --> 02:36:01,664
What Alex said whenever he was talking about

3047
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:03,456
Bring it back

3048
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:05,504
These so-called changes in pigs

3049
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:09,088
He was saying that

3050
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,392
People in power are using it

3051
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,160
Divide us

3052
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,440
Which is

3053
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:16,512
Frustrating

3054
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:17,536
Because that is

3055
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,840
It's frustrating that Alex

3056
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:20,608
Can say that

3057
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:23,168
It is a true thing

3058
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:25,472
And yet he's the person who's doing it

3059
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:32,128
Play correctly pointing out

3060
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:34,432
Like part of the reason that

3061
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,968
He's because

3062
02:36:36,992 --> 02:36:38,784
All the problems

3063
02:36:39,040 --> 02:36:40,576
Complains about correct

3064
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:45,952
Play like post-reconstruction are you know you don't want poor white people and black

3065
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:46,720
People to get to

3066
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:48,256
Because then they're going to realize

3067
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:49,024
Together

3068
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:51,328
The poor

3069
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:54,912
The poor White

3070
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:58,496
People can hang on to the fact that hey no matter how poor we are

3071
02:36:58,752 --> 02:36:59,776
No matter how much we starve

3072
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:01,056
At least we're not black

3073
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:04,640
So that's what all this racism that people

3074
02:37:04,896 --> 02:37:05,664
Can't let go of it

3075
02:37:06,176 --> 02:37:06,688
Is it like

3076
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,712
Look

3077
02:37:08,224 --> 02:37:11,040
I'm actually a living a shity life

3078
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:14,880
And the only thing that brings me up

3079
02:37:15,392 --> 02:37:15,904
Security

3080
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:16,672
Is that

3081
02:37:17,440 --> 02:37:18,720
At least I'm not

3082
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:19,488
Gay

3083
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:21,024
Great you know

3084
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:23,840
I agree that that might be sort of a psychological

3085
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:25,376
But

3086
02:37:25,632 --> 02:37:26,144
Time

3087
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:26,912
That doesn't

3088
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:28,704
Really

3089
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:32,032
Substantiv

3090
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:35,616
You know like if you are using that to like soda.

3091
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:38,432
You let it go

3092
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,248
The reality of your life whatever your paycheck

3093
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:42,784
Is whatever your right situation

3094
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:44,064
Doesn't actually

3095
02:37:45,088 --> 02:37:47,136
Right maybe you have to find new friends

3096
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:48,672
Hang out with those

3097
02:37:49,696 --> 02:37:52,768
Text

3098
02:37:53,536 --> 02:37:54,304
Adjust

3099
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,608
Have no friends

3100
02:37:58,144 --> 02:37:58,656
You know

3101
02:37:59,168 --> 02:37:59,680
Meet new people

3102
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:01,216
Other than that

3103
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:01,984
No I don't buy this

3104
02:38:02,496 --> 02:38:03,008
Yeah

3105
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:04,800
I don't know

3106
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:06,336
I don't know either

3107
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:07,872
Anyway all this.

3108
02:38:09,408 --> 02:38:15,040

You can do it anytime

3119
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:55,488
Weird thought

3120
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:56,768
Save it in your phone

3121
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:59,584
Save it in your phone is a number you can just like if you're out drunk

3122
02:39:00,096 --> 02:39:01,632
He wanted to leave it a drunk message

3123
02:39:01,888 --> 02:39:02,400
Go for it

3124
02:39:05,728 --> 02:39:11,104

Go to our Facebook group go home

3127

Apparently Dan is going to be working to get us on

3128
02:39:27,232 --> 02:39:30,304
Spotify

3129
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:38,752
Could get on but they gave me a real serious warning message

3130
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:39,776
That like

3131
02:39:40,032 --> 02:39:41,312

Spotify under fair use

3135
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:55,904
He plays a lot of music he has contract

3136
02:39:56,928 --> 02:39:58,976
I know from posting things

3137
02:39:59,232 --> 02:39:59,744
YouTube

3138
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:00,512
Like

3139
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:02,304
We posted the clip

3140
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:03,840
Along with the highway

3141
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:05,632
And I got a message

3142
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:06,656
On YouTube

3143
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:09,984
If we monetize until all the money goes to

3144
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:10,752
Like our CIA

3145
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:13,568
Play Highwaymen

3146
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:17,408
Clip in that player

3147
02:40:17,664 --> 02:40:18,176
It's not like

3148
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:19,712
Christmas too many Highwaymen

3149
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:24,064
So I think you were in trouble there

3150
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:24,832
Stitcher

3151
02:40:25,088 --> 02:40:25,856
Maybe

3152
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:32,256
In time but they have to figure out how to hook it all up

3153
02:40:32,512 --> 02:40:33,536
Do

3154
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:35,072
All agree

3155
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:37,376
Is it yours

3156
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,984
Yeah I know you

3157
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:42,752
You don't like it

3158
02:40:43,264 --> 02:40:44,288
No I don't really mind

3159
02:40:45,312 --> 02:40:47,616
It's a challenge

3160
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:48,384
For much longer

3161
02:40:54,784 --> 02:40:55,296
Okay

3162
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,320
I'd like to hear it

3163
02:40:56,832 --> 02:40:57,856
And then I

3164
02:40:58,624 --> 02:40:59,392
Alright

3165
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,232
But go ahead

3166
02:41:05,280 --> 02:41:05,792
Vestavia

3167
02:41:06,304 --> 02:41:06,816
Of the fremen

3168
02:41:07,072 --> 02:41:07,584
Okay

3169
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,120
They have been oppressed

3170
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:12,448
As well as the imperialist

3171
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:13,728
Such a long time

3172
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:16,032
You know what this is a very important story

3173
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:17,568
That you need to hear about right now

3174
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:18,848
So the fremen

3175
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:21,664
Only because their land egg

3176
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:28,064
It's a whole morality talenti it's basically an allegory for the imperialist

3177
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:31,648
Polonius treated the Native Americans

3178
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:34,208
My biggest issue is that Leo Berman

3179
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,744
Tingles

3180
