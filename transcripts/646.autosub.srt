1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge right now it's like I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
June

6
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,608
We are damn door.

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,544
Tweets about Joe Rogan

8
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,920
Play the Mario Party

9
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
My buddy Nikki gift

10
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
History of playing Mario Party

11
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,416
Together back in the days

12
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
He's back in the Columbia day

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,584
We would do what we do is we would play 50

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
Who's this

15
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
I'm one of the GameCube version

16
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
The Mario party that was Pagoda Peak

17
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
The star never moves

18
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
You just go up

19
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,128
This mountain and then you start back at the bottom

20
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,664
And we would

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Just get really high

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,344
And like have a long playlist of music and just a call to Mario Party

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
The

24
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
The worst

25
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,232
That's like

26
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:11,072
A great day

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Superstars or whatever

28
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
The f****** dog

29
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
Another of the capability of

30
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,448
If playing remote games

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
It's going to be living different cities and such

32
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,176
Of course you do like all the time

33
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
You're an absurd person

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,784
No no that's not true I'm really bad at many games

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,832
I was really expecting I was going to end up lose

36
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
But I think

37
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,512
I think what happened was I got to have winning because Nick ended up like randomly losing a star

38
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
On

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,424
The second-to-last her landed on a Bowser space

40
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,544
So great thank you technology for

41
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:58,432
Catching up you got one in the positive several thousand in the negative but you got one in the positive tab

42
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
My bright spot is the flowers that I ordered for my partner were delivered

43
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
For today

44
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
Tweet about that yesterday

45
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:15,328
Maybe today is today Valentine's Day

46
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Add was if you recall we had the truck

47
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
Chocolate strawberry

48
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,544
I ordered both of them on the wrong day so this year I was like

49
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
I'll make a joke off of that

50
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
And I'll order the flowers to be delivered a week early and it'll be like a you know it'll be a reference we'll all have a giggle and they'll be

51
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Flowers at the end of it

52
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,392
I was going to be a surprise for she's going to hit you over the head with a bouquet of flowers

53
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
How to be a surprise

54
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,976
And then they didn't show up last night

55
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,376
So so all the sudden surprise over in advance

56
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
Why she didn't know they were coming that's what I realized today your Grande didn't show up I was like I could have just said nothing

57
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
Ono said what I got her with sadness

58
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,944
The Joker doesn't work if it's 6 days early as opposed to Second

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,784
I just said it was just it was just a massive

60
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
Screw up on my part

61
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
Could have gotten away with it

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
But alas they still didn't show up in the Great

63
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
That impulse

64
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
This is very strange

65
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
The need to explain the lack of a surprise

66
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
To somebody

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
There's no expectation that I was carrying that I just couldn't handle anymore

68
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,335
To deal with it

69
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735
Alright Jordan today speaking of needing emotional support we will need a little bit of a crutch

70
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
Get through this Alex Jones I don't know

71
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:43,903
That was a transition on my part I'm usually fairly good but that was

72
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
It was a bee

73
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,839
So we'll be talking about all right

74
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
February

75
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,215
And one reasons I decided to do this episode

76
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Do the episode and Alex

77
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
The beginning that he's hosting off

78
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:02,847
4 hours

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,871
On Sunday

80
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Usually he does 2 hours

81
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,551
And then Owen comes in for around a mile I live

82
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Justice funny

83
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
It is but there's no sketches there's no characters which is unfortunate

84
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Characters come into

85
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,119
The Weekend Update

86
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,167
But

87
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:27,935
Pete Davidson

88
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,263
Totally cool with Infowars

89
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
She's ready for Primetime baby

90
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,599
Look good like

91
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
Maybe a Burt Reynolds

92
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
I would just say

93
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
Jason Schwartzman from Rushmore

94
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
And that's it

95
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,143
I think you can pull it off Sunday Night Live as well and so like I was like

96
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Okay I'm going to

97
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,983
Treat this like it's a full-on episode but then

98
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,615
Sunday Night Live episode isn't posted on Alex unbanned on video and I can't find it and so

99
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,991
Anyway to this episode

100
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,039
But not at all

101
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,087
If you're looking for an in-depth

102
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
Like

103
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Important episode

104
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:23,999
Might not be alright

105
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
Where's screw this is gross.

106
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,847
Does Emily wants dirty

107
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
Unscramble

108
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,271
Apocalypse

109
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
Scallops

110
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,743
You're doing the best you can and that's all anyone can ask of you love Mike

111
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,279
You and I hope all is well

112
00:06:59,327 --> 00:06:59,839
Lego

113
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
Bill Cooper's tax returns thank you so much

114
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Thank you very much

115
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,031
Color dress

116
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
Spell journal

117
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,431
Thank you very much

118
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
First

119
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,247
Steve G from Gilberts

120
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Thank you so much for an hour

121
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
Or how I learned to stop worrying and love the siop

122
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Thank you so much

123
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
What's your name

124
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,719
I'm a policy wonk

125
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
I have

126
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Risen above

127
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,119
Go take a little break you down

128
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,703
For me

129
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
And then we're going to

130
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
Comeback

131
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,103
And I'm going to start the show over

132
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
F*** you

133
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
I got plenty of words for you

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
At the end of the day

135
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
F*** you and your new world order

136
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Horse you rode in on

137
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
All your s***

138
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Maybe today

139
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,559
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5 years

140
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

141
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
And you never see me again

142
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
That's really what I want to do

143
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,519
I never want to come back here again

144
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
I apologize to the

145
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Was legitimately having break

146
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
I'll be better tomorrow

147
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:26,367
I'm not sure if he is better but this is a this is a real just Infowars ass episode

148
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
Bread-and-butter there's not there's not outbursts

149
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Please not morose

150
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
You just ate just put his hat on clocked in and he got through the day it's just a show

151
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,079
Actually honestly tonight

152
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,943
It's just going to be okay we have to do it even if we don't have a wonderful Dover you tonight

153
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,063
That's Alex starting his Sunday Night Live monologue

154
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,623
What are contractually obligated

155
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,231
Here's where he starts with the headline

156
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,815
And a little bit of fairness here

157
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:07,839
First off

158
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,119
You all know what happened

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
And that is Bloomberg put out the headline that

160
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,055
Russia attacks Ukraine

161
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,895
For what then supposedly

162
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,663
Unfolded

163
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
Just before the last two Iraq Wars as well

164
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Today

165
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:31,903
But the

166
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Russian

167
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
The new name

168
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,839
I absolutely agree

169
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
That might have lost something in translation

170
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,751
Really get too much into this

171
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Psyop

172
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:53,663
Bloomberg did this

173
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
To do that now but if this sucks

174
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:00,319
That someone actually within the organization to Bloomberg actually got fired

175
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:03,903
Mistake

176
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,279
Tube long short of what happened is that Bloomberg as well as many other internet-based media organizations

177
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,399
Create dummy pages with headlines many possible outcomes and headlines

178
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Is it could happen

179
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,447
In any given

180
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,495
7 day or week in order to get a jump on things

181
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,591
Text because there's a perverse incentive in that mediaspace be the first

182
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
With something to report

183
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:30,527
Because of this obsession with immediacy they don't have pages that are about things that haven't happened yet or may never happen

184
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,599
I'm in this case somebody accidentally published that draft

185
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
Page of Russia invading

186
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,463
This is not an unheard-of situation

187
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
Like one of the times has been a topic

188
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,095
The conversation online was in terms

189
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
2003

190
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:50,239
Prepared obituary Pages for a number of celebrities who are still alive

191
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:54,591
But we're out there folks that might die and it would be big news if they did

192
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
Then again in 2020 Radio France Internationale had about 100 draft obituaries for celebrities

193
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
That accidentally got published

194
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
And in the process they falsely announce the deaths

195
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
Soccer Legend

196
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:11,743
Yoko Ono and Jimmy Carter among others

197
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,143
Correction they went and killed all of those people at home

198
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,935
Our stake situations

199
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
Makes this Bloomberg

200
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Situation here a larger f******

201
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:27,103
Visit geopolitical Minefield so they should be overly careful but

202
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Even so

203
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
Doesn't seem like it's anything more than them

204
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Mistake

205
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,039
If you ever track breaking news on large media sites like cnnr Bloomberg

206
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,439
You'll know that often the pages for these breaking stories are little more than a headline and a brief synopsis of what information is available

207
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Available

208
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,767
Just been updated as new details come out

209
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Again

210
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
Because of these businesses

211
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,167
The model that they have the so highly values who got the story out first

212
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:55,775
It makes total sense that these organizations would look for whatever strategies they could use to shave a minute

213
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,055
Off their time to press

214
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
Unless Alex

215
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,895
Demonstrate otherwise this is a mistake that

216
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Shouldn't have been made but doesn't

217
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,199
To be an instance of

218
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Conversely

219
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
Everything Alex does everyday and basically every headline on Infowars is a malicious and intentional attempt

220
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
July so I'm not going to take

221
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,743
You can play for this 12 series

222
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
Yeah there was one of those just today I

223
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,447
From like The Hollywood Reporter about how Spider-Man in no way home with snow

224
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,007
Oh yeah yeah

225
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
And once again that little pre-written

226
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
Blur but once again

227
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,967
Academy is snubbed Marvel and instead nominated XXX

228
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
, XXX

229
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,903
, exactly like all you wrote that yesterday and I didn't think they would do that

230
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,279
Marvel movies are not going to get nominated for Best Picture

231
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,911
Someone is going to want to read that story

232
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:59,775
That's the worst-case scenario is it does get nominated and then you throw out the draft

233
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
There is no downside to it

234
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,943
Unless you accidentally published another country

235
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:12,575
That is a dunce

236
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Bloomberg to do an internal audit

237
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:16,159
Do things baby they can fire somebody

238
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
I don't know

239
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
Also I would say the maybe it's

240
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
Not a great idea for the media to operate in the state where they're busy

241
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
This model relies on living with the possibility that someone could accidentally post a headline that leads to a war

242
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
Maybe they should readjust those those priority

243
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,079
How is it

244
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:37,407
Is it possible to write that to pre-write the

245
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
War started story

246
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,223
Without

247
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Losing your f****** my

248
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,271
Right

249
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Like that

250
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,903
Requires some sort of ability to go to a different place to pre-write like

251
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,719
Millions of people are about to die in a blink

252
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
You know like that's crazy I'm crazy

253
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,071
Yeah

254
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,375
Yeah I don't know I mean how do you write any headline

255
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
What's the question

256
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,287
You need to go back to the elementary

257
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,383
So Alex has some ideas about Russia's various

258
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Adventures

259
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Wednesday on their border

260
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
I got up one morning

261
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Desktop

262
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
There was a headline on

263
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Drudge

264
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,983
The shower real quick

265
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,055
By the time I got to work in about

266
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Clock

267
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Others they were actually well directions

268
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Contagious

269
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,319
That they came in

270
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
That was all true

271
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
What's 3

272
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,447
Some of the areas

273
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
2014

274
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
Border and

275
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
Contingently

276
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,919
In southern Ukraine

277
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
That's really interesting Club because I think it tells you two things immediately

278
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
Play that are weird

279
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,671
The first is that Alex is somehow okay with Russia's invasion of Ukraine back in 2014 because he thinks they did it first

280
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
40 degrees

281
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
I guess if that's the standard needed to justify invasions I can't imagine oh Alex

282
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
Scooby a post of literally any military action

283
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Can ever

284
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,143
Invade

285
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
Texas score

286
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:41,311
To get their oil reserves for crisis

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Interested

288
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,199
Big fat Justified

289
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,479
Sissy Dadeland you just got

290
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,367
You learned is that Alex believes in a completely false version of what happened

291
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
Between Russia and Georgia in 2008

292
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,463
How to story just isn't

293
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,279
True the picture of what led up to that 5-day Wars

294
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:07,679
Is very complicated involves things like NATO's Bucharest Summit Decker declaration which

295
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
With plans to have Georgia and Ukraine join the organization

296
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,799
An act that was a hard line for Russia

297
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:19,455
It involves things like the Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili I haven't Ambitions to reintegrate the regions of

298
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
South ossetia

299
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,247
Anaplasia in

300
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
Into the larger state

301
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:28,159
Movie where territorially within Georgia Sovereign borders they operated is essentially Breakaway States

302
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:32,767
And Saakashvili made it to political priority to be the one that reunited the country

303
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
Which naturally was

304
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,839
Also a hard line for Russia

305
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,887
Who felt like they were actually in charge of those reach

306
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,239
The pictures what happened to 2008 isn't really a subject of some Grand can

307
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Conspiracy

308
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
No interest in Alex's real take on it

309
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Except

310
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:46,847
As much as

311
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,943
This is a clearly part of continuing to establish his pre-emptive narrative

312
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,015
But if anything happens in Russia and Ukraine Russia is

313
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,039
Blameless

314
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
And it's going to be a globalist

315
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Just out here

316
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
Get through the day

317
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Right

318
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
Putin

319
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Is an honest

320
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,559
Hard-working gentlemen he wakes up at 6:30 he put

321
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
His shoes on

322
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,679
He puts his pants on after that cuz it's a little bit different in Russia

323
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,215
But it goes to work like the rest

324
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,007
Okay goodnight

325
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,287
You can talk to

326
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Bury it it's strange

327
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Because I think that Alex

328
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,943
Just

329
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Buys

330
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,783
Any anything that comes out

331
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,111
From that mediaspace and I think it's I think it's largely

332
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
They just built on

333
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
A steadfast oppositional defiance

334
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,511
To Western news

335
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Despite the Russia being somehow a beacon of the West

336
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Also

337
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,655
Well then it's the beacon of the West

338
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
In his understanding

339
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,543
White masculinity

340
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Yeah

341
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
Yeah it is it is strange

342
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
I'm Amazed by anybody who can't

343
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
Have more of a clear-eyed picture of geopolitics

344
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
It's just like a

345
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
I don't think there's any good guy

346
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
You know

347
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
And it's

348
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
It's kind of rare that there is a like

349
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,327
A demonic bad guy

350
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,863
And I would never like

351
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,655
Come to the defense of cell

352
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Military action

353
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,055
No no it's totally okay cool cool for Russia to blow this week no

354
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
No it's not.

355
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:31,807
I think it in addition to what you're saying like there's not really necessarily quote-unquote good guys

356
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
There's also does not like

357
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,415
Clear and on complex

358
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
Situation

359
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,743
That lead to these guys

360
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:45,119
Yeah. Like Crystal Clear like yes

361
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
The globalist

362
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
Wants to do this and so they will

363
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,007
Fake something in order

364
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,383
I don't know children's story books about like

365
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
How these things happen

366
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,199
It's annoying

367
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Lie down play

368
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
The amount of just

369
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
Opera opportunism that is involved in global politics

370
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Something happens

371
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
And then somebody just seized the opportunity to jump

372
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:17,631
Like I don't think Russia is I don't think Putin is trying to invade Ukraine

373
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,703
If there isn't a massive dip in

374
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,799
Trust in the United States

375
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:30,431
Ability of the UN to the backup at statement the worst stuff is also dudakov you don't like or

376
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,575
Meeting in January that reaffirmed Ukraine's desire to join NATO like there

377
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
There's

378
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:41,951
There are reasons that are pictures to this that just

379
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,535
The other thing too

380
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
There's a real

381
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,863
Agency that Alex describes

382
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,655
To himself and people like Trump

383
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,215
And then there is a lack of agency

384
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
And like the individual desires people have

385
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,335
As world leaders

386
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:03,455
It just seems to be absent everything is just like weird pieces on a board

387
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,223
Except for

388
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,527
Or maybe Ron Paul

389
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:12,927
There's the players and then there's Ron Paul and then everybody else is the game like the Georgia situation and

390
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
Particular was one

391
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Where you know president Saakashvili

392
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,279
Was

393
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
Driven

394
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
To reunite the country

395
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,167
Based on what he felt was the Mandate when he came into power in

396
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
2004

397
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
And so like

398
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:30,847
Being able to bring in one of the territories as he was

399
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,479
Did not work

400
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
That was

401
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,063
And for as much as Alex

402
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
Cares about Sovereign borders

403
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Is it seems like they can be awfully fungible

404
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,207
Wow when it's on Russia

405
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
It's strange it's

406
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
It's real it's real weird I don't think it's a

407
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,887
Fuel teacher Russia or anything

408
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
Speed of an opposition to the

409
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,727
Existing International order

410
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,775
That he views as

411
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
Yeah

412
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,967
Anyway he's just really really invested in trying to build up this pre-emptive narrative

413
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,503
But if anything happens

414
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
Volkswagen

415
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
So you can profit off

416
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,087
Right

417
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,367
That's what they're getting ready

418
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
It's incredibly dangerous

419
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Incredibly bad

420
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Carlson on Friday.

421
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Job

422
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,864
Atlantis all outside normally are

423
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
His whole

424
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,912
Monologue

425
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,192
But we're going to do it

426
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Today because

427
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,752
Because you didn't

428
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
Such a great job

429
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Let me be clear

430
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,384
It's often entire Tucker Carlson monologue

431
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,504
If this is not something that he rarely does

432
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,808
Give you a lot Checker do about 15

433
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
Pretty pretty regularly on his show like Hill

434
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:52,768
The first six minutes of the show is like

435
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
Not broadcast on what radio stations

436
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Centennial play

437
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,912
Like John bound and Gregory's reports

438
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,472
During that time and he'll also sometimes just

439
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,752
Play Tucker Carlson

440
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,288
Monologue

441
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Yeah

442
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
It's

443
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,640
It's like he's in the folder Special Report

444
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,944
But I don't think he can Center

445
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,504
No but also at the same time what's he going to do

446
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Suum

447
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,160
You know like 08 if Tucker Sue's Alex Jones great for copyright

448
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,792
Give it to me or it to me now is Fox news's property

449
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
It sucker sucker to go to them and be like hey I I think you should let him play mellow out

450
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
So Alex has some other things

451
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
About various

452
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
Russian related War

453
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,432
Matters

454
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,992
He seems to be having some weird positions on

455
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,808
Globalist anti-American new Allure

456
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
Did you take my word for it

457
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
It's true

458
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Movie production

459
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
Production was the white helmets in the blue helmet

460
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Wm.com

461
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
Along with a bunch of the Islamic

462
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Insurance agent

463
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,312
Sade

464
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Which later came out

465
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
And worth

466
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
And a little boy

467
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
Dying for the nerve gas he went on

468
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
Take a note

469
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
From the kids

470
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
I mean all of that

471
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,048
What the globalist

472
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
Sounds very wrong about the larger picture of chemical attacks carried out by Assad in Syria but

473
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
He has

474
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,288
Possibly because a lot of the people he talks

475
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,360
Do about geopolitics are Putin and Assad apologist right

476
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
And propagandists

477
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,784
But you get to the larger subject of the attacks probably be too broad of a subject to get into right now

478
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,320
Really make specific claims better

479
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
Anything so

480
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
It's really hard to nail things down

481
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Button

482
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
He did use

483
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Specific discuss that a little bit

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,840
Balance brings up this Syrian boy who was videotaping Street treated for

485
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
Exposure to a chemical attack in

486
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:07,424
Duma in April 28th

487
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,776
He says that he later came out and said that this was all fake and that he was paid

488
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,800
To be in the video

489
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,384
Somebody claims Alex is making here are actually true

490
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,920
But it's critically important to us

491
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Understand the context of what he saying

492
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Because in that light

493
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
It becomes clear that these things he's correct about

494
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,880
Just revealed how wrong Alex is about they larger

495
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,792
So the question is eleven-year-old Hassan diab who's seen on video having his eyes washed

496
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
After a chemical attack

497
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,168
In the video that this is video that made the rounds really quickly because

498
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
It was

499
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:46,592
Or something where everything that was going into the city people couldn't get out

500
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Should I eat this footage

501
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Getting out was

502
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
You're very

503
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,016
So this obviously was very threatening as an image

504
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Looks like a sodden

505
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
His backers like Russia

506
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,880
Campaign that launched

507
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:05,280
To discredit this video and use it as proof that the humanitarian groups are actually propagandist Liars

508
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
Who are the u.s.

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
Hey to attacking

510
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Syria

511
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,632
The way they set up to do this

512
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,216
Was to release an interview on the state-owned Russia 24 Channel

513
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
Where the album is interviewed and says

514
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,288
That there was

515
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,056
Attack

516
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
And he didn't know why people were putting water on

517
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
I didn't say that he got paid

518
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
To say these things

519
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
You got food

520
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
From the

521
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
These are my parent

522
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:32,928
There's a video that Alex has seen and is the basis for his contention the people were faking being the victim

523
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:33,696
Chemical weapon

524
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:39,072
Send a text but I would strongly suggest that Alex should look a little bit deeper into the reality of that video

525
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
It's full of red flag

526
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:46,240
Video of shot Russian military took over to Alma and then refuse to let in

527
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,520
Inspectors from the organization

528
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,080
For the prohibition of chemical weapons in

529
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
Until 2 weeks after that point

530
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,944
At least partially due to possibly legitimate

531
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
Concerned about their safety to unexploded munitions

532
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,344
Some part of it that was

533
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,368
Illegitimate

534
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:06,464
Concerned but it also has a little bit sketchy

535
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,000
Conclusive

536
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,840
In the meantime this video with Diablo shot not in DOMA

537
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
But in Damascus

538
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,912
Guess which is about

539
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
Half hour drive away

540
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,544
Initially the reporter for russia24 was evasive about the context

541
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
The interview that they did

542
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,664
But eventually came out that it was done at the Syrian Army Officers Club

543
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,248
A location that was generally full of Russian military and

544
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,344
You know it's it's like how whenever you want

545
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,648
To have an interrogation you know you want

546
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,464
To have the if I'm being interrogated I want to have

547
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,304
Like 30 police officers all pointing guns at my head while I asked

548
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
But Isaac

549
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,680
The journalist

550
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,472
Been down there but the intercept

551
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Reported on

552
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:53,824
An exhaustive crowdsourced search for images of the ex

553
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
Exterior of the building and its staff

554
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
Definitely there

555
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:04,576
Three uniformed military guys in the background for part of the report something that doesn't scream of this is above board

556
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:09,184
Put up any quote insisted they were merely on their way to a local cafe

557
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,792
The reality is that it's just not possible to take this interview at face value there's just

558
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
Far too many places where intimidation could

559
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Be present

560
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:18,656
And it seems sketchy

561
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
And things that are being said about

562
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,008
The context of the video are shown to not be accurate

563
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
Knightcite

564
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,848
It should be allowed

565
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
And in fact

566
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
I think

567
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
Required by law

568
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:35,040
To throw a handful of flour into the face of any military person saying

569
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
They were on their way to a cafe

570
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,600
Go fuc

571
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Dare use a baguette

572
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Dare you send flower farm

573
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Do you want to try that again

574
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Another was right in the face

575
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
So then there's another really serious problem with a video which is at the end they purport to be interviewing a former militant

576
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
Claims that he made stage Victor

577
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Adam videos

578
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:01,408
Stalking Zee news report shows images of a group of people creating stage shots of victims

579
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:05,248
Clearly implying that this is corroborating with the interviews of the

580
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,600
Talking about inner actually shots of him and his crew creating fake videos.

581
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:15,744
The demonizer sauce instead they were lifetime Recreations that were the video is very clearly trying to make the

582
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,280
That point however

583
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,328
These are still images from the shooting of a dramatic

584
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:21,376
Film directed by who mom who sorry

585
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
A Syrian filmmaker

586
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:28,544
He's making a movie where the plot revolves around a dramatized version of a previous chemical attack that he lived

587
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Through in

588
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,336
2013

589
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,640
The intent to mislead

590
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Is very clear here and these

591
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
It is very real concern

592
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
All existing in

593
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
A couple minute long

594
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
Video it's

595
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
Very very hard to trust

596
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah then in 2019 the organisation for the prohibition

597
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,208
Chemical weapons

598
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,512
But at their final report about the attack in douma

599
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
Their conclusion was quote

600
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,704
Regarding the alleged use of toxic chemicals as a weapon on the 7th of April 2018 at Doma the Syrian Arab Republic

601
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,544
The evaluation and Analysis of all the information gathered by the FSM

602
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
Witnesses testimonies environmental and biomedical samples analysis results of Toxicology and Ballistic analysis

603
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
Expert additional digital

604
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,016
Information from Witnesses

605
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
Provide reasonable ground

606
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
That the use of toxic

607
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Chemical as a weapon

608
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
This toxic chemical

609
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:17,952
Contained reactive

610
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,976
Corian

611
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,280
Chemical was likely molecular chlorine

612
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,888
Anyway the point here is that I'll do the chemical weapon attack denier and he accepted that

613
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
Very dubious video is being real

614
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
Because of the firm the conclusion he's already

615
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Decided to believe

616
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
Namewee that Russia and everyone they're aligned with are actually always in the right

617
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,640
Because they are

618
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Poised

619
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
Against

620
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
The international

621
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
Community vet

622
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,016
He thinks

623
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
Right right

624
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
So in so doing

625
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,160
He is Twisted himself into a place

626
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:48,928
Where did

627
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Defending people who cover up

628
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Horrific atrocities

629
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
Because of

630
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
Strategic

631
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:04,288
I guess so yeah I had to admit that

632
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
These attacks are real

633
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Like

634
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:12,480
There's a part of him that seems like they had to do that while you're fighting the devil

635
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,272
I understand that we don't

636
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
Do these rules

637
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Civil War stuff but

638
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,720
You know what when you're fighting an enemy this bad anything's okay see it's really strange I think it's

639
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,536
Abhorrent and they find it

640
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,096
To be the sort of thing that

641
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,912
Doesn't get maybe enough attention

642
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,216
In terms of some of his positions

643
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
But I think in hindsight

644
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
It's something that

645
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Maybe Morella

646
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Yeah

647
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,896
That I think should haunt

648
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:45,504
Should linger so many things should be haunting people

649
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,528
So many things

650
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
So Alex gets into talking about China and the Olympics

651
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,904
Not really the Olympics

652
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,952
Sort of the Olympics

653
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,256
Thereabouts or someone who was at the Olympics

654
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
I was trying to do a live remote shot

655
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,888
The Chinese authorities got in the leg

656
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,656
A few days ago

657
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
Speaker of the House

658
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,640
Do not criticize anything when you're in China

659
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:13,664
Are you get dishes

660
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Appeared

661
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
Reporter TV

662
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,296
Videos posted up on Infowars

663
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Cam

664
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
Hold off by

665
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Myccp

666
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
During Olympics

667
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,024
Live report

668
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Because they didn't like

669
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
What he had to say you see the red armband

670
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
Of the five

671
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
Policeman

672
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
2A

673
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,824
Police rosselli reportedly will be

674
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Deported

675
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
Davey's Locker

676
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
It disappeared

677
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:51,808
So to be clear the way of the Chinese beliefs shut down those that reporter's live shot at the Olympics

678
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
Just kind of chilling

679
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,112
It's not acceptable really

680
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,184
Alex is a bit out of line sing the guy was

681
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
Beard

682
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,256
When someone disappear is disappeared they disappear

683
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,656
In this case the reporter wasn't even dragged off to a facility to be deported like Alex

684
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,424
Just claiming

685
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,288
He was accosted by the police but no one was hurt and then like a minute later he was able to reset in

686
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,056
Start broadcast

687
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Bowser's making up all this

688
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,712
There's a lot of issues of press freedom in China and it's a scary incident but

689
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
Literally making

690
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Yeah

691
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,088
It's not true what happened

692
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
Again

693
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
You do not need to do

694
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
With China

695
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
Well if you would like an example

696
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
Sensor disappeared

697
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
It's not hard to find one you don't need to make it up

698
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,144
Right but it would require you to do a little bit of work

699
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
Yeah that's true

700
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:45,056
Where is the alternative is

701
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:51,200
You can watch a video that you saw on Twitter and that make up a story about it man that sounds so much easier

702
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,040
I'd rather do that

703
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
I would say to our athletes

704
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
You're there too

705
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
Do not risk

706
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Incurring the anger of the Chinese government because they are roof

707
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,048
Honestly if Alex were the speaker of the house I imagined is stable be like something

708
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,864
Similar play to be way more Sensational and angry

709
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,936
Anyways disagree with Pelosi

710
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
CNA sport any athletes

711
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
They feel the need to protest witches

712
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,032
Confusing because

713
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:21,664
These people like Pelosi a globalist

714
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
Blob working towards the same goal

715
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,040
So doesn't compute how they have disagreements like this about a geopolitik

716
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
Weird all of them possibly be true

717
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
Somewhat stupid

718
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,928
And you as well

719
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:39,072
Going to go out on a limb and say it's probably bad if if you're the Speaker of the House

720
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Just be like

721
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Shut up

722
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,888
The government

723
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:48,288
F****** kill you that's that might be a little bit aggressive it's certainly untactful

724
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
Bissell Little hunt text

725
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,872
I would

726
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
If I were her maybe

727
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,688
Express things lightly

728
00:33:54,944 --> 00:34:01,088
I like maybe I see what I weigh weigh has to think about you know he was there for the last time

729
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
China hosted the Olympics and he has bad thoughts about it I'll buy you that right now didn't go well for him and then the White House

730
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:12,608
Express things better than like smoke them if you got them Let your freak flag fly

731
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,888
What is it Anyway

732
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,240
I thought when we voting for Democrats the idea was

733
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:19,776
Veridian

734
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,432
Little bit more adult they don't time where is much I guess

735
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,736
Self-control which comes with age

736
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
Look

737
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
This is

738
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:36,160
Weird Alex decides I don't know exactly why

739
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,696
But besides that he needs

740
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,464

741
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,744
The world powers are

742
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,304
Although that's a bad idea for him

743
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,656
Yeah it's a little strange I found this to be really dumb

744
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,216
Competing tyranny

745
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
To the globalist

746
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
And there are competing powers

747
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,128
The European Union

748
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,944
Those are the major power structures of the government

749
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Combine

750
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
There is

751
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Parsley

752
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
There is

753
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
The Communist Chinese and there's a Russian

754
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,072
Above that is the day Bose group

The New World Order

759
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,704
And an Ender

760
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
Military arm that is the UK

761
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,592
Why do you ask

762
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
And a commonwealth Nation

763

U.s. government

00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
By what they've all written books

Denied

771
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
A PhD level

772
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Your classes

773
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
Georgetown

774
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
Georgetown

775
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
But you are in the Queen's service

776
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:03,200
Do that part of the end there about how this isn't tonight at the PHD level

777
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
Talk to be under the

778
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,112
Just Alex Griffin about things he has made up about Carol Quickly's book tragedy and Hope

779
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,184
You can tell because he reference Georgetown and that's a dead giveaway

780
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:17,792
Also my dad got his PhD from Harvard and he claims that they never mentioned

781
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
Being under the

782
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,144
So Department

783
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
Suspicious benefit dead

784
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,568
When I was a kid he was a big fan of things like fault

785
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,968
L h i x

786
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,576
You're taking notes and I appreciate that because

787
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,880
This power structure is sloppy

788
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,952
You can see my notes

789
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
Camaros

790
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,280
So there are four base

791
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,560
Music governmental powers

792
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,096
Which is the US

793
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
Also known as the anglo-american established

794
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,936
The EU

795
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
Russia and China

796
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:04,128
This seems wildly simplistic considering that it means that there's literally no power structures that matter in South America Central America

797
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
Africa the Middle East

798
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,688
Southeast Asia

799
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Matthew's nut

800
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,504
Weather got their own stuff going on

801
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,624
So then there's the Davos group and the UN by which Alex actually made the world economic

802
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Look for him at the UN

803
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,744
Who make up a new world order along with some other ngos Alex doesn't want to specify

804
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,536
They rule over the

805
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:26,912
The four other powers or three depending on if you want to pretend that the anglo-american group in the EU

806
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,056
About there a little bit in cuz I'm a little late correctly he said that they were a little bit a lot

807
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
Yes scaccia

808
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:38,944
Apparently the top-level has full control over the anglo-americans of the

809
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,040
EU but not China and Russia which is why we have articles online about the queen

810
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,160
I really don't know what to say about this other than to say that I think it's a stupid it serves as a

811
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:52,000
Simplify be incredibly complex picture of geopolitical

812
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
Most of the world isn't even at

813
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
And Alex's

814
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
Conception of things which is weird

815
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:01,728
They're ton of examples of this whole thing into question

816
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,264
Brexit

817
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,056
Like the EU

818
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,640
UK wasn't be used as part of the Anglo America

819
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Can group

820
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
EU group

821
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,736
Then wanted to leave the EU which

822
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:16,320
Most of the EU and the US were not in favor of right

823
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Make any sense

824
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,160
If Alex's Grand portrait actually reflected reality

825
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:24,000
Notes app now they eat the UK is now the EU Patriots

826
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,328
Like how the Patriots in the United States are the Patriots

827
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
Of the United

828
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,912
Alright

829
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
UK's the Tennessee of

830
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
Ubu I guess is what I'm saying

831
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,544
I don't know how that tracks you but

832
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:43,200
Speakeasy here is Alex giving it really shallow assessment of world relations based mostly on members from

833
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,480
Book written in the 70s

834
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,320
Did you didn't actually read but instead just understands

835
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,392
They were published by W Cleon skousen

836
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
How it's kind of realizes there isn't much

837
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,488
Fremitus

838
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,792
He's kind of Retreats that Queen impression

839
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,632
And rambling about how they teach you at the high levels of Ivy League education that we received

840
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
Currently under the British Monarchy

841
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
It's

842
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
It's silly

843
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:12,128
So tell me more about these lines that you have drawn here to figure out is who's on who's

844
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,944
Eastside / who's Under and Over

845
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,016
So the UN and such was under was over

846
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,368
I thought they also encounter

847
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
China underneath there

848
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
Control what I did all of the all of them is under the UN

849
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,912
Russia's fighting against the Tyranny right Russia's a member of the um

850
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
Fighting against the tyranny of the UN It's Not underneath the globalist

851
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
No right under the evils they are

852
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Well

853
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Unfortunately they are

854
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
The UN and

855
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:02,048
The world economic forum and these are governmental organizations are on top of everything

856
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,376
Guess I've just called the globalist yet

857
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:09,728
They are on top of everything everything is underneath that

858
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Okay they have

859
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,544
Total control

860
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,848
Over the anglo-american Apu group

861
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,992
Right less control over China and Russia

862
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:26,368
Right and needs it but who are the two tyrannies the two tyrannies are China and the global

863
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
But they

864
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,000
But the China's underneath the globalist on top of that

865
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,560
Heating system of care

866
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
You know sometimes words could just be

867
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,240
Whatever you want

868
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,568
Kind of gay

869
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,664
What Alex wants to save year or what he's trying to say

870
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,712
But I don't think it makes any sense

871
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Snow

872
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,808
He sang of the globalist are in charge of everything and

873
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,416
You know they did the UK the EU the the United

874
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Midstate

875
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
Vero Lake

876
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
Inanna

877
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,512
And they're cool with it

878
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,048
Where is China

879
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,096
Was cool with it either fighting

880
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Against it

881
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,216
Sure I'm an Russia is that always

882
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
Are there like the

883
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,568
The defense

884
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Against

885
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Overarching

886
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,480
Little dump

887
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
So

888
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Alex Gibson

889
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,368
There's just more geopolitical conversations this stupid

890
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,648
China Wok

891
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,928
The New World Order

892
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
China Wok

893
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
Shut up by this entire

894
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,328
Our system and now what did Gigi pink start doing the Last 5 Years

895
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
He said no

896
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,656
I'm going to be going straight to

897
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Control the world

898
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,216
Materials

899
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,496
Do you like me

900
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
Shrink control the world that way

901
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
The West Wall of the military

902
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
China course double-crossed

903
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Didn't follow that

904
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,943
Take over the United States

905
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
When they're spies

906
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Double cross

907
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:03,647
Help us

908
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
They were so busy trying to

909
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,559
Cut ourselves penises off literally

910
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
That now the Tricom double-cross

911
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
Austin Pain on Hollywood everything else

912
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
And a Rollin

913
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:18,751
Spy

914
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Only because

915
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
What

916
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
That's where all this is

917
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
Going

918
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:37,439
Chinese military at about 2.7 million members

919
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,743
In 1995

920
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,095
4.1 million enlisted

921
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,423
In contrast the US has about 1.3 million Act

922
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Super snouts

923
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
Numbers aren't really the most

924
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
Important thing

925
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,519
Necessarily in terms of

926
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,055
Building up the army

927
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:57,407
In terms of spending even though China has boosted its defense budget in recent years

928
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,967
They're still only spending about a third of what we do

929
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,039
Well it is true that the gross number of dollars

930
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
The China is spending on defense

931
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,903
Going up steadily in the past 20 to 25 years

932
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Not the Last 5 Years

933
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:13,535
The percent of GDP that's being spent on defense is actually gone down

934
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:18,399
In 1990 there were spending approximately 2.5% of GDP on it

935
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
Compare 21.8

936
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,959
Percent in 2019

937
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,263
Yeah relatively

938
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
There's nothing is going down

939
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Right

940
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:29,407
And it's not a phenomenon that's been going all over the last 5 years at 10

941
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,431
Consistent thing

942
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
For for a while

943
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,015
I like I like the idea that

944
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,551
Like that

945
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
It was like we

946
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,599
You can pause

947
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:41,183
Simple for us to really keep it in perspective

948
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,231
That that America spend

949
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,255
40 f***

950
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,535
18% of its budget

951
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,559
On

952
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
The military

953
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,143
No reason

954
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Other than

955
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,471
You know money for that

956
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Really

957
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
It's crowd

958
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,287
That's

959
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,335
So but then they're like

960
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
Hey hey hey

961
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,407
You can increase your Builders baby

962
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
From 5

963
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
To $12

964
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:09,087
I can't I can't handle that s***

965
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,623
Trillion dollars how about that

966
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,159
You shouldn't have spent 12

967
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,511
Conspiracy theory that there was a deal struck

968
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,911
The United States military might for the New World Order China would have control over rometty Rios manufacturer

969
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:28,287
Has the city of London will be the center of banking did Eisenhower

970
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,127
No word yet on any of the rest of the world

971
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
But I'm sure it's in the fine print of this conspiracy

972
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,735
Contract Alex's imagining everyone sign

973
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,319
Honestly I don't know what to say to something like this other than it

974
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:42,623
It's dumb and a bizarre over-simplification

975
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
Of world events and his

976
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:50,047
I've never heard Alex actually back this up this claim with anything meaningful

977
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,351
She did say that it was like that movie Rollerball

978
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:53,631
So I guess you must be on

979
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
Yeah that does make sense

980
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,727
Which one James Conner original

981
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,055
This is just for Alex to explain away how Soros has been

982
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,871
Some critical of China lately and call Ga

983
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
Threat to open Societies in the world

984
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:12,575
Alex is yours yelling about how soros's want to be heads of the globalist tours in League with Islam and China to take out the noble ameri

985
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
So now that Sarah's is making some high-profile comment

986
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,695
That are critical to China's leadership

987
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:20,255
He needs to have a story to allow his audience

988
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
I take it that news without questioning Alex

989
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327
His previous narrative

990
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:28,447
The problem is though that you can fight instances of Soros criticized in China in the past

991
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Particularly

992
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
SunPass

993
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:36,895
In 2019 he said of the US and China quote the reality is that we were in a cold war that threatened

994
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,919
Things to turn into a hot

995
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,223
In 2020 he said quote

996
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:44,319
There are a lot of people who say that we should be working very closely with China

997
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
But I'm not in favor of doing

998
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,927
We must protect our Democratic open Society

999
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
At the same time we must find a way to

1000
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,047
Cooperate on fighting climate change in the novel Coronavirus

1001
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
That won't be

1002
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
I guess what

1003
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,143
In 2019 he also said quote

1004
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:03,007
China is not the only authoritarian regime in the world but it is the wealthiest strongest

1005
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,543
And technologically most advanced

1006
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,335
This makes G Jinping

1007
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,383
The most dangerous opponent to open

1008
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,151
Open Society

1009
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Sure

1010
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
There's a lot of optimism

1011
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:14,783
And a lot of sources comments prior to around this point

1012
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,343
We have to understand one of the main reasons the things

1013
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:23,999
In earlier times that look like China's government was opening up to the world in the progress is being made on that front but then

1014
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,791
In 2018 she abolish

1015
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,863
Term limits and essentially made himself into a dictator and this

1016
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
Definitely

1017
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,191
How the situation look to Soros

1018
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:38,591
Someone interested in open Society

1019
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,615
What if you just abolished

1020
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Term limits

1021
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
You're still have to

1022
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,431
To win the election

1023
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
The last one

1024
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:44,479
Yeah but

1025
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
It's email yes to win the next one it's it's

1026
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,319
Totally fine that

1027
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
You did that

1028
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,439
And is not him declaring that he's a dictator for life it's basically an alley-oop

1029
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:58,559
To the next person who am I mean that's why you're the John Stockton of Decatur

1030
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,983
The service has been pretty clear about this stuff in his comments and speeches in the past Alex hides all that information from his audience because

1031
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
It doesn't really fit with the narrative

1032
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,383
How's this thing about Soros is making some headlines for the audience

1033
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
The fun tale of intrigue

1034
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,247
Is betraying the evil global

1035
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Plans

1036
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
As best as I can tell it

1037
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
But Alex is writing

1038
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
And if you

1039
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,159
You can remind people

1040
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
Especially you are an idiot

1041
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,743
That they are coming for your children

1042
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:34,655
Right they are just demons

1043
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
Need

1044
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
Peanut

1045
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:41,567
What is things that I found really remarkable about this episode is that like their horse

1046
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
Statues of things

1047
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
That are just

1048
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
All naat

1049
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:47,711
True like Alex various things

1050
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:51,551
Form that I'm just not true not true things

1051
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,367
Program

1052
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:55,647
Is about

1053
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:57,183
Suppression of information

1054
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
When they make

1055
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
They're big

1056
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,791
Biomedical tyranny takeover move

1057
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,071
What is an operation

1058
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
What is an opera

1059
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
Operation lockstep

1060
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
That is an operation of

1061
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,447
The 201 and many others

1062
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Finest detail

1063
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,799
Virus

1064
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
Release the virus

1065
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
And then

1066
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,663
And then forcibly inject

1067
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,943
Therapy

1068
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
And then give us

1069
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,039
A world ID

1070
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,063
Through the vaccine pass

1071
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
The phone

1072
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,367
The track-and-trace

1073
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,391
Everywhere we go

1074
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:28,671
Control

1075
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Weed

1076
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,231
All of that is made of

1077
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
None of that is connected in any way to reality

1078
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
I was looking for something

1079
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
Pretty hard

1080
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,239
It's really an all of those operations

1081
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,543
It's not in all of them

1082
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,335
No it's at all

1083
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:51,455
There was a real operation that was a training exercise

1084
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:56,063
Smallpox many years ago

1085
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:02,463
Operation lockstep

1086
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,303
Operation Operation role-playing exercise

1087
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,863
Operation of it

1088
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,423
I love that operation so f***

1089
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,983
Real thing

1090
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,007
All these things

1091
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
Added up to prove that this is all

1092
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
Covid stuff is all the shenanigans

1093
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,807
Thankfully there's a ray of Hope in the world

1094
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Are some

1095
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,231
From a very important event

1096
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
Place in Germany

1097
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
Event 202

1098
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,607
Where they are having an international

1099
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
Criminal court hearing with

1100
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
Top judges

1101
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Lawyers scientist

1102
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
And I have handed down the findings

1103
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,543
I've recommended in.

1104
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
One of the things

1105
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Going back to

1106
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
Said it wasn't

1107
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Freedom

1108
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,319
That is important

1109
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,111
The first have

1110
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,927
People's Court

1111
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
When prestigious people

1112
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
What

1113
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Congress

1114
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
And then you

1115
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,239
The public sees it

1116
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,455
Committees of Correspondence grew in

1117
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
Choosy

1118
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Continental

1119
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,527
Congress

1120
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
In July 4th

1121
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,183
198 ways

1122
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,327
For simple Disobedience and nonviolent resistance one of the main one is

1123
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
Mock trials in mock jury

1124
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
What

1125
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,751
Something I was put out by the Pentagon 3198 Waze

1126
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Resist

1127
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
That's nonviolent resistance

1128
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:59,199
It was a guy named Gene sharp who is a political scientist and Nobel Prize nominee who wrote on Brazil

1129
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Dictatorship

1130
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
Weirdly holding

1131
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,807
Fake trials isn't actually on that list

1132
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
Giving out Makawao

1133
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
Prison holding Maca like

1134
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,647
Since those are on the way

1135
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,999
Just claimed that holding box trials is something that is a main entry on this list

1136
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:15,327
It's just him making s*** up to overhype a bunch of idiots

1137
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Germany pretending to do courts

1138
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,191
I'm not sure that mock trials are such an important

1139
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,727
Piece of American legal tradition

1140
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,567
Really matches up with the story of the Continental Congress either

1141
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,591
All right I mean

1142
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:30,175
Judge Judy Judge Joe Brown

1143
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:33,503
These are all my trials really

1144
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:39,903
Good for education purposes Soto

1145
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
This is really a mock trial either as much as I do

1146
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:47,839
It was the uniting of delegates from the colonies to make actual demands of Brit

1147
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
At all very real these people in Germany are not going to be reaching the same kind of outcome

1148
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:01,919
But the actual demand advised like indictments and okay

1149
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
You guys have fun

1150
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:09,343
You're so powerful

1151
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,487
Group in Germany's called itself The People's Court of public opinion and they're not as Alex is claiming top

1152
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,023
Judges lawyers in science

1153
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:23,679
Conspiracy lunatics presenting their conspiracy nonsense in front of little Mike's wear while wearing suits

1154
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,215
So it looks more official then

1155
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,263
If the same things are being yelled by Alex

1156
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,287
Like usual

1157
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,151
For instance the legal representative for the United States as a woman named Deanna sack

1158
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:38,783
On January 24th Deanna spoke about her involvement in this trial in an interview with Jim Fetzer

1159
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,855
The guy who wrote the book no one died at Sandy Hook who Alex is

1160
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,647
Is desperate not to be associated with

1161
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:49,791
The rest of her Twitter feed is mostly just anti-vax blog posts and retweets of Robert Kennedy Jr

1162
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:56,191
The other rep for the United States is Nancy and a Garner who was almost section recently by the

1163
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
City courts of in Albuquerque

1164
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,287
After she wrote the judge a letter that was quote

1165
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
Truly shocking

1166
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
Roman article

1167
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,807
From an article about the incident

1168
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:18,207
Import of the letter she called masks face diaper and then went on and compared mandate enforcement to Nazi Germany

1169
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,511
Call the governor Michelle Lujan Grisham

1170
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
A quote phony

1171
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,095
And said vaccines are experimental gene therapy

1172
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
This wasn't a case

1173
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:31,007
I swear she was representing a restaurant that was trying to get damages against the city for needed to be shut down during covid

1174
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,567
I guess she thought that letter was going to be useful for the case

1175
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,663
Mr Smith Goes to Washington

1176
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:44,063
I just wanted to show them you want to play

1177
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:56,351
Daddy said by people who are never playing I wanted it to be shocking and yes I liberally

1178
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,631
Used a couple of square word

1179
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:01,727
As the judge said I think I insulted every branch of government

1180
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,847
That's what I withdraw and I did with drive but I meant every word of it

1181
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,551
Just lawyer that I like that I like this is Betty lawyers that I've liked

1182
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:20,927
Results of imagining what

1183
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:24,255
Goal is served by this letter.

1184
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,535
Just feeling

1185
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Feeling good

1186
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,351
That's prestigious

1187
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,887
I would take that as Christie

1188
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,911
I feel like this

1189
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,935
Probably like

1190
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
Malpractice

1191
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,591
Didn't want her to do this I feel like they might be able to sue her

1192
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:44,991
Yeah I'm going to be I'm going to throw this out there I think bull would kick her out of the people's Night Court

1193
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,295
A meaningless exercise of repeating the same old

1194
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,343
Conspiracy anti-vax

1195
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,903
Do dangle red meat out in front of people like Alex

1196
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,439
Cool get really excited

1197
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,463
Didn't sell it to his audience

1198
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
This is the move.

1199
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:59,583
Finally going to bring about a worldwide recognition that you listener

1200
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,399
You have been right about being anti-vax all this time

1201
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,471
All this time everyone said that you were an a****** in prolonging

1202
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
No

1203
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,895
Absolute weirdos in Germany during and they're going to vindicate everything you've ever done

1204
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:18,015
There's nothing meaningful about this at all it's basically just the international version of Jacob walls

1205
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
Front porch

1206
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,063
Publicity stunt

1207
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,671
Just thinking to is like a lot of people in Alex's orbit do do this stuff

1208
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,743
Reverend Manning

1209
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:34,143
Up in New York held that weird

1210
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,519
Another pumping held a mock trial man this goes way back

1211
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
But that wasn't recently

1212
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,175
That's true pet Benedict did not pick up another phone that's

1213
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,711
I feel like

1214
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,735
These folks

1215
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,295
Really value the

1216
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,575
Attention Gathering

1217
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Having a mock

1218
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:58,719
Because also you give the appearance of having any kind of legal

1219
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Amend

1220
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,559
The people who take in your content

1221
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,655
You'll understand it that way too and disseminate it

1222
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Pusher

1223
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
To further its

1224
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:14,591
It's so just a dumb publicity game just think of all the out-of-work actors who would give anything to go

1225
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:16,895
Go to Germany and put on a play for a couple of weeks

1226
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,919
Makes you know

1227
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
There's no

1228
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Principal first

1229
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
You need a law degree

1230
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:26,367
You need to write a judge a weird letter

1231
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:30,207
I could probably pull that one out to look we got these weirdos in Germany

1232
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,791
We got ran Paula saying that the Republicans take over

1233
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,351
In the in the Congress

1234
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,911
They're going after facts

1235
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,447
But that's not all

1236
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Well

1237
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Guess what

1238
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Congress

1239
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:51,967
Has now started

1240
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
And if

1241
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
And game

1242
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
Function

1243
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,647
So that's very very poor

1244
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
I go through

1245
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
We're Congress announces in the committee

1246
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
Control

1247
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,911
Investigation

1248
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
Of the will

1249
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
Virus origin

1250
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
Gain-of-function

1251
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
For some reason I just

1252
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,383
And cannot

1253
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
Cannot find it

1254
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,759
Stop story can't find it

1255
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
Smaller

1256
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:32,415
Have a different Works load paper in front of you

1257
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
Clearly not effective

1258
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
Not going to help

1259
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:41,375
So this is just a story about the Republicans in the oversight and reform committee James Comer Steve scalise and Jim Jordan

1260
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:46,239
Calling in 7 scientist to testify they believe were pressured by people like fauci

1261
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,823
The claim that the virus wasn't likely to have come from the lab in Wuhan

1262
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:55,711
The issue they have is that some of them like the UK's Jeremy Farrar hit made statements

1263
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
He was 50

1264
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,295
50/50 on the liability covers his natural origin

1265
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Confer

1266
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
Call on February 1st 2020

1267
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,415
We're fauci was involved

1268
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,439
How to use part of that conference

1269
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,743
After that point he was aleska

1270
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,279
It's by the Light

1271
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Theory

1272
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,839
This naturally proves the fauci

1273
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,887
Put the squeeze on him and got him involved in a

1274
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,655
A cover-up

1275
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:19,519
As opposed to the possibility that a bunch of information it's science was discussed in the car which made for our change

1276
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,079
Tour doing the lab leak Theory

1277
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
As less likely

1278
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,175
How do I does just another grandstanding publicity stop by the

1279
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,015
These folks in the GOP horizontally creating names and bank accounts for themselves

1280
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,807
By attacking public-health officials

1281
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,879
If there's some evidence that there's actually a cover-up in Gray

1282
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Come out with it but I think the game played

1283
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:40,511
So many times already and I know this is going to be a zero

1284
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,535
It's just going to be

1285
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,839
You like Rand Paul yelling Itachi

1286
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:45,375
Like it's just going to be that

1287
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,911
Again no I mean it's

1288
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,935
It's like

1289
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
3

1290
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:53,823
I mean it's like three cavemen trying to ask aliens how to fly

1291
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
Like

1292
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:57,407
But they're smart enough to know that they can get

1293
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
Millions of dollars

1294
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
I know what you talking about

1295
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,575
It's just like you don't know any you have no

1296
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
Contacts for anything that they could try and

1297
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,671
Explain to you

1298
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:14,815
Yeah and the problem to is the hostility of the questioning will disallow any kind of actual like

1299
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
Cuz I'm sure there's a lot of times

1300
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,399
These scientists would be willing to

1301
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Explain be happy

1302
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
Me to explain

1303
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:28,127
Treated as hostile Witnesses and badgered into a bunch of cavemen with clubs about the bright lights in the sky

1304
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
It's counterproductive

1305
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
It's not good

1306
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
Speaking of

1307
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
Counterproductive

1308
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,807
Rodger Stone

1309
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:36,575
Is back

1310
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,599
Great

1311
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Got to do all four hours

1312
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:43,231
Rodger will be on later book

1313
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,255
Breaking news

1314
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
Spell with Raj

1315
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
Rodger Stone

1316
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
Joining us

1317
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
I should have

1318
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,679
My mind going on

1319
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
Because he's been on fire lately he's always

1320
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
Informative

1321
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
Involved

1322
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
With the massive cam

1323
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Florida

1324
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,223
Friday

1325
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:06,783
And they have found

1326
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,063
30 40%

1327
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
Other voters are

1328
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Of course

1329
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Huge number

1330
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
None of it is skewed towards Republicans there is

1331
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,303
Some of that butt

1332
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
Percent

1333
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Skewed towards

1334
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,191
So they showed people's houses

1335
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
And I do know we've lived here 5 years

1336
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,335
And that person never lived here

1337
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
Bought this house from

1338
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,455
In some of the cases I go yeah that guy moved out six months

1339
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
Horses

1340
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Chase's

1341
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,575
It totally fine

1342
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:41,855
The people are voting

1343
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
Alex and Rodger going into reruns this is a story Rodger tried to push last October but it

1344
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,071
Nowhere's I guess he's trying to breathe some new life into it

1345
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Try to push donations or something maybe

1346
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,775
Maybe you need the money in order to make sure that this canvassing gets into the right hands and it's got a

1347
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
Yeah

1348
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
I don't know

1349
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,615
It's crazy that it's all on the devil

1350
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:09,503
I totally I swear if you really start getting into what Alex State like

1351
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
If you believe everything Alex says

1352
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,623
You have to think there's like 50 Democrats in the United States

1353
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
He is waiting

1354
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,535
That's what he wants them to think we're the massive majority

1355
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:26,143
I think about the Dynamics of a lot of people that are listening to his show

1356
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:32,799
What is it a lot of his stalwart audience are people who are in more disconnected area

1357
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,871
There are plus-26 districts

1358
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
If you will

1359
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Semi-rural

1360
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
And I think

1361
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:44,063
At one of the things that is advantageous about that for Alex

1362
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,367
Is that he's able to create portrait

1363
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
The play on the

1364
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
Fears

1365
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,719
And Prejudice is the people have

1366
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,023
Urban areas who don't live in them

1367
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
If so I think

1368
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
That we do you can play paint this picture of like crime everywhere

1369
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,959
Last episode of downtown Austin isn't safe for anybody

1370
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,847
To wander through whatever

1371
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,127
And living in a city

1372
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,407
Bright or big city

1373
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:13,759
I think the same thing is true of like presented the demographics of democrat

1374
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:18,367
That's like it is believable if you live in an area where everyone around you

1375
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
Is is Republican

1376
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,975
It is probably truth it

1377
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
There's only 50

1378
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,815
Democrats even like that bias

1379
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,631
Does exist on the other side

1380
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,911
Cloistered and

1381
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
The insulated in

1382
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,215
Just hanging out with him

1383
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
And experiencing Democrat

1384
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,823
Sure they can think that it's impossible that anybody

1385
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
Would be on the right

1386
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:42,943
But but I think that I was plays into that easy

1387
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,247
It serves his purposes very well

1388
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,527
Yeah yeah does

1389
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,599
It is a it is always smart to

1390
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
If you are

1391
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Dealing with p

1392
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
People who don't expose themselves

1393
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,463
Two other things

1394
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Frequently

1395
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:58,047
It is a lot easier to tell them that other things

1396
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
You should not expose

1397
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:05,471
Lose Yourself to expose yourself to them and let me tell you about him

1398
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,287
Bono

1399
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
Alex's

1400
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,871
Can I introduce Rodger hair but

1401
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Adverse

1402
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,503
They have gone to Grand Jury

1403
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
Phelan Phelan slick

1404
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,495

Yeah you might just you know see me in jail

1406
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,591
Gaylord add Willy people

Was Russia

1408
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
I want to sit there and

Please do you how serious this is why it's going off here in six months cuz of Finance

How serious is vice listen to country

I want to be

1413
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Peaceful

1414
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,839
Democrat Republican

1415
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,375
Come together

1416
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,423
Read say no to the multinational corporation

1417
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,471
New World Order

1418
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,775
Heather playing us all against each other

1419
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
Republican Democrat

1420
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,639
Little Canada live in Mexico desert

1421
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:18,687
The New World Order

1422
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,991
Good for you

1423
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,039
Where are the masks

1424
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,135
But you're only engaged in the Stockholm syndrome

1425
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,255
Rodger myself

1426
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,303
Car finance

1427
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
Watching

1428
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
Down

1429
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Target products

1430
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
Put the money in. 6 weeks

1431
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
Before I get

1432
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
I'm having to put it on

1433
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,623
Because of that we don't have the cash

1434
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,975
Need

1435
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,447
What would be good for him because recent Wars wouldn't have any kind of shipping issues or any kind

1436
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
Supply chain is no just be pure profit

1437
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,055
For him so be good

1438
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,847
Also I don't think

1439
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,871
It makes sense

1440
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,431
That things that he ordered 20 weeks

1441
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,503
To go are now coming in if this is a new thing

1442
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,551
Move Supply chains are all that he needs

1443
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:33,951
Ex post facto

1444
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,767
Dad

1445
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,583
Also I mean if you're out of supplies

1446
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,887
You need to order things that'll come in at 6

1447
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,423
Six months you're f*****

1448
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
That is absolutely not

1449
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:49,567
A real depiction of his situations that's nonsense

1450
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,335
I go to a

1451
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:55,967
Bank and tell them that's your situation that you need an extension on your loans and see how they treat their

1452
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,295
But I guess you are foreclosed upon now

1453
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Yeah

1454
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,135
Alex wants to drive people to reset Wars

1455
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
Because

1456
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,207
It's just

1457
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:13,887
I think people might have noticed that I have maybe become a little bit less concerned with reset Wars and maybe

1458
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,703
The drive to cover it has been last

1459
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,775
Hey what are the reasons for that I actually couldn't talk about it

1460
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:22,079
Until after the deposition

1461
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,615
Came out because

1462
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,175
If there was a question about it in the deposition

1463
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,735
A what Alex said about reset Wars

1464
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Risa Ward

1465
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,207
No that is

1466
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,487
That is somebody else's

1467
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
That that

1468
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
It's not like

1469
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,727
It's very clear that Alex isn't

1470
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,263
Really you just get the

1471
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:56,895
The recent Wars has a company isn't even Infowars it's not

1472
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,967
Alex it's not free speech systems it's Jake Ducey

1473
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:02,783
And is hypnotism b******* and he got Alex

1474
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,087
To be the frontman for these videos

1475
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,111
Dorothy

1476
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
And so

1477
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:11,231
This is my most important work I've ever done

1478
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,535
After you kind of get the sense of like he's

1479
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,559
He's willing to

1480
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,351
Just back at somebody else's s***

1481
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
Yeah

1482
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:22,495
Took it took a little bit of the interest off at 4

1483
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,567
Yeah when you when you see like

1484
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
Brad Pitt

1485
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:31,967
Hawk and some product in an old Japanese ad in here like that's clearly you just

1486
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
You know what you don't even care you're just doing a commercial

1487
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,087
For the cash that's great good for you whatever f*** off

1488
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,183
But that's cuz he's not built a career out of

1489
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,207
Sebring like he

1490
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:47,583
He gave a s*** about the news

1491
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:49,887
I can't believe that you would

1492
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:56,287
Seriously say out loud on your show

1493
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,567
When you are not even

1494
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,127
Close to thinking that it's even a little bit of work

1495
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
That you try

1496
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
Or even something you're willing to take

1497
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,735
Any direct ownership of

1498
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,087
It's not really even your project at someone else's company promotion

1499
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,135
Real it's

1500
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:14,719
It's a little bit illustrates disingenuousness on his part

1501
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:18,559
Let's think about you would we know people comedians who have done like

1502
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Corporate gig

1503
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631
Kind of things worth

1504
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:28,031
Like maybe they do a video for a corporate internal use

1505
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,871
The host of the

1506
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,431
Match Game

1507
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,991
Dating Sim dating show used to watch

1508
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,575
No

1509
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,111
You'll get elimidate

1510
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:42,879
Love it

1511
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
Something like that

1512
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,951
Rodger Lodge

1513
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,999
Hosted the training video

1514
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,303
For it

1515
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,351
Do stuff like that fuel corporate gigs

1516
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,911
Rodger Lodge was Troy McClure

1517
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215
Some people do that

1518
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,519
What Alex has done is that

1519
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,287
This is a quart

1520
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,567
Great gig for him he's

1521
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
The face of

1522
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:06,175
Are the the recent Wars material that is

1523
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:07,711
From Jake Ducey

1524
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:12,575
And it's just pathetic for Alex because of the most important work is over.

1525
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:15,647
Being quiet I don't know what else you've done in his career

1526
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:19,487
Like I'm so proud of this hoodrich theaters

1527
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:23,327
Promotional video the internal training

1528
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:26,399
It's the best work I've ever done

1529
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,703
That makes it

1530
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,519
Slightly less interested in like Rush

1531
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,847
But we're still going to get to it eventually

1532
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,639
So sad it's so

1533
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:40,991
Raven and an awful

1534
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,015
Because I want

1535
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,319
Cover his most important work

1536
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,855
I don't want to cover

1537
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
Him doing a gig

1538
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:52,255
Again you have had that football pulled out from beneath your feet

1539
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
And again you go flying

1540
01:09:54,815 --> 01:10:00,703
360° in the air

1541
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,775
So look Rodger got a plug

1542
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
2

1543
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,311
Alley Cats of course

1544
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,103
Alex's Azan plug

1545
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,639
Rogers got to plug

1546
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
This plug

1547
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Is

1548
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Is is why

1549
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
You can go to Stone.

1550
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,135
Unfortunately

1551
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
You do still

1552
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
Need to help

1553
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
Patriots and a warrior

1554
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:28,863
Community

1555
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,471
You forgot

1556
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
You have

1557
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:39,615
You have the Capitol Police suing you for running January 6th I mean you weren't nothing to do with it

1558
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,967
They come at you with

1559
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,039
Georgetown University and the CIA are suing

1560
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Okay

1561
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
Admittedly run the law clinic

1562
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,391
The Virginian lawsuit against

1563
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,231
Weirdest

1564
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
We just got a

1565
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
The old process

1566
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,399
They local constables

1567
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,167
And literally take

1568
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,703
Lights off

1569
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
4 years in the corps

1570
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
All this just to stay on the air

1571
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,039
Blasting

1572
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
At the New World Order

1573
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,023
By complaining about my own

1574
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,839
Righteous battle against all the f******

1575
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,887
Comfortable

1576
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
That looks

1577
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:44,383
I think of some more though

1578
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,919
What that means

1579
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:52,319
I think I read it I think this is I think that he's talking about the fact that I I think I read somewhere that Rodger

1580
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,367
Can't afford to fix his car

1581
01:11:54,879 --> 01:12:01,023
Is it a half a car that's broken or is it a car that's Halfway Broken

1582
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,303
Can it work sometime

1583
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,583
Who cares

1584
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,375
I mean Beyond

1585
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,191
Beyond Rodger

1586
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
I mean like

1587
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,543
I don't know every car that I've ever had has been half-broken

1588
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,871
But he can't afford to fix it is what the character exactly

1589
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:21,759
That's that's fine but that's what Alex is talking about with a half broken car

1590
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:26,879
I mean let's go back to when I worked at that movie theater where Rodger lodged at the training video

1591
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,695
I never felt entitled that someone else should

1592
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:36,863
Fix my car no I don't know why Rodger Stone that's something that's relevant to his his legal

1593
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,983
I think because he would like everyone else to pay for his arrest

1594
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
After his life

1595
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,287
Yeah I would think so

1596
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,335
The way he goes about it

1597
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,663
Trying to get everyone to pay for all this s***

1598
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:51,199
Little tacky

1599
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
Little tacky hear it

1600
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,015
White tacky

1601
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,575
No

1602
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,719
Damn serious we are going to back down

1603
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
We are going to give up

1604
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,023
We could get out Rodger

1605
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,631
Rodger Stone did nothing wrong shirt how they get your boy

1606
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,655
How do I find Rodger

1607
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Paraphernalia is the left called

1608
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,031
Again you can go to stone-cold truth.

1609
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
Go to the shop

1610
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,871
Go to the shop

1611
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:20,895
You can get your

1612
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,015
Wrong t-shirt

1613
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,319
Or you get one of my famous

1614
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Rodger

1615
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Stones paper weigh

1616

Sorry what if you just want to help me in the legal battle and I need that

1617

Rogers stones

1622
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,007
A little dumb

1623
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,823
No that's great Rodger Stone

1624
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591

You can't not-so-little Uncle Joke

01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:06,367
What happened to my body my choice

1658
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
Too long

1659
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
Rodger Stone

1660
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:14,047
Still did nothing wrong with a fedora over at that hat $25 also

1661
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,119
Brookstone still did nothing wrong

1662
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
15 bucks

1663
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,703
That's an expensive mug

1664
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:24,031
Probably too too much you can get a

1665
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,383
Picture of Rodger Stone getting arrested

1666
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Seriously

1667
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:34,783
They have a Rodger Stone arrest photo for sale

1668
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:41,183
8 21/50 why this motherfuker can get away with this s*** is because that is such a great

1669
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,023
Dick wag I can't I mean they told impeachable

1670
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,839
Description of the picture

1671
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:52,447
A riveting piece of history and a huge mistake for special counsel Robert Mueller

1672
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:59,615
The stunning pre-dawn raid of Rodger Stones home to arrest him for politically-motivated

1673
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:04,479
Fabricated first-time non-violent crimes shock the nation and mobilize the Baga Bass

1674
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,783
In America to support Rodger Stone in his Epic

1675
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Struggle for justice

1676
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,647
CNN just happened to be there to live broadcast the entire Cirque

1677
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:15,743
Didn't get a photo that signed by Rodger for twenty bucks

1678
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,047
Wow where where would you hang up

1679
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,375
In the fireplace

1680
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:25,215
Picture is not stew because we

1681
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
You guys have talked about a cow

1682
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:32,383
Do they they came when they raided me he's wearing a shirt that says Rodger Stone did nothing wrong

1683
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Dick

1684
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:41,599
Goddamn personally hand-signed presidential part right how much do you think it cost

1685
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,183
I'm going to have to go he's going for broke on that when I bet he's charging 100

1686
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,511
So on December 23rd 2020

1687
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:52,095
President Donald J Trump granted an unconditional presidential party

1688
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:55,679
Pardon and active both mercy and Justice capital

1689
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,703
Jake just

1690
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,727
Capital j

1691
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:04,127
Has the president determined that stone had been framed by Robert Mueller's now discredited political witch-hunt

1692
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:06,943
Wrote it in the corruption trial in Washington DC

1693
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:07,967
20 bucks

1694
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:08,991
20 bucks

1695
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
Oh man he's really blowing that one

1696
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,415
I feel like you need to charge a s*** ton for that that's Prestige price

1697
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
You know you can

1698
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:22,047
You got your Goldilocks items you got your you got your shirt for twenty bucks

1699
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:22,815
You got drugs

1700
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,863
You got your expensive items you got your mugs

1701
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,887
415

1702
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:27,935
And then you got to go For Broke with some

1703
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,519
Well I'm going to tell you this right now

1704
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:37,407
Supply is unlimited believe so is low

1705
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
I don't think he could get away with charging that much cuz no one wants it

1706
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,855
The flagship product

1707
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,927
He is about selling it because

1708
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Youwantmati

1709
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:56,351
Clearly broken car what kind of conversation the if you buy one of those

1710
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
You expect

1711
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,703
Somebody to be like hey what's that and then you say

1712
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,471
That's my

1713
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
Signed copy of

1714
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,775
Rodger Stone

1715
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,055
Presidential pardon

1716
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:11,455
It would be so funny if you go into your doctor's office and they have their diploma

1717
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,599
Just as a prank that would be very funny

1718
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:24,255
That would be very funny either be the best doctor ever or unit for Rock

1719
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:32,959
I would have loved to be there for the conversation of deciding to do that

1720
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:37,311
That's just amazing that's the kind of thing you come up with when you're like cigarette high with your buddies

1721
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,847
Kind of an idea

1722
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,407
No that's the idea so Rodger stones

1723
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:46,271
Same Session 5 Seconds

1724
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,551
Great Neck

1725
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
45 minutes is f******

1726
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,879
Terrible ideas

1727
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,415
What about Stones Rogers

1728
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,695
No that's stupid

1729
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,487
I've been finally we get to

1730
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
Oh my god I've got

1731
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
The perfect

1732
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,631
Yancey I think a normal person would respond to someone suggesting they should

1733
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:08,031
Should sell autographed pardons if you like I don't know I think I would look bad

1734
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
YouTube

1735
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
Is

1736
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,991
Bespoke product

1737
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,783
That it only Rodger Stone

1738
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,111
I'm certainly not flying off the shelves

1739
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:28,255
Alex get to talk to Rodger about the situation in Russia is really really strong

1740
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,047
And he's got a lot

1741
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,607
From his research in his contacts

1742
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:34,911
Stration

1743
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
He really thinks it's happening

1744
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
With this Russia crisis

1745
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,359
Lighter say sorry fake headlines

1746
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,895
Are we seeing the

1747
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
Bathroom shelves

1748
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,063
We said give us proof they said that is the proof

1749
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:57,951
We've already gone over the Bloomberg story but I really think about the claims that by individuals

1750
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:01,279
Made that Russia was going to carry out a false flag.

1751
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Very strange

1752
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:08,703
I'm not going to defend the administration's claims or necessarily how they're presented not but the last person who should be attacking this

1753
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
Is Al

1754
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:16,128
If his complaint is it somebody's coming out predicting a false flag and then the only proof they can provide to back up their claims

1755
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
Trust me

1756
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,968
There's a situation where Alex has indicted himself

1757
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,992
Far more than

1758
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,016
Anybody in the Bible

1759
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,832
How much is career is 1 long

1760
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:28,928
String of in predicting false flags that never happened no evidence

1761
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:29,952
Or something

1762
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
Intuition or maybe a dreamy add

1763
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,792
Resume headline he misread

1764
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
If I were Alex I wouldn't

1765
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,144
Take this approach to attacking the official because

1766
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
It has the

1767
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
Cancel to make any

1768
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,008
Engaged listeners question what evidence Alex ever has

1769
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,824
Her to offer it is with his predictions

1770
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
The false Flags

1771
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,688
Anyone who seriously question and it listened to enough of his show

1772
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:53,504
Reach the inevitable conclusion that Alex is just regularly

1773
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
Making up at 10

1774
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,320
When's predictions of imminent false flag

1775
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:59,648
Then when they don't come to passing moves on and acts like a never did

1776
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,672
Let's just

1777
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
I I think it was

1778
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:05,536
It's dumb to accuse people of baselessly predicting false flag

1779
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:07,072
When that's your business model

1780
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:13,472
Yeah I was kind of expecting as a cuz I heard the I heard by them and all of them say that and I was like

1781
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Oh well

1782
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,288
Great we're having a great time

1783
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,360
And I assumed Alex's going to be like a Hi-C

1784
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,896
This is the false flag

1785
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
They are going to do it

1786
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,736
And then release the video

1787
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,576
So they're just getting you ready for the false-flag they're going to commit

1788
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:32,928
And then they're claiming that the Russians committed that false flag when in fact it was the United

1789
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,488
The committee that makes the most sense to me

1790
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,024
For an Alex things

1791
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
Sure. For him to be like

1792
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:42,656
Declaring a false flag is a bad idea like what are you f****** talk

1793
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,704
Talking about being like if

1794
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
You predict a false flag you must show

1795
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
Absolutely

1796
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,592
Now that's

1797
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
He can't live up to

1798
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,664
Infuriated

1799
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
It's a strange take

1800
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
I guess what you going to do

1801
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,064
Is audience doesn't demand much you know that's true there is not a lot of demand

1802
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:04,928
I have some interesting ideas about what Putin wants

1803
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,720
Visa Vie Ukraine

1804
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:10,048
Exactly like the Cuban Missile

1805
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,864
Interesting

1806
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:17,984
And install a

1807
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,264
Puppet government

1808
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,800
So that he can restore the faith

1809
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,080
Glory of the Great

1810
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
Soviet Union like he's dead

1811
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176
Afford that

1812
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
Secondarily

1813
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
Let us listen

1814
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
Do you say

1815
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,832
Over and over and over again

1816
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
He doesn't want

1817
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,672
Ukraine to join NATO

1818
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
Why do you saying is

1819
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,768
Western Metals

1820
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Border

1821
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,864
President

1822
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:47,680
John F Kennedy said 1962

1823
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:50,240
Russian

1824
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
90 miles off

1825
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:52,544
Assure

1826
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,080
Straits

1827
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,640
This is all about that

1828
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:58,944
Over and over again

1829
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
Extrapolate

1830
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,784
To take over Ukraine

1831
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
I don't believe so

1832
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:05,344
If

1833
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,392
Ukraine would merely agree

1834
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,208
Not to put missiles on

1835
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
On the border of Russia

1836
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,280
This entire thing

1837
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
Could be

1838
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Averted

1839
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,864
I I think

1840
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,912
Thought experiment here might be useful

1841
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,936
What is

1842
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,752
Can you imagine a situation where Ukraine agreed

1843
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,824
No muscles on the border but we're joining NATO

1844
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,408
It would be a huge problem

1845
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:33,760
Interpreting the only problem being

1846
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:37,856
Missiles

1847
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
Nautica

1848
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,928
The problem is the missiles within the mind

1849
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,208
I'm the one in May.

1850
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,864
There's a possibility that Putin doesn't want to take over Ukraine in the sense of actually occupying the country but just like in the case of George

1851
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,984
2008 use military action or the threat thereof

1852
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,800
To serve as a veto to a state wanting to join NATO

1853
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:00,896
Turning to other states in the region that might want to join up as well

1854
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:07,808
A part of it maybe missile related but it's also an attempt to keep states in the neighboring region within Russia's sphere of influence

1855
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:10,368
You're not allowing them to make other strategic partnership

1856
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
Rogers tennis sugarcoating this

1857
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:15,744
Make Russia the unimpeachably good party in this which is

1858
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,280
Alex's agenda as well

1859
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,096
Again I don't think this is an indication of any kind of like

1860
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:23,424
Fealty to Russia the way that some people might suspect

1861
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
Secret of the international order

1862
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:31,360
Like if Trump were at office they probably be insisting that he needs to send troops to help flush

1863
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
Russia fight off Mater

1864
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,968
Probably would be

1865
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:40,576
Right but it would be motivated from the same place of opposition to

1866
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:43,136
World body Issaquah operation

1867
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:45,184
Things that are seen as globalism

1868
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,512
Yeah as opposed to necessarily support of Russia

1869
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,048
Yeah I mean

1870
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,608
If I were

1871
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Pardon

1872
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Specifically

1873
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:58,752
For courting Russian influence in our election

1874
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,824
I think I would go

1875
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:05,408
So hard the other direction when I got out the other side of the part and I'll be like

1876
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,064
Russia's bad

1877
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,112
If I'm going to continue to say that

1878
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,512
I still didn't do it. Here's what the great is it Rodger believed that his part in that that he could never be dry

1879
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:26,912
Double jeopardy

1880
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,448
Text me

1881
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,728
Yep

1882
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,008
I just think it's a little bit

1883
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,056
So Alex

1884
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:34,592
Gets into

1885
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,128
Weird consistency

1886
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
Theme of his here

1887
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,224
You know we get new crew in here

1888
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,320
Whoever and people will ask

1889
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,928
Your office

1890
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,488
For now are you came out or are you using drugs

1891
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,816
How the hell did you get so excited once you're on here but you're not

1892
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,352
When you come in here

1893
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:58,656
Vinaigrette

1894
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
The world's excite

1895
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,776
And exciting things are going on

1896
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,128
And we could all die but that's exciting

1897
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,408
Wow

1898
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,504
He seems to have consistently people around him asking if he's on coke

1899
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,784
Okay that's

1900
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,808
A little sister

1901
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
Here's a common things that happen

1902
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
You

1903
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,160
Low energy

1904
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
Bright

1905
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
Go into a room by yourself

1906
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,000
Come out high-energy

1907
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
This

1908
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
If it happened

1909
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
Once

1910
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:32,192
This is a regular occurrence, just excited that we might die

1911
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
It seems like

1912
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:39,360
Might be excited in private without anybody seeing what gets you so excited whether or not this actually is

1913
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,688
To him on a regular basis he does seem to feel

1914
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:47,808
Need to bring it up on Arrow La particularly strange about this

1915
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,600
He's not even like

1916
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,392
Crazy high energy on this Epic

1917
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:54,208
No this isn't one where he would need to

1918
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,744
To give that caveat

1919
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,560
I mean unless he walked in like literally asleep

1920
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:04,960
Just practically sleepwalking me like there's no way Alex is going to be able to handle it if you did a bunch of blow

1921
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:09,824
And he is just super high energy like maybe he was

1922
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,616
Projecting

1923
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,152
I don't know it's very strange

1924
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
And I will

1925
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,712
A would-be

1926
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,064
I would be curious why he seems to need to bring this up over and over again

1927
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
So

1928
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:25,952
I'm glad you wrote down that diagram earlier about the world powers

1929
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
So

1930
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:32,352
Are we going to have more to relist the world feel like we're going to have

1931
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:33,888
Thank God

1932
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,424
I'm seeing it everywhere

1933
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
The Scotts

1934
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752

Tucker Carlson

1936
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
And Joe Rogan

1937
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,128
All these other people

1938
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:45,920
The great reset

1939
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,480
A corporate cabal

1940
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
It's the other power

1941
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Russia

1942
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,392
European Union

1943
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
But what's bigger than all that

1944
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
Get together the big

1945
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,048
Above-the-law

1946
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
Think about being conquered by them

1947
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,632
Reset it so please

1948
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Go to reset

It said heavily promoted

He can't get anything in stock for 25 weeks

1953
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,856
Write the list

The powers which is strange

1955
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:33,536
He forgot it when he was in the middle of his lecture seems like they are the ones that he hates the most States seems like he's just make

1956
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,864
Making s*** up whatever feels right in the moment

1957
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:43,776
This is not this is like the the Bill Gates's of Council of twelve or possibly middle management

1958
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:47,360
Who knows this is this is bulshit also I would say

1959
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
If these

1960
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,176
Big corporations

1961
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,200
Are the problem

1962
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,992
Maybe we should do something about corporate

1963
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:58,112
Galaxy politics

1964
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,672
They should be allowed to

1965
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,976
But they should not walk

1966
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:06,560
Exactly that's what it's about it's about freedom of

1967
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
Choice Dan

1968
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,912
The freedom to kill people only means that if

1969
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,704
You don't you're a better person

1970
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,752
I think that if

1971
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,056
Out of control

1972
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,872
Rampage Incorporation

1973
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:21,664
Are really one of them

1974
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:24,736
Largest issues that we Face an even Alex

1975
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,016
Recognizes that

1976
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:32,672
It seems like some kind of state power is basically necessary in order to reel in those Corporation

1977
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:35,488
See you I don't see what other alternative there is in terms of

1978
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,584
A communal solution the alternative is to keep people

1979
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,912
Shoplifting to make sure that the corporations have more money

1980
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:50,080
Don't feel like that gets us where we need to go but that's cuz you're not going to get there you're going to be

1981
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,968
Sing the shoplifting is the answer but stopping at Circle

1982
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
Well that's not a problem

1983
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,296
Okay

1984
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,112
Well I'm convinced

1985
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:03,904

They're baseless

2004
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,816
But if you don't go fight

2005
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:44,864
Like them to get a judgement against you

2006

2018
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,328
Crucial in terms of rebuilding your immunity

2019
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,888
Anybody wondering

2020
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,424
No I'm not paid

2021
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,312
Bunsold yeah

2022
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:29,152
I believe it that's all that is being genuine well listen

2023
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,200
I would never believe that

2024
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,480
Rodger Stone was lying to

2025
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:36,576
Especially if he says I'm telling you the truth Beacon of Truth

2026
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,880
I think that he might be getting paid to say it

2027
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,184
Specifically because he was in the middle of a plug

2028
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,536
Maybe Miami his brain connected it to plugging the iodine

2029
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,840
Seems Seems like maybe those are in similar

2030
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,400
Departments in his brain seems like he's supposed

2031
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
To be there to get everybody

2032
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:56,288
Even do a plug without going into another plug

2033
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:00,896
His plug for his legal defense got interrupted with a

2034
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:04,736
A story about how sick he was so you can plug iodine to be racist

2035
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:08,832
I'm going to continue to plug Ivermectin and hydrochloric win for no fee

2036
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,440
And then I'm going to plug one of Ali

2037
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Plexus products

2038
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,792
That I definitely am not required to do as part of this appearance

2039
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,376
So I'll Alex talk a bit about January 6th

2040
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:24,448
How they were all cool

2041
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:26,496
It's a bit defensive about it

2042
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:29,312
Because people wanted to shut up about January 13th

2043
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,360
Pansexual

2044
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,736
Polza research the number show

2045
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,528
Did you want your sex

2046
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,320
Republican

2047
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,344
This is just crazy

2048
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,440
There's no there there

2049
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,000
Just tired of hearing about this

2050
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Hey Alex

2051
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,304
Benghazi

2052
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,912
You know he keeps things alive

2053
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,704
Quite a while

2054
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
Crazy it is crazy

2055
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
It is so crazy

2056
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:04,640
They could have killed a congressperson

2057
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,712
Like I just could have killed one more than one

2058
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,480
On

2059
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,760
National TV

2060
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,296
Live stream

2061
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,320
And I

2062
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
Camp

2063
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,368
Help but think

2064
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:21,024
That a year later we would still be in the same place where they like that's legitimate political murder though that's

2065
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,816
That's totally fine

2066
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:28,448
They're just good honest God-fearing folk honestly don't think so crazy

2067
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Vets

2068
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
The line would have been crossed

2069
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,824
In a much more serious way if

2070
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,104
Number of conch

2071
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,384
Murdered

2072
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:41,504
I understand you're shaking your head

2073
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:46,112
That's a level of disillusionment jadedness that I

2074
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:54,816
I pray for you so don't have faith that whatever response would have happened to that hypothetical situation

2075
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,864
I don't I don't say that it would have been

2076
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,912
Necessarily super-effective

2077
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,472
Or maybe the right response

2078
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,776
But I think I'm more serious response wouldn't

2079
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
We'll see

2080
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,432
Maybe

2081
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:17,600
It especially because they have people like Rodger running cover for it that's kind of part of the problem here

2082
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,880
Next

2083
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,904
Fucken cliff

2084
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,976
Schmear against that Great America

2085
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
Good Patriot

2086
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,768
General Michael

2087
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,536
Flynn

2088
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
It is alleged

2089
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,584
Is there was a draft

2090
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,608
Cast of a memo

2091
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,144
They talked about seizing

2092
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,168
The machine

2093
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,704
A draft draft

2094
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
There's never Act

2095
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:36,800
Fact is I understand that General Flynn's react

2096
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,104
Needs to run

2097
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
By the lawyers

2098
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,664
Illegal

2099
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
I mean if I

2100
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,736
Born about murdering someone

2101
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,760
Then I don't murder

2102
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:48,576
Of course not

2103
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,856
Now you're being fresh

2104
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Crime

2105
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Let's be clear

2106
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,744
Recommend martial law

2107
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
General Flynn

2108
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,584
Recommend the Instagram

2109
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,656
General Flynn did not recommend this evening

2110
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:03,680
The machine

2111
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,544
Recommended those things on Alex's shoe literally all of them

2112
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,568
Yes Direct

2113
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:12,640
So we don't even need to talk about any drafted executive orders

2114
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:17,248
Chicken dumpling here like in December 2020 he spoke to Newsmax and he said quote

2115
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
He is

2116
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Trump here

2117
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:24,672
He could immediately on his order sees every single one of these machines around the country on his order

2118
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,720
He could also order within the swing

2119
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:31,840
States if he wanted to he could take military capabilities and he could place them in those States

2120
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,912
And basically rerun an election in each of those States

2121
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,704
It's not unprecedented

2122
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,568
These people out here talking about martial law like it's something we've never done

2123
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,872
That's what he was saying right after the other

2124
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,712
Quizlet really clear about how he wanted Trump to respond

2125
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,504
Rogers just lying about

2126
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,576
It is now because it looks really f****** bad that he wasn't

2127
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
Just talkingshit

2128
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,184
Is also coordinating with Trump about the possibilities

2129
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,720
Of doing these things

2130
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,024
Right so

2131
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,048
So like yeah

2132
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:05,376
It's so if you think about committing a murder and then you don't commit a murder

2133
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:06,144
Not a crime

2134
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
But if you get like

2135
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:10,240
75% of the way to committing a murder

2136
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,008
That's called

2137
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,312
That's true

2138
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,848
That's true

2139
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,896
You I don't know

2140
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:20,480
Conspiring with people to commit a murder and I take a bunch of steps

2141
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:25,600
Towards committed that murder but I never actually follow through

2142
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:29,184
Especially if

2143
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
Murder plans

2144
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:33,024
Indirectly led to the murder of somebody else

2145
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:35,584
Like if you hire somebody to

2146
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,608
Kill

2147
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:37,376
Somebody

2148
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:39,168
Right right

2149
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:43,264
You still in trouble

2150
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:47,872
It's Alex

2151
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,408
Rattling off

2152
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,456
A bunch of things that aren't true

2153
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:55,552
I would say almost everything in this clip is not true it's get it

2154
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,136
Trump will be removed

2155
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:04,000
Insurrection.act she said will have martial law even be Wednesday election we're not going to accept

2156
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
Inauguration

2157
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
They said

2158
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,192
Is the temperature

2159
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,728
Billions of dollars of buildings

2160
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,752
Police

2161
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
You know

2162
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:16,800
The device

2163
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:18,336
President

2164
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,664
Murderers and criminals out of jail

2165
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,432
And then

2166
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,248
Sure that's why

2167
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:29,600
Fight the police a few thousand wave in the building and they arrest those that peacefully went in

2168
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,160
This is a fraud

2169
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,768
Refuse Trump's request

2170
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,816
A month before

2171
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,096
It's on them

2172
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,632
Because they created the condition

2173
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Rodger Stone

2174
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,568
Yeah go ahead down the list there

2175
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:51,616
Pelosi didn't say that if Trump won they wouldn't

2176
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:58,016
Accept it and Alex's making things up a sauna wargame beating the people had to discuss the possible

2177
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
Responses that could be taken

2178
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
If Trump lost

2179
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
And refused

2180
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:01,856
Leave office

2181
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:06,464
The burning of these buildings in such protest that has nothing to do with what

2182
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,256
How to talk about

2183
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:14,656
Thanks 3, Harris didn't bail out murderers or anyting she retweeted a link to the Minnesota freedom

2184
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,216
Find which is helping to bail out people arrested in

2185
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,752
Did the George Floyd

2186
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:23,104
This has been spawned by people like Alex into reaching the form you here

2187
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:30,528
6 narrative seems to be ignoring the roads in The Oath Keepers totally planned

2188
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
To do what they did

2189
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:35,648
What you hear there is Alex going back to the old narrative

2190
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,976
He used to say even though that it shows talking points have been update

2191
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,512
But he's not even in

2192
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
NSYNC with his own

2193
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:42,560
Lights

2194
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:45,888
Five federal government in Russia was Trump's request

2195
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
The National Guard

2196
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:50,240
There's at least five like really discreet problems with

2197
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
With that

2198
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:53,056
Only 50 seconds long

2199
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,872
Here's it's complete bulshit here's what I'm saying

2200
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,664
Okay we don't need to f*** with

The First Amendment at all

2202
01:38:59,200 --> 01:38:59,712
Alright

2203
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,736
We don't need to

2204
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,272
Limit people's speech

2205
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,832
What we need to do

2206
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:08,416
Is just get like a litmus test like this

2207
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:13,024
This clip right here if you have enough lies in a short enough. Of time

2208
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:17,120
You're off the air well it's like Comics will do the last per minute

2209
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:20,960
Read measure lies for men

2210
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:27,360
Sabermetrics for bullshitters what's your lies above replacement post

2211
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:35,552
I think it'll be tough to find somebody who would be able to replace it

2212
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:37,088
Is the

2213
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:44,000
I can't think of the best baseball player in the world in the best baseball player in the world

2214
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,816
Who was the best

2215
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:53,216
Open till in history was Barry Bonds

2216
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:59,616
Ohio Tony another 10 years and he might be there that's how good he

2217
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,152
One of the top 20 Pujols

2218
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,432
Pujols top 20

2219
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,736
Maybe even that I would say I would put

2220
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,272
Ken Griffey at

2221
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:13,440
Holes probably around 17

2222
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:21,120
Down there that's pzo

2223
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,680
Number 6 Mark Sioux Falls

2224
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:30,592
I'm just naming the Cardinals that are part of SeaWorld teeth married

2225
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,200
My buddy is all

2226
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:37,504
The s*** out of that.

2227
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,856
Yeah this is a bit like this episode in terms of

2228
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:45,696
Like meaningfulness over replacement not gray

2229
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:52,096
Bright Now Dental very bad I'm going on here cuz I think that in some ways Alex is in the middle of a holding pattern

2230
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,632
He's made this

2231
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,656
Prediction of

2232
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,960
The Giant cyber-attack

2233
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,032
These preemptively made that narrative

2234
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,312
In case something happen

2235
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,360
The storms didn't seem to do it

2236
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,200
So maybe this is going to be pushed down the road

2237
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,480
Scan down until maybe

2238
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,016
There is some kind of a Cyber attack

2239
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:12,576
Simultaneously he's waiting

2240
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,112
For something to happen in Ukraine

2241
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:17,696
He's built up this pre-emptive Narrative of being a false flag

2242
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,768
That's globalstar pulling against Russia no matter what right

2243
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,304
The rest of this is just

2244
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
I don't know

2245
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,632
Weird b******* about history

2246
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,960
Rodger really needs money

2247
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:33,312
I mean I will say I take I take some schadenfreude and that I would like to

2248
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,592
To see Rodger Stone

2249
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:38,688
Tiny listen walking everywhere for the rest of his life I think that be

2250
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,784
Quite enjoyable I mean he could be a certainly could be out there asking

2251
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:45,344
But what

2252
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,696
He would make you a hat that is true

2253
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,000

01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,328

01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,144
I like his impoverishment or anything

2257
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,984
I do think it's funny though the way that they're doing

2258
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Dislike

2259
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:06,080
Promotional basically

2260
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:06,848
Like

2261
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,408
Excessive

2262
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:13,248
And I got to get one of those got to get run of Rodger Stone

2263
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:14,272
No

2264
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,320
Got to get in Grave 2

01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:26,048
How many say this right now

2268
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,632
I'm worried that someone is going to as a joke

2269
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,424
Bye

2270
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:37,824
Give Rodger Stone a f*** I told you I want to see him penniless walking everywhere for the rest of his as a joke by

2271
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,384
His assignment

2272
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
Noah pardon

2273
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:45,760
Just take joy in knowing that it exists and someone probably isn't one

2274
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,552
Has gotten if you beat them

2275
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,576
Maybe take it for

2276
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,856
Run Runaway

2277
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:55,232
On another episode more impact on this

2278
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:59,584
