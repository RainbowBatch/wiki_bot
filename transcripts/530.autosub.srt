00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,976
Acknowledge

6
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
A little bit about Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
I got that

8
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,896
It is expanded from that

9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,504
I am off.

10
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,320
I don't think that be possible

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
Difficult but I've tried the number flavors

12
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
That I've been able to get my hands on demand

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:33,952
Not mad so good

14
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,816
It was really tough for me was that I had heard of I'd heard such

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Startlingly different reviews

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
Worried

17
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,920
Category but I loved it and it also I didn't realize it but I

18
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,688
It just takes me back

19
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,712
A bit too

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,528
Like things that I had in Hawaii growing up

21
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
And it makes total sense

22
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
You think that it would

23
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,952
It's great I love it to another dessert

24
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Another f******

25
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Sweet thing for me to eat we need it at the audience was like what other sweet things

26
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,656
I'm going to become obsessed

27
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
What will capture dance sweep do today

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Good news is people will be mailing those

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872
No that is true thank God

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,688
Text again I think she just comes with dry ice

31
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,528
Dry ice and then just melted one

33
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
This week Dan is the sword

34
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
It's a Korean movie

35
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,048
I don't know it's really good it's about three swords when they do stuff

36
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
Swordsman plural know the movie is about

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Singular

38
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,056
Like the Highlander there's more than one Highlander or I'll go there

39
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
No there's not more than one Highlander there's only one

40
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,664
I mean there are many people who live in the highlands

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
I thought there was

42
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
These and Mortals and they have to kill each other of course they do but the Highlanders specifically refers to that he

43
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:09,440
Highlander isn't the group of them

44
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,584
English movies from just appearance in conversational style alone

45
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,656
Sean Connery is indeed Egyptian in that movie

46
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,008

Go to events

54
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
I know it's still late cuz I'm halfway waiting for you to say it first I am disappointed in you

55
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:56,288
Because you have the open Lane Car Stutter Step

56
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,336

59
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:15,232

60
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,536
Checking on this is because of course

00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
Trump impeachment is going on

62
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,375
We'll discuss some feelings about that

63
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,727
Both of us have watched a bit of that

64
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775

00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:42,367
Very conflicted about watching it I have

70
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
Feels important

71
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,999
It should read it feels like it's way more important than people

72
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Everyone's like this is our second one we've been here before we all

73
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703

00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,543
Do you organize those cuz I feel like our last episode was

93
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,847
99% fake joke

94
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759

You're a busy man

100
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,999
Before the episode I need to be better at organizing

101
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
And stuff but

102
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:29,119

Don't really need to do much work in the money is really good

104
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,727
The job site

105
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,031
I assume that that's what you're up to

106
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
Yep Jordan also

107
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759

00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,535
Haha

112
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
He wanted us

113
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
To play I'm Holding Out for a Hero

114
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Haha

115
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
Little bit of James Ingram

116
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
That sounds right

117
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,991
Human having a real tough time coming up with songs

118
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Insect

119
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,367
But he he reached out and you wanted us to give a little bit of a happy birthday message

00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:28,255
Whose birthday is actually yesterday with asthma coming out alright

121
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047

122
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
I know I hope not

123
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:37,727
That's not fair that office in a long time remember birthday week

124
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:42,079
Remember that they were birthday we remember people who would just be like this is my birthday weekend

125
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Thursday

126
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
But it'll be Tuesday and it be like

127
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
I choose to believe that we are not dealing with people who manufacture a personality based on their birthday

128
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,135
666

129
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695

130
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,327

132
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
I'm sorry Mike that I couldn't

133
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,055
Improvise a better song

134
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
James Ingram's named Holding Out for a Hero

135
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Nevermind

136
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
The only James Ingram song I can come up with right now at the top of my head is featuring Michael

137
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671

You know

143
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543

I don't know

149
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975

155
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
I don't know

156
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,415
I feel like the image that's going to resonate with me is that video

157
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,327
The officer running down the hallway running past Mitt Romney Mitt Romney turning around

158
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
And running the other way paired

159
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
With all the video of

160
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,007
Protesters talking about hanging Mike penson

161
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,847
GPD imagining what could have happened

162
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,639
Had that guy

163
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,175
God Goodman not

164
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,199
I said good you know

165
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,503
What the other way

166
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,807
You know they just the idea that someone

167
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,599
Who's a very

168
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,439
High-level politicians

169
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:10,047
Very notable in politics who ran for president who is impeached Senate

170
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
They probably would have killed him

171
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
There was a little bit there was a little bit of me that was watching that part thinking like and then the next

172
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
Thing you should say is if it weren't for him

173
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Mitt Romney would be dead guys

174
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,759
45 senators are going to vote to convict

175
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
Say you want Mitt Romney to die or shut the fuk up

176
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,183
That's one way to put it like that

177
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
I think that's pretty much the only way to go

178
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,303
It's it's it's a really surreal thing

179
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
To be seeing

180
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,399
This conversation that's happening

181
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
You're trying to persuade our like

182
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
You know that

183
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
They're chanting

184
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
Kill

185
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,591
The vice president who they elected

186
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
You understand that the Intel

187
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Moments earlier

188
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
They were fine with the idea of

189
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
Supported my pants be subverted

190
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
The Constitution

191
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
You understand

192
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,719
Your name is very replaceable with that they are looking

193
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,767
See the problem there is

194
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Is I think they thoroughly understand that witch

195
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,119
Why they will be voting to acquit

196
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,935
Yeah I don't I don't know the Dynamics

197
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
It it was

198
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Pretty it's pretty

199
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
F***** up to

200
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
Did you see the information presented

201
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
That way

202
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
Is it

203
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Coherent it makes sense

204
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
Spend

205
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
It's is almost

206
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Hilariously over-the-top

207
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,527
Comprehensive

208
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,831
We're like I was watching yesterday

209
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,391
I meant today and they were talking about how

210
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,463
This is almost guaranteed this is guaranteed to be the shortest in p

211
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Impeachment trial in history

212
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
And after watching those two days I was like

213
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,583
That does make sense

214
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,423
In a normal real-world situation because you'd watch that and go

215
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:58,079
Real good it's open-and-shut

216
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,735
Fairfax opening statement

217
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
What was that Caster is

218
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Being like

219
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Are they made some good points

220
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,935
I don't know why you're all August members of this body I just want to

221
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,983
Say you guys are all great

222
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:29,823
I love you now obviously the prosecution makes some good points

223
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
My client's guilty

224
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,407
But I want you all to know that your spec

225
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,991
Spectacular people I thought we were going to bicker about your addiction

226
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,551
I am not prepared

227
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,135
Boy it really does look like he's committed those crimes

228
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,487
And all the all these sort of defenses that you see throwing around or like well

229
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,815
Trump's rally couldn't have incited this because

230
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,119
Do people are planning for weeks

231
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,167
Tah-dah

232
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
Exactly

233
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,959
A e

234
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
About all the stuff in 4 weeks

235
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Is it

236
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,383
Are any

237
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Conclusion like I don't have any faith that there's going to be

238
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,735
Conviction and I also.

239
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
There's not going

240
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
And to be also like I just

241
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
I see this

242
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:14,879
That

243
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
Yeah yeah yeah

244
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:21,023
So I wanted to see Alex's response

245
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
To a lot of this

246
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,143
I figure if anybody is going to be

247
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,167
Mad

248
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
About this

249
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Alex yeah

250
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Key for the sense theme

251
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Peach mint as impeachment has come around

252
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,127
Has been really really insist

253
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Sent the trumpet

254
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
To get up there

255
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
I put the whole system on trial

256
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
That would be great

257
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,855
To get in there and insist that he won the election it was stolen from him

258
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
Alex is not happy that that is not happy

259
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,559
I'm so we'll get into a little bit of his response but first

260
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,839
Here's an out-of-context drop

261
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Today Show

262
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Ashley worship

263
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:06,591
Ashley know everything about everything about Joe Biden

264
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,431
What the hell do I have to always up my ass

265
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Yeah man

266
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:16,063
That stuff really shouldn't be looking at Alex Jones either

267
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,927
But but we have to because he's up America's ass

268
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Can't not look

269
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,583
Alex discusses the UN building

270
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,351
A little bit

271
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
Have the show here on February 10th

272
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,775
He's talking about how he made that to documentary endgame

273
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Reviewing building on the front of it

274
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
And

275
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:39,871
He wasn't supposed

276
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Beyond air

277
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,039
When this stuff was going on now you know all the stuff that message

278
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
And you can either believe that

279
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
Or you could believe that all that stuff you were saying about they have plans

280
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
Take me off the air when they're plans

281
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,487
Come to fruition

282
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Was just nonsense

283
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:04,191
We're not supposed to be on there right now supposed to be shut down

284
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
A green Mist on the cover

285
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:16,223
You will notice that I specifically said

286
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Bio-weapon stimulants

287
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Practice a lot

288
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,855
And then

289
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Launch

290
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,951
Successive wave

291
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Posing as the saviors

292
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
What will be the United Nations it launches the attack

293
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:36,447
For Global enslavement and click images

294
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,287
Bookshelf

295
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
If the UN building

296
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
New York City

297
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
84 Rockefeller

298
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Rockefellers

299
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,831
Strangely enough

300
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
My story

301
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,511
Of course

302
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,559
Sold it

303
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
We Are Family

304
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
That's right

305
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:12,031
1820

306
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
New York

307
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
New York New York

308
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Digressing sorry

309
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,743
I agree

310
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
And you can

311
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
Go and decide for yourself if that

312
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
The documentary is actually about what Alex

313
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,263
Think that I believe he's literally asking us to judge a book by its cover

314
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
The DVD

315
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:50,431
I love the idea that Alex's you know he's making this physical land or the UN building sits into a personal issue for

316
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
But there's a couple problems

317
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
The relative that Alex is talking

318
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
I'm about your is a guy named David Ayers

319
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,975
Who is he and his family were the ones who Colonel Travis

320
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
Left his son with

321
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
Exclaimed

322
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:10,911
To be related to came to Texas In 1832

323
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,031
I also Colonel Travis didn't like adopt his son to them like Alex likes to pretend

324
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,919
Hi son just stayed with The Heirs family to attend school while his dad drunkenly pretended to be a soldier at the Alamo

325
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
The sun only stayed with the family for 2-year

326
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
It's not like

327
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,391
Enough to build a bond I will I'm not going to get no problem I'm not going to I'm not going to

328
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:34,719
Arizona

329
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
I think that's fine but the way I was presented is like

330
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,447
Colonel Travis

331
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
Also David Harris himself actually wasn't from New York

332
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
He was from Morristown New Jersey where is born in 1793

333
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
According to the Texas State Historical Association David

334
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:57,247
Came to Texas to buy property and build a home

335
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,343
Prior to that he was a merchant in Ithaca New York

336
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Ithaca is what 200

337
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:06,719
30 miles from New York City's I had some doubts about this whole story

338
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,095
Of him owning the land of the UN building is on

339
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:17,471
Keep his fight with his imaginary enemies personal

340
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:20,799
Live family's land that they you at brother

341
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Think about that

342
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
If that's what you want to do

343
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:29,503
Okay I have a claim to that land back from the 1820s

344
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,551
Then you also have to acknowledge

345
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,391
That maybe somebody else had a claim to that land in the 1500

346
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
Nope

347
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Why not

348
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Alex's property rights

349
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
Began in 1820

350
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
There's this

351
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Sing it in life

352
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Square

353
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,775
Stuff happens gradually

354
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
Alex tries to discuss how

355
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Taking covid

356
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Seriously

357
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
I will lead to negative consequences

358
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Is much like

359
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,759
Taking the clan seriously

360
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Leads us to

361
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Trump off Twitter

362
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:11,231
This is one of these a here this way

363
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,047
So the first Domino was the

364
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,887
KK and watch the premise most probably lost her in the ATL

365
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,959
Pablo

366
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
Alex Jones

367
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:34,783
Gougeres leiteritz the president of the United States

368
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,255
No I think these are all lumped in with enough since 1415 house for 15 days

369
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,839
Sounds reasonable

370
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,055
Have you seen outside your house.

371
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
10 years in prison

372
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Outside your house when I tell you

373
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:14,975
The problem with the argument that he's making is that like

374
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
If there is

375
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,815
Behavioral similarities between the

376
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
The clan

377
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Alex Jones

378
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,215
The president I don't understand breaking the terms of service of ascertain

379
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,263
Platform shantham getting kicked off

380
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:31,103
Isn't it's not like some kind of a dominoes falling situation it's

381
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
It's more of just a

382
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,711
Consistency of the rule only Nazis would expect just

383
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,527
This to be applied fairly dad doesn't make much sense

384
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,343
How many terms of the evolving

385
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Situation with covid

386
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Didn't do any

387
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Any of those things

388
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,863
People some people didn't

389
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,655
Two large enough extent

390
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:00,543
That those were not effective as effective as they could be

391
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Provide

392
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
Material support to people

393
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,871
To enable them

394
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
To do

395
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
These safety

396
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
It measures

397
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
In a way that would have been meaningful

398
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,343
We end up with we end up with a situation that gets worse and worse and half

399
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,184
The medication you would prescribe for that

400
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Become

401
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,024
Larger so it's not the dominoes falling it's just

402
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,304
Does not taking care of a problem

403
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,448
Not just that but mitigation efforts that were already planned for an In-Place that Jared Kushner according to witness

404
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
It says denied

405
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,544
Specifically because it would only hurt Democrats more

406
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,152
Making it more of a genocide situation less am just awesome that out there

407
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,736
So but if you're outside your house are going to go to prison for 10 years

408
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
Okay

409
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
In the UK

410
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,416
This is nonsense actual story is about how the UK government has rolled out new rules

411
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:53,024
Swear if you're returning to the country after visiting a country that's on the red list of high-risk

412
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
Countries

413
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,120
You're required to quarantine at a government designated hotel for 10 days

414
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
Would cost approximately 1750 lb

415
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
David discussion of a 10-year setting

416
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:06,336
People who knowingly lie about where they're returning to the UK from

417
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
In order to skip and skirt

418
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Public Health measures

419
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Andy require quarantine

420
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,248
Everyone can still go outside their houses out

421
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,528
Just trying to scare people

422
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
And I am positive

423
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:21,184
That you know that is a high figure

424
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
For a lot of people

425
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
But also

426
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,024
I would assume

427
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
Dead people who

428
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Are coming

429
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,888
From these countries are people who are coming in

430
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:30,912
Provocation

431
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Do those countries

432
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,472
Possibly

433
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
People who would be able to afford the quarantine

434
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,824
And I would also assume that

435
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,384
If not that there's probably

436
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,712
At least some sort of a program in place to help people who don't have the memes

437
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
Step forward this to think of Public Safety

438
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,320
It's not that I don't know

439
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,112
Anyway download bulshit

440
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
Alex is lying

441
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
Oh yeah so

442
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
We know that Alex is a violent

443
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Jap

444
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
From all of his words and deeds

445
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Yeah those would be how we identify as regular

446
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
His existence

447
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,568
Encouraging people to be violent his behaviors in all of the stories he tells about a casa

448
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Sing people is oh he's

449
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:11,360
Superhero

450
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
He's not

451
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,224
We're right now

452
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,016
Buy Wii

453
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,296
I mean Alex and his audio

454
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Yes

455
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
We

456
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
Are in a rip

457
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:22,880
Tide

458
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,416
Interview fight

459
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,208
When you're the riptide you're going to drop

460
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
So you can't fight

461
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
I don't know anything about Riptide

462
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,680
No Riptides were part of my girl.

463
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:38,496
Quiet

464
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,848
Yeah there is there's a certain amount of truth to it like if you get taken in an undertow

465
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Or something you will generally end up like

466
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
Just kidding

467
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:53,088
It's not cuz you're just going to stay under and drown

468
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,928
It can't be it can't be very bad.

469
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,232
Been through similar things

470
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
In my younger years

471
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
This metaphor doesn't quite

472
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,632
Quite work the way Alex wanted to

473
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Because when he's sort of saying is like we're going to take some bulbs

474
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
In this Riptides and then will be spit out

475
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
From the riptide and Beyond safety it'll be scary

476
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,360
But you can't fight

477
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Cuz if you fight that's when you're going to drown

478
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,992
But then at the end he also says that people are coming to kill your family

479
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
One of those things

480
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
I knew what to do when it's stuck

481
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
Hit me up

482
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Well

483
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
Let me just tell you

484
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:51,456
Already

485
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
This is not negative

486
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,536
He's going to get so bad within a few years he's going to be totally Blown Away

487
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,728
Mass suicide deaths

488
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
And then

489
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,872
All the college games

490
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Jobs going to have government paycheck

491
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Uniform

492
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
Coming to your house

493
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:31,392
Call Minister coming

494
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
So we shouldn't do any

495
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,816
Okay

496
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Okay

497
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:46,240
Or should I be worried about the armed, he's coming to kill my family would seem important to you

498
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,336
But they're not coming to kill Alex's family so we need to just

499
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
Sit tight and we'll get through this

500
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,808
T-Rex can't see you in the movie is going to sit still and relax

501
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Spaghett see you

502
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
I just can't

503
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
What do you also have to have blue ribbons

504
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
Why does it always go to be every time there's a new email

505
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:16,192
I was there I did all of the stuff the best of everything at 3 today

506
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
Close enough to like

507
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
I could believe that I don't have any problem with that I just have a problem with this is yet another in the long list

508
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,480
Things Veritas is up

509
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,344
I want that title for most specialist.

510
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
My buddy

511
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,232
Yeah so that that's an incoherent message that he sending his audience there because

512
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
At the end of it I

513
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,864
Feel like you'd negated a lot of the ideas that you'd want to be

514
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,936
What do you tell people you're in a Riptide relax

515
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
We're going to get out the other side of this

516
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,032
And I feel like you

517
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,568
He's telling you to fight that ripped

518
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:55,360
No no no see cuz he

519
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
He said Relax

520
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,920
First yeah it's it's

521
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,528
These Clauses are dependent on each other so first

522
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,576
Get the riptide and then die

523
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,136
What do you know about Pablo Escobar

524
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,696
Not

525
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Good you're not watching narcos

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
I did not watch

527
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
My calendar.

528
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,376
I think he was at at elephants I know that was in the movie Blow

529
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,448
I just figured as a character in the movie Blow

530
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:24,032
All-time great mustache

531
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
Pee-wee Herman with Elsa

532
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,688
All-time great Moustache by the way

533
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,992
I learned

534
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,832
This is not only did he have elephants he also had hippos

535
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Yes Alex

536
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,952
Cuz I'm very long

537
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
Ramble about the dangers of Hippo he was voted best hippo in high school

538
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,520
So Pablo Escobar had these hippos

539
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:59,104
And they got breno now they've bred and now hippos

540
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
I heard somewhere where they should

541
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
Weather now

542
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,736
Speed sensor now people want to call them

543
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:08,320
This leaves Alex to saying that there may be some good arguments

544
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,880
Perfume I'm calling

545
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
And I'd like to remind you he is a noted eugenics

546
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
Dislike her this guy allergy

547
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Theoretically

548
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:21,376
Pablo Escobar in South America. What was it for hippos

549
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
Something like 40 years ago

550
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
Thousands hippos run around

551
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
Grizzly bear

552
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,464
20 ft crocodile

553
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,096
Throwing around

554
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Pablo live

555
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Now they want to call

556
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
Hippopotamuses

557
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,880
Don't come from there

558
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,232
I don't need to be called

559
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,400
You noticed you're telling people this and they don't care

560
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,960
That's because they're not conscious they're just eating food

561
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:35,872
Bad and they're breeding lead to get rid of

562
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Donation

563
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,736
Stop playing God is evil

564
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
That's the problem

565
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,184
God

566
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,584
Real document

567
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,680
Artificial intelligence Singularity Godlike

568
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
2

569
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,360
Dissension

570
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,736
I just find it really interesting whenever Alex has these like hypothetical

571
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,784
Go conversations of globalist

572
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:24,000
The dog listen listen I'm not saying it's a bad idea it's very weird

573
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Practice it can go wrong

574
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:28,864
Yeah I would say that if you're branding is the such

575
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,888
But at that Alec

576
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
Puts forth

577
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
Should never

578
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Say that there's a

579
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
There's an argument to be made

580
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,544
Dumb people that's not a race

581
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,176
It's never been used in a way that's not racist

582
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:48,832
There's a track record of some people may be using this for their own race

583
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
Hey Alex

584
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,928
You know how you see some people is dumb

585
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
Is Ezekiel

586
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
That's it's playing God because

587
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Is God had already done the Noah thing

588
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,704
I don't know baby

589
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,008
So is it so he's almost a little mad at God

590
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:11,360
I was like what are you doing you should have just gotten rid of the dumb one bright we could have had plenty of fun

591
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:17,760
Yeah, let the Dum Dums on the boat then you put all those goddamn hippos on the boat they're everywhere

592
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Classic

593
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Mustang

594
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,112
So Alex is not afraid

595
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
He's a strong strong boy

596
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,280
Was only slightly afraid of Riptides

597
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
Who's afraid of

598
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,608
His former employees probably

599
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,168
How I'm doing

600
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Have no fear

601
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,800
I know I'm way past everything I'm not worried

602
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,104
I love my family but I just had turned over to God

603
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
Rodger said hey it's okay

604
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,296
I'm not mad at God I appreciate it

605
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
Future anyways

606
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Can you watch

607
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
That first lawyer that got up

608
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Gravel

609
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,216
Pulled over and pissed all over itself

610
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
You're so powerful Schumer I love you sir you're so much better than us great job with your presentation on trunk

611
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:19,456
Because there's not men in this country

612
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
What about you

613
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,952
You talked about the dimensions in chess

614
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:31,488
Quite a bit

615
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,608
F****** pretend yeah that transition was as jarring as it seemed in the foot

616
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:43,008
Yeah it felt a little weird

617
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,544
Happy's lawyers being soft

618
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Right right

619
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,224
Universally agreed that cancer did a real s*** job

620
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,248
Great lawyers

621
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
This is a little bit like

622
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,344
Touch N Go

623
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,368
On the

624
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,720
Material yells about the lawyer being weak a little bit

625
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,768
Doesn't spend too much time

626
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:11,168
Talking about it yeah I kind of halfway assume that today we will be talking about a secret migrant Caravan and they wouldn't

627
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Even though the appeal

628
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,568
Dancing around a little bit shoes to the impeachment like

629
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,664
The fact the Democrats all have Chinese spy handlers

630
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,736
In their office that sounds right no not only that

631
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
They all have

632
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
Handlers

633
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
Nobody knows

634
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
The name

635
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,160
Of the Chinese

636
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:33,952
Spy agency is called

637
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,280
Chinese spice

638
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,656
Intelligent no secret the name of Chinese intelligence

639
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
He's not even know

640
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
What is it

641
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
And you all know its name

642
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:54,176
What is everything in Plainview

643
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,480
Like what

644
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,904
Is the red white and blue

645
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
China is the Red Dragon

646
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
A what

647
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,304
What's the name of the

648
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
Diablo

649
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,472
The devil

650
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,848
Don't talk about some positive news

651
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,040
We're just doing word association game

652
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,856
But the real kicker is he over B the devil

653
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,416
Especially the the ministry of State security

654
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
The dollop

655
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,888
Diablo couldn't come up with old scratch their I think he's probably pretty pissed in the moment

656
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,728
Come on man scratches way better

657
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Anyway

658
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,800
Alex is thinking about the devil

659
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:53,824
And so

660
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
This clip is actually just titled

661
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,176
This show is stupid

662
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
You got the whole blueprint folks

663
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
Global enslavement at the blueprint for Global extermination

664
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:16,096
Malaysian Daniel

665
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,168
You decide

666
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
But you don't want to be part of its decision

667
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
You cut yourself off from Satan

668
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,456
You got to let me in

669
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
What you got

670
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
Steal your will to steal

671
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Irritability

672
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
God

673
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
And your free will

674
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:57,824
Touch that Satan's all about

675
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
Animatrix

676
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:04,480
So he can fool your soul the only way you can win because he's not a god

677
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
He's a fraud

678
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
Wake Tammy wins liar

679
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,792
KT impact filter yellow that the devil is a devil

680
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,608
I can actually come with a more upwards

681
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:21,888
Inflection that passion

682
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
Seems so fake

683
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,960
Tumi

684
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Just so boring

685
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,776
Cookie

686
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
Declutter

687
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
1 things are exciting maybe another bright spot is a cat has jumped into my lap and is insisting on being very

688
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Affectionate right now

689
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
A few

690
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,880
Little guest appearance there on the bike

691
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,560
I guess she probably going to swing in probably heard some devil talk

692
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:57,728
So actually she was trying to delay the inevitable and that is that I need to tell you about a couple gas

693
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
We have on the show

694
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,312
They just got kicked off Twitter

695
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,360
Jim

696
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Jim's brother hop

697
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
I can't remember

698
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Brothers Pizza

699
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
Maybe something like that

700
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
Yeah they're the brothers

701
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,672
Coffee Brothers Hawk

702
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
The Gateway pundit

703
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
The dude that got kicked off Twitter

704
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,768
And so they come on to complain

705
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,048
About that

706
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
And I don't

707
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
We don't want to listen

708
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:30,752
No not really but no

709
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,848
Jim hoft his main point seems to be that

710
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
This isn't the cult of personality about

711
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,224
Okay you know we're not going to have another candidate like that

712
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
For a while

713
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
Wake up

714
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
And I think it's also imperative

715
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,352
Populist candidates in the next

716
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Primary

717
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,680
Are we have to get rid of some of this deadweight

718
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
Looking party if you don't want to sound crazy

719
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,056
I would recommend you not say

720
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,872
Whether or not a candidate in a future election is

721
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,432
Pro the president who is no longer in office

722
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,064
I would say he's a real designation of a crazy person

723
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,464
Personality Dan I just want everyone to agree that a single person is the greatest Hume

724
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
Human being that ever lived and we should do whatever he says

725
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Yeah

726
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,608
If you were running a Democratic candidate

727
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,936
And they were like this is the pro-obama candidate

728
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
And I would look at that

729
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Also as weird

730
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,776
If you're very weird

731
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Variable

732
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:42,176
So Alex is going to be talking about how like a note

733
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,224
They've stolen the election

734
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,552
And then we know that

735
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
They've stolen the election

736
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
What makes us

737
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
Not vote

738
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,648
And that makes it

739
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Easier for them to steal

740
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,976
Is it goes out to break with something

741
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
Really upsetting

742
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,304
Blue States the most City people get

743
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
It makes it easier for them to cover up

744
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:12,640
I was talked about

745
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
Basalt

746
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,064
We'll get to that in a second

747
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Is it

748
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,904
Cartridge box

749
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
So you heard that the end

750
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
You can't hide

751
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
Assault

752
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
Alex's commercial here

753
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Is a little while

754
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm now back to listening

755
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,240
Started off great I'm listening to this episode on the DC entry

756
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:42,336
This is a commercial that would have been played out on the radio

757
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,384
And I will tell you it is a very

758
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Different tone

759
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,504
Then the commercials reads that we've heard Alex gear

760
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Oh no reason episodes

761
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:55,648
The little bit it's a little bit more f***** up it also sounds like he's jacking it

762
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
Okay

763
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:05,120
Good listener discretion advised he sounds we maybe to Banning by proxy

764
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:12,800
A grand assault America is about to have a Synergy cut off its borders

765
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:19,200
Is dollar

766
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:24,064
Are you on the right team that you are

767
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,672
All of you who are awake at and love

768
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,304
Oblivion fear the enemy is about to expose itself

769
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
Enemy comes to kill steal and destroy

770
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:49,920
We should but once it comes through

771
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:55,552
Dominating us and raping us attacking us

772
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,440
America

773
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,536
This is the truth of this just the infowar

774
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
Wow

775
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
Quite a bumper

776
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:16,032
Hey Alex it sounds like your voice is a little bit scratchy l a t that usually have

777
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,896
Promos today entire pack of cigarettes

778
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,224
I'm a 3/4 drunk

779
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Objecting off

780
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
Papa Haydn

781
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:30,112
From my wife recorded under a blanket

782
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,696
Cell phone flashlight

783
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,352
It's supposed to be like a billion-dollar operation

784
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,936
I think I think one of the things that's going on is I think he's probably f***** up

785
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:49,568
But it is also like trying to really do that movie

786
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Yeah

787
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Because I

788
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,479
I think this is tailored more towards

789
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
A possibly random person

790
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
They could be listening on the radio

791
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,391
Peak their interest

792
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
What is this

793
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
This is exciting

794
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:12,351
Like he missed the mark though I need to know more

795
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,167
You compare that to the meanderings random

796
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,983
B******* it's on me like actual forward speed

797
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,031
Rubinos attacks targeting his audio

798
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Yeah it's

799
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
It's pretty clear I just think that the

800
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
It's really funny

801
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:30,271
This is what he thinks goes to that like wife messed

802
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,295
Yeah yeah

803
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:38,719
It's remarkable it is it is you know I like to imagine that you know I'm not if I fail

804
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:40,767
Held in a different Arena I would be aware of it

805
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
I wouldn't just be like

806
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,119
Yeah I killed it I can do literally anyting

807
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Wow hits

808
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
Done who gives it

809
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Yeah right

810
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,543
So this is a good strategy for Alex a try and get new listeners in

811
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,079
Just do these

812
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:57,407
Creepy jack off commercials about the end of America

813
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
Alex this sounds

814
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,479
I only do what

815
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,551
You're not paying me for two

816
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
Good strategy

817
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,415
Another good strategy might be Paul

818
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Paul Joseph Watson

819
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,487
My oldest friend

820
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:15,071
Promote my s*** maybe I'm not mad

821
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
About it

822
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
Please remember

823
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Everything the enemy.

824
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
Infowars.com newswars.com

825
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Call zaida summat.

826
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,199
Not mad about it

827
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:36,319
What is in it for Paul to promoted 40 reason

828
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:41,951
It's really in his best interest to play Down sorry connector

829
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,255
Nothing else that he can get out of it

830
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,791
Other than like

831
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Not making Alex

832
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:51,423
Mad that's the only thing that he has to worry about he's gotten

833
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
As much publicity as

834
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
Could come out of Infowars

835
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,591
That's why the band on the Titanic

836
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
Cat playing is cuz they didn't want the captain

837
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:05,247
To be angry well I guess this is where we die I don't want to piss that guy off

838
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,527
Yeah

839
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,391
It only hurts Paul to remind people that he worked at Infowars for 20 years

840
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,743
If I were him I would do the exact same thing

841
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
So Alex is mad about Trump's lawyer being

842
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
For the most part I mean incompetent

843
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,447
Two more mad that he

844
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
He's polite

845
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,519
About his presentation

846
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,799
Therein

847
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,359
The chamber's obsequious

848
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
Sure

849
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:40,063
Decorum that comes along with extreme directional speak

850
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,623
Edit all set with literally just storm

851
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:47,743
Do you refer to people as the the gentleman or the lady from New Hampshire whatever the f***

852
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,535
Alex is mad about the

853
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:53,887
Swell

854
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,935
Stitches show you with enemies

855
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,663
A white male.

856
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:10,015
So you look at just this this this foppish

857
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Meaning

858
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,719
Just classic BS artist lawyer in there ingratiate himself

859
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,559
Groveling Chucky shimmering all Shimmer takes out his weakness

860
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,863
Congratulate

861
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:28,959
You later if you do it

862
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,591
He's just mad out of analysis

863
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
At all

864
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:40,735
Big thing that he's mad about in terms of the conversation that happened

865
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
Throughout the beach

866
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
And stuff is that

867
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Did defense

868
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,159
Is not arguing

869
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
Did Trump win the election

870
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:53,023
They're taking as granted that Biden won

871
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
And Alex is pretty mad about that

872
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,863
Because

873
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:01,471
That's the only thing you could really get people like

874
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Distracted

875
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
That's

876
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Stupid arguments

877
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,895
That you can't but the reason they're not doing that is cuz that doesn't belong in court that belongs on

878
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Infowars

879
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
Media Outlet

880
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:15,039
He's a little bit upset that that worldism

881
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,831
I'm being like taken over by his

882
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Right his s*** right

883
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,391
I mean it is

884
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,415
Maybe

885
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,695
Maybe it's their best

886
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:26,559
Honestly after after looking at the the opening arguments

887
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
Maybe their best defense would be like

888
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
We're putting this

889
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Whole thing on trial

890
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Actually

891
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,727
Trump is president

892
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:38,079
Find that everybody did this in your doll the one who should be impeached

893
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
If you want a gum up the works

894
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Can possibly create new problems for yourself

895
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,527
I think casters already gone far enough he might as well

896
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,063
Jump off the edge

897
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
Edmund is a

898
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,951
If you want to be interesting yeah probably that's the way to go

899
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,999
It would be a disgrace

900
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
It wouldn't work

901
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Probably not

902
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,375
Has gotten a little bit used to the last

903
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
In 04 years

904
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,447
5 years is like politics

905
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Descending

906
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
To his level

907
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,799
Concrete instance of

908
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Not

909
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,871
And that probably be pretty frustrating

910
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:14,431
And then at the same time you have a funeral Biden

911
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,967
Comment so if you know Alexa

912
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:18,527
The Senate has an important role to play in

913
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
To do their job

914
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,575
Stay above the

915
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:21,855
The Fray and trying to

916
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Keep himself

917
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:25,951
Yeah it removed from the processor

918
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,487
And that's got to really piss off

919
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
I would imagine

920
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Sup

921
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,911
So you got the only thing that he knows how to do and that is

922
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
Talk to Akinator

923
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,495
He has a comedian

924
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:45,151
Let's see if you know who this guy is

925
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,199
I have heard

926
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
I've heard the name

927
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,551
It's funny cuz I'm banned. Video

928
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
The segment that he's on

929
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,159
I believe we're first team is atopica Media

930
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
That's not good

931
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Usually means they're not

932
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Apparently Jose

933
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,327
Co-host

934
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
With Anthony cumia

935
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,167
Anthony cumias new show

936
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:15,871
I'm shocked that I didn't get a call the co-host on that one too for that

937
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
Are you comparing me to Anthony cumia

938
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
Cuz you better not forget

939
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:21,503
I don't think that is

940
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,623
Dave Landau is on

941
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:29,183
And tries to make a few jokes

942
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:34,559
Alex is not a good scene partner As We Know

943
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,911
I only have one clip here cuz I don't care about what Dave Landau has

944
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:45,311
What to say about cancel culture I do particularly care about his perspective on

945
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Impeachment cuz

946
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:51,199
It's not that interesting

947
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
You f****** co-host

948
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
Show with Anthony cumia

949
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
I got to go

950
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:59,647
I have very little interest in what anyway comedian has to say about

951
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:04,767
Cancel culture Strike 10 show that you're on Infowars

952
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
Strike three

953
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
You said this on Infowars

954
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,239
It's not even so much taking that big of a stand it's just telling people not to be completely blind

955
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
The only

956
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,383
Thing that most people are really saying is that this is going to end in some kind of bloody Civil War

957
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,943
And whether it's starting to look I can see that

958
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
I can see their point

959
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Just think if people just

960
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
Down and stop

961
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,599
Turning on mainstream media

962
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:32,415
Which I just can't imagine what it's like to sit in your house

963
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,975
Sheritha television

964
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
Fear I'm sending you

965
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:40,095
Yeah totally unlike the show you're on

966
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
Terrifying

967
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,167
Kind of monster would

968
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,447
Force people to watch

969
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,543
Search for straight hours of fear-mongering

970
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
I feel like you really

971
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,151
I look like a like a real ding-dong

972
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:59,551
When you say something like that on Infowars because that either means that you accepted a booking on a

973
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
Platform asthma

974
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,135
And notorious as Infowars about having

975
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Do diligence

976
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,463
About the place you're on

977
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,535
Or somehow you don't see what Alex does as

978
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:15,167
Rank fear-mongering

979
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,775
It's really simple what he's doing he's just asking people not to be blind

980
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:23,103
And that's all he's doing mainstream media that's pumping

981
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,919
Fear into your blood all the time by reporting

982
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
News

983
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:33,855
I would think that anybody who works or any kind of mainstream media Outlet if they behaved in any kind of way

984
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Close to like with Alex.

985
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
They might be in jail

986
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Would be sued

987
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,839
Over and over and over they be fired

988
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
It's just it

989
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
Before they would be Brett's

990
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
That's also a possibility

991
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:53,567
That leads me to believe that maybe this Dave Lent

992
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:59,455
Guy is not incredibly sincere maybe a little bit disingenuous with his

993
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,271
So

994
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:04,063
The temperature was

995
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,599
Do Brothers Hospital

996
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,367
Yep

997
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,647
Weird comedian yep

998
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,231
Surface-level fairly certain that one of the big deals of

999
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
Stuff is happening right

1000
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
On the 10th

1001
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
You mean impeached

1002
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Yeah

1003
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:20,447
He have a lot of that stuff

1004
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,519
Hearings on the 10th we're happening after Alex

1005
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
It was on it

1006
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,823
Metro that's true

1007
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,407
Some of the stuff he had he didn't have any way of knowing

1008
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
Got until the next day the 11

1009
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Anthony's on air

1010
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,551
That is still the little service

1011
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Live Oak

1012
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
These nut

1013
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
It's October

1014
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Nearly as much

1015
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
I mean because

1016
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,719
From Alex's for sale

1017
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,999
Perspective that makes sense

1018
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:47,071
The election was stolen according to

1019
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,631
This is all b******* it's all imaginary

1020
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,471
Engage with the substance of the thing if the thing

1021
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:59,103
That kind of seems to be where he's at spleen to me how

1022
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,503
Alex seems to have a more cogent position on what he imagines is imaginary and how much we should talk about it then

1023
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
The rest of us

1024
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
I won't

1025
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,183
So are you starts off on the 11th talking about Bill Gates

1026
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,463
Cuz of course

1027
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,535
This is the most important news of the

1028
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,583
1 *

1029
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,911
It is official

1030
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,983
TED Talks

1031
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:30,335
Call for on.cnn 3 clips of it the last few years

1032
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Falling

1033
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
4

1034
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:40,319
The euthanasia of old people because we quote can't pay for the Aging population

1035
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,391
In Europe the United States Australia

1036
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,607
You can hire 10 teachers and that's not

1037
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
And you fish for a life.

1038
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,263
The moral thing to do

1039
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Everyday

1040
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
Nursing home

1041
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,135
Where is the employees notice all of the death

1042
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:16,927
Say something

1043
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,535
Mostly places know to keep it quiet send it out of something else but

1044
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,399
The cdc's on website

1045
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,775
Some of them died within 15

1046
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,799
Minutes

1047
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:39,199
Carlos is claiming that someone died 15 minutes after getting covid-19 vaccine and then be presented that as evidence of the to work

1048
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:39,967
Causally connected

1049
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
That's the level of work he does

1050
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,319
He just dissociates two things and insist

1051
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:47,903
That you had been proven that they're connected when he's done no such thing

1052
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:54,303
Alex good legit show me a news story about someone dying as they're getting vaccinated and it still doesn't prove the claim

1053
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,095
The vaccines related to that person's

1054
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,655
There's an unfortunate reality here

1055
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:03,519
That is that Alex either doesn't understand that Dynamic of reality

1056
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,615
Or he understand all too well how easy it is to trick people into thinking

1057
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
The correlation proves causation

1058
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,735
I think the latter is probably more likely

1059
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:17,087
I also killing all people who could hire teachers

1060
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,743
It's easy to misconstrue his words that way but the conversation he was having it out so it takes out of content or context is about

1061
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Exorbitant

1062
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,535
Medical cost

1063
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,583
And that what can be done about that

1064
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,167
Literally most of the world is

1065
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,239
Dealing with right now as population

1066
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,567
Explodes like it's not unique to anywhere it's like

1067
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Oh s***

1068
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
What are we going to do

1069
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:42,175
Does f****** baby boomers wrecked

1070
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
It's

1071
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,295
It's easy to look at that conversation to Bill Gates

1072
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,599
Public forums

1073
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,647
As being like well

1074
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,927
Mathematically if we just

1075
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
Kill all the old people we can

1076
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
Tyrell

1077
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,071
It's not it's not the conversation

1078
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,911
That would be officious argument that I would make it a

1079
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,447
Debate where somebody's like

1080
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,751
Oh well old people are trying to be like

1081
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:11,615
Kill all of the old people that you could sarcastically make that argument against

1082
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,895
Alex and win

1083
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,735
Totally he is he's got a lot of nothing

1084
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Actually that's a really good idea

1085
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Alex is now more mad

1086
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
Are Trump's lawyers

1087
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
This isn't 10

1088
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647
Don't fuc

1089
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:27,231
I can set them up

1090
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,279
Lawyers that

1091
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,375
Trump hired bad

1092
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,983
I'm only for shooting Or democrats

1093
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:44,383
Sabotaging him publicly

1094
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
By the way

1095
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
When that lawyer was saying

1096
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
Get the s*** thrown out

1097
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:04,095
How do you say another president

1098
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:09,471
It seems like a process has worked problems like corrupt

1099
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:16,127
Dictator historically you have an election

1100
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,175
McKay's

1101
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Is

1102
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,223
Maybe

1103
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,015
A decent argument to try

1104
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:28,415
If we didn't have any precedent for it if this was the first time if this was like

1105
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
1810

1106
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
We were having one of these

1107
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
And people were having that are going to be like

1108
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
I don't know

1109
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,375
Who ever tried this before

1110
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,935
Baby gunshot this is about the

1111
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Does January

1112
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
This is about the storm and

1113
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:47,615
A capital is about that from time to time

1114
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
Because I'm

1115
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:50,175
Nefarious s*** heads

1116
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,455
BMX stuff up and

1117
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
Whatever

1118
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,039
That was not

1119
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
That happening

1120
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
Because

1121
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
Provocateurs

1122
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Did it to make

1123
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:05,535
Alex look bad because people who are in the same communities outdoor Pier to be

1124
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Are being violent

1125
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,119
Right now at the same time

1126
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,655
Violence is cool too

1127
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:16,799
We are well past the point of being able to use violence against these institutions organization

1128
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,271
A few hundred to go in the capitol

1129
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,319
Insurrectionist Terrace

1130
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:31,903
Okay

1131
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,719
Coherent messaging

1132
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,023
No I think that one is actually really coherent

1133
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,863
We should absolutely storm the capital this was bad planet

1134
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,399
They tricked us

1135
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
Into not storming the capital

1136
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,055
On the 20th when we would have all been able to actually kill everybody Maybe

1137
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,847
I think he's essentially saying that it

1138
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,663
It wasn't the right time to fire the shot heard round the world

1139
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:59,295
Yeah yeah I guess so but the reason it's incoherent is cuz I don't think he wants to take

1140
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,343
Responsibility for that

1141
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Cut

1142
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
Dry message

1143
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,183
That's why I think

1144
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,999
Is the what's behind

1145
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:12,607
Violence is obviously Justified but this was this was a misstep

1146
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:19,007
Yeah I know that's why I blame it on agitators him provocateurs tricked us into shooting before we were ready

1147
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,567
So in that case

1148
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,847
I'm pretty sure he

1149
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,151
He said that will ya previously we wanted

1150
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,943
Play the kill everybody and overthrow the country

1151
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,271
We just wanted to do it at the right time so we would win

1152
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,343
Spell course I mean Alex even gets into his blood loss

1153
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,159
Halfway decent mood today

1154
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,007
Physically

1155
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:54,079
Nauseous

1156
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,615
Because my

1157
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,663
Nervous system was telling me

1158
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,711
You need

1159
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
To go

1160
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,039
Visit violence upon the people that are doing this

1161
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,671
And kill babies are newborn and they admit they're doing it

1162
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,487
You are an accomplished my very cells are

1163
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,911
They're mad at me because

1164
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Offensive

1165
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
I understand your gut

1166
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
And your blood and your soul

1167
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,823
When your mind is burning

1168
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
With the desire to kill

1169
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Pull up

1170
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,503
Stop these people just as much as you do

1171
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,343
We've got to be wise as serpents and peaceful of doves

1172
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
I don't think you pulled it off

1173
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,191
I'm going to end with two cliches because I realized that I just basically told everybody that it's fine to kill

1174
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,983
And that I want to to

1175
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,567
So you got to walk softly and carry a big

1176
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:01,919
I feel like Alex might not be lying about reading Infowars,

1177
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:06,015
That's cuz that sounds like in responding to a lot of feedback of people who are like

1178
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,343
Alex your soft let's just go Kellen let's just go Kelly

1179
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,111
I think that our

1180
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,951
That's Alex trying to like have an olive branch to the

1181
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,999
After murderous audience

1182
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,607
And also do you know who else anthropomorphize has their murderous intentions

1183
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,655
Serial killers

1184
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,959
Lucky wants to kill

1185
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:27,263
And you understand that the audience wants

1186
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,055
Skill and they're connected on this

1187
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,335
Feel like there's a problem

1188
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,615
There you got to be

1189
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
Why is it a serpent

1190
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,479
Vista problems

1191
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,807
It doesn't get better

1192
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,623
The last

1193
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
Twitter

1194
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Dorsey

1195
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,607
You know what you're doing and you were just as guilty as Bill Gates

1196
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,679
Mark Zuckerberg

1197
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,703
He's the next.

1198
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
Eonline

1199
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:06,943
You guys are mass-murdering killers and I Know Who You Are by knows who you are and you will

1200
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,991
What you've done murderers

1201
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,807
I don't care what you do to me

1202
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,367
You are you you are guilty

1203
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
Military

1204
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,471
The diversionary tactic to wipe them out for the Chinese

1205
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:33,567
Have the Civil War

1206
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,735
Civil War we want a removal of the globalist

1207
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
Collaborators

1208
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:49,951
The number of people that we want to do that remove these people that I

1209
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:54,815
Read it out for you from murder and I am specifically

1210
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,423
Violence and everything is okay because they're murderers and we're well past

1211
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:05,567
What's the point of being able to write Teresa

1212
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,359
But would be good planning

1213
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
He's clearly implying what would be

1214
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:10,943
Be good

1215
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:17,087
What are you guys doing stormy the capital with only a few hundred people you can't win what you should be doing

1216
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,135
Targeted assassinations

1217
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:24,511
It's unfortunate because one of the people that's on Alex's list

1218
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,535
Alex Cox

1219
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
Italy calls him Jeff Zuckerberg

1220
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,655
Zuckerberg

1221
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,935
He's because I like

1222
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:38,335
Can't remember dude now man he wields too much power it is too dumb to handle it

1223
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:41,663
Responsible and I think you could make a pretty good argument that

1224
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,223
You know using Shifty language Alex's

1225
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,527
Is probably telling his audience that

1226
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,319
Should maybe kill my

1227
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,159
I think one of the things about the evidence in the Imp

1228
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,951
Sprint trial that I've noticed was

1229
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:58,303
How many times did they did a really good job of avoiding allowing that

1230
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
Kind of

1231
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
Claws

1232
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
To like

1233
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,911
Excuse any Behavior

1234
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,191
So often they had

1235
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
They played Trump's words

1236
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
And you're you're literally like

1237
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Yeah

1238
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
We all know he said

1239
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:15,199
Peacefully protest peacefully and then they're like

1240
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:18,783
Yeah but we've got 300 examples of him saying otherwise

1241
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,111
So you can't pull that b******* this is a pattern behavior

1242
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,951
Alex Jones is essentially on trial in the same way

1243
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,047
Where are we are showing in some ways is a

1244
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
Rigorous

1245
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:37,983
Completely without legal backing

1246
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,591
Specific

1247
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,359
Crime yet

1248
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,127
Right

1249
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,943
It's just the behavior that would lead to that

1250
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
God people

1251
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,271
I have not carried out

1252
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,295
His

1253
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
Cleared man yeah

1254
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,671
He's mad about this trial because these

1255
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,207
These these lawyers

1256
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:58,975
Arthro

1257
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,791
Another at?

1258
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
I don't know or are they just shitted everybody knows he's lawyers

1259
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
Lawyers

1260
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
They are sabotaging

1261
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,991
You got a great job and you prove

1262
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
Because it's a bunch of cowards

1263
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
What was their making their move

1264
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:34,559
All these so-called men are bunch of pinstripe wearing knuckle-dragging

1265
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,095
Dirty stupid

1266
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:40,191
Through this country over a vagina

1267
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,799
Lawyers

1268
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:45,823
Bio weapons

1269
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,895
Globalist

1270
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:59,391
They hate themselves and their going down Hollywood

1271
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,303
Run by the same slave master Satan

1272
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
Cool

1273
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,119
How's it going to

1274
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,655
Explain it when Trump

1275
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Gets acquitted

1276
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:18,847
It really is going to be difficult to explain for a lot of people Beyond saying

1277
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:25,503
These guys were just going to quit no matter what if Trump gets acquitted then why

1278
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,807
How are you going to rationalize

1279
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:33,439
His lawyers are in on it they're throwing it they wouldn't have it a trial if it wasn't rigged

1280
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
That's rigged

1281
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,255
Acquit

1282
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,791
F*** are you talking about

1283
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
Makes no sense in your rambling

1284
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,887
You can tell the real dead giveaway

1285
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,167
But he's probably just

1286
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
F****** coked out of his mind and rambling about nothing

1287
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
If you get to the Satan at the end

1288
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
I'll tell you what

1289
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
That's a real

1290
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,271
4 in the morning Hardy I want to leave in the puppet

1291
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,807
Anyway

1292
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,367
Alex gets to talk about these vaccines

1293
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:08,767
Thousands dead already from covid-19 vaccine feel like I would have heard it if there were

1294
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:13,631
That's smart

1295
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,911
Second is the

1296
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,495
If Alex believes that then he has to believe that there's

1297
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,335
About as many deaths from the vaccine is there is from covid

1298
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,871
That's outrageous

1299
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Guesstimate

1300
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,455
1 out of 10 conservatively

1301
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,271
Smurf reactions gets reported

1302
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
Moana.

1303
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,343
Probably really

1304
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,903
How many times do you take a reaction

1305
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,207
Can you call the CDC

1306
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:44,863
Thousands of dead people so far

1307
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,911
HomeAdvisor mRNA vaccine

1308
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,727
Europe us

1309
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
I think viseart

1310
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Suing

1311
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,567
I think so too yeah

1312
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:59,199
Also either making up numbers or the beginning that are you don't call the CDC your doctor

1313
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,503
CDC to report adverse

1314
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,039
Yeah that's why you go to the doctor

1315
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,367
Adverse reaction to something you will go see treatment

1316
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,183
And then they will

1317
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:12,255
Job really inefficient system

1318
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,535
Divorce everyone to be like

1319
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
Bring bring hello CDC

1320
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:20,191
What frustrates me a lot about Alex's narratives regarding this type of stuff is that

1321
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,495
Yeah man people have already thought of those

1322
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,263
Problems

1323
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
They happened

1324
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,847
A long time ago and people were like oh let's not

1325
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,615
Do that

1326
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,175
Like the reason we have the reporting system

1327
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,711
Is precisely because

1328
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,015
You wouldn't call the CDC

1329
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
Yeah you wouldn't do that

1330
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:39,135
You're the doctor does it for you

1331
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,975
Ubering to get to Alex maybe having a kernel of Truth although he still making

1332
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,743
Stuff up

1333
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,535
Is that like if you have a headache

1334
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,143
That could be considered an adverse reaction and you might not report that

1335
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:56,543
Be something so trivial that you don't seek help with it and you might not even know if it's related right so yeah

1336
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,847
Maybe one in ten if you count like

1337
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,431
Minor nonsense that maybe you maybe my back

1338
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Back hurts

1339
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:07,039
Slight dizziness is often a

1340
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
2

1341
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
Britney saying is just a load of

1342
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,183
I honestly think that some of the

1343
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
All the stuff that he saying

1344
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
Has a real potential

1345
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
For Public Health

1346
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,559
Problem

1347
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
Holy

1348
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,655
Micro

1349
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:28,287
When you come across a covid virus the most common in the world Coronavirus

1350
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
In the future

1351
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,407
Most people will have a violent autoimmune reaction

1352
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
And they're going to call

1353
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,015
2022

1354
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,695
Everybody dying

1355
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
Oh by the way

1356
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,655
Both these old people that died they said an already tested positive for covid

1357
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
Elsa said

1358
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:08,735
Virus or Coronavirus

1359
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:14,623
Or later it'll cause autoimmune response when you come in contact with

1360
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:31,519
Never going to get away with this never there crazy

1361
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:35,871
Kill everybody yeah that's

1362
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,431
That's deeply deeply irresponsible

1363
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:39,967
Yeah this is

1364
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
This is

1365
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
F***

1366
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,295
Yeah like this is

1367
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,855
The level of thinking that this is is

1368
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,927
Which level like this is like a pure

1369
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:50,463
We've never advance

1370
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,743
It's beyond thinking that the

1371
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
The person with

1372
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
Two cats is actually behind illness

1373
01:09:55,327 --> 01:10:01,471
Yep that's where we're at

1374
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:07,871
Vaccine for a brand new virus in less than a year

1375
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,711
People are like nananana see if you're physically unattractive

1376
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,015
Chances are you're the one killing everybody

1377
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:19,391
Yeah I know I read I read a little bit about some of the folks who have died

1378
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
After getting the vaccine

1379
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,743
And some of them did test positive for covid

1380
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:28,095
And with the belief that their peoples were writing about this had

1381
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
Where they at

1382
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,167
They had gotten the vaccine

1383
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:35,007
When they'd already been infected in the incubation.

1384
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,567
Vaccine wouldn't be effective right

1385
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,103
At that point it's too late

1386
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,127
Yeah

1387
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:43,199
You're talking about high-risk communities

1388
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
And

1389
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,503
People who are prioritize

1390
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
We're getting the vaccine

1391
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,087
You know that doesn't

1392
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,391
Number either

1393
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,695
Like it's it's not in the thousands like Alex

1394
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Nothing but

1395
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,535
But either way like this this kind of misinformation

1396
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,375
Persuade people

1397
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,399
To have

1398
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,959
Either a belief or an inclination

1399
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,495
To not disbelieve

1400
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,287
This shot is a Datsun

1401
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:10,847
And I can be really really Danger

1402
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
Yeah it's hard even to imagine like

1403
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,479
Okay it's not the best

1404
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
Vaccine

1405
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
And it does have some by adverse reaction

1406
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
But

1407
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,367
It's going to save

1408
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,159
A Million Lives

1409
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,743
You know like like that kind of level of thing

1410
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,535
Where it's like yeah that's

1411
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Worth

1412
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,119
Half a million people are dead

1413
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:37,471
Strawman s*** all the time of life

1414
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,519
Everybody pretends the vaccines are towed

1415
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,799
Totally safe

1416
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:42,591
There's never been a bad wreck

1417
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
No no one says that

1418
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,711
That's a fake argument that you're making an order to

1419
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
22 strawman

1420
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Yep

1421
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Oh yeah yeah

1422
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
It's just

1423
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,623
It's childish and I wish these people

1424
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,671
Would treat him

1425
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
And he's arguing

1426
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
With the

1427
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
Distain but they deserve

1428
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,559
Two talking about

1429
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
Bitcoin

1430
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Of course

1431
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,143
Yes of course

1432
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,423
Because Elon Musk

1433
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,239
It was just on Rogan apparently again

1434
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,799
And maybe he is into Bitcoin now

1435
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:17,663
He also has a guy named B boy on as a gaslighter

1436
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,455
How about motherfuking bad boy

1437
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,503
The Weeknd

1438
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
You want to laugh

1439
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,831
But you can't

1440
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,671
That was that look over I can't laugh at this

1441
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,743
What's wrong

1442
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,023
Dan I'm well past

1443
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
The point of righteous viola

1444
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,839
That was going through my head

1445
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:41,727
How do I just got his just a YouTuber whose into Bitcoin into currencies is interview

1446
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
Not interesting

1447
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,543
I'm surprised YouTubers are always fast

1448
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,591
He actually has some interesting things

1449
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,663
Get any sense of like

1450
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,479
And I'm being a big at but I don't know

1451
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,527
He just was talking about

1452
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
Cryptocurrencies

1453
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:56,831
Anyway

1454
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
Alex is against

1455
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,415
But then he interviews this guy

1456
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
And it

1457
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,975
Pretty positive

1458
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
He's very good

1459
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
Is a global government openly

1460
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,239
Dollars

1461
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:18,591
Obviously a giant inside job from the beginning just like

1462
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
I told you that

1463
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
10 years ago

1464
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,223
So why are you having a long interview with a guy who's

1465
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
Into Bitcoin who's giving really positive

1466
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,599
It's very confusing

1467
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Also Alex

1468
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671
Hasn't been super negative

1469
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,695
About Bitcoin

1470
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
And it's much more

1471
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Complicated than

1472
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,559
Been a promoter of it

1473
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:43,423
But if he actually thought it was something that was meant to replace the dollar as part of the globalist

1474
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,703
Plantain

1475
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
Mad Max

1476
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
Kaiser on

1477
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,799
For the last 10 years on his show to

1478
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,335
Constantly promoted

1479
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,639
It cryptocurrency

1480
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,735
His behavior will be totally different

1481
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:02,367
And that's the same actually is with you if Alex actually thought that there wasn't some

1482
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Thing in it

1483
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,671
For him to

1484
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,767
Not fully denounce XYZ whether it's qanon or Bitcoin

1485
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,559
His behavior will be totally different

1486
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:14,655
He thought there was an angle that he could play some sort of hedge in the middle

1487
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,679
Yeah man wants

1488
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,215
That was clearly not the case

1489
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,031
Oh I've known this was a setup all along

1490
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311
Bulshit yeah

1491
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,103
Yeah it is

1492
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
His pattern of like

1493
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,431
Denouncing something

1494
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,735
Softly and gently but that having

1495
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
Pro

1496
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Guests on it

1497
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,295
4

1498
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
An eternity

1499
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Is

1500
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,927
Clear evidence of some sort of

1501
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,487
Issue he has with

1502
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
I can't piss someone

1503
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
There's always someone that

1504
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Be pissed off in

1505
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:47,167
Or just like a there might be

1506
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
Might be worthwhile to

1507
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,983
Tonight pelean

1508
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
This

1509
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:56,639
Yeah maybe maybe down the road qanon become something that is profitable for me so let's

1510
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:01,247
Keep that lane open until it's too late and then I can always have been against

1511
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
With with

1512
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:09,695
Bitcoin it could have collapsed left people with nothing could have been something that everyone hates

1513
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,559
Will be great for him to be able to say I better get dressed hold out your right

1514
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:20,959
Maybe it's a cool thing and then I feel like I said Max Keiser promoted on my show for 10 years I'm an old-school Bitcoin guy

1515
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,775
If you play both sides and let me look like a prophet

1516
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,103
But you're not you're just dumb dumb

1517
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,151
Anyway

1518
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Is on trial

1519
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Because

1520
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,735
He said something

1521
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,527
People did something

1522
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,599
What about Kamala Harris

1523
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
She said some pigs

1524
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
Who hasn't said things

1525
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,951
.

1526
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:47,071
Kamala Harris cackling like the witch she is

1527
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,143
Will she be

1528
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,191
Impeached

1529
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:55,519
If you had to be stuck in an elevator with either President Trump

1530
01:15:55,775 --> 01:16:01,919
Jeff sessions who would it be

1531
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,263
A possible interpretation of that joke is that she would kill herself

1532
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,823
Before going in an elevator with one of them

1533
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,103
So

1534
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,663
I don't know I think this is a little bit then

1535
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
You think

1536
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:39,295
The laughter at crowd Applause

1537
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:42,111
Indicates that this is a different setting

1538
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Baby

1539
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:46,207
I would argue that there is a different

1540
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:52,607
Contextual interpretation of someone saying a joke on the Ellen show and someone

1541
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,887
I'm saying that you should kill one

1542
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,215
Political enemies in a rally after having said that

1543
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
Killing them is fine for a long time

1544
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
Dealing with this situation

1545
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
Entirely differently

1546
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:04,895
If Ellen DeGeneres killed Jeff session

1547
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,943
An elephant

1548
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,319
I would say the cowboy Harris was very irresponsible

1549
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:14,111
Kill Jeff sessions at elevator

1550
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,647
We could be

1551
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
I mean how could you.

1552
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:23,583
Yeah I mean it's still hard not to add the context of

1553
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,167
Couple killed in.

1554
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,727
So in terms of the

1555
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:33,055
Impeachment stuff from the the day before

1556
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,663
Alex doesn't deal with much of the

1557
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,967
Let's say previously unreleased

1558
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,783
Videos that are real problem

1559
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,111
Find me they certainly contradict his narrative quite a bit

1560
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Particular

1561
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,535
People chanting hang Mike Pence

1562
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,863
And like people wandering through the Halls yelling

1563
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
For Nancy Pelosi

1564
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:01,983
Though just the person the first person going through the window

1565
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Wearing fultz

1566
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:05,567
Picogear Confederate flags

1567
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,103
Following along

1568
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,943
I think that everybody has different images it'll probably

1569
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,759
Stick with them take was one that was really

1570
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,039
Really tough for me

1571
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:18,111
And particularly because you know I I I

1572
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:21,183
Spend so much time with Alex's rhetoric in his narrative

1573
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,231
Directly counter

1574
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:28,351
This reality is to the game that he's spending totally

1575
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
Yeah sure

1576
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,679
But this Raskin guy right

1577
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
Luigi

1578
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,287
Council

1579
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
He

1580
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:40,127
I know that from watching

1581
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,687
The impeachment not from earlier before that

1582
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:47,295
Paul Joseph Watson Road an article about that

1583
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,183
The slimiest like creature

1584
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,047
Signal while Jamie Raskin

1585
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,655
Said that tonight

1586
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:06,239
On the 6th Trump supporters burn

1587
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
Down the church

1588
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,847
It's funny cuz that church is the one that

1589
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
Fireball

1590
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:13,919
Church

1591
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
The gentleman

1592
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,015
Is the

1593
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
Visited with the Bible

1594
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,647
Why would you tell

1595
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,695
Such a gigantic

1596
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,303
Interesting question

1597
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,095
John's Church

1598
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,375
Trump supporters

1599
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,191
Well that would be an issue

1600
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,799
Did Abraham Lincoln

1601
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Killed Abraham Lincoln

1602
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,127
Bojangles biscuit

1603
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,039
I know your background is green today

1604
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
A what

1605
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,975
Scott Israel in Texas

1606
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,791
Because you don't lying

1607
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
Couldn't get it

1608
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:12,799
Play with it

1609
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,616
By the master of similes I was just

1610
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Wild

1611
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,200
Outrageous

1612
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:25,600
Yeah so reskin didn't say the people were stabbed on January 6th

1613
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
Blackpool's as a weapon

1614
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,160
Turn against Capitol Police because

1615
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,440
That's a super resonant image

1616
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,976
That's the idea.

1617
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:37,376
They're being attacked by something that has the flag on it sure it is hard to avoid

1618
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:40,704
Strictly literally than yes no one was run through with a

1619
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,312
The pole but that's the difficulty that Alex and his ilk have spinning this stuff

1620
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,944
The previously unreleased video of like I said at the storming really disprove a lot of Alex's narratives

1621
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,504
Do you really just don't want to deal with that

1622
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
That stuff so

1623
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:56,576
You Retreat to dumb semantics argument

1624
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
The mean nothing

1625
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,904
Pretend that that's the entire argument against Trump

1626
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:03,744
And it's all a lie no one was impaled

1627
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:09,888
Paled by javelin throw over 40 ft away we were slamming the cops head in a door

1628
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,424
Come on right

1629
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,728
I asked for the church burning Alex's playing.

1630
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,592
Raskin said quote that's before the second million Maga March or rally that ended in

1631
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,640
Serious violence and even the burning of a church

1632
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,944
This sentence doesn't say who burned

1633
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:29,344
The church but Alex and Paul Joseph Watson are pretending that it's making it

1634
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
Satori claim

1635
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,672
The essence of saying is that

1636
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,440
Trump has a

1637
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:36,000
Pattern of exciting events that lead to violence

1638
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,280
Really debatable

1639
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,096
Fake claim to respond to

1640
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:44,448
They're also pretending that Raskin must be talking about the burning of the st. John's

1641
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:48,032
Church which was the church that dropped it is photo op in back in May

1642
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,592
The person or persons responsible

1643
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,896
Possible for that fire are still unknown

1644
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,992
Is Alex Camp actually prove that anyone from one of his villain group chat

1645
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,552
He's just decided to report as if that is okay

1646
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,344
Yeah as long as it's unknown

1647
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
Fine for him

1648
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:09,024
Raskin could have spoken more clearly but what he was talking about was the proud boys vandalizing the Asbury United Methodist Church

1649
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:12,608
A burning banners they stolen from the church that said black lives matter

1650
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:19,264
This is a secondary instance of Alex creating a fake thing to argue against and he knows exactly what Raskin is talking about

1651
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:23,616
The guy who took credit for birding at Church's sign has been a guest on Alex's show

1652
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,152
In the night of January 5th

1653
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:31,040
Alex's employee Owen Shroyer recorded himself burning a black lives matter flag in d.c.

1654
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,832
Come on grow up a******

1655
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,880
Anyway what's really funny about this

1656
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,440
Is with that lead up

1657
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Hibdon

1658
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
Actually watched

1659
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,560
Best time to tell at the end

1660
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
Because

1661
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,864
In the lead-up to this

1662
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
He's saying

1663
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
That Raskin claimed

1664
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:51,776
There was all this on January 6th

1665
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Whoops

1666
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:56,896
End

1667
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
Before the 2nd

1668
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:59,200
Million Mega mart

1669
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
A rally that ended in serious violence

1670
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,320
And even the burning of a church

1671
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:07,392
And is the president forecast it was only the beginning

1672
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,184
On December 19th

1673
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,744
18 days before January 6th

1674
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
About where the battle

1675
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
Would be that they would

1676
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Fight next

1677
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,376
January 6th

1678
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,168
Would be wild he promised

1679
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:21,472
Be there will be wild

1680
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,032
Said the president of the United States of America

1681
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
And that too

1682
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
Turned out to be true

1683
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,640
Still seeing the days

1684
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,224
Continue to aggressively promote

1685
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
January 6th

1686
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
To his father

1687
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,856
Okay so he said that the

1688
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,416
March

1689
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:45,024
What's the June 1st

1690
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:47,584
PLM event burn the church

1691
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
Did he say

1692
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,400
6 months apart

1693
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,704
Is that why he didn't

1694
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:57,056
President

1695
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:02,432
So you can hear him kind of Reese pinning in real-time because he realizes the clip dozen

1696
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,712
Don't say what he had already

1697
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:06,016
Processed it to say

1698
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,808
You can hear it very clearly

1699
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:09,344
Okay

1700
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
Okay

1701
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,928
Alright see you now

1702
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,976
What he saying is something

1703
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,536
Different from what I said he would say

1704
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:22,400
And so he's

1705
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,568
So whose fault do you think it is

1706
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,104
That Trump has bad lawyer

1707
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,504
Let's see what it'd be the entire legal profession thinking to his cases both nonsense

1708
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,832
Physical and unwinnable or him

1709
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,880
Try again Pacific person

1710
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,672
Nancy Pelosi

1711
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,720
Bruce kaster

1712
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,304
So-called lawyer

1713
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:52,096
Put

1714
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,168
Oh yeah

1715
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
Just three months ago

1716
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,872
Lawyer

1717
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Son-in-law

1718
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:15,392
Spell at Kushner

1719
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
Okay alright

1720
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:17,952
It's Kushner

1721
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
Yeah yeah okay

1722
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,256
Alright

1723
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:24,864
Lot of buck stops their kind of secret leader of the

1724
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,424
Deep state has been Kushner the entire time

1725
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,472
Botanica said that maybe

1726
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:33,056
I think this is a relatively Shakespearean Tale

1727
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
Son-in-law

1728
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,896
Betraying his father

1729
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:40,992
I would love to just be able to be like Vibram job

1730
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
If I could have it

1731
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,576
Would be to be a person

1732
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
Who

1733
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,904
Hacks in to Alex's earpiece

1734
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,512
And I can just respond live

1735
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:55,584
What's 2 + 2

1736
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:59,424
Alex hasn't earpiece in the producers talk to him

1737
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,776
And just be able to hack it and respond in real-time would be so great

1738
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:07,104
Cuz I just secure that is

1739
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,688
You just say that the bad lawyers

1740
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:17,088
He hired a lawyer who sued him at the path that he didn't know about that and this is kushner's Father absolutely

1741
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:23,488
Convincing convincing anthropomorphize voice in his head

1742
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:29,888
My mind that he would have that lilacs I got myself doubted that was bad

1743
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
That was dumb

1744
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,728
Is this guy supposed to be king

1745
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,264
Hero-guy in

1746
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:39,360
He hired a lawyer who sued him because his son-in-law trick tip

1747
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Yep

1748
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:46,272
This is this is stuff that even like this the man I want leading the country

1749
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:50,880
So Alex like I said there's not as much

1750
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,672
About the impeachment

1751
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,720
As Maybe

1752
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,744
Would be

1753
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
Interesting or seen

1754
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,560
Should be merited by

1755
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,328
Wake me up this

1756
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
Show

1757
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,936
But he spends quite a while talking

1758
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:04,704
The B boy

1759
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Surely the motherfuking bad boy

1760
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
Yeah we're two clips last

1761
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,360
Tomcat cuz I'm not talking about that boy no I'm good

1762
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,640
We have to clip

1763
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,224
If you'd rather go culture-war or gossip

1764
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,248
First

1765
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,296
Who I feel like

1766
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:26,208
Culture war is going to be more offensive in yet somehow I feel like gossip also might wind up with

1767
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
Some really f***** up

1768
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:29,792
Okay

1769
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Disney

1770
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,608
Alrighty I knew it

1771
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
Disney has fired

1772
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,496
Gina Carano

1773
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:45,408
So a man who is absolutely not a fan of Star Wars

1774
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:52,064
Absolutely not appreciate a release of Star Wars very angry about one particular

1775
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,856
The Mandalorian

1776
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,904
I didn't know that

1777
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,184
If I were Disney

1778
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,976
I would blame her for grow goo

1779
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:06,400
On our way out

1780
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,984
Everyone else everyone

1781
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,312
So in reality what happened was

1782
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,360
That she had some social media posts

1783
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,664
Including

1784
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,456
Particularly offensive one where she

1785
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,992
She compared being Republican

1786
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:21,760
To being

1787
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,552
A Jew in the Holocaust

1788
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
Care much for that

1789
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,744
No

1790
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,816
Alex may not quite

1791
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
Stand why

1792
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,120
She got fired

1793
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,168
Crazy about it is

1794
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,752
Disney's virtue signaling

1795
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:46,080
English former MMA lady office

1796
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:46,848
Topman

1797
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:02,720
Hero

1798
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:08,864
Pedro is the Mandalorian

1799
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,104
Amazon

1800
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:24,736
Wobbled

1801
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,600
Semitic

1802
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Wow

1803
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:35,232
Wow, blade

1804
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:37,024
The conversation

1805
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,072
Cowboy Alex

1806
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,096
Alex

1807
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,120
You might be

1808
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,216
Too used to people saying worse things than that

1809
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:51,616
That's anti-semitic actually does make sense cuz I compared himself to a Jewish person during the hollow

1810
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,664
For him

1811
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,224
Obviously

1812
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,016
What she's saying is like

1813
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:01,088
Towards

1814
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,880
Little fire for her for that

1815
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,952
I have Steve beyond my show all the time

1816
01:30:06,208 --> 01:30:09,280
He's throwing anti-semitic s*** out like f******

1817
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
Candy in a parade

1818
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,840
Yeah it's

1819
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
It's interesting

1820
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,656
To me the part that I find the most

1821
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,936
Interesting outside of

1822
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,216
Alex's Bazaar

1823
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:17,984
Need

1824
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:18,752
2

1825
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,056
Have a sexual psychodrama with his audience

1826
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:27,456
Yeah I don't know why you need to do that

1827
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:30,784
Have looked strong and powerful now it doesn't mean I don't want to have sex with

1828
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:33,600
But now I've got me should deal with your therapist

1829
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,184
I absolutely have to air out the

1830
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:43,072
This problem that I can't sublimate which is that I both attracted to strong powerful women and what them destroy

1831
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:47,168
Weird I wasn't quite sure where he was going

1832
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
Nancy was talking

1833
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:50,240
I'm about this like what side you was going to land on

1834
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
Because he's being very weird

1835
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:56,896
Then when he said she groveled and said the Holocaust was bad

1836
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
Why did you say grovel

1837
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:05,088
I mean when you say the Holocaust is bad obviously you're caving to the ATL and the cuckoo

1838
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:08,160
Klux Klan why did I don't understand that

1839
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
At all

1840
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,048
What should she have said that Hitler was a

1841
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:19,936
Badass stud Alex's said maybe

1842
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,984
Navigate to Gossett

1843
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,264
It is

1844
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,800
It would be kind of ridiculous if

1845
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,824
The guy who said that

1846
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,920
Hitler was a complete started a badass was like at Gina should have been fired

1847
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:30,688
I wish

1848
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,224
That I had the soundboard

1849
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:37,856
Play that cuz I'm afraid that we had a drop that we used

1850
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:41,440
Play where Alex says that Hitler and Stalin are total badasses

1851
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,488
Complete badasses.

1852
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,024
That's how we used to think

1853
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,048
People for

1854
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:49,376
We move on the gossip

1855
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
Close the show

1856
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,472
I will say one of the more rewarding things

1857
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,496
It's about listening

1858
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,520
To Alex's show

1859
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,824
Is getting 25 little thread

1860
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,616
Is it you can pull that you would

1861
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,896
You know you'd never had

1862
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:04,480
Like there was the story of Buckley's birthday party

1863
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:10,880
Oh sure yeah

1864
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:12,928
Naughty hat

1865
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:19,584
Little glimpses that you get into Alex's life the globalist in the hot

1866
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,632
Hot tub is always a classic

1867
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,424
Springs tails

1868
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
All the times he would go down to Barton Springs

1869
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,520
The hike-and-bike trail

1870
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:33,920
Tales of the hike-and-bike a lot of interesting things that happened on that trailer another thing is a lot of

1871
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,200
About Alex's wife

1872
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,224
Tennis habit

1873
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,040
A lot more than I would have expected hilarious

1874
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:41,344
We know that her tennis partner

1875
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
I believe

1876
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,392
I was

1877
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:49,792
The scoping out antifa at grocery stores

1878
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,072
Intel

1879
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,352
And now we learn

1880
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,168
But maybe not all is good

1881
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:59,776
In the world of Alex's wife's tennis maybe there's some haters

1882
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,168
Crossword just say

1883
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,472
Jamie

1884
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:33,056
Raskin says Trump supporters burn down that shirt

1885
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,896
That quick huh

1886
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:41,504
File the turnaround is fast on that

1887
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:53,280
I mean I understand that it's most likely just a device for him to do like a character or whatever but I love that there's a

1888
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,816
An entire genre

1889
01:33:55,328 --> 01:34:00,192
Within Alex's world of light Story 3 complains about the people that plays tennis with

1890
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:03,776
Yeah he's almost doing like

1891
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,592
Nursery rhyme levels of explaining things

1892
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
In in like

1893
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Entail

1894
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
You know like

1895
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,688
This is why we don't touch

1896
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:14,016
Search fire because there's a rabbit that goes around and it touched

1897
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,808
Fire one time and you were like this

1898
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
Is bad

1899
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,136
This isn't her tennis instructor was like

1900
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,184
Hey we should listen to this guy

1901
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,208
That's bad

1902
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,256
Now children let's move on

1903
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:25,792
I feel like more his

1904
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,072
His wife's

1905
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:27,840
Tennis

1906
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,912
World is like

1907
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,960
World is populated by

1908
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:39,360
Fictional characters that he just gets to a Caston little plays

1909
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:42,176
To have seen antifa setting up at the grocery store

1910
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,736
Somebody involved in my life tennis games

1911
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,552
We need somebody to play the role of

1912
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:54,208
Nosy judgemental Democrat

1913
01:34:54,464 --> 01:35:00,608
It is strangely enough the only both combined tennis club and private investigator Lori

1914
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
Agency

1915
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:07,776
It's like whenever you first saw Baskin-Robbins in a KFC in the same place you're like what are we doing here

1916
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,544
That's the time

1917
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,568
Thank you thinking

1918
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:15,968
Dunkin Donuts in kfci

1919
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:19,808
Supposed to know never be a Baskin-Robbins

1920
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,856
Safe Company

1921
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,232
Taco Bell and Pizza Hut

1922
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:33,632
He said this and then Dunkin and Baskin-Robbins I think a company

1923
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,424
Taco Bell KFC

1924
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,960
And Pizza Hut all together with

1925
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Good meal

1926
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:38,496
But

1927
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,800
Don't eat it before you go play

1928
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,592
Tennis with Alex

1929
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:45,920
You will you will probably wind up taking a nap and missing out on some

1930
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:50,272
Crucial information either that or you'll become a story that Alex tells on the show

1931
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,856
I let somebody who ate too much shittyfood for playing chess with his wife

1932
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,840
The new way to f*** with Alex Jones you join his wife's tennis club and you just every now and again walk up to her with a ugly look on your

1933
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
Listen to say something

1934
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:09,472
If I had all the time in the world

1935
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:14,080
I'd still not do that that sounds hot.

1936
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:20,480
Jordan we come to the end of this and I expected a little bit more fireworks but I mean he is mad

1937
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,272
Show me wrong he's mad

1938
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,832
It almost makes

1939
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:28,160
More sense to me you know like you're saying this is a coherent issue

1940
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:28,928
Responsive

1941
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,232
But he shouldn't be

1942
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:38,656
Looks like upset about the impeachment thing he think he's supposed to think the Trump won the election

1943
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,704
Will be disappointed in whatever

1944
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:44,800
Defense there is because they're not saying the Trump won the election

1945
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,592
Yeah it is

1946
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:50,432
It's even better for him that they're terrible lawyers because then you can pretend it there

1947
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,992
Sandbagging on purpose course

1948
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,064
And then whenever they whenever Trump wins and is acquitted

1949
01:36:56,576 --> 01:37:00,672
He's very like ca even in spite of the lawyers that the globalist

1950
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,696
Dave Embry

1951
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:04,256
He's so innocent

1952
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,536
His defense

1953
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,352
Was literally two men going bye bye man

1954
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,448
4 hours

1955
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:23,968
We do have a website at salad 5.com

Dzx Clark

1961
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:38,560
I have no other place to mention this and it

1962
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,096
It seems perfect

1963
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:42,144
Set me a message

1964
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,192
