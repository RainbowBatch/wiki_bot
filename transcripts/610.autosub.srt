1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:15,776
It went real fast

6
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:30,624
I would like to start the show by apologizing for not knowing that that was

7
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,976
Flugelhorn

8
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,816
I I mostly over you know Chuck Mangione from the children

9
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Sanchez

10
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,448
Run Tracker

11
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,216
That's on me

12
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,592
Anyway

13
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:51,872
What's your up right spot

14
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:58,272
Back to the Eco challenge show that alright I was thinking about it I finished

15
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
Didn't I realize what I liked so much about it I have a structure it was

16
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
All inspirational it was all positive

17
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
Yeah everything about it was

18
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,768
People trying their hardest

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
With people that cared about

20
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
I am trying to finish

21
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,216
Write like the first half of the show had kind of a focus on what team was going to come in first

22
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
And that was like

23
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,008
Pretty

24
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Proud of

25
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,104
Even after the winter

26
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Still just as excited about like are these people going to finish everybody

27
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Everybody

28
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,112
Goodness no it's fantastic

29
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,976
You know and I think that there's so many shows that are about kicking people or like

30
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
You know being certain there's a shot

31
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
Freud aspect to him any of that

32
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Whenever somebody had to

33
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
The quit or got hurt it was

34
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,216
The tragedy when people

35
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Pushed through and tried as hard as they could but

36
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
Still didn't make the cut off

37
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,128
They were congratulated for never quitting right

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
It's just

39
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
Rate

40
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Made me feel very very warm we watch the documentary my partner and I are about

41
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
This woman who is running the Iditarod

42
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
For like

43
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,256
20 years and she just

44
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,536
Could not

45
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
Get

46
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,608
Further you know she was really good

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
She cared a lot and then all the sudden she starts coming

48
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,680
Second second

49
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,008
Second over and over and over again

50
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Helping people

51
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
He could have one like twice but instead

52
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,688
Somebody got trapped behind her and she was like

53
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:35,040
What kind of s*** in your life

54
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,624
That's great even with

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,232
Despacito challenge is like a lot of people who are old-time Adventure Racers who are like

56
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
Pasture Prime

57
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
Fifth grade fifth grade

58
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Anyway I recommended

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
It's the final table of outdoor

60
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
The Dig real beef

61
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,640
The weather wasn't the second

62
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
It's either that could have been

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
The Absurd production value

64
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
Maybe maybe a little on the pricey side for a computer

65
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,464
So whatever

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
Follow up on

67
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
A few months

68
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,815
A few months ago few weeks ago I

69
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
It said that we were starting to eat

70
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
Eat healthy and do these this meal thing and all that

71
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
I have lost

72
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,727
5 lb

73
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,495
Wow

74
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Yeah that's not yet

75
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,199
Your place in

76
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:41,343
I know right

77
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
Unique games

78
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
About eating healthy for me

79
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,487
It said

80
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,511
The food taste

81
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,327
Fine

82
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,191
John I used to order out all the time and I like the taste so I

83
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
Yeah I know it's

84
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
You do some of it taste okay

85
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,687
You want to serve it

86
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
Beautiful enough not like a giant thing of mac and cheese or don't need help

87
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
I don't need

88
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
It works

89
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Well

90
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
Congratulations

91
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
It's very

92
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,911
Weird

93
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
But I think that may be having a

94
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,455
A different relationship with eating good since it's not like you hurting yourself is maybe positive

95
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,479
Play better I haven't

96
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Myself with a bag

97
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Cheetos for a while

98
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,135
I'll pray today we have an episode from

99
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:53,535
Because quite frankly I wasn't a situation where

100
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,839
I've got some side project

101
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,679
I'm working on when he talked about eventuate but also like

102
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,983
On Monday's episode Alex

103
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Was talking about

104
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,567
Advice about maybe you should kill your family

105
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
I do

106
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,711
Know what is more time out Worthy

107
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
Locked up things

108
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
Imaginable and actually I went back when I was editing a sewed and I looked up that story that you mentioned about the

109
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:25,535
Guy who killed his brother and his brother's wife and it was very similar

110
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
Do that

111
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,655
I was a little bit disappointed that I didn't pick up those pieces of clearly

112
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
In preparation of the episode but

113
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
It did seem like I was

114
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,311
Kind of what he was touching on a little bit

115
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,895
There's a weird feeling that I have

116
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,759
Personally that like whatever Alex says he's going to eat his neighbors

117
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,831
A million views on Twitter

118
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,951
Maybe it's time for you to think about kill your family if they like vaccine

119
00:06:54,463 --> 00:07:00,607
I didn't see that go viral yeah yeah it is

120
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,935
MC Hammer saying it the demon face go viral

121
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,615
That is a real bummer that we exist in that space where people loved

122
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
Infantilizing

123
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,247
Your neighbors

124
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
But then it goes

125
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Really

126
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831
Only difference

127
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Open Total voice

128
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
Between it's time to eat your neighbors and it's time to kill your family

129
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,719
Chinese difference

130
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:33,119
Yeah I just looked up my families starve

131
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
I will eat my cookie

132
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:35,935
Can eat my neighbor

133
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Hey and hey

134
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
Maybe it's time to think about it

135
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
It's a family affair

136
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
If you're really hungry you might have to eat your family too

137
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
Extra

138
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Loophole in the

139
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
I will say that sometimes it

140
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
It gets

141
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Disheartened

142
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
Yeah and I'll push through that

143
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,583
And will get back to the present day on Monday but

144
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,143
I was just like I don't I can't I can't

145
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,191
Imagine something worse

146
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
The nest

147
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
And I can't imagine

148
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,847
How mad I would be if there is something that's worse and no one is yeah

149
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
Dealing with a lie

150
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,271
That's really f***** up and I'm in the Press

151
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
So Jordan like I said where is the past

152
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Yeah and I will get down to business on that but first

153
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
But say hello doesn't be washed

154
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
First

155
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,511
This is just a theme I guess

156
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
Parton from my life in a demon Feast make you some hot tea or no apology

157
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:44,031

00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,735
Policy

160
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135
Suggestion is alive in your partner

00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
With really in-depth things

162
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
About tax code

163
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
And Healthcare law

164
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583

166
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
Anniversary

Sure technology

168
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:25,247
Control it now before it happened right I usually am not in favor of some of your ideas this one

169
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,039
About

170
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,087
Preemptively the 650

171
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,415

So good

178
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
Freakishly large

179
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,583
23rd of June

180
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,887
2003

181
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,007
I wasted a bit of my time listening to the

182
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
Episode prior to this

183
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
So the 20th

184
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,895
Does that was over the weekend

185
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,199
It's a repeat

186
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
And I didn't realize it for a while

187
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:35,647
Speak highly of some of his broadcast

188
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
I took me a second

189
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,583
Why are you defending yourself about being drunk on a boat yelling at people

190
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
Do the exact same conversation again

191
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
I do you cut your hand the people who started it

192
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,847
Not

193
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,639
Baton

194
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
It's going to be all that interesting for us to go into gear

195
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:01,503
But there's a couple of there's a couple of points that I found

196
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Very Illuminating

197
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
I am excited to

198
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,415
There's not a complex drop that will come in very handy in the future

199
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:16,095
Oh my God.

200
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
This is going to add round out our Zoo crew

201
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:28,383
We don't even need

202
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
Alex you're really dumb

203
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,735
You're a traitor,

204
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
Salman Ali

205
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Terrible

206
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,391
Talking to

207
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
We're not doing this

208
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
Shut it down.

209
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,095
Syfy

210
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:48,863
Of this year

211
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
June 23rd episode

212
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
And this clip

213
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,263
I think is really illustrative of why it's dumb

214
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,055
To try and talk to someone

215
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,591
Like Alex karev

216
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
I think that you're never going to really get

217
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,991
It proved he's talkin about the Charles sells Supreme Court

218
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,087
And we talked about that quite a bit in our 2003 episodes

219
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
So far

220
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Here is his take

221
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:13,951
Akon people who try and correct him about the the rule

222
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Supreme Court rules

223
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
I'm individual

224
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
For trying

225
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Little form

226
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
Literally

227
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Jog

228
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
I'm sorry

229
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:12,831
Apropos

230
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
Federal ruling

231
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,751
No that's not true at all these random people absolutely correct

232
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,055
But boots fascinating about this

233
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
Is at least in 2003 Alex seems to have an awareness of this

234
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Extinction

235
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,223
Between the headline and body of article

236
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
That distinction is

237
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
Gone is present-day awareness

238
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:49,439
That you need to read beyond the headlights yeah we want to start barking

239
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,023
Viscerally insulting

240
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Have you know

241
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Decency

242
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
Cool

243
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
Yeah I think

244
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
These people are emailing him or correct

245
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
And

246
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
He's just

247
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
You can give him exactly the right information

248
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
It'll just about. You need to read deeper

249
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,319
What you don't understand is how to read these documents

250
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
Actually mean the opposite of what they say

251
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
Yeah if somebody

252
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
He's telling you

253
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
You're not reading something right

254
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Because you are engaging with what it says right

255
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
Then you are

256
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,679
What do you say you know like you have to go to First print

257
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
Suppose we agree that what are we talkin about

258
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:43,711
A book that you've written in the margins of the book I'm reading it's a fundamental disagreement about like

259
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Take what you can

260
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
How information is taken from source

261
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:54,463
New receiver of information will then leave me alone forever

262
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:59,583
I don't care who that over there but don't f****** pretend

263
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
Don't pretend it's anything other than an art form

264
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
About the notes

265
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
Barracks

266
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Story on this day

267
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
And this

268
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:11,871
Is fascinating

269
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Minecraft

270
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
Huge problem

271
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,455
And

272
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:20,575
He is on the exact wrong side of this issue based on his political principles

273
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
Wayne

274
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Auburn internal

275
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,287
A 1988

276
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:50,015
If they are found to be

277
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:51,807
Really

278
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Brevard

279
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Now

280
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
During art class

281
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
Alicia calls

282
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
The year

283
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
I don't know about this art

284
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:33,535
School Story art class got out of hand real quick

285
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Is really interesting about this guy

286
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Police officer in Falls River

287
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
And to look

288
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
I was just trying to prevent this as

289
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,263
Police state

290
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
Kind of things

291
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,335
Zero tolerance for all this stuff

292
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
Eat Jam.

293
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Right right right

294
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,943
I don't know what the art

295
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,991
Exactly how it relates

296
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,063
To the police guy getting fired for smoking.

297
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:56,831
Application

298
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,159
Fall River Police Department has a zero-tolerance policy on smoking

299
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,255
Officers whether they're on or off duty for a very specific reason

300
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
I wonder if you can guess

301
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
Could you can you Workshop in your brain why

302
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
That might be the case

303
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,799
They're the only cops who carry around hand grenades at all times

304
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Yeah they all have cartoons and TV

305
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,503
It's because they don't want to allow for

306
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,623
For any insurance claims that prevent things like smoking linked heart or lung cancer is being work relay

307
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
So if you're disallowed from

308
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Smoking at work

309
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:37,791
And you have one of those conditions they don't have to pay out in the insurance

310
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
You're right I should have assumed capitalism was the problem

311
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,031
I need money somewhere along the line the fun case for Alex and I are both

312
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,567
Against this thing before

313
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
Completely different reason

314
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,895
I'm opposed to the world because they can take

315
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Clearly don't care if some

316
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
One smokes or not they're just trying to

317
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
You know save money by not having

318
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,527
Play some cops health

319
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,135
Right I was supposed to because he's created a fake version of the story to present

320
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
It's just yet another

321
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,231
Example of the New World Order takes over

322
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,815
It's discipline human resources

323
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
That's so f****** annoying every at all I can't come on man

324
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
Is there nowhere

325
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Is there nowhere

326
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,639
Alex seems to think

327
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
This this

328
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
Bizarre notion

329
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
That

330
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
In this case

331
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
The cop should have to go on trial

332
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:40,511
It's not the cops

333
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Jeffrey

334
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
Jeffrey

335
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Has nothing to do with it

336
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,143
Do the feds put people in bathtub acid whether they do or not is irrelevant

337
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
This is a human resource

338
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,007
Not allowed to face my

339
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:29,919
Volume don't work for us anymore nobody's nobody's

340
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Put into jail

341
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
I got in trouble back when I used to work at a subway cuz one of my co-workers saw me eating a meatball and snitched up

342
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,231
Did not have a chance to face my accuser

343
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
For the ship

344
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,375
You're done for the day get out of here

345
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
I did not get you processed

346
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:00,639
Are you going to assume that you've eaten the meatball I could have been anybody you can't trust that I wouldn't

347
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Accountright

348
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,735
30 snitch you can bring in

349
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
I need been proven that eyewitness accounts

350
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:13,439
Easily

351
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:18,047
It looks very good source

352
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
It's payroll

353
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,423
Alright alright

354
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Bets to Vaudeville

355
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
So

356
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Like legitimately convinced

357
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
That somehow

358
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
This smoking

359
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Of the

360
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,735
The cop did

361
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
The crime

362
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
That he needs

363
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,551
To have due process

364
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:40,575
S4 right

365
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,855
It's so ridiculous

366
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,623
I like it

367
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
Import

368
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
Tobacco

369
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
The cops

370
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,336
Forgot there's no right to Due Process based on employment

371
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,968
This is a completely silly thing that Alex is coming although maybe it's not the worst idea in the world

372
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,248
Maybe you'll be good

373
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:47,648
To get rid of at-will employment where workers are seen as disposable Commodities they could be replaced in the song

374
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:57,120
Have to prove their case in court you don't think that to Alex would appreciate think you're going

375
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,704
I know that's what he saying but I don't think he's saying that I think that Alex Wood

376
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Totally be in favor of this

377
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:06,336
Considering how huge an infringement that would be on a business's ability to operate within the

378
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
Mythical free market

379
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
And considering how many big government processes we need to be put in place to make sure businesses adhere to this ain't gave their employees

380
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
Affair day in court

381
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:19,648
I wanted to find a goddamn Alex

382
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
Millie Weaver in court

383
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:30,400
I want it I want it I want a case of Alex Jones vs David Knight

384
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
For firing

385
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,776
Alex call Steve Steve pieczenik

386
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:40,384
Human resources

387
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,456
If the cops use fire drunk

388
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,760
Terminator

389
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,296
Appoint the corkage

390
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Decide whether or not

391
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:53,440
It is valid for him to be fired for smoking when there is a statute that says

392
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:59,072
You can't be fired for smoking that you can challenge that statute eventually but it doesn't have

393
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
Anything to do with whether or not the person who

394
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,424
Snitched on you smoking was anonymous

395
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
You want due process

396
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
You have to face your accuser You're Not Innocent till proven guilty

397
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:12,896
Also is

398
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,432
He's making it sound like

399
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,968
Is there was an anonymous tip

400
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,784
And they went to the cop and they're like man

401
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,576
Somebody said you've been smoking

402
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
I've never taught before in my life and I like pulled his jacket open and pulled out a pack of Marlboros and Alexa

403
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,536
Put it in the evidence Locker

404
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
Austin B

405
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,120
His back and it's courted him out of the building

406
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
It was just like a man you can smoke

407
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,288
Spend a lot of time on this story and I just think there's a

408
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
Fundamental problem with it that if you spend

409
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Time thinking about what the issue

410
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
He's mad about it yet realize that this flies

411
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Completely in the face

412
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,064
Of every weirdo conservative idea he has

413
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,440
The idea that if this one like if he got his one wish on this

414
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:01,280
Except the unintended consequences for the tear down his entire house

415
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,632
Like if he accidentally got one wish

416
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,776
Spay today I'm going to Grant whatever the first thing you say on your show is

417
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:18,176
This would be the accidental labor Revolution that we've all been waiting for

418
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:23,808
I think it's some modicum of this is probably could be good but I think that if you had to

419
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,880
Like have a court case for everybody fire

420
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
I don't think that's productive I don't necessarily think that by advocating for accidentally

421
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,632
I don't know maybe if it was that much of a hassle to fire somebody

422
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
Betraying better and treated well

423
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
Maybe maybe

424
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,336
I used to manage the theater and go to court every time I watch fire skid

425
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,152
Would have been a pain in the ass

426
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,272
So Alex is a good bit of time on this

427
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,088
And I'm starting to feel like maybe this is going

428
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,160
Going to be what the whole show is about maybe I'm getting a little bit

429
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Feel like I'm walking

430
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
Been through some mud

431
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
And then this happened and I

432
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,352
Saw the light the sun coming out from behind the clouds

433
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
I was like yeah

434
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,000
The difference between Harry

435
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
AR

436
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,896
Call Matt

437
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,576
Fifth grade difference

438
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Between Tolkien

439
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
In Harry Potter

440
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Token

441
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
What's in a reference book

442
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,232
Prefer Magic

443
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,120
Is the Harry Potter books actually taught people how to do magic whatever

444
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,656
Huge problem

445
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:21,056
Let's just stop there

446
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,128
Before we before we go any further

447
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
And because every five seconds I just be like

448
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,504
Expelliarmus and knock the f****** microphone out of your hand

449
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Just for the joy of it I wouldn't

450
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:37,696
Exist because I've called people who like Harry Potter.

451
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:43,072
Somewhere I do like because actually what I was saying is

452
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,240
B Generations version sci-fi is better

453
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,848
The fantasy that appealed to my child imagination is different

454
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
Then this Generations in that alienate

455
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:03,808
It's made from the pop culture and I feel sad about that people like the things that I like it

456
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:08,672
Do a lot of them

457
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,488
I'm disconnected they like Lord of the Rings good safer

458
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,536
It doesn't

459
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,168
To a certain extent I guess I agree with

460
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Lord of the Rings

461
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,032
You need the ring

462
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,872
In order to do all of the absolutely do not need the Rings

463
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,688
To do magic

464
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,736
If there's wizard

465
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,600
Character dies and comes back to life through Magic

466
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Wait

467
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
Gandalf

468
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Oh

469
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
I didn't consider in the main character

470
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,048
You're right

471
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,520
Did you like the movie

472
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
I love Daddy

473
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,152
So what are the great things about doing is it doesn't teach you how to do

474
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
Actually

475
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
I believe the David Lynch version does

476
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,320
Teach you that if you yell loud enough you can explode

477
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
Oh that's good

478
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
New Harry Potter books

479
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
Which one

480
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
Just got released

481
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,816
Ryder this 2000

482
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Secrets

483
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Snow

484
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
House of Cards

485
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
To think about it

486
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
He's wrong

487
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
RedTube

488
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
Wow

489
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
Which

490
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:56,448
The ones in Harry Potter I thought you was talking about the first one cuz it wouldn't be like

491
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:00,288
Could be bringing about the movie the first one was on the solstice

492
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
Philosopher's Stone was released in 1997

493
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,016
This was June 21st in 1997

494
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone came out on June 26th

495
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,464
I don't know how close you have to be to the solstice for to be a conspiracy but I guess 5 days is good enough

496
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,584
What are the other nobody nobody expects like on the day

497
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,960
You know you get like I know there's a 3-day late fee there's a 5-day Grace.

498
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
It's like paying rent

499
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,264
I like the the

500
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,568
Big piece of evidence Alexander

501
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
It was released

502
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:43,040
Maybe if you maybe if you learn how to speak Elvish in token you be able to do magic

503
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,600
Maybe Alex just sucks and reading Elva

504
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,648
It wouldn't be the only language

505
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,208
There's more

506
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,280
There's more evidence

507
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,840
Justin was just one book came out on the 12th

00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,656

You really Spore books released

524
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:57,024
I have a bunch of other like summer release dates when you know baby kids are getting out of school

525
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:59,072
Plenty of free time that they would

526
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:00,864
Would have to read books for

527
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,888
For school

528
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,728
If you go on summer reading list that parents would

529
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,008
Be more Act

530
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776

The Tempest

533
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:16,224
Like what magic is fine and what magic is not

534
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,064
Huh

535
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,112
Because I'm sorry I can't say that in here

536
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
We're not on sale

537
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,000
See if you rhyme while

538
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Stirring

539
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,584
Bubble bubble toil and trouble

540
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
Macbeth taught children how to do magic

541
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
The script

542
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,728
For the magical ritual is right there

543
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Yeah

544
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,824
I don't know I wonder if the Harry Potter thing is Alex just

545
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,640
Heats education so much

546
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,992
It's a school books about school Furious

547
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:52,832
I wonder if that's it like he actually thinks that like well if you read this

548
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,368
Kind of like going to hog

549
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
You know my favorite character infection is

550
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,256
Sandwich

551
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,304
Cuz he clearly never had an education

552
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,424
I would love it if like

553
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
You just got to sit and talk with Alex

554
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Turned out that

555
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,520
He like

556
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:14,336
Just got a little bit drunk one night was a relief

557
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Through the Harry Potter book

558
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,408
He came for the Sorting Hat

559
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
You have nightmares

560
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:28,160
Does nightmares about the Sorting Hat of Slytherin

561
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,072
No one will ever know

562
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Assertive

563
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,960
We're looking at this and then recognizing that nowadays Alex

564
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,008
It's probably pretty into the daycare

565
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,080
You know what

566
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,616
The thing that's different about

567
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Tolkien and Harry Potter

568
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Is it Harry Potter taught people how to be more race

569
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,784
I do think there's something

570
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,320
King of of the fun

571
00:32:57,856 --> 00:33:00,672
Okay this is teaching kids how to do evil magic

572
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,208
And you know

573
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,488
18 years later

574
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
I'll defend

575
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
The

576
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,840
The author

577
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
Who is teaching kids how to do magic

578
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Stickman

579
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Unreal

580
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
So it's not the only thing that's demonic though

581
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
You know the Harry Potter is pretty demott

582
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
When I was

583
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,176
When I was 10 years old when I was 11 when the first book

584
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
Came out my church got ahold of it

585
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
And they gave it to me they were like read this to see if there's any

586
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Real magic

587
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
Really

588
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:35,488
Is this okay to give to Children's or is their children or is this

589
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Demonic I didn't know it was like yeah

590
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,328
This sounds

591
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
So familiar to me that's

592
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
That's what I do remember hearing

593
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
About that

594
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:51,616
Like I do I know I remembered hearing stuff about people who had that I never experienced that like first

595
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Time

596
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Those books

597
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
We're coming out

598
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
You like my mom was even reading

599
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,528
Yeah and I like I thought I feel like

600
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
Extremism didn't touch our sort of religious

601
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,416
Community will I will never forget this

602
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
Because it was a weird moment

603
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Of both like

604
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
Growth

605
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
And insane cognitive dissonance

606
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
Coming out of the first movie

607
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Smione

608
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,704
And what's up with my family

609
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Rights and my dad said who is

610
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,544
Super conservative Chris

611
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
My dad said like

612
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,128
After the movies like you know what I liked it

613
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
I liked it because they solved

614
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Problems

615
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Without using

616
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:33,088
That was how they won in the end it's nice if not using magic and I was like

617
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
And the reason that that's

618
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
Both

619
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
A good

620
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,464
Interpretation and insane

621
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
Is because he was afraid

622
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
To see the movie

623
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,560
Because there would be too much Magic

624
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
Usher and it would be evil

625
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
So

626
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
It's like

627
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,264
Yeah okay. Okay alright

628
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,824
I worked at the movie theater when one of them

629
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,872
Came out I don't know which one

630
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Like a third one

631
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
And a friend of mine

632
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Who worked at the theater with me sauce

633
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Hey came out he's like

634
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
Don't watch a movie is so funny

635
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Scary

636
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
I thought like valve

637
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
I watched it like a week later it wasn't scary at all it's like what the f*** is going on

638
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:28,640
Movie that I will watch that movie

639
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Okay

640
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,968
Summation

641
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
How to say about Harry Potter

642
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
Alright

643
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
Do you get it you get it now I do like the idea of Alex being like I Repent of rock and roll

644
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:27,008
29

645
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Oh my God

646
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:38,016
Listen to rock and roll I Repent from Rock I stopped listed I'm a happier and healthier person

647
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:40,576
Just listen to Kris Kristofferson by yourself

648
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,928
He also sings along with a lot of like pretty

649
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744
Demonic leaning Rock later is

650
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
Career

651
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,888
Excessive gas coming on the show Scott Goldberg

652
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
Scott

653
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:55,936
Goldbergs

654
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:58,496
I don't know Alex mispronounces it like 30 times

655
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,824
And they have a nice moment is like ice

656
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
But anyway he's going to have this guy on and

657
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,504
He points out that he disagrees with him

658
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
Okay

659
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,936
They're all here

660
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,824
I got pumped when I heard this

661
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,128
Because I was like okay so you're going to have to people

662
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,016
We're both arguing that foreign troops are being brought into the United States and they're going to argue about whether or not the government

663
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
Is behind

664
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
Right right

665
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
This doesn't happen this this is not payoff at all

666
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,208
It doesn't they don't argue they just talk about how far and troops are

667
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Cummin mechanic

668
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,536
I know it was

669
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,560
Balloon deflate

670
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,096
Yeah that's it that's like

671
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,120
Marvel versus

672
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,144
Does DCR give

673
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
In terms of

674
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
My surreality is better than yours

675
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,544
Yeah and then in the end you don't really even argue

676
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,080
About that

677
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Pretty good

678
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
You know what's great

679
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:12,224
Cartoon people who draw

680
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
So Alex is not too

681
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,320
Surprisingly opposed

682
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
Affirmative action

683
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:23,744
Not right around this point 2003 there were two Supreme Court decision

684
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
When's that were regarding

685
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,304
Affirmative action

686
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
Especially regarding School admission

687
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
In process

688
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:33,472
These two cases essentially if you took both of them

689
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Together

690
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,264
What Vicky

691
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
Conclusion that they came to was

692
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
But having a point

693
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
System

694
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,432
Or anything we're like if just by virtue of

695
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,248
Being of a minority group you got

696
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Appoint

697
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,808
Or if there were quotas

698
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
That's unconstitutional

699
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,880
Schools can't do that right

700
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:56,512
Having some consideration about the diversity in the makeup of your University in terms

701
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
Admission

702
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,304
Processes

703
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Narrowly

704
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
Is okay

705
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,168
It's not something that is considered unconstitutional

706
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:06,752
Alex has a bit of a weird take on all this

707
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
And the good old boy Network

708
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Preferential

709
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
Show me side there for sure

710
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,944
Yes

711
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,552
That appeals to some people

712
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:28,672
Inasmuch as there are these Fat Cats In The Legacy Folk

713
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:35,072
All this s*** handed to them on a silver platter

714
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
Some people

715
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,656
Mike Hira clip like that

716
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,936
And get tricked

717
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,544
By that being very appropriate

718
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,384
I accidentally agree with him being like these minorities

719
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,224
These are also getting all of our s*** that's kind of amazing

720
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
Is exactly like

721
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Big fat cats

722
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
The people that

723
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,648
Are crushed underneath big fat cat

724
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,928
That's boots

725
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,792
Yeah yeah what Alex is saying is basically that there is this sort of three tears

726
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,864
There's another one

727
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,168
I can't believe I can't believe

728
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,448
Yeah that's it

729
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,264
That it got to this

730
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,568
Essentially what

731
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:20,384
Behind the argument that he's making

732
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
It's pretty easy to miss that

733
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
If your

734
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
If you're just listening we can order

735
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:31,392
That is the real kind of affirmative action

736
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,744
Realize that you're internalizing a fairly racist perspective along with

737
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,536
I am at suck

738
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,096
Are you racist or Super 8

739
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,192
Sometimes I'm very generous

740
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,008
So Alex call and this guy is Dad

741
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
Either doubting

742
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
Thomas

743
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,431
He's the sort that would see the holes in Alex's hand

744
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:58,783
Metaphorically would be Alex's documentary about Bohemian Grove

745
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Sure and then this guy is that

746
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:07,231
Did Bohemian Grove is all evil and devils

747
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,071
Far afield that metaphor

748
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:16,191
Is that doubtful even if you saw evidence of something and Alex

749
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
That's cool

750
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,287
In Arkansas you're on the air

751
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:24,639
My dad is a minister and I was telling him about the

752
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Bohemian Grove in

753
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,199
Anything

754
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,223
Something that kind of shock

755
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,503
He said you know what

756
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
Even if I see it with my own eyes

757
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Communication

758
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,623
Turn books

759
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
See all this proof

760
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,207
I believe it

761
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
Pretty sad huh

762
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:45,119
Believe a lie and

763
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,615
You know

764
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
Oh wow

765
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,175
Yeah

766
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,935
Dad not believe me but I prefer human cry

767
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:24,287
Some people say that's the ultimate sin and his response to that was

768
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,943
Oh wow wow who would have guessed that some people would think that it's blasphemy against the Holy Spirit

769
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
Unforgivable sin

770
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,319
Maybe it's not believing

771
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,927
Jesus said it was honor thy father and mother so in this

772
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,207
Particular Circle

773
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:47,839
Alex is 180° away from who is committing the ultimate sin

774
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,863
Let's not surprised

775
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,727
Yeah I would guess that this is a telephone problem where the dad is actually saying

776
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,263
I don't find this evidence

777
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Compelling

778
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,567
I can't get this is bulshit

779
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,639
You can put as much b******* in front of me as you want

780
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
I'm still not going

781
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,735
By the arguments being presented cuz it's b*******

782
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
Discolor

783
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,855
It goes off the rails a little bit cuz he has another question

784
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,623
Garlic

785
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,159
I don't know

786
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
Another question

787
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
You know what the animals

788
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Looks like the Jewish protocols

789
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,287
We sure thought

790
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Protocols

791
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,623
Score

792
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,535
If you can if you can take a whiff

793
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,863
Anolon a softball question like that that is how you do it

794
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,655
Wow that's pretty bad

795
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:55,679
I think

796
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,263
I think there are some people who don't know what

797
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Ton

798
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
Maybe maybe you're a layperson

799
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:03,615
You may not know

800
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,175
About the alcohol Protocols of the Elders of Zion

801
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:11,295
Maybe you don't know about it or maybe you've heard of it I don't know who wrote that I have no idea

802
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,831
But if you're someone like Alex

803
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
Where do

804
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Plus

805
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
Of your audience

806
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,231
Believes that they're real

807
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
Mbara plan

808
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
To take over

809
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,095
Western culture or whatever

810
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,655
You have kind of a responsibility

811
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:27,679
Do you have a position

812
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,495
You could have the responsibility to

813
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
Especially if you're not

814
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
Convinced that they're real

815
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:36,127
To be able to tell this caller

816
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,199
No this is a forgery this was this is not real

817
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Complete yet

818
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:44,575
You can't just play like the game like I don't know maybe three Levi if not

819
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:48,415
I mean we did an entire episode on it the idea of somebody

820
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,207
Asking me like

821
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,255
Do you think that this methane text

822
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
To kind of

823
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
Hopefully do something about climate change

824
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,167
Is actually the Jewish protocols trying to kill us all

825
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
I would be like

826
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Listen

827
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,287
You got to use what you need

828
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
To believe what your

829
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Haha

830
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,359
That's probably it

831
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:11,711
I don't know what they could be

832
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:14,783
I'm not saying one way or the other I don't know

833
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
Familiar with what

834
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,087
You're talkin

835
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,647
You have responsibilities be familiar with it when you're

836
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
Do you know this

837
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
Deep into a career in conspiracy I would say

838
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,583
Especially when your worldview is essentially swapping out

839
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
Jewish people in the pros and cons

840
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,167
To be Elders of Zion and just putting in

841
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:33,215
Whatever I want envelopes

842
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,823
And I think also you have a responsibility when you recognize that this person is

843
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
Probably younger

844
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:44,223
You know you talkin about his dad and like an argument with his daddy sounds Kong

845
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:49,343
Like this is a this is not necessarily a person who's fully formed in a lot of ideas yet

846
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Your you're

847
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Just this responsibility that

848
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Just being

849
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Dropped

850
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,535
Disgusting weird

851
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
This

852
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,839
Sometimes going back

853
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,375
2003 is

854
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:04,191
Is on some of these calls you know you hear a younger voice

855
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,727
And you're almost like

856
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,799
Trappe eye or at least I suddenly have this like

857
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Cut 2

858
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
January

859
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,431
If this dude called

860
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:20,831
20 years ago it is entirely possibly like 3536 and he could be in there

861
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,135
You know like how I think that's

862
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Crazy

863
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,439
This dude could you

864
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Just calling Alex

865
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,743
F****** Jones

866
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
What happening this f*****

867
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,839
This guy wasn't there because

868
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,655
He was actually in court over firing

869
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,191
Hangover termination

870
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:38,751
He was he was trying to

871
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,823
That's better solid Alibi I'll give him that one

872
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
So Alex gets to this author

873
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,687
The guy who wrote Silent invasion

874
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
Again here's

875
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Yours is a

876
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Earlier

877
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
So Alex and Scott

878
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
Are there big point is that tyranny

879
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Is

880
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
Hear from you gotta face it

881
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,599
Sometimes even these dudes who do this deep research and stuff check

882
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,671
Sometimes even I can't believe how bad it hurts so bad it's

883
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
So bad

884
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:33,023
Urban Warfare

885
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
And now it's come out

886
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,487
Call absolutely

887
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,535
Don't have days where I don't want to believe

888
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,839
Days that where

889
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
You're going up in is America

890
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Believing in the ideals that are

891
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,727
I still to this day

892
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,495
Just sometime

893
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,775
Just wanted to go away but

894
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,591
Only lasts about three minutes and then I realized

895
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,431
And I think a lot of people

896
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
Just pulled out of my face

897
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,759
They can't be out there at the pond

898
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,807
United States of America this is

899
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
The beacon of freedom

900
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,111
Throughout the world or what used to be

901
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,231
I wanted to go away fretted

902
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,279
Took me a long time to

903
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
The grips with

904
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,143
The truth and I opening

905
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Experience

906
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,703
The showed him like what was

907
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,263
Crawling under the rock ignore

908
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,895
Did you see the rock on top of all the bugs underneath and what have you

909
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
Be kind of would expect that like

910
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
You know

911
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:02,879
Continuous path is a new world order researcher after this point after 2003

912
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,159
The word out like Alec

913
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,559
Scott's currently the host of a radio show and podcast about the Las Vegas Raiders

914
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:16,959
The NFL here seems like he's been pretty able to go back to

915
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
The Gruden situation

916
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,335
He's he's not too I don't know

917
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,359
Seems to have

918
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,895
Closest

919
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
Oh man

920
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,599
I think it is really f***** up though

921
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
That

922
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,183
The DHS is a horrific

923
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:37,951
Organization

924
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
He's right

925
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,071
But there's no kgv

926
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,119
There's no hidden

927
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,679
It's just it's just

928
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,703
Pop's attic

929
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Oh man

930
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Sure that's what it is

931
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:57,407
Yeah you're right it's just not a good book and sensationalizing it in the way that folks like Alex do doesn't deserve

932
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,943
Legitimate

933
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
Criticism

934
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
Just f***** up

935
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:08,671
Yep so they talked about immigration a little bit here and I think this is bad

936
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,351
Disease

937
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
Mexico

938
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,191
Telling mothers

939
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
Chico in Spanish

940
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
If your

941
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
You can get better care in the United

942
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,847
Go over the Border even if you're arrested

943
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,919
Because they know that once they cross over the Border

944
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,223
People can

945
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
Can have a child here

946
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
States in America

947
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Our hero but

948
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:56,287
Alex is just like pretty great replacement to eat

949
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:01,919
He's dumb people will vote the way the Democrats want them to and they've been great replacing us since the beginning

950
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Man

951
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,735
Yeah I why I think that sucks

952
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,807
I think it's a horrible perspective that Alex has

953
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,111
They're just

954
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,647
They're bringing in

955
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
Educated

956
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
Did people become

957
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
They know that

958
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,231
They won't learn

959
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
I don't know about freedom

960
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,047
I mean

961
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,583
Just what a name

962
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,607
Insane weight of

963
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,375
View people

964
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:25,983
I would I would suggest that if Freedom it actually does exist in any real sense

965
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
Everyone in

966
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
Inherently

967
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:28,799
He knows about it

968
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
You you would even Turtles

969
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,199
Viscerally be able to understand what freedom is

970
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Elaborate

971
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,575
Private property document you need to understand

972
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,135
In order for freedom to really be captured

973
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,695
I don't even I don't even mean to go to first grade

974
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,767
To know that when I'm in first grade I am not free

975
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,839
Trapped

976
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,119
School like that's

977
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,143
If you knew it

978
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,703
I also think it's like kind of too

979
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,007
Perspectives that you can take

980
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
America

981
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:04,383
If you hear that there are people let's say in Mexico who are being told that if they're pregnant

982
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
They should risk

983
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,967
Fleeing to the United States

984
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
And getting arrested

985
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,063
Because they get better Healthcare in order to

986
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Protect their child

987
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
You can go down the path of like

988
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
Look at these manipulative fuc

989
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:20,511
Or you can go the other direction and look at it like

990
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:23,839
Wow that is a terrible choice to have to make

991
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,399
What can we do about the situation

992
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,423
That exist

993
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:32,543
You know it's a difference of perspective to blame as opposed to

994
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,871
Address how can you hear that sentence of like

995
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:39,455
Here is the choice that someone is faced with when they get pregnant

996
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,479
Either

997
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
Maybe die Where You Are

998
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,599
Or maybe die somewhere else

999
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,671
But somewhere else maybe your baby has a better chance

1000
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,231
A slightly better chance

1001
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
There's no way to look at that

1002
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,583
In a rational way without going well

1003
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,887
Anybody who is just

1004
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,423
A b getting pregnant

1005
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,703
In existing

1006
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,751
At threat of death

1007
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,543
There's a huge problem there

1008
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
So before we ever even get

1009
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
To the United States

1010
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,663
What the f*** is going on

1011
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,503
Wait a second are you telling me that if you're trying to do better for your baby

1012
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
The country will just go

1013
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
We're going to have to

1014
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,855
Pick up you and then send you back to die

1015
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,903
That's f****** out of your attic

1016
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,951
Control may I present to you thought

1017
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
Freedom

1018
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,327
You know what I don't think anybody's free in those scenarios

1019
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,143
So Alex's dad as we know is

1020
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,703
And he's done some work for

1021
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
From CIA fellow

1022
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,007
But turns out he was

1023
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
A lot of clients

1024
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
So turns out

1025
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
Remarkable

1026
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:03,167
This to all people who could have information that Alex

1027
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,727
Hopefully there were any lieutenant colonel

1028
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,311
All the lieutenant colonel's got their Dentistry work done by Papa John

1029
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
Definitely

1030
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
Okay

1031
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Alright so

1032
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
1

1033
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,479
So the

1034
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
The check

1035
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
The checked Army

1036
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
Sure

1037
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,391
There at the border

1038
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
To invade the United States

1039
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:31,071
It's a shoot border people like a border patrol people

1040
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,607
On us soil

1041
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
That's part of the

1042
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
I mean just the Czech Republic get a cut

1043
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:38,239
Of the United States after they overthrown

1044
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:42,079
I don't think the Chinese and the Russian government are going to

1045
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:48,735
Carve out Iowa for the Czech Republic of Maine

1046
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
No sir

1047
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,391
I assume it's kind of a combined effort towards the Water World Government Shoreline

1048
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
At that point there will be

1049
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,207
Pecan trees

1050
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,559
Look at it from that prism from the larger perspective

1051
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,119
I think that Alex is telling the truth

1052
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
She's not

1053
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
Ucbh

1054
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,703
Trouble

1055
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:13,567
Oh yeah oh yeah this is got to be a violation of some confidentiality

1056
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:19,711
I mean everybody who goes to his dad should be in very big trouble like why are you going to Alex

1057
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,271
Jones of Infowars his father

1058
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,551
I'm telling him

1059
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
What do coral code

1060
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,695
Secrets is there a some kind of an agreement I don't know this

1061
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
Just listen here listening you would know

1062
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
I would have

1063
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:35,327
That there's some kind of a professional

1064
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,863
Navigation

1065
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,007
Like I do like if you're on the gas or whatever and you're like passed out stuff right

1066
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:46,591
Keep that to yourself like the doctor-patient confidentiality kind of

1067
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:49,663
I would think especially if you're the top border

1068
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:54,527
Pro person or in the CIA

1069
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:57,087
Wgno the videos where somebody's

1070
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:03,487
Driving their kid home and they're all drugged up from the dentist

1071
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:09,887
The dentist while you're drugged up in the chair although now I want to see a YouTube video

1072
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,727
The top guy in the CIAA

1073
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Why why don't we all just

1074
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
Her down

1075
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
And find out where

1076
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:21,663
The top people of all the organizations get their Dentistry

1077
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
Rhino

1078
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,247
Outdoor warehouse

1079
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,159
He gets around he's really good

1080
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:36,511
So this. Guy I did not think there was much

1081
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
To his

1082
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,327
Perspective is very

1083
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Standard

1084
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,679
Kind of un Invasion New World ordering on Sunday

1085
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,959
And I also didn't

1086
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,751
Feel like I had much respect

1087
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
For how he was describing his

1088
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
His process

1089
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,615
Yeah I had one of those one of the sources of my book

1090
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
He was very afraid

1091
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Compose

1092
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,759
Look

1093
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,831
But you don't want them until your kids anyway

1094
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,879
Either you're going to

1095
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
Quite get more people on

1096
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,743
All come together

1097
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
Country

1098
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,399
I don't trust you anymore

1099
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,215
Look I can't do the

1100
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,263
They're going to kill my kid

1101
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,567
I'm going to kill your kids

1102
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,615
If you don't put this in my pocket

1103
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
Yeah I think it's a little Boolean

1104
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:31,039
I don't I don't I don't feel like this is how you should treat sore suck you man

1105
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
You coward you loser

1106
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,927
I demand you produce the things that I know you must

1107
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,975
Cuz you're already assuming

1108
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,279
The Source materials

1109
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,071
And you're behaving as if

1110
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
This isn't how you

1111
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
This is not what the game is.

1112
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
That's very rude

1113
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
At the very least

1114
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,775
Is

1115
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Etiquette

1116
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,103
You know like a lot of having bad bathroom etiquette

1117
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
You know the

1118
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
I think a lot of the time it's generally

1119
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,271
Talk to people too much

1120
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
Reminder on business has the one specifically next to you and starts of a Converse

1121
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,951
Station

1122
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:13,023
Out of your out-of-pocket

1123
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:19,679
Am I think that Alex actually has a pretty decent complaint here if this did happen delay

1124
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
Globalist

1125
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,519
But you need to understand something

1126
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:30,175
Really want

1127
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
Larger one in there was wine

1128
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:06,015
I said

1129
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
On the record

1130
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,623
For the record

1131
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
Yeah man

1132
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,399
That would be

1133
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,191
The highlight of my life

1134
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:26,239
Hilarious

1135
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:31,359
I want to be in a bathroom so we're just suddenly be like you're Jordan

1136
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:38,015
Yes you will believe that if you're a listener the show and you ever run into Jordan in public

1137
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,111
Don't say we love your show

1138
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,903
Please say we're going to get

1139
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:46,975
Buggy rides at

1140
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
Otherwise

1141
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
Otherwise we won't know for

1142
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
For sure

1143
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,119
Based on Alex's stories about like

1144
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
Seeing demons

1145
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
Teleport in

1146
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,447
Into people and stuff

1147
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,471
I think that

1148
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:01,311
His credibility in terms of the details of the story or maybe a little bit sketchy

1149
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,127
I don't know who this guy is

1150
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:07,199
Was Lionel fella is but like if he has a good sense of humor

1151
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,015
Maybe he wasn't if he was joking

1152
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
Pasala Joker joking and I do happen to me and they were joking nothing like f*** you

1153
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
Dude

1154
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,631
Bump elbows you have a great time

1155
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Amazing

1156
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,703
But so that's

1157
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,727
That's a

1158
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Whatever the case

1159
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,615
Probably something rude happened in that bathroom and I'm not I'm not for it

1160
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:41,247
For some reason of Paula topkins ghost in the bathroom the monster in the bathroom B

1161
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
I think it was awful

1162
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
Freak Wharf

1163
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,367
Where he's he's like a

1164
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:50,719
You know that scene in horror movies where the guy goes up

1165
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
To the goes up to the sink

1166
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,791
Is it a real loan

1167
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,815
He's just like all man

1168
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,583
I just need to get

1169
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,887
The water on my sink.

1170
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:02,751
And he looks up in the map

1171
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,799
I realize one day I was in my own bathroom

1172
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,847
That if that were to occur

1173
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,639
The monster would have to say

1174
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,919
Excuse me

1175
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
F***

1176
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
After after

1177
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,599
We have this

1178
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
Protracted boring interview

1179
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
We Outta some more calls

1180
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
One of the things

1181
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
Started to notice

1182
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
He's especially during this.

1183
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
And even

1184
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
I'll tell the present day

1185
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
Alex has

1186
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
Like standard

1187
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,959
Call Ursula like

1188
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,287
Carlos is a guy who calls in all the time now

1189
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
House phone

1190
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,175
The reason that we could pick out something like old man house phone is

1191
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Because

1192
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,343
He called in a bunch and always got through there's this weird British guy who Alex seems to not like much

1193
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,879
Who calls in quite a bit

1194
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
But he gets through

1195
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
A lot

1196
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
And then

1197
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,007
New World Order

1198
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,847
The other conspiracy about polish Hot Dogs

1199
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:17,247
People putting ketchup on them a lot of thoughts about

1200
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,879
I want your origin story to have been

1201
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,927
Called in one time

1202
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,999
When you were real young and not remember the

1203
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:28,767
Exact date

1204
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,583
And then to discover it on the show that would be In Crowd

1205
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
First of all

1206
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
No thanks

1207
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,215
No.

1208
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,495
Don't think

1209
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:43,615
I want first of all I wasn't in Illinois

1210
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,919
I would have to be pretending to be in Illinois

1211
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:53,087
Missouri who's really into ska

1212
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:57,695
Then maybe maybe we will have a

1213
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,279
Conspiracy

1214
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Okay

1215
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:06,143
Is it cool to wear rainbow suspenders

1216
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,423
Get off the line kid

1217
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,007
What kind of ride is your favorite mine the Zoot Suit

1218
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
That's more sweet

1219
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,871
So we have one last trip here and I just think it's

1220
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,663
The bad summation of this episode

1221
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,647
Here are several

1222
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Yeah

1223
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,815
It was so good I'm going to re-air

1224
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
Your shows rebroadcast

1225
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,935
Wikipedia The Man episode of Seinfeld

1226
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:46,335
We're really going to play this one a lot

1227
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,151
Syndicated

1228
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
So dumb

1229
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,271
I think that this show is episode was a little bit light

1230
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,063
Oh and actual content

1231
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:01,439
Not a whole lot going on right but that cop story you think is pretty funny there and then

1232
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
Alex's

1233
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
Discussion of Harry Potter is

1234
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:11,167
Anytime we get a nice cultural Touchstone it's always really important

1235
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
You just experienced

1236
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,215
Whether it's

1237
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,799
His take on the Watchman for his take on

1238
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
Oblivion

1239
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,663
Other take on Oblivion

1240
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,527
There is an alternate universe where

1241
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,135
Fiscal is the guy on Infowars

1242
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
And Alex and Ebert

1243
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
I have been working together for you

1244
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:37,791
Sure I think that would be great that would be great Alex

1245
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
If Alex is

1246
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,351
Career does Fall Apart

1247
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
You know it,

1248
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,399
Months and years

1249
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
I would like to

1250
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,215
6th and Olive Branch

1251
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,055
Vodcast with him where we talk about movies

1252
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:54,175
He just talked about man what do you think this is about

1253
01:05:55,967 --> 01:06:00,063
I mean I would I would legitimately watch a movie with Alex

1254
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,599
And just be like okay

1255
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,647
Now I want you

1256
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,695

01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:08,511
Tell me what you remember happening in order

1258
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,071
I just want to see how your brain

1259
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,631
Yeah is this real

1260
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:20,799
What is real and what is not real secretly real or is this the nonfat

1261
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,663
Start a movie podcast

1262
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,199
Weeds first episode

1263
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
Dune

Round Table

1265
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:32,831
So Jordan

1266
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,391
We come to the end of this and I have to say that

1267
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
Harry Potter is evil don't read it

1268
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,255
Cuz if you do you'll get magical powers

1269
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
I would also like to say it

1270
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
1:35 a demon face

1271
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,863
Say no

1272
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
You have other plans

1273
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:49,215
It depends on it like ass at the very least ask

1274
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,031
The follow-up question like what type of

1275
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,359
Feasting upon demons or are you on the menu

1276
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
Definitely

1277
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Definitely

1278
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:03,807
But

1279
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:08,159
We are on Twitter that knowledge underscore fighting that go to bed Jordan

1280
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,167
Alex

1281
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,983
Birthstone colors
