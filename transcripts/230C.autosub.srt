00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:43,264
Not really all that much

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,544
Cuz this documentary doesn't really

00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:45,568
Adults

00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
It's different

24
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,992
Jumping off in the middle of

But for now let's go

59
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Two part three

60
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
Of our coverage of the apartment

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488
You are a

62
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
If you recall

63
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,792
Where we left off the last

64
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Episode Alex

65
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
Just got done lying

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
About the Federal Reserve

67
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
It's private

68
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
I told you

69
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
How the Federal Reserve System works

70
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
Now we'll jump it on

71
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Completely different topic

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,688
What you talking about

73
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
But

74
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
Immediately after

75
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
I mean camp

76
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,624
What Wall Street

77
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
Hijacked

78
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Everyone is

79
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Appointment

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Are there

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Gru

00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
American Pie

83
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,312
Their object

84
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,872
Single one of them is

85
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Every single one

86
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,712
Who are work

87
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Public

88
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
He's a member of Bilderberg

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Play exist

90
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,640
Trilateral commission put he left the group

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,296
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

92
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,440
Spell

93
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:46,048
What's unnecessary

94
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Because again

95
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
But there is no evidence

96
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
Is a CFR member on Wicca

97
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
Interpublic membership rolls on the counseling for relationships

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Bill and Chelsea Clinton

99
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,552
But Hillary is not

100
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,416
The trilateral commission member list from the time is also available online

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
Is not a member or former member of

102
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
The trilateral

103
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
So

104
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Also

105
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
Trilateral Commission

106
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
She also left

107
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
What information is it going off

108
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,927
That would help him is fake argument

109
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Just bring it up

110
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Make a member of the group or anyway remember the Cs

111
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,687
Maybe Alex

112
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,551
Much like Tim Geithner and Susan Rice

113
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:24,351
McDowell York

114
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,447

00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,927
Dismember CFR

118
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279

Efficiency apartment

124
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
McDonald was dead

125
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Member of

126
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,935
I don't think it means anything

127
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,311
My notes are my notes

128
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
Editorializing

129
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
How many more minutes before we just get all of your notes

130
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
All work and no play

131
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
Note

132
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,447
F*** this b**** documentary doesn't mean anything

133
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
But this is the closest of all these people

134
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
Closest

135
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,175
Because he was member the CFR and he was a member of trilateral commission

136
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,879
Special State Department Envoy

137
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,719

Jeremiah Henry Kissinger

140
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
Probably all of those things

141
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,471
Debate whether or not he's still a member of the CFR

142
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,495
She had left

143
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
The problem is

144
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,503
He wasn't special

145
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
One of them

146
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
Administration to go in there like big bad guys

147
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
He is

148
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,423
Genuinely evil

149
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:18,175
God you could just like why not like get rid of a couple of

Trilateral Commission

156
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,799
This is the first one that Alex is almost entirely right about

157
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,663
Hear it

158
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:54,271
But why doesn't Alex point out that he was a founding member of the trilateral commission

159
00:08:54,527 --> 00:09:00,671
Bored

160
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:04,511

This is the guy you bring it by you punch it

There's also former chairman of the Federal Reserve

In his role as the economic recovery chairperson

172
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,991
He felt that Tim Geithner was being real f****** rude to him

173
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:01,343
Keep him isolated from me

174
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023

00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,855
Nothing more reliable than done confirmed

201
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
That leads to an Infowars story that says

202
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,071
Infowars reporters Aaron and Paul Joseph Watson to receive confirmation

203
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,447
B-list a conference

205
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
There's no proof

206
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,407
Who is

207
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:05,759
Plus years after this documentary came out

208
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
Who gives a s***

From 2001-2003

220
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Northern Ireland

221
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Because

222
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,751
He's a member of the trilateral commission

223
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,847

00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:07,967

230
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Not a member of the trilateral

231
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,839

00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,975
Alan Greenspan

239
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,839
Even if you weren't advisor

Floribama

241
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,399
Alex like that

242
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
Alan Greenspan was a free-market kind of guy

243
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
Hated raising taxes

244
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,599
You should love if the idea that use an advisor for

245
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,135
Wasn't

246
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Alright

247
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
Alan Greenspan

248
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
Alex

00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
Him to do

250
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
But that's

251
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
Osher

252
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
FedEx

253
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
But not the things

254
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
Followed up on

255
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,175
Turn back

256
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
Let the outcome to take print

257
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Exactly

258
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Cuz you look like

259
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,207
State Department special Envoy Richardson

260
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
CFR

261
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
Finally

262
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:16,991
Oh s*** there was just a lot of balloons

263
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,903
All over again

264
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,183
Remember since at least two

265
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,023
I know that because the CFR

266
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
They put out a press release

267
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
Mission of the director of communications for the council

268
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,127
As a special representative for Afghanistan

269
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,455
Globalist

270
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:52,063
Boosting the agriculture sector in a sector in Afghanistan

00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Holbrook

00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,623
Diplomats

273
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
I can argue with

274
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,047
Holbrook was ultimately ineffective

275
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:10,239
So adorable

276
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:15,871
You've got a war in Afghanistan

277
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,199
I love that

278
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
You get a lot of points

279
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
If your last words of that

280
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831

Make make the world

284
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
And the list goes on and on

285
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,543
Petroglyphs

286
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,199
Three of the people that he listed in that group

287
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Are not even in the Obama Administration at all right

288
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,135
Is given the wrong title unscrew

289
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,743
I guess this night it was appointed by Bush

290
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,119
If you people who have left the trilateral commission is Alex being

291
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,519
3 really only got one of these people's description right at all and it Paul volcker and he didn't even mention that he was this

292
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
Don't understand

293
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Like this list is

294
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,479
Full of deception

295
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
Haribo

296
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,295
Also please consider this

297
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
It wasn't even Obama's entire cap

298
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,695
Who's just 13 people cherry-picked out of the hundreds that Obama had on his team

299
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,791
Unity been absolutely correct about each and every one of these people

300
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
Pictures that prove

301
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
It's just a drop in the ocean

302
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,983
There's 19

303
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
The main position

304
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,383
Out didn't mention any of them and they aren't members of any of those books

305
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,479
Directions to

Eric Holder

308
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Not member of any of these

309
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Groups right

310
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
That wouldn't

311
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,231
No

312
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,047
Vice president not member of any of these groups

00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:19,775
Labor secretary hour and a half

Is a member of those groups

316
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:30,783
We're going to start alphabetically with the entire population of the world

317
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
Aaron Rodgers

318
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
This is

319
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,375
This is

320
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Even if

321
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,055
Barack Obama

322
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,359
You're the most wonderful person in the world

323
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
And brought to power

324
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
Carryout

325
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
There

326
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,039
Citation needed

327
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
So far

328
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,647
You have proven nothing

329
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,439
Humanity must

330
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Look pass

331
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Obama

332
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
And realize

333
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,791
Presidents come and go

334
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Machado

335
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351

Continue

337
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,751
How could people be so stupid

338
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Gullible

339
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
To believe a bunch of

00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Politicususa

341
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943

Define Express

343
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
First of all son

344
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,527
The hatred

345
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,551
Bush Cheney

346
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,855
The desire to punish

347
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
The Republican

348
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,159
For their Adventures

349
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
State

350
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
And their record

351
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
The second Quest

352
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
Was on the economy

353
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Bushwick

354
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,119
Selling them

Regards

358
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,591
Really why Obama was

359
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Prepared

360
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Almost

361
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Did Obama is there

362
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
To frustrate

363
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
See all of those

364
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Those hopes

365
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Obama is

366
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,087
The cruel hoax

367
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
Real f****** b*******

368
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,023
Because

369
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,447
Negatives about the Republic

370
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,007
As opposed to positive about Obama

371
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
If some of the progressive policies he was in Decatur

372
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Torts

373
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:34,943
There's a strange world of everyone around him

374
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
Profoundly self-censor

375
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,783
Self-centered

376
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,135
Outside of its relation to themselves

377
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,231
Townspeople excited about the prospect of a bomb and liberal policies

378
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,535
He discussed

379
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
Which of the positive

380
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,983
Everything is good or bad is a response to what their side is doing

381
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Of any agent

382
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
We don't really

383
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Believer

384
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
You're not responding

385
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
How much we love guns

386
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
It's that same dumb thinking's it really is

387
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,391
Is a dead-end it's really

388
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Really talk

389
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,744
I'm stupid it's childish and self-centered to level two

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
It stinks

391
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,496
Like mad that I have a lip ring

392
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:36,896
Mohawk is the equivalent

393
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:45,088
The people who support

394
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,928
They do hate push but that's not what they're expressing

395
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,536
You are looking at only the negatives applied to you as opposed to the positive

396
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:55,072
Did exist externally

397
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,632
Because we're going to recognize those for a second

398
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,424
You would have to either

399
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
Debate those positive points

400
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Admit

401
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
You don't give a s***

402
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,312
And ignore those

403
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
Because you're a dumb f***

404
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
I

405
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Am so

406
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
So happy

407
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
That you watching

408
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Beforehand

409
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
Listen to that

410
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,320
And then

411
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
Spare time

412
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
Rioting in Ellicott

413
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,376
That is exactly what I thought

414
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Immediately

415
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
Because I'm

416
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:40,128
Waukee Wellness

417
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,224
Absolutely one hundred percent correct on all fronts

418
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,064
Thank you so much for avoiding me just going like

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,464
Value value in that response because it is it is

420
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Like

421
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Hitting the point of what

422
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
He's expressing

423
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
He's so important because it really does underlie

424
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
So much of this.

425
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,312
When we talked with Alex Jones

426
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
I don't

427
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
I don't know was that

428
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
I felt that in the back of my head for a really long time took

429
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,784
Something

430
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Oh that's what they're doing

431
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:28,000
It's a real and revealing moments

432
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
Nicole endpoint of that

433
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,752
Point Break before this was plenty calling everybody stupid

434
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:45,152
It's like the idea is exactly what I say

435
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
Everybody else

436
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
Euro Gyro

437
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
Reacting to what's real

438
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,416
You are not capable of agency yourself

439
00:23:56,672 --> 00:24:00,000
And the only way that you'll ever be capable

440
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,864
Reacting

441
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
Right you

442
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,272
White Anglo-Saxon Protestant

443
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,552
Straight

444
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Yeah

445
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
The only people

446
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:32,256
In our wake

447
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
The Ancient Aliens

448
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:43,008
The explanations of aliens created pyramids and stuff like that

449
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,336
All that really does is take agency away from non-white

450
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,176
The aliens built the parts

451
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
It's the same sort of

452
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,024
Go to Art in my quick or whatever I don't believe them to be

453
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Be capable

454
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Positive

455
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
Only reactive thought used at the directions

456
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,360
Which would be the equivalent Webster Tarpley saying these people

457
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:26,016
Did the Locking of bricks around to be devoting 40

458
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Boat over a mountain

459
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,208
You look at stuff like that

460
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,280
Just like it's hard to look at that be like

461
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:38,304
Oh you're a

462
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,912
Greatest really tough to hear that mentality

463
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,728
But again this is why

464
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
To break

465
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,592
Conditioning

466
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,616
To come out be like

467
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:56,224
Toughest ride to Institute fascism part of it is real

468
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,040
Failure of Ron Paul in the Fig

469
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
Principled libertarianism

470
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,392
Babies been around for

471
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,232
2016

472
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
And also why does he still have a show on the Genesis Communications

473
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,920
Isn't like

474
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,760
I mean I know he was a big role play

475
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Okay so anyway

476
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,464
Fungus shampoo

477
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Absolute

478
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
President

479
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,888
It is very disturbing to see well-meaning people

480
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,936
Falling for High-Tech propaganda

481
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
Over and over

482
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,640
11

483
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:00,992
American people a mess was swept into a mob psychology

484
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
Whatever the administration told them to

485
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,696
The general public eventually caught on to the fact

486
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,768
The George W Bush was a deceitful thought

487
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:19,936
Somebody's trying to make that he's leaving on Saturday

488
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:24,544
Where is Sparta

489
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,944
I don't like whatever they get something right in the wrong way

490
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
I was part of

491
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Bike protest

492
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
Communities around that time

493
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,832
I don't think anybody didn't know that

494
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:37,856
Bush was Africa

495
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,952
Selection with heartbreak

496
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,512
Before 911

497
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:48,864
It was literally all that happened

498
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,496
Like it's not like people didn't understand the game before 9

499
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,336
But people came together after because

500
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
The economy was in free fall

501
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
In the midst of it all right walk Obama

502
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:08,320
Speaking out against the abuse of the people at the

503
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Undercuts

504
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
Wench

505
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:27,776
No sir

506
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,360
What is your forehand

507
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,688
What is your window for coming out of nowhere

508
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
It's very small

509
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:41,600
Like

510
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:47,232
Surprise

511
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
I'm nobody's like

512
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
Wayne Gretzky got out at came here out of nowhere it was literally like

513
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,784
Barack Obama

514
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
But unfortunately

515
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
This was another vicious frog

516
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
I want to like

517
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
He is

518
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,656
2 seconds away from saying articulate

519
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
But you know what

520
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Is that at

521
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Free

522
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,288
Really really measure

523
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Quality of

524
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,872
Nope

525
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Put away all the flowery words

526
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
Put away all the rhetoric

527
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
When you put away all the rock

528
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,272
And roll music

529
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,672
Starting with

530
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
Notorious

531
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,536
You promised

532
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,560
He would get out of

533
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
Power

534
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
The Scotsman

535
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,032
And sure enough

536
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
Promises

537
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
What about the Dutchman

538
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,456
Mister Richard

539
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,976
But honestly who cares I actually said about

540
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,304
Official website

541
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,120
Machines

542
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,008
Must be careful

543
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:40,384
Immediately upon taking office military commander

544
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Ending the war

545
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
The removal of the troops

546
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:44,480
Will be responsible in space

547
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
DirecTV

548
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,344
Military commanders on the ground in consultation with the government

549
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,696
Military experts

550
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,976
At a pace of 12

551
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,816
That would remove all of them

552
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,376
That's where the 16-month number comes from

553
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,400
Promise

554
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:04,704
Bring everyone home with them.

555
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
But that it was a military expert

556
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:10,336
I believe it was possible to do responsive

557
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,664
Gotcha an estimation of both the mostest

558
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,944
Expedient and the most

559
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Responsible

560
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Absolutely

561
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,528
Buy NES

562
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
Estimation

563
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
Remove home

564
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:32,352
The troops

565
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
There's no way for Alex to know

566
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,664
Wait

567
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
Eight it is fascinating

568
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
It is fascinating

569
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
To watch this

570
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Aventurine

571
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
And remember

572
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Weir's

573
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,984
They're in there for

574
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,928
I remembered I was 19

575
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:40,448
High School in college

576
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,824
Which most people use to hire.

577
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
Eerily close

578
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
Amazing

579
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
All the palace intrigue

580
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
Every f****** day

581
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
Still doing this

582
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
We're still f****** doing

583
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:09,376
I mean I mean to the 2018

584
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,168
In the 2016 election

585
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,008
Nobody ran on ending the war in Iraq

586
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:22,176
Lip service

587
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
To talk about the present

588
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,784
Throwing bigger

589
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
People brought it up

590
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,744
Depressed

591
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
It's not something

592
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
We would like to be

593
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,960
Because you stopped

594
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
The doing this interview

595
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,544
Who's actually on

596
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,312
Right

597
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
Obama campaign

598
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
2008

599
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,480
Express

600
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,552
Little bottle could realistically withdrawal

601
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,096
The plans that he's able to make it.

602
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,144
Not the same

603
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
As well you'll be able to make one

604
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
To make a plan in March

605
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,824
2008

606
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,944
When the situation may change by January 2000

607
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Basically

608
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
Clarifying

609
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:35,136
She's just clarifying and she said that the 16-month window reflected a best-case scenario

610
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
Which I think is a fair way to put it

611
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
Obama promised

612
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,536
Like I don't think it's unfair.

613
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
But interesting

614
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:46,912
Based on the fact that Webster incorrectly

615
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,216
Is power doing an interview with a Scotsman

616
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
I know that

617
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,312
Did she also was no longer with the Obama

618
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,384
Having resigned in March 2008

619
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,944
Any immediate aftermath of her interview with the Scott

620
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
The problem was that you said

621
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
We f***** up in Ohio

622
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:06,880
In Ohio they're obsessed and Hillary is going to she's going to town with her

623
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Because you knows Ohio's the only place

624
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
The chicken wing

625
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
She's a monster 2

626
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
She's stupid to anything

627
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,584
If you're if you're poor

628
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,912
And she's telling you some story about Obama's going to take your job

629
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Maybe you'll be more effective

630
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:24,544
Reminder Tuesday to put forward is really unattractive

631
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
You know we have

632
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,816
Also where the Scotsman we don't give a s*** if you say is off the Record right

633
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,656
Obviously

634
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,152
Already knows that this is something

635
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:04,736
2008

636
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
Before

637
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,112
Use referencing an interview

638
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
It was John

639
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
On a different

640
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,256
Medium that he's reporting which is just her clarifying

641
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,584
The misconception about the position

642
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
He knows that

643
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Immediately

644
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
She ended up leaving the campaign

645
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,312
I rate this

646
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,736
Hundreds of speeches and interviews

647
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:43,136
Home from Iraq

648
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,208
If you'd said that that's what

649
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
Easiest Clipper Alex

650
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Pulling up

651
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:54,656
People ever after 6

652
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Yeah

653
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
The story

654
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
M16

655
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,016
It didn't change

656
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
It reflected the advice of

657
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
The people who he had hired

658
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
To advise right

659
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
Look at bring the truck home in 23 months

660
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,304
Washington Post

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400

Colon Obama weigh 23 months

663
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
23 months

664
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:36,640
But up in the up a little bit higher

665
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:46,368
Sherwood

666
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:56,096
Yeah Bunch since day one in this election

667
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,680
Understand

668
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,544
Because people more powerful than him.

669
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,456
We first released one not

670
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
What he saying

671
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:21,440
I love the just because I'm a Lovecraft fan

672
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,976
Powerful people brought

673
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:29,632
Do you know the case of Charles Dexter Ward

674
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,216
References I still haven't read it

675
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:39,360
Stop being able to raise the Dead

676
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
How dare you

677
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:45,504
Bring up something you can't bring back down

678
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,320
Like a raise

679
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,952
More powerful

680
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Did you relocate

681
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
Also in that

682
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:04,960
Text Rory

683
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Evolve

Charles Dexter Ward

685
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
2

686
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
To get some sleep

687
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,992
Read between the lines

688
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
That's not what you said

689
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:32,864
There is no military solution in a rock and there never was

690
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
I will begin

691
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,704
To remove our troops from Iraq

692
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
Immediately

693
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,056
Begin

694
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,616
Begin memes

695
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,152
Begin to

696
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,688
The process of it

697
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,064
This is not a demonstration of Ally

698
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,928
That's still beginning to remove the troops from Iraq

699
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,720
To physically bring someone

700
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,792
Consult with your expertise

701
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:07,424
It's not

702
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,496
Right lateral

703
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:18,176
Yes

704
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:22,784
Over there I don't care they're all getting slaughtered

705
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,112
So much in what's the best way to achieve

706
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,416
So much as they are in scoring points

707
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,440
Promise

708
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
It's just

709
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,728
It's a charade

710
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
Even if you want

711
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,848
2nd

712
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,920
Even though announce mission accomplished

713
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
How many times

714
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
Even then like

715
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,648
There's no way that are reasonable

716
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:03,232
Could say that just unilaterally removing all troops now

717
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:09,888
Is going to be a good dumbass

718
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,240
The idea of like

719
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:23,456
That is a great outcome have towards that outcomes that you are suggesting would lead to everyone dying

720
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,808
U-Pull

721
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
Just willing

722
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,928
To die in a much greater number than already has

723
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,512
Even even like

724
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,536
Let's go with

725
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:40,352
Funeral lateral action like that

726
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,448
Like I think a single-payer healthcare system is the best way to go

727
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,752
Congress

728
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,032
Tomorrow

729

730
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:56,223
Your Healthcare System

731
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
Tomorrow is a

732
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,087
Chaos

733
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,719
Results

734
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Does that

735
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
Hey being in a nice cool pool feels good

736
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,679
In wrong condition

737
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,775
If you jump you could have a heart attack

738
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,895
I have to find a way to

739
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:30,527
Is this

740
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,319
0

741
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,159
Singular individual

742
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,487
History

743
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,815
The idea of singular variable

744
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,655
External

745
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
Ideas

746
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,311
Write this is a failure of

747
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,591
I think comp

748
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,199
Group of Rome

749
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
Problematic

750
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
What bro

751
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
I apologize

752
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,791
Okay you can play whack-a-mole but you're not going to solve anything

753
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,583
Until you actually

754
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
Deal with the totality of the issue

755
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
Somehow that's both a

756
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
Critique

757
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
For these guys

758
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,103
Because they're dumb

759
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:33,759
That's best really boiled

760
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:39,647
We finally got a lot more listeners willingness to engage with

761
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Complex ideas

762
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
Insisting instead

763
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999

Go to the second page of Google

766
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,263
It makes you angry because I love it

767
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:59,359
It's weird to me

768
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
Excited for it

769
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,455
In-N-Out

770
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,551

772
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855

776
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,735
This is very important

777
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
Especially

00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903

00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
Radar station

783
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,175
Protect allies in Europe

784
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
Russian officials at Express

785
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:10,783
Ballistic missile

786
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,879
Obama and Russian president Medvedev

787
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,695
Did their missile experts

788
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:23,071
Conduct a joint review of the entire spectrum of means at our disposal that allow us

789
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Cooperate

790
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,167
The development of missile programs around the world

791
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,007
Obama was working on cooperating with Russian president

792
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,823
Jamaica region safer in ways that serve both

793
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Countries entry

794
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,431
To prevent this is some sort of integration toothbrushes complete bulshit

795
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,223
And even though this joint agreement was

796
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,527
Finalized until July 2009

797
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:47,135
News reports all over the place earlier in the year when I was working on the documentary

798
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,975
The testify to the fact Obama was trying to find a way to work together

799
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
The only reason for him to not know that

800
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:54,303
Is Wilfred

801
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
Wilbur Lake

802
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,351
Or he's lying

803
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
That's the only way around

804
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
This

805
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:02,751
To me seems more like

806
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,359
Medvedev and Obama

807
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,895
That is cooperate

808
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:09,919
Right

809
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
But

810
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,503
Nationalistic

811
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,447
Serbia

812
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:38,847
That narrative

813
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
The propaganda

814
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,919
List of Russia that we know today

815
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,759
I can't find any evidence

816
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
Like

817
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
To back that up

818
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:54,463
I'm not going

819
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,743
Once again

820
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:59,071
Automotive

821
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
It feels very

822
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,679
Weird feelings about Russia

823
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
General

824
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,519
But in terms of this documentary it also

825
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
Things like Occam's razor could tell us that it

826
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:16,479
It's just good enough

827
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,343
Quick question

828
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
Wood

829
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,631
Do Interceptor missiles actually work

830
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,239
Has anybody ever

831
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:42,079
Junito are released as a

832
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,871
Deterrent

833
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:48,735
Really hard to shoot missiles out of the sky because I don't think

834
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:53,343
Tiny little bird

835
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,183
Not small planes

836
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:04,351
Technology does exist

837
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
You could shoot down

838
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,167
I believe that

839
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,519
There's a little bit of a

840
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,687
You don't know all the technology I have

841
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,991
Here you don't want to waste your Rockets

842
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:27,391
With the idea that I might be

843
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,743
And so on

844
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,279
Weather

845
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,471
Everything that I've ever read about Interceptor missiles

846
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
It's like a success rate

847
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Like

848
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:52,479
Whether or not

849
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Sweetheart

850
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
Yeah

851
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
I don't know

852
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,951
I know you don't know the answer to

853
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
I was just kind of hoping that maybe

854
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,327
Like maybe a vice

855
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,959
I no longer like quick question

856
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
You have ruined them for me

857
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
Only logged

858
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,687
Fascist creep

859
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,223
Who does the best nature

860
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
Ushanka

861
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Ukraine

862
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
What's Jacques beauty or Georgia

863
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:40,607
Your time to remember a payroll

864
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
This is worse than

865
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
Bush and Cheney

866
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031
Brudzinski's

867
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Soros

868
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,895
And the other people running

869
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:59,295
That is the only time throws his name is mentioned in any way in this documentary

870
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:04,671
Because with the ID the Webster Tarpley is coming

871
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
Why wasn't demonstration

872
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,863
Kissinger in their house

873
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
Why didn't you throw

874
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,287
Because he's not someone who's on Alex's radar in

875
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
A 2009

876
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
I mean

877
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
What's purple

878
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
Lyndon larouche guy

879
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,623
Two things about this clip so far

880
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,951
How many more places are we going to interview

881
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,255
Carplay

882
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
Like this is

883
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:45,887
Crazy

884
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,263
Outside the hotel

885
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
It's the same place

886
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,991
Because because our listeners can't see the eclipse

887
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:07,391
Another one of those fashion

888
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:17,887
Now I'm one of the best

889
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:26,079
Whatever version of you

890
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,895
It's whatever version the Oval Office whose country has

891
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,199
He's on the phone and he's just kind of

892
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:41,951
If you're going to play

893
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:48,351
Better if

894
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,287
Just a shame

895
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,127
All this stuff like I think it's kind of outside

896
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,151
Our purposes

897
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:05,503
The political situation in Eastern Europe

898
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
2000

899
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
I was going to leave that alone for now just cuz

900
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
May I was outside

901
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
All safe

902
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
Zach

903
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,815
Around Russia

904
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,351
What that was predicated on

905
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,911
Is the idea that Obama was putting missiles around Russia

906
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:24,191
That's absolutely not true

907
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,519
That's the most important

908
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,311
I don't care

909
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
For good or ill

910
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,479
Because it's alright

911
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,503
And even then

912
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,807
They specifically point out that he's putting

913
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,879
Interceptor Interceptor missiles

914
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,647
Which

915
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,695
By their very definition

916
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
Ardis

917
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
Expensive

918
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,143
I don't know if you can or not

919
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,679
You can't just like launch

920
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
An interceptor missile

921
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
It seems like you would have Disturbed

922
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,735
Obama School

923
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,135
Bernie Sanders

924
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,767
Bush Administration

925
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Real quick

926
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
A couple things

927
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:35,359
He just said that oversight

928
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,895
About government survey

929
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
Be meaningless though I don't really know

930
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,343
Re-examine The Patriot

931
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Going to get rid of it

932
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
Voted for it

933
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,583
Renewal

934
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
By no means are we going to

935
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:14,271
But also. Onscreen Alex's pushed up this

936
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,111
To Post article

937
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:22,463
Intelligence

938
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,999
Necessarily

939
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:29,119
So you trying to make this about the idea

940
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
It's complicated

941
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:41,919
On that one

942
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
Is that

943
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,807
Wood

944
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
I would

945
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,903
Posit that the debate on Obama

946
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,927
This presidency

947
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
Twenty years from now

948
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:55,999
He's going to be

949
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,279
Far more fascinating

950
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,679
Even then the debate on Obama.

951
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,703
It will be

952
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
His

953
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,543
His legacy will be so interesting

954
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,663
Work through on a line-by-line ones were out of Crisis that were

955
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,967
Very hard for us to have

956
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,551
The gift of insight or Force

957
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
Chaos

958
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,423
This was made two months into his

959
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,239
So like when they're saying he's not out lying

960
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Not that they're wrong

961
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
Totally

962
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,135
Because that hasn't happened

963
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Obama pledged

964
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Filibuster

965
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
To give retroactive

966
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Telephone

967
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
The telecoms

968
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
Except

969
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,495
For that bill

970
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,775
He's right

971
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
Neural network

972
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,663
Pickled Angel City downtown

973
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,687
To reinstate

974
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Patriot Act

975
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Wiretap

976
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,551
Candidate Obama told

977
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
Brick Factory workers in speech after speech

978
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:30,719
Negotiating

979
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
A mistake

980
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,655
But then

981
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,935
Top corporate leaders

982
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
And then it was just campaign rhetoric

983
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:50,687
We got one

984
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:55,551
Wilford Brimley

985
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,391
Webster

986
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:05,791
This article

987
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,863
Canadian news organization

988
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,447
More about this and then I'll explain what

989
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,775
Obama saying you know I'm against

990
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,127
We had Austin

991
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Rhetoric

992
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
President

993
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:35,743
I forgot this is also still a news article

994
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,071
Was publicly criticizing the North American Free Trade Agreement

995
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
In a bin for boats

996
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,679
But privately worry about it

997
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,847
Custom piece of b******* Webster Tarpley

998
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
News reports

999
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,943
That were erroneous

1000
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,503
This is absolutely

1001
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,135
Yeah

1002
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:09,535
Anything to drink 2018

1003
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,839
Is going around telling people in Canada

1004
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:21,567
Local access

1005
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,407
He was just insisting that it needed to be improved to add labor and environmental

1006
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,431
Protection

1007
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:30,015
The campaign Trail

1008
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,159
Diplomat

1009
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:41,791
True and most likely was actually a coordinated smear against Obamacare

1010
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,375
The story that Alex plashes up on some

1011
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,239
They reported on February 27th

1012
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,055
But there was a memo

1013
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
Contact empathy

1014
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:58,431
And told them that Obama's rhetoric was just quote political maneuvering

1015
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,735
In the Fallout from the story being

1016
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
Obama's campaign

1017
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,319
The Canadian embassy

1018
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
No record

1019
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,647
To be found of Obama advisor

1020
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
Their contact info

1021
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Canadian embassy

1022
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,999
There's no record of transcript anywhere to be found

1023
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,815
This was days before the Ohio primary

1024
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,863
Place where

1025
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:23,519
To both Clinton and Obama

1026
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
To being about

1027
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:32,991
Visiting the Canadian consulate

1028
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
Chicago

1029
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,415
Palatka

1030
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,679
Likely change because go visit consulate on February

1031
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
And after weather topic

1032
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
Take the came up

1033
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:00,383
When the full meeting with offer

1034
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Included this

1035
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:08,063
On Master Goolsby suggested that Obama is less about Sunday mentally changing the agreement

1036
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Clarifying

1037
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,927
Labor Mobility

1038
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,767
Established

1039
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,583
That's pretty much exactly what Obama was saying

1040
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,935
They're also part of that quote

1041
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,471
Political maneuvering,

1042
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,103
Even close to that

1043
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,895
It was an inappropriate

1044
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,687
Made by whoever had written that were

1045
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
The Canadian in

1046
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
Embassy issued in

1047
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
An apology that same day on March 3rd

1048
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
In the recent report

1049
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,927
Produced by the consul General in Chicago

1050
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:50,047
There was no intention to convey the senator Obama

1051
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,095
A different position

1052
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
Computer Express

1053
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,399
Private including about

1054
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,471
We deeply regret any inference the could have been drawn out

1055
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,567
In the Fallout accusations were made

1056
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:05,407
The chief staff staff of the conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper

1057
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,479
I've been behind the week with interest

1058
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Interfering

1059
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,831
Whatever the case is and whoever was behind

1060
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,391
Which is still to some extent unclear

1061
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
This is a situation where

1062
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
Emily

1063
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,095
Hillary would go on to win the Ohio primary because of this mirror

1064
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
Most likely

1065
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
It's hard to say

1066
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:30,239
Obama was gaining ground had a chance to win

1067
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:34,079
And in the aftermath of that she did end up winning the Ohio

1068
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:41,247
Pointless to re-litigate that to some extent because of how it is.

1069
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,527
Even though.

1070
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,599
To come out about it just me Obama on the general

1071
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
It's

1072
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Goolsby.

1073
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:09,663
In order to paint the picture that Obama was a flip-flop

1074
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,223
And now we have Alex

1075
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,759
By this point

1076
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,087
It when he's making this documentary all the information is there

1077
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,647
Like you should know that this isn't something

1078
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
That is

1079
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
Isn't right

1080
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
4

1081
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,327
Public toilet

1082
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,191
Even going even going down to the staff

1083
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,751
Don't have a cartoonishly evil name

1084
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:39,615
Goolsby I don't want to be that guy

1085
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:42,687
I don't want to tell you that you have to change

1086
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:49,087
Come on man you can't be cool course you're going to be in a f****** controversy

1087
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Gold

1088
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,999
The moment they said that conspiracy theory and you said

1089
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,303
There's probably some truth to that

1090
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,351
Canadian

1091
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,751
Little bit

1092
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:13,151
Animalistic visceral she probably took

1093
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:18,015
Distrust of ghosts

1094
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,039
I just trust

1095
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:24,159
Acrostic

1096
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,095
Let's move on

1097
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,143
You Google

1098
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,215
No he didn't

1099
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,007
Experiment

1100
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Parents

1101
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
In about

1102
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
Haircut

1103
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
Not have

1104
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
Pavlova

1105
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
He said he was

1106
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Clean up governor

1107
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,551
He said he was going to work for

1108
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,599
You're laughing about

1109
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:58,975
You're laughing about Dave Chappelle that deceiver with Obama being pi

1110
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,047
Like Obama's silhouette being the eyes to fever

1111
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:06,399
It's clunky as hell I thought they were like

1112
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,471
Really was like

1113
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
We trying to spell December I honestly doubt the first two times I watch this documentary

1114
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:22,271
It looks like instead of Obama being

1115
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
It's

1116
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,695
Terrible

1117
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:31,743
Visual Arts

1118
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,839
Another part of the

1119
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Legitimately

1120
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,471
What I was doing

1121
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,775
What are the points of the documentary

1122
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:48,383
I would end up watching like three minutes and then have to walk to the bathroom and look in the mirror

1123
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:53,503
What am I doing

1124
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
It took a payoff

1125
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,415
You probably took me

1126
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:09,119
Now I got to read a wrestling article

1127
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,775
Casino

1128
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
Point B

1129
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:20,895
First

1130
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,663
Month

1131
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,455
Of his inauguration

1132
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
He has lied

1133
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
Beat It

1134
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,487
No obligation to respond

1135
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:41,887
Complaints to Georgetown

1136
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Campaign promises

1137
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,007
Some of it is fairly

1138
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,823
Like the idea of

1139
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,479
Fair Credit

1140
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,831
It is so unfair

1141
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
It's nonsense

1142
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:09,279
Bulshit

1143
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
2 months

1144
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,775
Kept getting this feeling

1145
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,823
Overwhelming

1146
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,895
Trying to figure out

1147
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
What they think

1148
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
2 months into his term

1149
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
Is a futile

1150
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,391
Baby baby

1151
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
Probably

1152
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:40,767
Exercise

1153
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:46,399
Breaking All the promises don't matter on the primer

1154
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,959
Started making this documentary

1155
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:55,359
What I've realized from this

1156
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,919
Finish the documentary

1157
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:02,015
16 hour days

1158
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,575
I guarantee first of all I worked harder on this then

1159
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,023
So much of it is padded

1160
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,559
Filler from like

1161
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Endgame

1162
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,887
A lot of it is stuff that is just like

1163
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,031
I guarantee

1164
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,591
No matter who won he was going to make this documentary

1165
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
Absolutely matters

1166
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:39,135
Is responsive that would be like of course I would have.

1167
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,487
He's making rely on the specifics

1168
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,535
Of what Obama has done

1169
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,071
Who he put into

1170
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Position

1171
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:50,143
And it doesn't matter

1172
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
I look at this and I'm like

1173
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:57,311
This is the

1174
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,335
Francis Trucking

1175
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,359
Anything in the world

1176
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:02,175
Makes me feel gross that were covering

1177
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:09,599
Level

1178
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:19,327
One one thing that this makes eminently clear and I've already been on this trip and I've said it

1179
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
Seriously and loudly

1180
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,447
These people are

1181
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,471
Well

1182
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:32,383
They're probably delicious

1183
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:40,831
Flank

1184
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,927
The futility of arguing with somebody

1185
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,231
In this kind of

1186
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
Like what

1187
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,983
Why would you watch this documentary and then think will going on Fox News to get my point out there's going to make

1188
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,287
Know these people decide

1189
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,943
Years before you showed up on there was going to be

1190
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,367
Turn office light

1191
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,415
45 days

1192
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:23,327
It's 45 days when the documentary was released was finished

1193
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:28,703
No

1194
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:33,823
-10 days before he was inaugurated

1195
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,151
I do know how to take this.

1196
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:42,271
Valid criticisms

1197
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,063
I can't take this seriously

1198
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
Yeah

1199
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:55,839
This is going to help me much more than endgame really pisses me off

1200
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,375
8 1/2 hours ago

1201
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,215
I really miss Obama backwards back when you were at home

1202
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:10,175
This documentary

1203
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:20,927
Early first episode

1204
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,743
When I was going through

1205
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,559
From those those peaches

1206
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
Because

1207
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
Really interesting

1208
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
To listen to

1209
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
Oh that's what you're getting

1210
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,967
It's not just like hey

1211
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,039
Those people in the back in the media they f****** suck

1212
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:54,975
Hey baby maybe an old Jew

1213
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:59,839
Get some of these Second Amendment people

1214
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,863
I forget

1215
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,143
Trump was president

1216
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,823
The podcast

1217
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,151
Can I watch a movie

1218
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,943
I forgot how

1219
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:18,015
Really great speeches work

1220
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:23,135
The people of the United States in the world

1221
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:25,951
Or filled with Pope that Obama was the real deal

1222
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,743
In office

1223
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
She signed an executive order

1224
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
Supposedly closing Guantanamo Bay

1225
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,607
Another Secret

1226
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:36,447
Then the Press actually had a chance to read the executive order

1227
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,727
And we're shocked

1228
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Define

1229
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:44,383
Was thinking about closing Guantanamo in the year

1230
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,735
How much does an Obama signs executive order signing

1231
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:53,855
Thinking about closing Guantanamo orders that are like

1232
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,135
That's a diarrhea

1233
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,999
Number 4000

1234
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,279
300 or actually

1235
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:07,679
Earlier

1236
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,775
11000

1237
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,567
You can't be like

1238
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:19,967
Having a nice meal for Logix 800-1000

1239
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
I'm thinking Arby's

1240
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,879
Brandon Florida

1241
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
I had a dream about

1242
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:33,023
Bears

1243
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Know what that

1244
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,095
I don't understand what Alex is trying to

1245
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,143
Ludacris

1246
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
President of

1247
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
Country

1248
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,055
Persuade

1249
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,175
F****** stupid

1250
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:54,015
All we did was cry

1251
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,551
Closing Guantanamo

1252
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:56,831
In reality

1253
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,903
You signed executive order 13 490

1254
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,719
Explicit timetable

1255
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
Close Guantanamo

1256
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
And relocate

1257
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:05,791
People being held

1258
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:10,143
Now admittedly they ended up blowing it in terms of actually falling that timetable

1259
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447
March

1260
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:18,847
This substance of the actual executive order sets of timetable

1261
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
When they're going

1262
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
Reevaluate the position of all the

1263
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,223
People who are out there

1264
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
And also reinforces the idea

1265
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,087
Right

1266
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
This refers to

1267
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,255
Alright but worst of all

1268
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,839
The executive order continue the practice

1269
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,143
What's the yellow X called

1270
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,423
Secret abduction

1271
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:49,567
Because that's the day

1272
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,871
It's not in the executive

1273
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:57,759
Executive order

1274
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:01,599
Hey also let's stop right

1275
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,159
I wish I wish

1276
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,695
Never

1277
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Isn't expect

1278
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
To be like a compound executive orders

1279
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:14,911
Something is not even part of

1280
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,263
The most

1281
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
Celia Cruz

1282
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,871
He's made of Obamacare

1283
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:28,735
Having sex

1284
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
Dictator powers

1285
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:33,087
Closer to our version of like

1286
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
Mirror socialist left

1287
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:42,815
Later on explicitly say you should nationalize the Federal Reserve

1288
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:52,799
But yeah it's so you want to have closing

1289
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,591
How did Obama do that

1290
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
He just says

1291
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,503
Who can just

1292
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Whatever you want

1293
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:10,207
Consequences

1294
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
Who you are now releasing

1295
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:24,287
Soccer players

1296
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,615
If you are at

1297
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,151
Yeah I do whatever

1298
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:33,759
If you are a terrorist that is been held indefinitely

1299
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:35,551
Force-fed

1300
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:40,159
You are not going to suddenly be released

1301
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:45,791
Now I'm not a terrorist the whole reason to close it is because

1302
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:50,399
If the Earth because they knew that there were so many people that they were holding

1303
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,471
The f****** win

1304
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,479
Because that is a

1305
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:09,087
For the pizza

1306
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:13,695
Call Reese mobile

1307
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,511
Consider

1308
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,279
That

1309
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,327
Like what

1310
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Is forcing the issue

1311
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,143
U2

1312
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,543
Actually I would say

1313
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,615
Let's go ahead

1314
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,455
Myself in a circle actually think you probably should have

1315
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,271
Just released everybody and let the chips

1316
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:44,159
At least then maybe he wouldn't

1317
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,695
Think that he signed off the

1318
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
Immediately on

1319
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,231
Closing

1320
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
But he's allowing

1321
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
Prisoners now.

1322
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,071
Taking Safari

1323
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
Countries

1324
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,399
Not knowing where were there Sunday

1325
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,191
Detroit shooting

1326
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:56,959
Borinquen

1327
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,495
They don't notice

1328
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,871
Obama is now continuing the practice

1329
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,687
Record prison

1330
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,223
And most important

1331
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,527
Indefinite detention without

1332
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
Trial

1333
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,951
Which you will be for a scam

1334
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:24,351
Recorders that proof that the Bush Administration was ordering Personnel the systematically abused

1335
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,167
Barack Obama

1336
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,591
The program was important National Security

1337
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,895
Not only endorsing Bush's crimes

1338
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,175
But continuing them

1339
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:45,087
But the ACLU Alex's referencing the ACLU

1340
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:49,695
Alex

1341
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,095
Makes no sense

1342
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,631
Cuz by the time

1343
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:00,447
Like by 2009

1344
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,239
For president

1345
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,519
Administration

1346
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,055
Position was pro-torture

1347
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
What's debate about it

1348
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:09,919
Ministration

1349
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
Didn't really give a s*** about it

1350
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
I took a lot of activists

1351
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
No

1352
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:19,135
Now

1353
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:27,071
Columbia Missouri

1354
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:30,143
What are we doing

1355
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,935
The revelation of the torture was like

1356
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,751
Profoundly impact

1357
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,359
In 2009 Alex

1358
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,663
Is it like Obama is trying to

1359
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,199
Block these.

1360
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Coming out

1361
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:47,807
In some way to empty it's an aisle

1362
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,599
Did Bush torture people

1363
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,791
Obama was clear on his position that he would end torturing

1364
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:59,327
Absolutely

1365
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,607
Some of the

1366
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
Gray areas about

1367
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,679
Third countries

1368
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,703
I'm stuff like that

1369
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
Eastbay

1370
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:09,311
2 degree

1371
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,175
But it's

1372
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:18,015
You made it so that American

1373
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:23,135
You did kind of Outsource it though so I'm not exactly right

1374
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,303
U-Haul

1375
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,095
That you just do none of it

1376
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:38,751
Obama presidency that we are going to re-litigate

1377
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,519
Twenty years from now

1378
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Incremental

1379
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:49,503
Morally acceptable

1380
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,551
Forward progress

1381
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
Consistent

1382
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:59,743
What you do today is a building block for what happens tomorrow and what happens the next

1383
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,047
It is like

1384
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
Okay we can achieve everything

1385
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
Swallow

1386
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
Pill that we don't want

1387
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
It sucks

1388
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
But it is what's best

1389
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
4

1390
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,640
Maintaining a haystack

1391
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
Appropriate status quo

1392
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:25,344
I know that

1393
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,904
Calculation we're not taking into account how much

1394
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
That is still

1395
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,208
Horribly abused

1396
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,096
X Xbox One

1397
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
X + 2x + 3x + 4x

1398
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,168
X + 5

1399
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:39,936
Expose

1400
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,264
Or whatever you get to a point where it's not

1401
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Hurting arrest

1402
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,080
Exactly you working

1403
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:49,408
But since Xbox One

1404
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
It means nothing

1405
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
Probably matter

1406
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:00,928
Maybe that's the true reality that we learn about compromise

1407
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:06,560
Power exists in your hands for

1408
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,864
A certain amount of time

1409
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:12,192
Preserve that power bi

1410
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,728
Is only serving the entry

1411
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Chris

1412
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,776
People who agree

1413
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
The exact off

1414
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,592
When

1415
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,872
You are someone who is like

1416
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
We shouldn't

1417
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,200
Kill people

1418
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,368
The power that you have

1419
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,648
You have it

1420
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
To confirm

1421
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,208
Because you had the powers

1422
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280
Right I don't know it's hard

1423
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,840
I think my

1424
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:43,424
If I were a

1425
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,960
History

1426
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,240
Masters

1427
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:48,800
Two graves

1428
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,992
I would definitely right about how

1429
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,296
The first two years of Obama's presidency was

1430
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,064
Probably the

1431
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
Here's where the linchpin

1432
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:11,584
88

1433
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,888
Sensitive

1434
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,424
History

1435
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Don't worry about it

1436
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,824
Obama was trying to protect

1437
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
The Secret of bush

1438
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,896
And that's not fair

1439
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,432
Because the tickets are already at

1440
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,272
Search impossible that's what his motivation

1441
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:34,624
In reality if you look into this Obama threatened to limit intelligence share with

1442
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,440
United Kingdom information

1443
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,744
But not because it revealed torture

1444
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,352
But because it would reveal some of the information that was gathered through the course of the interrogator

1445
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,400
Now I still don't think that's

1446
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
Right

1447
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,776
Write a very different scenario than what Alex is painting

1448
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,056
He's not trying to

1449
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Protect bush

1450
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:56,128
Or the idea that we torture people

1451
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,408
We already owned up to

1452
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,200
Right

1453
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
About it

1454
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,784
He's trying to protect the idea that there is some information

1455
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,576
That was gathered from a

1456
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,624
Interrogations of people that would be released

1457
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:07,904
If the British

1458
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,208
Put these rats

1459
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
Some people have speculated that

1460
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,304
Contained in that information

1461
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,376
Have released

1462
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,168
Information that Obama

1463
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
It's not

1464
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,520
Entirely clear that's just something

1465
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
But

1466
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,360
If that's the case then that's a really good

1467
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
I don't know

1468
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,176
I don't know

1469
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,672
Because he's what

1470
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,000
Just like with our last documentary

1471
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
Forgetting

1472
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:48,096
That we are watching it.

1473
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
Just a

1474
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,656
This is a series of like

1475
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:55,264
Visual

1476
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
Very little relationship

1477
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,176
Just kind of Freewheel

1478
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
Obama voting

1479
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,016
For reinstatement of

1480
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Zerli.

1481
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
He's already

1482
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,136
Subway

1483
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:21,888
2000's hit early

1484
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,936
Nevermind

1485
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,496
People that have been charged with

1486
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,032
Beach Washington

1487
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,176
Cover all of Obama's lies

1488
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,736
This documentary would never be released

1489
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:44,672
I love the idea that the makers of this film

1490
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,792
It would be long

1491
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
It's crazy

1492
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
That way like

1493
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,848
Like I got f****** hire to do voiceover work

1494
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,152
Because there are new ones every day

1495
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,736
We're going to cover one more big

1496
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,576
Black Edition worth

1497
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:18,976
Keeping out of administration within hours of being

1498
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:19,744
Collected

1499
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,280
Obama did a 180

1500
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,840
Distilled white house in Federal

1501
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,168
At all levels

1502
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:30,240
On the campaign Trail

1503
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,080
Did industries that they

1504
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:45,856
Documentaries

1505
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,672
Were people

1506
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
Lobbyist

1507
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
Reviled

1508
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,520
Power of the executive order

1509
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:07,616
Or any front

1510
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:11,456
And I wish you would have stuck with that commitment but ultimately

1511
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,224
Oprah

1512
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
And I always had this big of a problem

1513
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,368
I can't imagine how he feels about what Trump

1514
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,952
I know I know

1515
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,744
I know that like

1516
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,584
Idealism and we wish would be

1517
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,120
Be true is so caught up

1518
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
Certain extent

1519
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
Because

1520
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,496
You know we we wish that this had been

1521
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,264
Vindicate

1522
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,080
Right but if you look at almost every president ever

1523
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,384
Special interest

1524
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,688
Right

1525
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,016
So Alex is going to get into some of the lobbyists

1526
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
That were involved

1527
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,856
Obama's campaign

1528
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,160
Are they all on the council for relationships

1529
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,280
But some of these are interesting

1530
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:59,328
Example

1531
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,096
Terrible

1532
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,448
Obama pick William Lin

1533
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
The top lobbyist for Raytheon

1534
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,032
The building number two position of the

1535
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,312
Department of Defense

1536
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
So you did

1537
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,664
He looks like he's a robot

1538
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,528
It looks like a robot

1539
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:37,216
It's definitely not a good looks

1540
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,008
Years in the past

1541
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,544
The argument was

1542
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
He was very

1543
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,080
Qualified

1544
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
For the position

1545
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,896
He was also

1546
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,432
An undersecretary for defense

1547
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,712
1997

1548
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
2001

1549
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:52,320
He also been a senior fellow with the national

1550
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,368
University

1551
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:00,000
The job in his waiver was specified that he not be able to work in any matters that relate to

1552
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,024
Did any of the six

1553
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,072
Did he previously been a Lobby

1554
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,608
Is that good enough

1555
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Probably not

1556
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,960
That is your first example

1557
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:11,776
Probably have a weak argument

1558
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,056
Probably

1559
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:13,824
Because I

1560
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:14,848
You could

1561
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:19,712
I want any I don't want anybody who has a financial interest

1562
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,392
William Lynn would be a very qualified

1563
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
BT undersecretaries

1564
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,952
Like I get it

1565
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,488
Understand

1566
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,304
If there is oversight

1567
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,096
Where do stuff like

1568
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
You get out of line

1569
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,472
I don't

1570
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
In that role

1571
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
I don't know

1572
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:45,312
I still would say I

1573
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,104
It's that is that ultimate question

1574
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,152
It's like you have someone who has

1575
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
A good resume

1576
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Re-qualify

1577
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Applications

1578
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Good for the job

1579
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,552
Do you

1580
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
Surprise yourself

1581
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,648
Of their experience

1582
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
Because of

1583
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,208
The former job

1584
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,744
I don't know the answer

1585
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,512
For that question

1586
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
There's probably equally qualified

1587
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,096
But maybe they didn't click

1588
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,888
With the other people who were involved

1589
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,680
I don't know

1590
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,216
It's not my decision to make

1591
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:15,008
Alex is kind of fine

1592
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:19,360
I would say there's another decent point

1593
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,896
Phuket never going to get his body

1594
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
Exactly

1595
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,200
Timothy Geithner

1596
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:28,064
Former president of New York

1597
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,600
Secretary of the Treasury

1598
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,880
That's a terrible animes

1599
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,256
Looks like

1600
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,048
Like his chief of staff

1601
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,072
Mark Patterson

1602
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,888
Formerly the top lobbyist

1603
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:44,960
Like I said there was never a lot

1604
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,520
The president of the New York Federal Reserve

1605
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,360
Mark Patterson works at Goldman left the Furminator

1606
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,384
April 2008

1607
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,176
It's probably not enough time separation

1608
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:54,944
Confirm

1609
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,528
But they thought he was well qualified for the position

1610
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:02,624
Who's the Democratic staff director and chief counsel for the Senate Finance

1611
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:05,184
Committee from 1995 to 1999

1612
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,720
Enter 1999

1613
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:09,024
2004 you the policy director for Senate

1614
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:16,704
He's only a Lobby unqualified forthright

1615
01:30:17,472 --> 01:30:18,752
Yeah I don't know but also

1616
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:22,080
Alex Gartner Garden

1617
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:29,248
This is the one example he's got

1618
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
Hacking

1619
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,320
The department the chief of staff

1620
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,368
Is a former lobbyist but also

1621
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,160
Maybe qualify

1622
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,488
The people or Obama

1623
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,816
He is indicting the revolving doors

1624
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,608
I am

1625
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,376
Find

1626
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:47,936
If you want to hit you with it

1627
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:53,568
Buc-ee's

1628
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,360
Individual

1629
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:01,760
When in reality it's about the entire system that has created

1630
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Existing now

1631
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,856
Now if you want

1632
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,816
All of the places where he has

1633
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,840
To do

1634
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:20,448
Specifically about the

1635
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,288
Like

1636
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:28,640
I am with him on

1637
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:35,040
You guys shouldn't be in the

1638
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,416
I know Gartner's not a lobbyist

1639
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Well that's fair

1640
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,744
But it's not like

1641
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,816
These guys are the individuals

1642
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,584
Doing this

1643
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:50,144
This is part of a broader system

1644
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,984
Politics

1645
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,896
Gris on a certain level

1646
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,456
I understand

1647
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,736
But the actual

1648
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,504
Charges

1649
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,784
He's making are not

1650
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,904
Because because

1651
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:18,304
Resume

1652
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,376
Well if you had just taken a lobbyist

1653
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:27,776
Reyes on the fellow at the National Defense universe

1654
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,896
Would be able to profit in Subway

1655
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,968
Then we have the absolute

1656
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,248
Absolutely

1657
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,552
Personal experience in government

1658
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,600
Someone who

1659
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,904
Is relevant to the job

1660
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,440
It's not the same

1661
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,232
Thing is that revolving-door thing

1662
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
It is 8

1663
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,560
Is adjacent to it

1664
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,400
It's not the same as like Betsy Daedalus being their Department of Education

1665
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,032
Carson Beach

1666
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:03,360
And not like their lobbyists or anything like that but it is like

1667
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,896
Those are people who are unique

1668
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,920
Unqualified

1669
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
To be in the position

1670
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
Work Wallace

1671
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:18,208
It's a decision of glad I never have to make

1672
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,768
Right look at it

1673
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
I don't think

1674
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:29,216
An example of his

1675
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:31,008
Then I'll agree with him

1676
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
Absolutely

1677
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,616
Obama appointed top lobbyist

1678
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,408
The Saudi royal family

1679
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,432
George Mitchell

1680
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:43,040
Obama appointed the

1681
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:48,160
Dla Piper

1682
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:52,256
History for the Middle East

1683
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,024
Envoy

1684
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,328
He was actually lobbying

1685
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,728
Interesting one retroactive

1686
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,288
I think so

1687
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Do some lobbying work

1688
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
Frassati

1689
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
Right

1690
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,576
A2000

1691
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,488
You have a perfect candidate for the job

1692
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,768
Simultaneously

1693
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
The dirt

1694
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,704
Tobacco manufacturing interest in the insurance

1695
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:35,008
It makes me very uncomfortable

1696
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:38,336
At the same time the position Obama was looking

1697
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,640
Phil was the special Envoy for Middle East

1698
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,968
F****** good step qualification

1699
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:48,576
He previously served as special Envoy for Northern Ireland

1700
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:50,624
From 1995 to 2001

1701
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,928
Where he was involved in the Belfast Pizza cream

1702
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,280
Mitchell a liberty medal and the presidential medal of freedom

1703
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
Because you resolved

1704
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,144
Tense situation in North Carolina

1705
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,680
Just perfect

1706
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,776
In 2000 Bill Clinton Mitchell on a fact-finding

1707
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,080
Mission about the arab-israeli

1708
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640
In 2020 released the Mitchell

1709
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:18,272
Which called for the Israelis Brent f****** stop building settlements

1710
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,088
A call for the Palestinians to work on preventing vile

1711
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:22,624
No I remember

1712
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:26,720
Beyond that he was a senator from Maine from 1980 to 1995

1713
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,280
Use a senate majority leader

1714
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,096
And he's a senior fellow and Senior research scholar at

1715
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,120
Universe

1716
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,168
International

1717
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:39,520
That is a very specifically qualified resume for someone that Obama might look

1718
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,080
To be the special Envoy for Middle East

1719
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:47,712
Shooting has been disqualified because he done work for these other Industries in the past

1720
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:54,112
Maybe I don't f****** know but that's a great resume for somebody want to send her the

1721
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,136
Negotiation

1722
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
Successfully and quote

1723
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,792
It largely made progress in North

1724
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
Diplomatic

1725
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,912
Conflict resolution experience

1726
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,704
Is a

1727
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,776
With a 15-year record as a center

1728
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,080
And the point here though is

1729
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,104
His job

1730
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,152
Is Middle East Envoy

1731
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,712
It's not overseas

1732
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,504
Middle East on I apologize

1733
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:28,672
HR overseed his job is literally

1734
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:32,000
Leave the rest alone

1735
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:36,096
You can do on this tissue thickening

1736
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:41,984
It probably have a lot of connections willing to talk to

1737
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,776
To use and other people

1738
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:47,104
Someone who is easy to plug into that role

1739
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,896
I don't know I don't

1740
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
F****** know I don't know what to do with it

1741
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,992
Lakers if you was able to

1742
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:55,296
To be in that role and there were at the

1743
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,832
6 rules in place but like

1744
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,368
Nothing you do

1745
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:01,440
Can any way touch any business that you have Lobby

1746
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,208
4

1747
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,000
Be fine with that

1748
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:10,400
Cuz it's unrelated interested in

1749
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,448
I don't know if you

1750
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,264
It's like a Jimmy Carter gives up

1751
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,544
Peanut Farm

1752
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,616
Because he's worried about ethics issues

1753
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,688
There's there's

1754
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
There's no lie

1755
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:30,624
And that's when you have a s*** ton of hotels that are making a lot more money because you're the president

1756
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,672
Good grace

1757
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,032
We would avoid

1758
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:50,080
Because it feels like what

1759
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,808
Like what's going on

1760
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:01,088
What you're saying

1761
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:02,624
But it does feel like

1762
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,648
We're trying to

1763
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,256
Or someone could hear it as us being like

1764
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,560
Well let's let Obama off the hook

1765
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
Because here's what's wrong

1766
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,960
I'm not saying that I only

1767
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,984
Want to

1768
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,776
The only reason that that's important

1769
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,800
Bring up at all

1770
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,592
And is relevant anyway

1771
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,360
Highlight

1772
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,896
The level to which Alex Jones

1773
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,432
Just giving up on any principles

1774
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:32,832
He ever pretended to have absolutely

1775
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,160
You could never be what he is now

1776
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,976
I am ready

1777
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:46,400
Concert

1778
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
Because what's the point

1779
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:51,776
The difference

1780
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
Between like

1781
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,080
Okay

1782
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:58,688
If we still lived in the 2009 World of Obama

1783
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,480
You were like

1784
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:05,344
Who has a history of and I was like

1785
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,672
Well what about bugs

1786
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,000
Situation

1787
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,328
Whiffs of corruption

1788
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:20,960
Now we're talking about with a whiff of corruption

1789
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,520
And Trump's admission Administration

1790
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:26,336
Farting corruption

1791
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:29,664
You know if I heard what about

1792
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:33,248
The version of what we could do

1793
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:36,064
Would be here Alex complain about George Mitch

1794
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,624
And then be like

1795
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,184
Address

1796
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,464
George Mitchell

1797
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:55,776
No that's that's real here's the contest for doodle

1798
01:39:57,312 --> 01:40:01,152
It's the right decision but it's not as easy as represent

1799
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,456
Sign with

1800
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,504
Martinez housing

1801
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:12,928
Yeah so here's five under the radar

1802
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
So far

1803
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:19,072
Garbage

1804
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:22,144
Uniquely unqualified for the position

1805
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:30,336
Nonclassic

1806
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,104
Smile

1807
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
It's nice to know that

1808
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,432
Major crisis

1809
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,344
They are ignoring our minor Christ

1810
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,136
Which are fireworks

1811
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,952
Which are far worse than anything

1812
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,792
Of Wall Street lobbyist

1813
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:50,816
Leon Panetta

1814
01:40:56,448 --> 01:41:00,032
Never been a lot

1815
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:06,432
Killing do Consulting work

1816
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,784
Clicklist

1817
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:11,808
McLean auto log-in

1818
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,344
He's never been a lobbyist

1819
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Old article

1820
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,416
You can find about the Scribe is action

1821
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,208
Activities

1822
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,256
Closely approximates

1823
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,560
But it's not like he's not a lot

1824
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,864
And maybe

1825
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,632
Maybe

1826
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,424
Amy's

1827
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:28,704
Really good at hiding

1828
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,240
I don't know

1829
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,008
But he thought of

1830
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,544
Technically speaking

1831
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:33,568
He is not allowed

1832
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,896
Through

1833
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,688
Consulting

1834
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,736
Doesn't change

1835
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,528
This is not

1836
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:45,344
Yeah cluding Leon Panetta.

1837
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,880
Judge him by his record

1838
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,720
He's a piece of s*** in the way that you say

1839
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,280
King of Wall Street

1840
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,960
Kingslayer

1841
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:15,296
Federal Reserve

1842
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:33,728
I'm not allowed to know anything about this

1843
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:37,568
Jack Purcell

1844
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
It turns out people jug into

1845
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
To some of his past

1846
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:47,808
Used to write

1847
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,088
Game of Thrones fans

1848
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,648
Oh hell yeah

1849
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,416
Is a character

1850
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,544
A story about Donald Trump

1851
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,568
Love with

1852
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,336
Su with a

1853
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Let's see who's next

1854
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:25,440
Top lobbyist for healthcare

1855
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:28,000
Department of Health and Human Service

1856
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,536
Arby's app

1857
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,816
On and on

1858
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,632
The list goes on and on

1859
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,448
Like I said Obama nominated

1860
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,496
Bedazzled had filed

1861
01:43:39,008 --> 01:43:39,520
Texas correct

1862
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,056
You might have missed files

1863
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:41,824
Deduction does it

1864
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:47,968
So on February 3rd 2009 from consideration for

1865
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:48,736
Human Service

1866
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,528
It was replaced by Katherine sibelius

1867
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,808
This is embarrassing

1868
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:56,416
Looks like he has every reason to notice

1869
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,208
Came out

1870
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,744
Why would

1871
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,792
Stacy was a month

1872
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:08,192
Took his name out of consideration given to the confirmation Pro

1873
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,776
Plays because he been foot animation

1874
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:15,616
8 awful

1875
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:18,944
Angela

1876
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Look at play

1877
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,272
Listen to Prince

1878
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:31,232
What the f***

1879
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:35,328
Got a new animated Katherine sibelius

1880
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,608
Getting robbed do take some

1881
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,448
Who that sounds too close to home

1882
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,568
Is it real

1883
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:48,640
Jesse was nominated

1884
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,176
Joseph Alexa Lobby

1885
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
Bye-bye

1886
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,392
Then three weeks into his administration

1887
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,928
Obama wants to know

1888
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,720
More outrageous than the

1889
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,792
Academy Awards

1890
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,328
He said that he was up

1891
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,352
Upset about

1892
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,376
The banker bailout

1893
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,656
Which is anshika

1894
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,448
Rahm Emanuel

1895
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:15,008
Another former Wall Street executive

1896
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,384
And anyway wrote

1897
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,176
The 2008 bailout bill or head

1898
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:25,504
He was a member

1899
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
4

1900
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:32,160
I don't know I

1901
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:36,256
Looking for

1902
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:46,240
And especially considering earlier the documentary they said it was Larry Summers now

1903
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
I don't understand

1904
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:54,432
What's going on

1905
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,224
Borat

1906
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:03,136
My wife's pension

1907
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,048
There's nothing to understand

1908
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,912
It's the way they do their propaganda

1909
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:16,704
What they do is they make

1910
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,520
Extravagant unsupported

1911
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,800
Sensational clay

1912
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,592
They don't prove

1913
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,432
No

1914
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,480
You can't play that game

1915
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
Like no I don't have to

1916
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:35,136
Now it's your job

1917
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,792
You're the one who made the claim

1918
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,328
I can't be expect

1919
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,352
Negative

1920
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,912
Because then

1921
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,704
The only way I'm going to ever satisfy the

1922
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,240
This is like

1923
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:55,104
Give me a detailed accounting of literally everything

1924
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,408
Horor Alex Jones

1925
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:02,272
And that's the way the heart

1926
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
I would look

1927
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:12,256
I don't I don't do that kind of pressure like I don't understand it

1928
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,792
I don't care

1929
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,608
You know what I mean like I think a lot of people

1930
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,680
Robbed

1931
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,216
And then

1932
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,752
I don't know

1933
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
How to be like

1934
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:31,968
Prove me wrong

1935
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:34,272
601111

1936
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:40,672
300

1937
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:44,512
01

1938
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,400
Like I will I will say that

1939
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
If you prove to me

1940
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:56,032
I'll revise my position

1941
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,152
Position

1942
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
You know like it's not it's not worth it

1943
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
Obama says

1944
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,400
Taking the bailout

1945
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,704
Enzyme executive order that was just part of

1946
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:30,592
Major Banks and brokerage

1947
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:31,872
Firms

1948
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,152
And the New Order

1949
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,968
With any future bailout

1950
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:39,040
And those were to be on the honor System

1951
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,600
People upset

1952
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:43,136
And rightfully so

1953
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,208
Executive being rewarded for failure

1954
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:50,560
I want to respond I really don't care

1955
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,840
Because

1956
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:58,752
Alright

1957
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:05,152
Yeah

1958
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:09,504
2009 were already started to pay back the bailout

1959
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,880
Yeah but it's just nonsense nothing went perfectly

1960
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,976
IG Bank of America and Citigroup which it received

1961
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,768
Bailout money

1962
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,048
This plan

1963
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:26,144
Only banks negotiating future agreements with the government will be restricted

1964
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,960
But this appears to be built in honor System

1965
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:35,360
And White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs had a hard time explaining

1966
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,688
And I will get the clarification

1967
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,992
From treasure on that generally speaking

1968
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:44,832
This is already the biggest liar and the biggest disappointment

1969
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,624
We've seen in recent history

1970
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:54,048
Delivering on

1971
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,072
On promises

1972
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,656
It doesn't matter any of the stuff

1973
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,680
I'm telling you

1974
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:01,472
Something's about to happen in the second battery

1975
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,752
Big changes the f***

1976
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:09,408
Obama is a fantastic and Weldon better liar

1977
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,712
His track record is clear

1978
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,248
He has done the Opera

1979
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,320
Everything he told the people

1980
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:21,184
He would do it for 3 weeks

1981
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,232
You believe these

1982
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,048
I don't believe it

1983
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:29,888
Get their asses so late

1984
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:36,288
I bought the delivery I love it I love it

1985
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,408
Within one month

1986
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,176
Of the past

1987
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:44,480
Baker bailout bill

1988
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,016
The Press reported

1989
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,808
Set / 5 trillion dollars

1990
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,696
That's not true

1991
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,720
That's not

1992
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,768
How could you even make that

1993
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:02,144
Claim pretend disappear

1994
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:08,544
That's absolutely not true the specifics of it hours we'll get into a little bit further down the road so we'll deal with it.

1995
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,080
Colors disappeared in Iraq

1996
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:15,968
I get that trillion dollars is enough to bankrupt

1997
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,784
Short version of about

1998
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
Contacts

1999
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,112
I promise we'll get more

2000
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:26,208
Is conflating the bailout 7

2001
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,744
A hundred billion dollars with

2002
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,024
Funds that were

2003
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,560
By the Federal Reserve

2004
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,656
Got others trillions of dollars

2005
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,568
What

2006
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:46,432
The amount of money

2007
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,016
Circle boomerang

2008
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:52,320
It would not discuss where the money

2009
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,512
Manual back there

2010
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,960
You're close to ready for what's about to

2011
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,752
There are at least

2012
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:23,296
Generous

2013
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,088

Buckle

2016

Using this for like four minutes of this documentary which is the 8 hours in real time

2017
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:36,096
Americans protest

2018
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:39,168
Apple 38r regional governorship office

2019
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,968
Give me a refreshing to see people standing up

2020
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,760
Against the real power structure

2021
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,320
Alex wrote

2022
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:57,344
He's goddamn

2023
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,560
Being distracted by the elites

2024
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,328
Frontman

2025
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:09,888

We travel to Dallas Texas

He's like a Vining with Federal Reserve jobs

2037

Bankers meeting

2039
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,840
Here's me doing the GIF of a jack off motion

Senate confirmation

2041
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:56,896
But I like that you strongly waited into argument very first position

2042
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,944
No recognition

2043
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:01,248
Stepping in there

President Obama

2048
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,656
The president

2049
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:23,520
Is the Federal Reserve chairman

2050
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
Who is

2051
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,568

President of the United States what the f*** is he talkin about

This is John Smith and then hey guess what

2054
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:37,600
After that

2055
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,608
The Federal Reserve

Freakonomics glasses

2060
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:12,928
Why I left the End the Fed rally outside

2061
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,232
We spoke with Ron Paul's brother Waynesville

2062
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,888
Folks I am so sorry that that's where we're cutting it off

2063
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:23,168
But

2064
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,472
We're about to jump off into a section

2065
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,240
This document

2066
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,616

01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:57,888
About Survivor series

2112
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,960
I didn't feel right about it

2113
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,008
Together putting

2114
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,288
Soda realized

2115
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,592
Probably

2116
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,616
Was that

2117
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:08,896
Games

2118
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,688
Saturday night

2119
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:13,504
Future.

2120
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,040
Someone who you think might've

2121
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:17,856
Aleister black

2122
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,136
Pro wrestler

2123
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:19,904
Aleister black

2124
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,952
People really hard to the face

2125
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,720
But

2126
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:24,000
Has not killed anybody

2127
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,280
With his

2128
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,560
Mass kick to the face

2129
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,352
Has not killed anybody

2130
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,632
One guy that I know of

2131
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,656
Who technically

2132
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,192
Probably killed the dude

2133
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,216
That's Alex Jones

2134
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,592
Alex

2135
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:41,152
In color
