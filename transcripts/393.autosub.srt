Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

Dot-com

6
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,280
We're couple dudes exit around technology Beverages and talk a little bit about

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
Alex Jones Jordan

8
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,936
Big event happened last night

9
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,472
What was last night's Sunday night

10
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
I don't know what day it is it's Tuesday while recording it for me Sunday night

11
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,456
That was rough

12
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736
That's okay

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
Anyways

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,672
Is running around going

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
Rights to get into how is the Royal Rumble it was

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,400
Sunday

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Glad you're at

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
Have some thoughts

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
It was fun it was really interesting the Royal Rumble Sundown and the 30 people enter the ring and then

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
Libro now Court

21
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,040
Be at the way they did it this year the it was a really interesting

22
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
Structure to it that I actually really didn't like

23
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,392
In the moment but I like

24
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
In hindsight

25
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,976
Sportsbook

26
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
Paradox of Brock Lesnar is the chair

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,888
YouTube Monster of a man

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,240
Paella beef everybody

29
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:22,848
I thought he was the champ and he decided he was going to enter the Royal Rumble and put himself in the

30
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
First he was number one

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,992
You're the number one entries heat up a flight through everybody but of course

32
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,088
What is a cocky

33
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,112
It seems like a bit of a car

34
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Kaki bukit

35
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
It's so he enters first and of course he just beats up everybody who comes out come out

36
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
Get their ass kicked

37
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
Grown-ups the first guy was thrown out a media

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Who is Elias

39
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:52,032
Whose character is this guy who has a guitar and he sings sarcastic

40
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
I forgot I watch wrestling a long time

41
00:02:55,104 --> 00:03:01,248
So he comes out and he starts freaking the song insulting Brock Lesnar and so Brock runs out of the ring grabbed him and I

42
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,648
The way they give you like little moments of Hope like maybe a couple p

43
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
People be able to work

44
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,976
The Gathering take him out

45
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Hey so it gets to like halfway through and all hope his likes would have been diminished right and then finally this big sky

46
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Scottish guy named Drew McIntyre comes in and Ricochet kicks Brock Lesnar in the balls

47
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
McIntyre

48
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,640
Perfect perfect

49
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
And what you realize exerted in hindsight is like I had to do all this stuff

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,528
Kind of unsatisfying in a little bit like

51
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Disappointing

52
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
In order to get you to enjoy

53
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
When McIntyre

54
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,928
Does yeah

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,792
I kind of enjoyed that and then the rest of the

56
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
The people who came out like

57
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,680
I know it is what it is for the rest of the rumble Championship they had a guy

58
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,568
Who's the wrestler who's around back in the Attitude Era and like back when I was watching way back

59
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
Yeah it was rated R superstar

60
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
And he had like a really

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,808
Really traumatizing neck injury about 10 years ago and he had to retire

62
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,160
It was just like this horrible thing where you know he has his emotional retirement tonight

63
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Ldb loves being in that he had somebody

64
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Craziest moments

65
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
From like back when I remember

66
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Watching wrestling

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
And Christian these two guys were tag team

68
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:26,239
And they had these insane matches with The Hardy Boys

69
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
The Tables Ladders & Chairs match with irritation

70
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847
Mystery

71
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,711
Antonio here to retire and it never

72
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Seems like he was ever gone

73
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Comeback

74
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
And he came out

75
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:39,807
In the 21

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,231
Out of control people freaking out

77
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
But what I found really amazing about it was

78
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,559
I gave you

79
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Like watching the moment when he comes

80
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Through the fog

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,935
The smoke machine that he has

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
He looks

83
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
Almost like he's going to cry

84
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
Like just this moment is that I am back

85
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,335
Doing this thing

86
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
There's a

87
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
Put wrestling aside

88
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
There's just such a human moment you can

89
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
Seeing his face

90
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
I would like a stadium full of people getting to

91
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,087
View of that moment

92
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Begin

93
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,647
This is what I was

94
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231
I was meant to do I never thought I'd be able to do it again

95
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
It's just so Universal and it just like it is amazing

96
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:26,143
Remember Lou Gehrig did that Ten Years After he retired

97
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Take all of the

98
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,775
Bulshit people not liking wrestling or or whatever it

99
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:32,799
Whatever

100
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Take all of that out of it

101
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
That moment

102
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
I think makes up for like

103
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Any kind of

104
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Negative

105
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
Review you might have like this match

106
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,903
Boring or whatever that makes a night

107
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,743
When putting on a 30-person Royal Rumble

108
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Creating it

109
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:57,119
Life created that moment facilitated Andre

110
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:02,239
This much as it is like this emotional thing for for Edge it's also for the people who

111
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
Lovin and then missed

112
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
You know like as a performer

113
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
So that's those

114
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
Anyway I have a lot of feelings about

115
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,759
Save-A-Lot feelings about non-wrestling aspects

116
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
The wrestling

117
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
Very side-by-side got bar to your other stuff

118
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,559
Anyway that's up I guess right now I've been about that

119
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
Right

120
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,655
Date 2020

121
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:35,007
20 episode of The Alex Jones Show

122
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
I swear to God

123
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:43,711
Swear to God I wanted to not do a present-day episode because we've done a couple in a row

124
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:46,783
And I think we all kind of get the sense that Alex

125
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,319
It's just going to be talking about

126
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,343
The Coronavirus

127
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,183
And really exaggerating and being irresponsible about in it

128
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,743
A lot of chickens are going to get sick if they don't get that back

129
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
Feels like almost like you're just

130
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,839
Beating the same drum

131
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
And it's annoying

132
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,215
And so I wanted to try and do something else but man I went down a lot of avenues

133
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
And none of them

134
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
We're good

135
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,871
I listen to two episodes of Project Camelot where Kerry Cassidy interviews magician

136
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
And neither

137
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,759
We're any good now I feel like I have to go listen to them

138
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,111
Confirm for you I never I never listen but how can Carrie Cassidy f****** talking

139
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
Hugo 142 Italy

140
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
Are you got the time go watch him I don't give it to you

141
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,607
Alright

142
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
Only Project Camelot

143
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,335
See if I give a s***

144
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,015
Actually honestly pretty glad that I ended up being sort of backed into a corner with a bunch of like

145
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,575
This isn't this is not a good thing

146
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,855
To cover this isn't going to work

147
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,623
And having to reach

148
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Treat back to the January

149
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
28th 2020

150
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
I think there are some things

151
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
Things that are are worthwhile in this

152
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,839
Some having to do with coronavirus some having to do with other stuff

153
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
And with all that in the moment

154
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,959
Before we do got to give a thank you to people who have signed up and are supporting

Although then again I don't think our

185
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Show should be funded primarily by

186
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,063
Outside the auspices of their Masonic Nessa

187
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,879
It looks like they say all money spends

188
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
Or whatever

189
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
I don't know

190
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,279
We start at the show and to Alex had some suspicions

191
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,887
Isn't it interesting that the coronavirus has been heavily study by the Chinese communist government

192
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Foundation

193
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,263
Pay stub Foundation that bill and his father fun

194
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,615
Patented the Coronavirus

195
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
4u Shanna vaccine

196
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,967
They may be able to rush it

197
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,015
Into production to protect

198
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,367
And your family aren't we just blessed and lucky

199
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
We are

200
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Conspiracy theory

201
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:46,143
Their sites out there saying that there's a government vaccine development this has been staged

202
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
Push

203
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Vaccines on the public

204
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
But now

205
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,615
Nbcnews J&J scientific officer pretty confident they can pray

206
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
Coronavirus vaccine is outbreak widened because

207
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
Patented viruses of it

208
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:06,623
I've been patented for use in a backstage we just mix it all up and

209
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,903
Goodall is

210
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
You just mix it all

211
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
It's not

212
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:17,375
Suspicious that scientist to work not a vaccine for a novel strain of coronavirus that just appeared

213
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
What you'd expect

214
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,799
The entire history of every situation that ever happened like this

215
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
You can see here how Alex is incorporated that chicken vaccine patent into his narrative and laundered it so now it's just

216
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,479
Just accepted fact

217
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:37,855
This is often how Alex works and it's one of the things that honestly is most frustrating about doing this kind of work

218
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,415
If you aren't listening when the narrative launch

219
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,695
It's often compared

220
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,535
Wheatley impossible to track down what he's talking about because you just speaks in vague

221
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
Buzzwords

222
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
It evokes something to his audience

223
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,143
But like any of the details you need to

224
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Confirm what he's

225
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
Saint

226
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,983
If you didn't know that he's lying about the

227
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
The pure bright Institute having a patent for a vaccine

228
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,311
For poultry

229
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
It'd be really hard to

230
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,639
The details of what he said in that last clip

231
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
Hey tray sit down and be able to learn more about what he's talking about

232
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
And that isn't intentional strategy

233
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
He's now turned this into a talk

234
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,111
The media didn't say that it was a

235
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
The Conspiracy Theory the people were working on a vaccine

236
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Many of the articles that I've read and

237
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,839
Preparing for these episodes of mentioned that work was underway but that it would take a while if it was even really pause

238
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,607
Possible at all

239
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Coronavirus Hazard notoriously hard

240
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:26,239
Great vaccines for in generally doctors tend to take the approach of

241
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,263
Just managing simple

242
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Which are often the most dangerous part of the virus

243
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
For instance in the case of SARS

244
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
It was often that how it led

245
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
To pneumonia that was the biggest

246
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,479
Concern for medical

247
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
The catch-all for

248
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,367
Something done f***** up

249
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
But now there's water in your

250
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,415
Haha

251
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:48,255
So Alex is making up all that stuff about them having patents on the Coronavirus

252
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
Which is a lot in allowing scientist

253
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
To do their work

254
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:57,727
There's an article in the New England Journal of Medicine from January 24th which discusses AC DC investigation and research team

255
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Examples

256
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,799
From which they were able to

257
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
Identify the viral genome sequence of this strain

258
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:09,759
All the information is perfectly available but I would rather yell about the gates family funding animal disease research

259
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Get them help them build panic

260
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,135
He's business model largely relies on his audience being scared

261
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,439
In events like this are basically sweeps

262
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Like a Superbowl for him

263
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
It's legitimately

264
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:20,767
Disgusting

265
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
That article that Alex is referencing is about Johnson & Johnson

266
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,631
Or J & J

267
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
And how their Chief scientific officer said he's confident that they could make a vaccine

268
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,031
Alex didn't read this article

269
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Calling them J&J

270
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Is reading the headline

271
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:40,479
There's nothing in that article that talks about them having patented viruses and just mixing them all up

272
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,527
In fact the article explicitly says quote

273
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
Stoffels who's the John Cena John

274
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Chief scientific officer

275
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,695
Said that the pharmaceutical company needed to start from scratch

276
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
On this vaccine

277
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Giant kind of runs counter

278
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Pair to the narrative italic

279
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,607
But you know when you when you bake

280
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Scratch you have all the ingredients and you just mix them up so that can still

281
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,727
I'll still give him that

282
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
Okay I'm not because

283
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Really

284
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:09,151
All this is is trying to heighten the mood heightened your height in the panic

285
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
And then funnel it somewhere

286
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,015
Yeah it's very clear where that

287
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,063
Infomercial is going

288
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
On this episode

289
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,855
We have had

290
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Sources

291
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,695

AR

296
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:39,615
That indeed is now happening in your now seeing that the news today

297
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:41,919
Selling out

298
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,247
Suppliers are already sold out

299

Relational doubt the big institutional group

00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
My Patriot that pumps out Infowars select

301

A sticker on it

302

303
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
Still able to guarantee delivery within 7

304
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Days

305
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,143
They can do that I can tell you

306
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
But

307
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,007
That could change any time that means if you get your order in now

308
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
You will get it within seven

309
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
29-0 my God there's a crisis going on and it's causing food prices to go up really

310
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,783
Say hi but hey call my bakery supplies Celtic area

311
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:23,391
All these other places they don't they don't even have any food

312
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:26,207
You want to buy food but you can't get it anywhere else

313
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
Interesting Lee the US Department of Agriculture

314
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
Just put out their food price Outlook report for

315
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,351
For 2020

316
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
And what are you doing

317
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,655
It's the exact opposite of what Alex

318
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
The thing

319
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
Rumor report

320
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,335
The 2020 consumer price index forecast indicates a continuation of low inflation at grocery stores

321
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Answer for Mark

322
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:49,247
In 2020 food at home prices are expected to increase in the range of between .5 and 1.5

323
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,807
Percent as potentially the fifth year in a row with

324
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,879
Deflating or lower-than-average inflating retail food price

325
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
Sweet there's a 20-year historical average

326
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
2% rise in

327
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Send food prices

328
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
So this is well within

329
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
Then or even below that ever

330
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Gap

331
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,375
Given overall inflation factors

332
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,167
This could be a maintaining or even

333
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Decreasing of point-of-purchase

334
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,031
Price for consumers within the United States

335
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
This is true the United

336
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
States where Alex's primary Market of listeners is Loki

337
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
However it's not uniformly true in the world

338
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,783
Princeton Cindy is currently seeing food prices

339
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,087
Is Jump considerably with most experts point

340
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:25,855
Oil price

341
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Instability is being a major

342
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
You're factor in the country's retail Market

343
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,695
Inflation

344
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
Another major driver is the supply chain

345
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
To quote an article from Court

346
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Quote

347
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
Prices of vegetables and fruits were driven High because

348
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
Crop damage

349
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
It's caused by excessive an unseasonal rain

350
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,495
Supplies

351
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:47,615
I can't imagine that many of these people in India that are affected by this or the target market of Alex's

352
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
Food buckets

353
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,663
So I don't know how this

354
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,967
I think there's a

355
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,039
Maybe

356
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
I don't think you don't go for dialysis

357
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,375
So there's also a recent article in the BBC about how brexit will likely lead to higher food prices in the of the UK

358
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
And the people there would probably Disney

359
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Need to adjust to that

360
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
But Alex is in favor of brexit

361
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
So doesn't seem like you would want to bring that up

362
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:18,079
As a potential consequence

363
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,871
Avari adjust my

364
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,455
Yeah it does seem like brexit is going poorly when

365
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
After everybody's already agreed

366
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
To brexit

367
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
Oh yeah your food prices are going to go up this is going to go out this week

368
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Going to go up I don't know if you guys do this

369
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,463
It was a battle

370
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,351
So there's also been reports and writers about Rising food prices in Wuhan

371
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,119
I'm turning the corner

372
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
And I think that's a problem

373
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
I've not seen any numbers are hard information but the exact

374
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,775
Kind of rising prices so it's

375
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
Kind of difficult

376
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
For me to assess

377
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
But this is the kind of thing you see in most

378
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Emergencies

379
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Situations

380
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Unfortunately

381
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,247
People get gas prices when they have the ability to do so

382
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
I just last week you saw Uber and Lyft

383
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,647
Charging people insanely elevated rates after the shooting in downtown Seattle

384
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
There was increased demand it so the price for the available Supply Rose

385
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Like in that case if it was the result of

386
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
Like automated algorithm

387
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
It's not like a militia

388
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
It's from a human standpoint

389
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,519
But it's just mirroring what happens with

390
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
You know a lot of

391
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
Exactly what they desire the freemark

392
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,295
There are laws in place in the United States that forbid price gouging

393
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
Situation

394
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,391
Is when a state of emergency has been declared but that law doesn't apply

395
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
The other countries

396
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,231
And honestly you can find a lot of people here in the United States

397
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:39,999
To take a position

398
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Like if

399
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:43,071
You're in the position to sell someone

400
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:46,143
Something they need to survive you should be able to charge them whatever the f***

401
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:46,911
You want

402
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
These people are often libertarian

403
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Which Alex pretend

404
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,775
Going to be so I don't know what

405
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
Philosophical position

406
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
He comes from where he's a

407
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Supposed to price guide

408
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,431
Whatever is happening on the day

409
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
Rights for against

410
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
And that is the

411
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,063
Right anyway my point here is that the rising

412
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,855
Food prices in Wuhan Arkansas

413
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
And it's something that the Chinese government has made clear that they are aware

414
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
And we will see

415
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
See what happens from there

416
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
The larger Point here is that Alex is selling these food buckets

417
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,863
Not to people in Wuhan

418
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
He's selling them to people in the United States

419
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,007
He's trying to use the Optics of that City in quarantine too pushy

420
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
Cheese product

421
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
Inches disgust

422
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Yeah and the underlying messages

423
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
This is going to happen to you

424
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
Even if it's not happening now here

425
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
You can already know because the globalists are using this to take a worldwide and kill

426
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
6 billion Peter

427
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,463
And that the may not be an underlying message a little bit later the trip

428
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,743
Yeah might be an explicit

429
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,863
It does seem odd that you'd be selling food buckets if previously we've already

430
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,143
Confirm that the world is already

431
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Done and the human races

432
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,239
Oh yeah

433
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
For Humanity

434
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
There will only be lone survivors

435
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,895
So I mean

436
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
You want to be one of the lungs it's all still makes

437
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Mark Wahlberg

438
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
So Alec

439
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
He's talking about these Rising food prices

440
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Citizen his food bucket

441
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,111
It's being the solute

442
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
Listen to it so it's kind of funny that he ends

443
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Is plug like that

444
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
My Patriot

445
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,279
Bring your distributors

446
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,863
Square.com that we were way lower than all of them but they

447
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:30,335
I'm at the lowest price for my Patriot Supply

448
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,895
Comedy or just goes to them every

449
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:47,487
According to the UN Zone definition the Coronavirus

450
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Okay obviously

451
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,327
Obviously

452
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,863
Sure obviously

453
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,399
How could you not know that

454
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
I love her Alex's blood for the food buckets is based on the idea that food prices are going up so this is the solution to that and ended up saying that the

455
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
Prices of a suit pocket

456
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Are going out loud

457
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Seafood prices are gone

458
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
Give me the Department of Agriculture and said the food prices are not projected to go off it seems like some of the narrative he's do

459
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,879
This might be a rationalization for him Verizon

460
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Prices so you can

461
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,416
Make a little money

462
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:22,816
Woody's been clear he's not been doing lately I could be home money is coming in

463
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376
You are looking at your sales and you're going like who the

464
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
The food is down

465
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,936
If we got a virus

466
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
Guess who can't eat food now

467
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
If you're not making money

468
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,568
At the current

469
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:38,176
Rate of sale or whatever one of the strategies you could employ is rising margin

470
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,248
This might be a rationalization to

471
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:45,344
Raise margins to make money without having to say that's what you're doing

472
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
Seems

473
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
Maybe like a

474
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
I'm not sure

475
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,280
Also I'm not sure that the UN has a formal definition of pandemic that's really meaningful

476
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,376
Alex may have wanted to see the World Health Organization but he's just rif

477
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
I think so he's mine just plugged in the um

478
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
I think

479
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
There's a lot of controversy with the World Health Organization and their definition

480
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
The pandemic

481
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:10,688
Menu at the World Health Organization say they don't really have a definition but they have description

482
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
What constitutes

483
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
The pandemic

484
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
And they all over

485
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
On the Border

486
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
That is true

487
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
Generally the guideline the people go by is that

488
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
That none of the six phase model that we discussed

489
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Some last episode

490
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,256
Basics and a pandemic

491
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,792
Wisely pandemic face

492
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,352
An outbreak has characterized by a quote

493
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:33,472
Virus causing community-level outbreaks in at least two World Health Organization region

494
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,336
According to that definition de coronavirus outbreak does not constitute a pandemic

495
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
At this point

496
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,456
There is a community-level outbreak in China but we do not have evidence that is

497
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,528
Is the case in any other region where there have

498
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Ben cases confer

499
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,320
So

500
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
Eva is Alex

501
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
Wants to talk about the World Health organization's definition

502
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,208
It doesn't apply but it's

503
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
Turns out

504
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,352
And he's not talking about the UN definition he's not even talking about the World Health Organization definition

505
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,888
Here's what he's talkin to

506
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,704
The definition of a pandemic

507
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,752
Merriam-Webster

508
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Alright

509
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Sites

510
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Current traffic

511
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Unaffected

512
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
Exponentially High

513
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Proportion

514
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
Populations exponential mean

515
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
Go to Merriam Webster

516
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,672
She'll help you out

517
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Elgin

518
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
Now don't do this

519
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,280
Exponentially

520
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,864
Stop it no this is not going to go well

521
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
Dublin

522
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
Time

523
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:37,984
And spread

524
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,592
People use the word exponentially to just mean something is growing rapidly like in the

525
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,920
Kukla colloquial sense but it does have an actual meaning that Alex

526
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
Definitely doesn't know

527
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
It means that growth is characterized by

528
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
I think this mulch

529
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,808
Lakeisha not like double

530
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
At the first interval it's just the base growth

531
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
At the second

532
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
It's not rape

533
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
Squared at the third it's Patrick cubed

534
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
And so on

535
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,816
Typically in the early stages of viruses

536
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,632
Spreading they do sometimes 10 show exponential growth

537
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
Until there's a countervailing force against it

538
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Like a vaccine or

539
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,008
Some sort of intervention meth

540
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,568
This is not really all that controversial

541
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,408
But it's a little strange to recognize that Alex doesn't know what the word exponential mean

542
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:24,064
Also the Merriam-Webster definition of pandemic has literally no bearing on what the World Health Organization or you and Mike declared

543
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
To be a panther

544
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:27,136
Alex can't use this dictionary to post

545
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,160
Some kind of a gotcha

546
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,976
On this one doesn't work I don't know

547
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
I'm pretty sure he mailed it also get this

548
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,840
Definition of pandemic

549
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
The point about exponential design

550

558
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,600
Alex just added the word exponentially because he wanted to

559
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
By the textbook definition

560
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Change the definition

561
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,536
I just

562
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:09,888
The mind boggles at how bad you can really be

563
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,216
Like you can be so bad at it

564
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,520
Still get millions of dollars yeah

565
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:20,640
Infuriated what's fascinating about how bad he is at it is he's bad at hiding the Badness

566
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,432
It's somehow just like

567
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:25,504
Yeah it's fine if I just admit I'm just throwing random words.

568
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,368
The change definition

569
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
So did

570
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
You know he's creating fear about this

571
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Outbreak

572
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Certainly

573
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,048
But one of the other things that he's doing

574
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
When is Easter

575
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Now at the stage

576
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
In his coverage where it's important

577
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
The pivot the sphere

578

Going to come

580
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,336
Because he knows that eventually this what we won't be able to make money on this forever

581
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,384
And so he does that

Article share where they're saying

00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:15,168
Google and Facebook are blocking Liars explaining this was made in a lab

591
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728

Doctor says there's too many people anyway in the clip that he plays

603
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688

605
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
It's

606
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
Not

607
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
Salt

608
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832

610
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,416
Get your information right Alex

611
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,696
And I'm like dude

612
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,720
Yes of course

613
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
I I think the

614
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
These places like Facebook

615
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
The platforms

616
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
It's a certain amount of responsibility

617
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:26,336
To everything is at a noun

618
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,104
Delete

619
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
People being hurt

620
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
I I think that it is

621
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
It's totally fine

622
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
When Alex says why would

623
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,272
You speculate about this stuff

624
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,320
It's one thing to be specular

625
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
It's another tab

626
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,696
Be a liar who's trying to sell food bucket and weird pills

627
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
It's

628
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
It's not

629
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
It's not the same

630
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,072
Facebook isn't

631
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,864
Oak Washington Post

632
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
On Facebook where it's like

633
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,472
Suspicious of the government

634
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,544
They are questioning malicious actors like Alex.

635
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
Misinformation

636
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Front then

637
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,152
What is AK

638
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:02,176
You know we should be cautious

639
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:02,944
This about

640
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
Informed opinions are different than

641
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:09,856
Haha the Chinese are released in order to

642
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,184
It's different informed opinions are usually better than

643
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,232
We're all going to die

644
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,280
Bye-bye food

645
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,120
I think this next trip is actually really clearly Devon

646
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
Dude why Alex is not just being

647
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
Suspicious and speculating

648
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,264
Yes is viruses deadly

649
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,104
It's not like SARS and things that were just a hype up and scare people why not

650
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
This is already killed thousands and thousands

651
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
What

652
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
Comprehend

653
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
It does have a high kill rate

654
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
18%

655
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
According to a BBC report from January 28th

656
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
The day of this app

657
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,376
Episode The confirmed death toll is currently

658
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,776
Conversely tsar's killed 778 people but another important aspect of that is that there were deaths

659
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
770

660
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
Different countries from SARS

661
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,152
As opposed to the current situation which is been entirely in China

662
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,456
A death is a death that is true

663
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
But from the perspective is like

664
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,040
Gauging the spread of a virus

665
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:13,088
It matters a lot where the Death Star have

666
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,648
If they're in a bunch of different countries

667
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,952
It it demonstrates a difference

668
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Situation

669
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:23,072
Alex is completely outside the accepted reality with his claim that thousand

670
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
Thousand

671
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,120
Who died from this outbreak

672
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,960
I suspect that he's getting this information from noted Muslim hater

673
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Pamela Geller's website

674
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,056
Where she posted a breaking story about there being 10

675
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
10000 dead

676
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,480
According to factcheck.com this story was sourced from a blog post on a website that's largely about gold

677
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,040
Quote which has a disclaimer that says

678
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
Vouch for the accuracy orca

679
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Completeness of its information

680
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,928
Now that is a big disclaimer

681
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Quite

682
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,328
I think we might be lying is a huge disclaimer

683
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,352
This website

684
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
JS mine

685
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
Mine set.com it published in

686
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Email an anonymous person sent them who is relating

687
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
A phone call he had with a friend

688
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,616
And spoken to a Chinese friend who had information for

689
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,640
Family in Wuhan

690
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,176
If you're keeping track

691
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
At bat

692
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,272
This is for panda information at the point of this blog post

693
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
The alleged family in Wuhan is first

694
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,880
The Chinese friend a second

695
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
The friend on the phone is 3rd

696
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
The anonymous email her is 4th

697
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
Then Pamela Geller using the site as a source

698
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,840
Sleep and information on her site

699
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
No one who operates a legitimate news or information out that wood

700
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
Ever accept this kind of work

701
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,984
It's just gossip

702
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,312
Basically she will be testifying in the impeachment hearings

703
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
Chosen only her to test it will not be spread

704
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,784
Alex is misusing the information also in that Lancet article that he's talking to

705
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:53,696
In the actual article researchers examined 59 cases of people who'd been admitted to Chinese hospital with pneumonia

706
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Symptoms

707
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
Which they've been whittled down to 41

708
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,840
Who also tested positive for the novel Coronavirus

709
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,936
All of them had pneumonia which indicates that these are all

710
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
The most severe sort of cases

711
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,056
Among the larger population of people who come down with the virus

712
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
Just on Viscount

713
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
This is not a fair study to extrapolate to the entire population or even the entire population of people who come

714
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
I'm down with a Coronavirus

715
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
No no viral

716
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,464
No virologist would be like 41 that's enough of it

717
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Yeah and none would take

718
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
That information

719
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
That is provided in this paper and then say that if

720
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,448
Whatever you all the time for all

721
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,520
The report says there's a 15

722
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,568
18% incidence of patients

723
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,848
In that 41

724
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
Sample size

725
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:45,920
Which is 6

726
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
However

727
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
28 individuals or

728
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
3% recover

729
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,832
Edward discharged from the hospital but Alex says one point that out

730
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,416
Also it's hard to say if there's any direct parallels here but

731
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Of the same

732
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,464
Set that they had

733
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
15% of the patient

734
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
And also had pre-existing

735
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Existing hypertension

736
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,120
And 15% had a history of cardiovascular

737
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:11,008
Based on the information available in the report I can't say if those are all the same 50

738
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,104
I'll but it it's just a illustrate that there are cold

739
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Mingling variables

740
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
But Alex isn't

741
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
Considering

742
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
And

743
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Make this a

744
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
I don't think anybody thinks

745
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Step most

746
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm at maybe I'm

747
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Way off base

748
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
Since we're dealing with Alex

749
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
People believe any

750
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
But

751
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,768
In most viral cases

752
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,608
Nobody is saying that the most healthy members of society are going to

753
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
You instantly died

754
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
If they get this coronavirus it's generally

755
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
The Alden children

756
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,056
Generally

757
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Most

758
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
Regular people are saying

759
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,688
Yeah

760
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,272
Looks like nobody believes that nevermind

761
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,856
I want to sing straight up 15% of the 18% of people who get the

762
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,184
They're going to die

763
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
10% of everyone

764
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,792
Also the report even says quote with the limited number of cases

765
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,096
It's difficult to assess host risk factors

766
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,680
For disease severity and mortality with multivariable adjusted method

767
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
This is a modest-sized

768
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,032
Case series of patients admitted to

769
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
Collection of standardized data for the larger cohorts

770
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Would help to further Define

771
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,200
The clinical presentation natural history and risks

772
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
To put that more succinctly what they're saying is

773
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,344
This is a small group that we looked at and we need more information

774
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Don't know if any of this could be

775
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,416
Explained by other variables

776
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
About the specific people that we looked at

777
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,768
Whatever impact that might have had

778
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
On the results

779
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,072
I see this is where we getting

780
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Into trouble again

781
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,656
Yes I understand what you were saying

782
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:46,240
And I indeed understand your interpretation of what he was saying

783
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:49,056
But ultimately let's boil it down still further

784
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
We don't know yet we still got a little work to do

785
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Sure

786
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,152
Via interesting Lee

787
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,224
Even this study doesn't say there's death rate of 80

788
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
10%

789
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,624
This again is another example of Alex being unable to stop himself from exaggerated

790
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,928
From lying to make his narratives more severe

791
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,512
He strips literally all contacts from this Lancet report

792
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Exaggerated its conclusion

793
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,912
While simultaneously blindly reporting as gospel some dumb fifth hand bulshit

794
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
Pamela Geller post on her blog

795
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:21,568
This is just embarrassing a dangerous work here and you should be ashamed of himself

796
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
I don't even like. I don't even like the use of a percentage

797
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,920
Whenever you're dealing with sex

798
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
Just small stamp

799
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,248
I would prefer a fraction

800
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,784
Because 15% people go like

801
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,576
Oh well 15 out of 100

802
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
Not six out of

803
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,928
No it's those things where

804
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,696
It's like

805
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
We do

806
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
It doesn't it's not

807
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
I don't know how you're feeling for me update

808
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
Hey when we get

809
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
Get to 100 you can use percentages until then

810
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,240
It's fractions all the way

811
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
Fair enough that when you're in charge

812
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,568
That's it

813
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:57,408
So Alex has a pretty severe news about the United States

814
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,688
And this by

815
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
And

816
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
I don't think

817
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,440
Because I don't know how to make it but if you go to infowars.com you see the live feed headline

818
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
It's official this is now a global pandemic

819
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:16,608
Coronavirus

820
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,400
Us

821
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
Officials believe

822
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
But the virus has already

823
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
Broken out of containment on the way

824
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Ghost

825
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,616
What

826
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,944
When was hitting containment on the bus

827
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
I believe it

828
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:39,648
Really what they said that they said something else

829
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
We Believe

830
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,144
With Johnny students that came in

831
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
A massive emergency

832
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
How to figure out how to

833
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,568
Announce to the public

834
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,272
I can find literally no evidence for anything Alex is saying here other than his own words

835
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,112
As of this recording there are five cases confirmed the virus in the United

836
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,672
States and all of them have been people who had been to Wuhan

837
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
There's no evidence

838
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
Has there been any person to person

839
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,536
Some Transmission in the United States

840
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,120
I have a particular disrespect for Alex and that he doesn't want to pay

841
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
Literally everything he's been doing is

842
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,984
TaylorMade to cause a certain amount of panic

843
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
In a certain type of

844
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,032
But panicking people

845
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,384
When he said that he doesn't want a panicky means he doesn't want people to lose their s*** in

846
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
Start looting

847
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
He doesn't want that kind of

848
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,016
He wants a controlled Panic he can profit off of

849
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:42,624
He wants to stoke just enough fear in his audience that he can get them to buy all this food

850
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,672
But not enough that they start killing people

851
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,976
He is a calculated monster

852
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:52,352
That's why he throws in things like I don't want to cause a panic

853
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,448
Yes sir to try and reel it back in a tiny bit

854
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,728
But at the same time make

855
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,520
Get super sensational

856
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:03,616
Cuz we know if we have 10 days of panic when people are going to start eating you true

857
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,712
Cannibalism I want to put that on

858
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Gravestone

859
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:09,760
That's not what they

860
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
They said they actually

861
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,880
You can't you can't even do that.

862
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,464
That punching me in the face and telling me you did

863
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,864
That's just an example of him being bad at this bad thing

864
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
So this is just grow

865
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,776
Last week to say 47,000.

866
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
So this whole thing is out of control we be praying about it

867
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,672
How about a vaccine personally

868
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Have been

869
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:57,888
Vitamin D3 vitamin

870
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
Great great

871
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
Great stuff

872
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
I'm you can just see it's like

873
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:05,056
It's clear if you if you without him awful if you listen to a show with a

874
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,360
Any sort of a critical eye

875
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Orire

876
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,480
All you see is like oh all of this is really getting ramped up

877
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,760
And then you funnel it some

878
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,064
Really fun

879
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,112
All these hundreds of thousands

880
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:24,256
The people they do know it's all everyone's lying about this what you need to do

881
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:30,400
All day food prices are skyrocketing everywhere it's going to be a disaster no one can find food get my bucket

882
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,936
All its 8

883
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,728
Clear formula even used

884
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,568
Car salesman looked out no used car salesman is going to go out there and be like

885
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,896
Hey man looters are going to light your car on fire you better go to backup

886
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,040
Get a backup right now your car will be lit on fire tomorrow and if not tomorrow

887
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
So it's the season of health and that means that the health Ranger is on everyday now

888
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,864
Time stops in for a little visit

889
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,264
Isn't that it is a situation where you sort of blew the officer the finale a little bit early

890
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
You wait till the end of the week

891
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,848
Interview situation now we're like

892
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:17,504
Alex should be like all right we got like Adams on the show is reporting live from a bunker deep underground where you stocked up

893
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:25,440
We got back out of here who put his f****** money where his mouth is undisclosed location

894
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:30,816
Coronavirus

895
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,400
As we all know it only takes me 5 days to Aid go cannibal so

896
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,424
Let's see what happens

897
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
Yeah I mean

898
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,984
It's all very stupid but

899
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,520
Yes

900
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,800
They're just beer bong

901
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
I guess it's really

902
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
Absurd

903
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:49,504
Global pandemic

904
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:50,528
No

905
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
Media in America

906
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
Is now complicit

907
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,184
Cover up

908
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,232
Cost millions of

909
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Will get people

910
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
Killed

911
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,144
The same media that pushes transgenderism or they going to do next

912
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
Trans vitalism

913
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:12,288
Identify is a person who doesn't have the virus

914
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,896
Hospitals in California

915
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
That's how you know they're not taking

916
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:21,248
Any of this that is the most

917
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
Teddy bears joke

918
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,928
Ain't that the Matt elfring character

919
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:31,744
So what person listening knows what you're talking about

920
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,448
Yeah I mean that's just like

921
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
This s***

922
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,568
I mean you're just taking opportunities to get your weird social pun

923
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Launch is in

924
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Evian

925
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
Transgender what's next

926
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,944
Trim virus

927
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,480
Everybody

928
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Nobody

929
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,552
Good stuff

930
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Alright I'm going to need another beer

931
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Here's where Alex

932
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
Gets down to like

933
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
I think this is what he thinks

934
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
The conspiracy is

935
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
If this is

936
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,144
You been hard I am so alive for more than 3 weeks

937
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,776
This could be a bioweapon released to bring down the global economy is a way to counter nationalism

938
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:18,336
Global to shed bad economy for Nationals

939
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
So everything is about them

940
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,224
If they can't they're incapable of

941
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
Understanding a larger world that isn't about themselves

942
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,880
I don't understand something like this virus

943
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:31,904
Brake is not

944
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,488
Just a natural phenomenon the people need to come together and

945
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,512
Try and

946
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,608
Mitigate the damage has helped each other as best as possible

947
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,216
No it's an attack on Trump and nationalism

948
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,264
This virus was released by the club

949
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
In order to spread

950
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,336
A panic whatever

951
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
Crash the stock market which

952
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,967
You know the Domino's you keep seeing which one Falls Boom at the end

953
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,015
Trump and nationalism earlier attack

954
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
It's so

955
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:05,951
I don't even know a cynical doesn't even seem like the right word

956
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
Damn it's such a disgusting

957
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,351
I m Norse is he is speaking for the Sheridan

958
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,911
Experience of humanity most of us

959
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,959
Live in Austin

960
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:22,335
In a mansion and make millions of dollars scamming people with with pills

961
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,431
That's a normal thing that's a human behavior that we all share

962
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Right

963
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
Oh well then

964
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
He's a narcissist

965
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:35,391
So Alex gets back to trying to sell food bucket okay because I really

966
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
I can't stress

967
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,231
Isn't it comes up over and over and over and over again

968
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:41,023
It is just like

969
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
A very

970
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,839
Consistent like marketing

971
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Give him a call

972
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
Yes yes

973
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,191
They just know well enough

974
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
To know like this

975
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,055
Is good opportunity

976
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,967
I have sources an industry that have talked to all the big storable food company had

977
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:02,271
Institutional buyers started

978
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,551
Who are the

979
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Lineup

980
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
Then it exploded

981
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,743
Friday basically everybody was sold out

982
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,047
Suppliers that are

983
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,607
The biggest Supply

984
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Literally

985
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
Horrible food

986
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,215
Third-party sold out

987
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,775
My Patriot is boxing and they needed

988
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Fast as I can

989
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
You got to drink for sure.

990
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
Vonda Smith exact same assembly line

991
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Star Sticker

992
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,015
More select never done before if we can

993
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Plug year

994
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Talking to the folks there

995
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
Tires

996
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
I just stopped by the post office

997
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
But it's

998
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,567
Let me guess the West Coast Mission yeah course West Coast

999
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
And I said

1000
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,943
Obviously that's the first

1001
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Playsets

1002
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,295
Obvious Chinese cities in United States

1003
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,319
Seattle

1004
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
What's going on

1005
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
This is so ridiculous

1006
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
Alex is trying to spend a conspiracy that the coronavirus is going to explode in the west coast and Seattle due to the high Chinese population

1007
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
Canon Seattle

1008
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:24,703
We're apparently it's traditional buyers of food or storing up tons

1009
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,751
The stops we need to act now by survival

1010
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
Food buckets

1011
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,079
That sounds right there a few problems with this Theory

1012
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
What are

1013
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
Seattle has the ninth-highest chinese-american population of major US cities with approximately 30,000 Chinese

1014
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,807
Those are the ones you know

1015
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:44,671
Compare that to the 562 thousand Chinese Americans in New York

1016
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
You should get a scale between

1017
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,303
First and night nobody's going to

1018
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
Send a virus out to New York you start with

1019
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
Seattle there that's close to

1020
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,727
To Portland and all get-out it's all over for the lips

1021
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Alex did say the Westco

1022
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,311
So I'm going to take New York out of the equation

1023
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:06,943
Let's consider there are 180,000 Chinese Americans in San Francisco 77,000

1024
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:09,503
Los Angeles 75000 San Jose

1025
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
43000

1026
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,367
43000 in Oakland

1027
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,951
Thirty-four thousand in Irvine California all higher

1028
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,231
In Seattle

1029
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
College students is nonsense to

1030
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:27,679
The biggest school in Seattle is the University of Washington Seattle and they've a smaller Asian student body than UT

1031
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Also

1032
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
The case of the personhood coronavirus in

1033
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,031
Washing

1034
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
In state

1035
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,335
He wasn't a college student

1036
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:35,615
Any wasn't in Seattle

1037
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,175
Who's the man in his 30s who lived in Everett Washington

1038
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:45,855
Honestly all this he doing going to Wuhan a businessman do I want to know the what's going on with this guy

1039
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
Online Jordan

1040
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
Dachshund bad idea

1041
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
That sort of speculation makes more sense than what Alex is doing

1042
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,935
Guy was doing in China is

1043
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:02,239
Amor sensible conspiracy

1044
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Then this

1045
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,335
Comes down to make it trying to make Chinese Americans

1046
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,871
Scary to Alex's audience

1047
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
It's Ellie's food

1048
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:15,039
Yeah that's never gone wrong we've never treated an entire Asian population negatively in this time

1049
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
This is all just

1050
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,671
S*** this is an infomercial for the food

1051
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
Also of course

1052
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
Looming in the background

1053
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,767
The pals

1054
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,583
Are you getting the food you might have

1055
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Might as well

1056
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
Mix it up

1057
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:31,935
So there's more

1058
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
Conspiracies a fuk

1059
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:37,055
Can a smart guy even Main Line news in Shanghai

1060
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,383
Stolen by Tchaikovsky

1061
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:46,527
The same people were involved it turns out and weird stuff for the bowling weird stuff

1062
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
This sounds like a movie script

1063
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,367
Parmalee

1064
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
What are you doing on here

1065
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,255
Interesting

1066
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,559
Three or four or five

1067
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,607
My days ago that was immediately called fake

1068
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,423
Mainstream media now they are reporting and confirm

1069
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,447
So

1070
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
We weren't

1071
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,287
News we were ahead of their news

1072
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,359
I just replied to here's what Mike Adams was saying a couple days ago

1073
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
It's over for Humanity

1074
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455
Lone survivors

1075
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:19,039
Okay he's really not bring it on this

1076
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,343
Joke season it's not going well

1077
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,951
So that story Alex is talking about beating mainstream news it's not

1078
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,719
It's b*******

1079
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:33,375
This all started with a guy on Twitter named Kyle bass posting a CBC news story from last July adding the caption

1080
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,959
Husband and wife Chinese spy team were recently removed

1081
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,727
From a level four

1082
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
Infectious disease facility in Canada

1083
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,335
For sending pathogens to the Wuhan facility

1084
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,199
This tweet was retweeted thousands of times in the story began to take traction

1085
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Conspiracy community

1086
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
The only problem is

1087
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,575
Is the article that he linked to didn't say any of that stuff

1088
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
That's not what they

1089
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
They said they said some

1090
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Well

1091
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Alex Trebek

1092
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:04,863
The two people who were taken out of the national microbiology lab in Winnipeg were suspected of making an administrative violate

1093
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:09,471
And every organization that's involved in this matter as well as the CBC reporter

1094
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
I'm stressed that nothing surrounding this case

1095
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,103
Involves any kind of public danger or anything close

1096
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
To what this

1097
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Tweet is electric

1098
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:24,575
Zerohedge started taking taking this as a launching Point start speculating the China stole the virus as a bioweapon is it

1099
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:27,647
Caught fire in the dumb dumb world's people who don't read

1100
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,927
These people are out

1101
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
For sensationalism and trap

1102
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
In the prospect

1103
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:38,143
Two Chinese spies sending the very same virus that ends up causing an outbreak is a really good way to get eyeballs on your s***

1104
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,191
But it's not supported by actual facts

1105
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
Reporting

1106
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,007
To the point where someone

1107
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,799
Like CBC is reporting

1108
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,383
Fitbit going to do reporting a couple of Chinese scientist to remove

1109
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,431
Fermilab in July that's fair game

1110
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Does did happen

1111
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,503
It's supported by available evidence

1112
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,551
In order to come up with the rest of the

1113
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:59,647
The stuff that people like Alex are saying about this door you can make up a whole lot of details

1114
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,183
And simultaneously you have

1115
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,999
Insist that everyone who commented on this story is lying

1116
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Did you shity stuff

1117
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
That's that's

1118
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,863
There is no conspiracy he won't latch onto

1119
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Who is

1120
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,423
Terrible just such bad work

1121
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
They will

1122
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Lee Papa

1123
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
Any desperate thing

1124
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,663
Just one tweet the right-wing machine will find it and they'll turn it in

1125
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,247
If it works million illegal

1126
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Said f*** off

1127
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
Right

1128
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,599
So you might ask at this point you know like

1129
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Hey

1130
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Why isn't Trump

1131
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Doing any

1132
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,719
I don't know why you would ask if

1133
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,743
It's broken

1134
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,791
Containment and right now at all right

1135
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Why isn't he stopping flights

1136
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,167
It's from China what is doing anything

1137
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,703
Wow no

1138
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Turns out

1139
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
Mike Scott Mike knows

1140
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,799
Why isn't Trump

1141
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:52,383
Sorry no Chinese coming into the United States

1142
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,943
You always see how bad this is for sale week or so

1143
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
Exactly

1144
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
My criticism of the

1145
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
The president on this issue

1146
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,879
Tractors here number one

1147
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
Is he's a very successful

1148
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Intelligent person

1149
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,815
Not have experience in epidemiology of virology or Laboratory

1150
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
Expert

1151
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,215
You are no doubt lying to him

1152
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Exactly right

1153
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,199
He doesn't know how to ask

1154
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
They are making this up

1155
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,807
Sounds like

1156
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:37,183
Trump is going to need a 20-point I do Health Ranger

1157
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
That's all just made up there's there's nothing behind that

1158
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,911
Obviously you know that

1159
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,495
The health Ranger who have deemed Humanity over driving what's up

1160
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:56,895
It does seem like he he's he's planning for a future that doesn't seem to be also part of his plan

1161
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
For the future

1162
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,199
So that's the one vector

1163
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:04,575
That Mike has to criticize drunk on Expert friends

1164
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
I got share advisors are like them

1165
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
Here's the second Vector which is

1166
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
So much worse

1167
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,303
He's very much

1168
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,119
Concern that any loss of faith

1169
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,167
Could

1170
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,471
Taxes reelection chances

1171
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,055
Bubble Market depends on irrational exuberance

1172
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
Irrational exuberance is fear

1173
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,919
Fear of the unknown

1174
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,223
Causes people to sell stocks

1175
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:37,599
None of the stuff that Alex in my car saying is connected to reality at all but I think this clip is really in

1176
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,415
You have Mike basically saying the Trump isn't

1177
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
Taking the

1178
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:46,303
Coronavirus outbreak seriously because he doesn't want to hurt the stock market it does hurt his chances for re-election

1179
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Mike Adams

1180
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:50,911
Trump will let Millions die to get re-elected

1181
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,239
Even in their fantasy world where they're bending over backwards to

1182
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
Defend an indefensible present

1183
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,079
They still have to fall back on excuses like

1184
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
Trump would act

1185
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,503
Protect the health of American citizens but his personal interested re-election is more important to him that he is going to stand

1186
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,783
End up for honest

1187
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:13,183
Everyday Americans by letting a large number of them die in order to facilitate Israel

1188
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
This would just make me think that these people have

1189
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583
No idea what they're even saying

1190
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:25,727
But they're openly expressing support for a leader who would risk the lives of the entire country if it means holding onto power

1191
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,311
And yet somehow they point the finger at the last

1192
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Does being obsessed with

1193
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,663
Guy holding onto power at all costs

1194
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
Victor fake SeaWorld doesn't even make sense

1195
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
It's absurd

1196
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
Mike Adams

1197
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Obvious

1198
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:41,855
Like

1199
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,879
Explanation of how to

1200
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,671
Exploit the bubble economy is very fresh

1201
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,231
That's all that should be illegal

1202
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,255
280

1203
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,911
It depends on irrational exuberance and means no rational person would think it's a good idea

1204
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
So

1205
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
Money

1206
00:52:59,263 --> 00:52:59,775
Mike

1207
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,871
He's just making so much s*** up like this is all made up

1208
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,431
One stress that before we even listen to this clip

1209
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
There is nothing to back this up

1210
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,503
It is Mike's

1211
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
Ideas

1212
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Fantasies

1213
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:17,439
Yesterday in the show Alice I believe that they were working on this strand

1214
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
Yet ready to release it

1215
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Why

1216
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,047
Needed a few more tweaks

1217
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:22,815
Why

1218
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,655
Before they were ready to release it

1219
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,703
They would have released in China on purpose

1220
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Africa

1221
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:37,151
Hampton Inn North America or Mexico City

1222
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
I get the blame of this

1223
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
What

1224
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,783
They're just making this up none of that means anything

1225
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:47,391
That's just like hey this is what I feel isn't even more interesting if we talked about it like

1226
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:53,791
Like this it was a bioweapon that they plan to release somewhere else but it got out of the lab too early by accident

1227
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,351
Yeah it does seem like they're more

1228
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,143
Spitballing script ideas

1229
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:04,543
More like they're they're tossing ideas

1230
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,615
Doesn't

1231
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,735
He's my cat he put a bullet in his own bloodstream

1232
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
Which is worse

1233
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,599
So Alex

1234
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,951
If you ever if you need any indication that he's an opportunist

1235
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
Easy crafts

1236
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Piece of s***

1237
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
Just trying to sell stuff

1238
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
This is

1239
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Maybe is good as yours

1240
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:32,191
Because of what's happening I said I couldn't get 50% off anymore because

1241
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,239
Doesn't give us the margins to find herself

1242
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:35,775
Going to then

1243
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
We have an emergency like this

1244
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,127
Raise prices on the Protestants

1245
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
Lower them

1246
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:46,527
That couple days it's snowing out right now okay

1247
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
By the way

1248
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,207
Products super silver toothpaste 50

1249
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:02,399
Got to have big sales now because it got to strike while the Iron's hot there's a situation that I can exploit to cause

1250
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,167
Panic

1251
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:06,239
That leads people towards maybe wanting to buy the

1252
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
The things that I have given better

1253
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,567
What is the move all this product

1254
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,103
I mean I use Visa

1255
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,943
Lost leaders and hopefully the profit margins on the food buckets that I have pushing

1256
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
Real heart

1257
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,015
Maybe it'll all work out

1258
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,551
It's it's soy

1259
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
Yeah

1260
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,623
Places are bad grift yeah

1261
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,415
Yeah it's really pretty disgusting

1262
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Now we're done with

1263
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
But

1264
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,023
Alex has another guy

1265
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
This guy

1266
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,095
Is a holocaust

1267
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:39,519
He is someone who

1268
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,847
I think we can just leave Holocaust denier is assume

1269
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
It's at least

1270
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
Lurking in the background is too many of his gas

1271
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,991
He's a guy who is a made-up resume

1272
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,039
And his name is dr. Steve pieczenik

1273
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
Ads

1274
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,903
Alex Alex

1275
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,439
But yeah

1276
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,207
It's not the right

1277
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,023
To also declare the end of humanity no

1278
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,583
He's on to talk about John Bolton

1279
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:08,703
And I'm alright is

1280
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Alex

1281
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:13,311
It's clearly doesn't that any of his gaster nose really well because

1282
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:19,967
The spoiler alert Steve ends up completely contradicting Alex's virus narrative

1283
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Great booking

1284
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
Like I said he's on to talk about Bolton

1285
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,831
And here is Alex

1286
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
Steve pieczenik on

1287
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
Casinos

1288
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,207
Bolton

1289
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,303
Neocon ways and the time

1290
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:37,887
What the hell you doing

1291
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,983
I have no idea Steve actually knows John Bolton although I can save it

1292
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,055
The last time Steve was definitely in the state department was

1293
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:47,871
Prior to Bolton interpublic entering public service

1294
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,455
At that time John Bolton was a lawyer at the firm of Covington

1295
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Berlin

1296
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,271
Also steep did Wornall

1297
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,295
Alex about John Bolton

1298
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Trump can't allow him to be in the White House

1299
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,135
And Alex didn't listen to him

1300
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,183
Because Rodger told him that Bolton was

1301
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Cool

1302
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:03,743
You can try

1303
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,327
I don't want to I'm not going to give

1304
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,631
Steve-O

1305
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,191
Hatred of all things

1306
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,983
Things neocon whatever

1307
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,287
Anyway Steve immediately

1308
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,871
A pretty quickly gets to saying they're like a man what they're doing with

1309
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
Virus outbreak

1310
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Totally cool

1311
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:25,247
Transit and she appreciated with Trump have said

1312
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,551
Transparency in China

1313
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,415
Seclusion

1314
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,975
Different areas and

1315
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,095
Because of the flu

1316
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
Oops

1317
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,519
Steve's eyes Cecil point of the matter is there two other handling this appropriately

1318
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,615
I don't need to worry about appreciate them they it's mutual appreciation

1319
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
Humanity is going to last

1320
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,991
Thousand more years working to get to the stars that populate the entire gal

1321
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:04,671
So a lot of these appearances just yelling dumb nonsense about how like the state is pointless and what-have-you

1322
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,767
Elizabethtown of that but there are some points that are kind of Interest

1323
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Sing like this

1324
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,839
What's really happening at

1325
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,655
Point is the absurdity

1326
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,775
A representatives and how little they really do it

1327
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,103
Time of need right now we have a world

1328
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Is it going to

1329
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:27,967
CBS maybe no

1330
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,503
Surgeon General appointed

1331
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:35,135
Service office has been appointed

1332
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
House of Representatives job

1333
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:41,535
Steve does make a great point though like he hasn't seen that there be a surgeon

1334
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
Now Yasin

1335
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
I wonder why Dan

1336
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
I wonder why

1337
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,887
It seems like somebody

1338
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,215
Somebody has the ability to appoint a surgeon-general I wonder

1339
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
I mean Steve doesn't

1340
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,871
Think the House of Representatives is really failing us on this one

1341
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,895
I don't know

1342
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,967
So Steve has this weird thing

1343
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,039
Where he thinks that the newspapers talked to him

1344
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
Eddie thinks

1345
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
Back to powerful people

1346
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,439
When he comes on Alex's show remixes YouTube videos

1347
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:13,023
And I would generally are on the side of thing

1348
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,583
Thinking it's like just sort of a flourish of language

1349
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,351
Or something

1350
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,375
But it's soaking

1351
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Consistent

1352
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,679
Again in this next copii

1353
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
He really seems to think like

1354
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
He's sending a message

1355
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
Nancy Pelosi

1356
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,799
Through Alex

1357
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
Nancy Pelosi

1358
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,663
Idiot savant

1359
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,431
We had

1360
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
That we are a republic

1361
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,831
Not a democracy so she went

1362
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,367
I can read all about

1363
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,207
He's really to be expressing their

1364
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:47,839
Rue Alex's show they have taught Nancy Pelosi about the nature of a republic and she's gone and done

1365
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,863
Some research on it

1366
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,959
This is this is seriously Disturbed Behavior

1367
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:59,359
That doesn't sound like any kind of rhetorical flourish say that seems like he is remembering fundly a time when

1368
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,151
You taught Nancy Pelosi

1369
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,687
The rules

1370
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,735
The Republic I don't think that haven't either

1371
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,319
So Alex is having a good time talking to Steve

1372
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
But

1373
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,367
You know all good things

1374
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,391
Must be interrupted

1375
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
Did when you need to make sales

1376
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,791
I am not an opportunist

1377
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,887
My goal is to promote the lifestyle and

1378
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
Up against the Tyranny that the globalist promote

1379
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,055
Because I believe you're going to want to buy in

1380
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
To having a free open

1381
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Truly

1382
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,967

1383
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,991
Show The Americans

1384
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:40,575
Tricom system or the EU

1385
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:43,391
Return of modern nobility models are

1386
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
Steve pieczenik

1387
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,535
Notice

1388
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,839
The last few months I'm saying hey

1389
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,375

Hide your phone

1392
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,543
In the winter

1393
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
It's getting son that

1394
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Boost your immunity

1395
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,431
Deficiencies

1396
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
Knock on wood I have

1397
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,039
Had a fever in over 4 years and it's because I

1398
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,319
Fish oil everyday

1399
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,879
Are the best sources of natural

1400
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,487
Vitamin D3 vitamin K

1401
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
1% off you know it's very close to selling out

1402
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:29,983
Set within a minute easy start saying by saying I'm not an opportunist and then he's using this

1403
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Outbreak as an opportunity

1404
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
It is the most

1405
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,103
Infuriating verbal Tikki has

1406
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,151
Of starting every sentence

1407
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
With saying I'm not

1408
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,223
And then does exact right

1409
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,271
I'm not bragging

1410
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,295
Right

1411
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,831
I'm not an opportunist

1412
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:47,903
Take opportunity opportunity

1413
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
As a reference

1414
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
The edge

1415
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:52,511
Anyway bring me the Cowboys

1416
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:54,303
It sings Alex talks a little bit

1417
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
He's not a cowboy

1418
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,167
He was a Drifter but he's not a cowboy

1419
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,983
Continues this plug

1420
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:04,799
And honestly I think I only kept this in cuz you said something I did

1421
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,591
A bad mood

1422
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,687
Radio show

1423
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,783
Do I bring a bottle of wine and drink 4 cups of coffee

1424
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
It doesn't work for me

1425
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,599
Big old juicy

1426
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
Gross

1427
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,231
No good

1428
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
Makes you sleep better

1429
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,815
Your body is really amazing

1430
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
First of all

1431
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,983
Juicy Fishel Elitch's that ridiculous

So

1435
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
This might sound

1436
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,663
What drug is this Steve comes back in

1437
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
He has something to say about this

1438
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
Coronavirus

1439
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
And

1440
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
This

1441
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Clip

1442
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319

1443
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
Okay

1444
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,415
This is a masterstroke of Steve pieczenik

1445
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
Using language

1446
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:57,023
This could be an Agatha Christie okay alright alright

1447
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,351
We have a cronut coronavirus coming in

1448
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,655

01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
The reason I can

1450
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,775
90s because I treated a patient

1451
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591

1457
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911

1467
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:05,119
He also cured himself

1468
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
I just

1469
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,983
I just can't hang with that I can

1470
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,335
That was bananas

1471
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,127
That needs a

1472
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,735
Commitment

1473
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Just like

1474
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,807
Yeah man you're amazing

1475
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,671
So anyway Steve Took issue earlier with the fact that there is no Surgeon General

1476
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,719
And what do you know Alex starts

1477
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
Repeating that client

1478
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:38,143
I agree he should have them

1479
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:43,007
Something is really bad

1480
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:49,407
Man I mean it is a really interesting point that now like Steve is brought up if there's no Surgeon General and Alec

1481
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:54,783
Good because I like because Steve is that he's repeating it as like that's a real criticism

1482
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,111
Surgeon General is named Jerome Adams

1483
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:04,767
He was confirmed by the United States yes it was confirmed by the Senate on August 3rd 2017

1484
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,095
If you want to make a point that he's not doing a good job go ahead

1485
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
Do it

1486
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,959
The bureaucracy is making sure there is no Surgeon General

1487
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:18,079
Both of these dudes don't even know that there is a surgeon-general you don't even know that he's a real person

1488
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
Have you seen him in person

1489
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,431
Pictures

1490
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Where is now mister

1491
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,015
Big picture guy let me tell you something

1492
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,039
Fake dude

1493
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,343
Steve pieczenik within those pictures and they took him

1494
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,719
I'm out Steve is coming in and making an argument I haven't seen that there's a Surgeon General right

1495
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,743
And now Alex is like

1496
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:38,815
Doubling down on it and either these dudes even know anything

1497
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,607
Anything about what they're talkin

1498
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,191
F****** surgeon-general you dumbasses

1499
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,775
Was the first place

1500
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,335
Don't know how you can listen

1501
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
You too man say

1502
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,663
Confidently

1503
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,991
Just so proudly

1504
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Bracelet

1505
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,343
I was the first man with this Global pandemic

1506
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:07,743
What month before it became an outbreak it's even better than China better than that

1507
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,791
Because like I can't stress enough how

1508
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,095
Great the storytelling of that clip was

1509
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
The eye treated

1510
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,495
The first patient very well because

1511
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,103
Level a pageant

1512
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
Straight to it that I appreciate

1513
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Yeah

1514
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,199
That person is

1515
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,551
Steve Hunter said I was the first person who got Coronavirus

1516
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:36,671
You wouldn't Bora Bora this is a master at work

1517
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,791
Oh you treated him personally tell me more about that

1518
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:44,095
City with you this is a twist

1519
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,655
Said I could not have been coming every night you

1520
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,703
Gorgeous.

1521
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
Alex has been

1522
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:55,615
Reading Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and adding words to definitions in order to prove that this is

1523
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Pandemic

1524
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,687
How many is Steve pieczenik who is

1525
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
According to Alex on all things

1526
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,295
And

1527
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,367
Let let me ensure your audience in the American audience

1528
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,903
Where would not condemn it

1529
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,927
We have to

1530
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
This will be

1531
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,231
Control

1532
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,023
Want everybody

1533
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Panicking

1534
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Oops

1535
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,351
Shut him up right now

1536
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,447
You can let him say that you wouldn't want anybody

1537
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,311
Lying about having

1538
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
You were the owner addicting at the pandemic that's hybrid

1539
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
That's brutal

1540
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
Steve recognizes that maybe

1541
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
He's contradict

1542
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,015
Doing some of the narratives that Alex is using

1543
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,295
To try and drive sales

1544
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,111
And so he decides I'm going to go ahead and also help

1545
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
Do you sell pelts

1546
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,439
That you're saying is correct

1547
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
K2 vitamin D

1548
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,767
Fish oil

1549
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
Stay healthy

1550
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
And you're less likely

1551
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
Pneumonia

1552
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:58,079
Getting pneumonia sore coronavirus is the immunity system so as long as your immunity system

1553
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,127
Even if you're 60 70s

1554
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
But you're young

1555
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,319
She's not going to be leaf

1556
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,367
Number one

1557
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,975
We don't have a Surgeon General and a public

1558
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,535
How service is disturbing we do have a surge

1559
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
General

1560
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
This whole thing is based on a faulty premise

1561
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
I guess we don't have to worry about it

1562
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,447
I guess

1563
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,983
Steve

1564
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Yeah

1565
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
Man

1566
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
He is done every

1567
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,127
Really seems to have

1568
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,711
Every single thing that has happened since like the mid-70s

1569
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
Steve is Hattiesburg

1570
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
Fingering

1571
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,807
He was also the first person to get HIV

1572
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
Hear that

1573
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
Absolutely did

1574
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
Have

1575
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,415
Play in another route

1576
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,439
The recent

1577
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
Of course

1578
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
This one

1579
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
Boy this is

1580
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,047
This is a big swing

1581
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,119
Years ago when we had the Ebola epidemic

1582
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:57,727
Have to sit down with a former friend of mine and asked this individual was the

1583
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,519
Pharmacist and Surgeon General

1584
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
Of the United States

1585
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,383
Do we have a Surgeon General the answer was no

1586
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:06,943
Do we have a service that can stop

1587
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,503
Got the Ebola from coming in

1588
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,551
You have a problem

1589
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
If I ordered

1590
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
Descend / 3

1591
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:20,511
Ordered General Dempsey

1592
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,535
Answer was no

1593
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,911
Dempsey who was

1594
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:34,847
I mean our military officers who created situation

1595
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,663
Really coming into the United States and they read

1596
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Buyracon

1597
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Understand

1598
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:44,319
Steve that old friend was Dan

1599
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,135
Steve told the chi

1600
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,183
Staff deployed

1601
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,999
Ordered the general

1602
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:52,767
Right

1603
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
This dude is

1604
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
It's f****** while

1605
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,423
Crazy

1606
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,519
He's very high-functioning within this

1607
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,287
Weber

1608
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,079
Bulshit that he's spinning

1609
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,871
So it makes it much more

1610
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,151
Difficult to

1611
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
For Alex

1612
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,711
Text to pinpoint like where there's a

1613
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,295
This is a clear break from reality or just a

1614
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,903
Malicious lies and Alex's isn't equipped to deal with it

1615
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:26,303
You know I actually ordered Tom Brady to lose in the playoffs him to do that in order to get

1616
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
Get him the Wuhan virus

1617
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,375
Then he dropped it

1618
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
In what

1619
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,215
Which is ironic because we had already named it that

1620
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
Way before it right

1621
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
Well I mean

1622
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:40,383
I guess without Steve we would have Ebola everywhere so that's great I'm glad

1623
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,199
But he stopped Ebola

1624
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,223
I really

1625
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,831
Sometimes have a hard time keeping that information in my mind what Steve says something

1626
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:52,159
Things like that and then you repeat it back to me mere moments later

1627
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,439
I'm like he couldn't

1628
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Possibly upset.

1629
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Anyway Steve has a

1630
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,279
Prescription for what we need to do

1631
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
My point is simple

1632
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:04,191
Do not panic we have everything in control now President Trump get

1633
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,567
Assign somebody in this as a Surgeon General

1634
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
And create a public

1635
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
Service

1636
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,919
Military

1637
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,551
To mobilize military so that we have a

1638
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,087
Convenient weight

1639
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:21,855
Control

1640
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
So I guess who's his his angle is you got to either get a surgeon-general which we have

1641
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:33,631
Deploy the military to police the Border

1642
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
That's not good

1643
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,519
Can you imagine

1644
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:43,871
What these morons would say if they did to play the military

1645
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Oh yeah that's

1646
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,111
I'm sorry this is all stupid

1647
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,903
Steve's whole thing is very dumb

1648
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,207
And but he has a third possibility

1649
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
Either

1650
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,535
Surgeon General military the Border

1651
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,327
And actually it's not a third option

1652
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,119
It's actually like what we also need

1653
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,679
And at the same time without

1654
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:12,031
Go to the nearest universities and assist

1655
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,615
How many Chinese Oriental students we have

1656
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,199
Just simply to know what's going on

1657
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,991
Oh yeah it seems like a real

1658
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:24,319
Good thing to do

1659
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:27,391
Cataloguing every member of a certain race has

1660
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:33,791
Never worked out poorly I don't want names and addresses of everyone of a certain

1661
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,375
Erase I think that's bad that's probably bad

1662
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,399
And certainly I don't

1663
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:44,799
Trust that sort of thing coming out of the mouth of somebody who calls them orientals

1664
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,359
To me I was really struggling with that one

1665
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,127
Yeah

1666
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:48,895
At Sunoco

1667
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:55,295
Steve titles

1668
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:00,927
When is Miss Saigon we need to make sure she's taken care of all of my information about the east

1669
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Comes from

1670
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,463
Musical

1671
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
It's a it's weird

1672
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,279
Holocaust denier

1673
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,095
Antiquated racing

1674
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,935
Divas match

1675
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,775
Brush with the other Coronavirus

1676
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:18,847
Jesus anyway he's a he's done

1677
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,663
It isn't nonsense about

1678
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,199
Bi there like

1679
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:23,967
John Bolton

1680
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:26,783
The pathological liar and not really care

1681
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,111
I don't care to hear his perspective on that absolutely it is what it is

1682
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,927
I want to I want him to be

1683
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,487
Set down in a deposition Style

1684
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
And just ask

1685
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,583
Just peppered questions about historical event

1686
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,375
Just to see where he think

1687
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:48,287
I bet you would know a lot of like details about a lot of stuff like a lot of

1688
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
Claimed to have done it

1689
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:55,199
That's what I want

1690
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
Enough

1691
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,247
To get him committed for the rest of

1692
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Good life

1693
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
So Steve is done

1694
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,087
This point

1695
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:06,719
I do like I should reveal like one of the things that I really wanted to do this episode 4 is B

1696
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,767
Because on the 27th

1697
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,327
News broke that Wolfgang halbig got arrest

1698
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
Yes

1699
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:16,703
The guy who Alex had on many times and was the basis for a lot of

1700
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,287
Alex is reporting about Sandy Hook I'm sure Alex had a lot to

1701
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,103
To say about it and how big got arrested because

1702
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:25,663
He had gotten letter Posner

1703
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,783
Personal information his ID and his social security number and was sending it out

1704
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:34,367
Yeah that's that if that wasn't a crime I'll be real mad

1705
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,439
Now it's an interesting Theory

1706
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,719
That I

1707
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,535
I think it's possible but I have no idea this is the case

1708
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,839
Auto recent episode Alec

1709
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,887
Mike said get ready for bad news about me

1710
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,911
Need to come out

1711
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,959
Even building this up

1712
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,239
And I

1713
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,007
Think it

1714
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:55,103
Within the realm of possible that Alex was one of the people that

1715
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,895
Wolfgang might have sent

1716
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,735
Information to I don't know if that's true

1717
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:04,319
Speculation on my part

1718
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,343
Possibility

1719
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
That Alex

1720
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,159
Might have known

1721
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,487
That's a positive I'm sorry that Wolfgang B

1722
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
Be getting arrested

1723
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
I think it's

1724
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,327
You've connected to a lot of

1725
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:18,655
Even if he wasn't one of the people who woke and contacted

1726
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,423
Possible

1727
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,495
Rocaine contacted somebody else who knows Alex and pulled out

1728
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,103
Ha there is a possibility that he was aware of this and he knew

1729
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,943
When Wolfgang halbig gets arrested his name is going to be brought into it

1730
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,479
So I

1731
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,271
Kind of thought that maybe Alex

1732
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
To touch on this

1733
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,087
He doesn't he doesn't mention it at all

1734
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,623
On the 28th there's no mansion

1735
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:40,159
Or discussion of it at all

1736
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,207
So we'll have to wait and see if it

1737
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
Pizza Everett

1738
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Enters the

1739
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,279
The Infowars

1740
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,583
But for now we can

1741
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,375
Steve's Don

1742
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Alex

1743
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,191
Finishes up the show

1744
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,215
And

1745
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,007
Erie is being a dumbass hole

1746
01:15:56,031 --> 01:16:02,175
Helicopter little while do a live feed of us and be back in studio later

1747
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,991
Punjab powerful broadcasted a great job crew

1748
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
Great job group

1749
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
Weather

1750
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,855
F***** you doing he goes out on a f******

1751
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
Kobe

1752
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:14,207
Yeah he's going to go in the film rights or report where he's at

1753
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:18,559
Hey look you know there's a lot of you know a lot of people

1754
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
With positions on Kobe

1755
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,399
Without getting into any of that

1756
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,935
What I would say is

1757
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,495
The voice that really we need to hear

1758
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,079
And the voice that no one is bringing to the table is

1759
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,151
The person whose defensive about helicopter safety

1760
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:36,479
I got is a real angles that f***** up

1761
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
When I was reading

1762
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
The coverage of this

1763
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
What I should have been reading about what

1764
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,903
Is whether or not people were more afraid of

1765
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,207
Write that

1766
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,487
Hey if there's one thing

1767
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:49,535
Thing I know about this Kobe so

1768
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Situation

1769
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,095
It is that people are clamoring out

1770
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:52,863
Forte

1771
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:58,239
On helicopter safety day I need such a bizarre thing for him to

1772
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:04,383
It it's super bizarre but it is sort of a way for him to skirt any kind of

1773
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Like

1774
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,455
Overtly

1775
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,735
Distasteful

1776
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,807
Kind of things about like Kobe's passing

1777
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,111
Yeah and at the same time he can

1778
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
Get attention

1779
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
Yeah give me like a really

1780
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:24,607
Cowardly way to still try and capitalize up celebrities

1781
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:26,911
It is something

1782
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,703
I think that should have been shot down at

1783
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,751
Search meeting very quickly

1784
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,775
No way

1785
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,079
What's our take on this whole Kobe

1786
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,895
Put you up in a helicopter

1787
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
Stop at work

1788
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,687
Love it

1789
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,247
So I think that should

1790
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:44,319
Be Illustrated with the sort of work that he's doing

1791
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
Will you see

1792
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,623
Throughout this episode

1793
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,183
Very consistently is

1794
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:54,047
Trying to raise the temperature of people's feelings surrounding the coronavirus and that

1795
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
Transmute that into

1796
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
2 sails

1797
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
Largely about food

1798
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,167
The food buckets are like

1799
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Primary

1800
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,959
On this episode

1801
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,983
But also the pills

1802
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
You see that you sure

1803
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
You see that

1804
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,591
This is empty emptier than

1805
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,615
Then

1806
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
At least it was

1807
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
A long time ago

1808
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
Yeah this is

1809
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,967
Really really

1810
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
It's it's it's

1811
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:15,551
It's G but I I think they like

1812
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
I might have

1813
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:20,927
Not really even been super interested in doing this episode

1814
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,207
Except for the fact of wolf

1815
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
Getting help it got arrested in Alex Camp bring himself

1816
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,535
Even talk about

1817
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,839
And then Steve

1818
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
And he's crazy.

1819
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:31,167
Yeah he was the first person

1820
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
Yeah

1821
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,471
I still can't believe

1822
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,287
He said that out loud at that I have a hard time believing that

1823
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,567
Genuinely

1824
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
Like on a very visceral level

1825
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
Resisting believing that a human being

1826
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,039
Said that that sort of thing is absolutely worth it

1827
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:51,647
In the same way that edges return makes makes it all worthwhile

1828
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,439
Pay-per-view worthwhile

1829
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,023
Rusty's declaration

1830
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,303
Obsessed

1831
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:04,703
I'll bet I'll tell you who had the first outbreaker

1832
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,727
I thought you knew that was

1833
