00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,416
Friend of the show Mighty DeRosa has been a lot of time

5
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
He bought me a flashlight

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024

Victorious baby sex shop

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,296
About getting a flashlight

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
For this

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
I can't afford this

17
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,440

Flashlight knockoff type thing

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,064

What kind of friend Marty DeRosa is Astoria number times I don't mind putting his business

25
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,496
I have that flashlight for a little while

26
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,800
It wears out its novelty

27
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,616
Yeah the excitement of

28
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:58,016
First time around is is great but then overtime

29
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,040
Becomes a hassle

30
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
Like going to clean it

31
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:05,696
Google has the best bet about

32
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
I'm sure I would paraphrasing

33
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072

Induction

61
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,384
We're probably about two weeks behind

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
You became the entire beginning of the show

63
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,808
You know beautiful like 2:50

64
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Into trouble

65
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:14,464
We've got first of all sorry about the weird schedule this

66
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,839
Supposed to Monday Wednesday Friday

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,119
I just

68
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Keep up quite frankly

70
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,519
Matter of

71
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
This is

72
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,895
To do our last episode with all the Soros business

73
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Stuff like that

74
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,687
Sometimes

75
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
The workload is too much

76
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Tuesday Thursday

77
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Back to normal

78
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
Next week

79
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,159
I'm not defensive about it I just want to live

80
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,511
Not really but I'm not

81
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
Today Jordan we are going to be going over on modern day ever

82
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
Going to be going over the

83
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
15

84
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,727
Of January 2019

85
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
In in

86
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,567
In the year of Our Lord I'm still writing

87
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
That's correct

88
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,639
I get out of that happen

89
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,223
Episode

90
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:14,367
Alex's had this big news broke recently I have you heard something

91
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
Think about this and that is that

92
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
He lost

93
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Little League

94
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Situation

95
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:20,767
Where in

96
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,583
The Sandy Hook families will be able to

97
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
I get in Discovery

98
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,703
Some of his financial documents internal memos

99
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,471
Yeah

100
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,079
There's this there's this legal situation and everybody bring it up to me

101
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:40,479
I wanted to be able to address it by covering whatever Alex is talking about about it

102
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Not talkin about it

103
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,087
So I listen to Monday and a lot of it is just

104
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Complaining about that Gillette commercial

105
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
That's a 04

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
That's a non-starter

107
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,375
Not not really caring so much

108
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,959
Watch over that episode but

109
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Tuesday the

110
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,567
The 15th actually interested

111
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,847
Merits talking about

112
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
And so we will

113
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
Here is an out-of-context drop

114
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
From Today Show

115
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Donald Trump like tacos

116
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
And Obama likes like winners

117
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
I get it

118
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,999
Alex likes to have

119
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Fun

120
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
Refuse refuse

121
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
Piece of his conversations

122
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,031
He's having where he's defending Trump getting all those burgers for

123
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,431
The football team Clemson football team

124
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,991
Get it

125
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Cuz he likes

126
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,343
I don't know

127
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,647
We will start the show with what

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,183
Maine Marathon

129
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
Surprise anyone

130
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
Your any

131
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Of this store

132
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Of nonsense

133
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,679
I really important story that illustrates why we can't take this country back

134
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,775
Representative

135
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,895
Overboard

136
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,015
Adam contest quote from the New York Times

137
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Shoreline

138
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,463
Vicious lie Factory

139
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,863
Remove words

140
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
Clearwater

141
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,311
And none of the media will eat

142
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,919
White supremacist

143
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
White supremacy

144
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
When you got a public statement

145
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
Today

146
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,463
I have experienced that they are times

147
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
They are

148
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,047
Devils

149
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,703
You can kind of see there at the end that a lot of the energy that's driving this is probably about Alex's own personal

150
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
Listen to every episode of the show

151
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
In the present day as I have

152
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,295
To the past but I don't remember him talking that much about Steve

153
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,855
Do it the past

154
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:29,951
It surprises me not to hear him defend Steve King

155
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
But that it surprises me to hear

156
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
I haven't heard you talk much about that guy

157
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Defense

158
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,079
Bet you do it publicly

159
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,103
Is a bad boy

160
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
It's that it's not in my memory

161
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
The dedotated strikes a novel Court

162
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,951
Anything that would assimilate I would associate him with the white National

163
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,279
But that's only because the New York Times is taking

164
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,839
New contact

165
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,167
And putting him in that box right never

166
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:17,567
Nationalist to talk about it because he's never been

167
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,223
For being a white nationalist or white supremacist before because Dan of course he is never said anything

168
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,087
The issue

169
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,207
How does white supremacy

170
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
Attitude

171
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Supremacist

172
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
Quote

173
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
It's

174
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,703
He talks about illegal aliens

175
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
Okay

176
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,663
He says we should be proud of the accomplishments of Western Civilization absolutely

177
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Are the Japanese proud of themselves

178
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,503
Not the same thing

179
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
It's just it's just a Rosetta Stone into everything

180
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
How they lie how they manipulate

181
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,535
And how the Republicans

182
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
To curry favour with the left

183
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
Race Pace leopard constituents

184
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Hoverboard

185
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
So he's mad

186
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Alex's pretty bad

187
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,919
Really quick

188
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,271
P by taking Steve's

189
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
But not turning on Steve King cuz they disagree with his

190
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,879
Positions or anything like that

191
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,439
The only reason they stripped him of his committee seats

192
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,487
Is because Randy feenstra

193
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,047
Iowa State

194
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
It just announced his candidacy

195
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
Run against King

196
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
2020 primary

197
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,775
If it didn't have a very viable replacement waiting in the wings

198
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Outspoken

199
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
Like they have for years

200
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
Does it have a primary challenge

201
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:01,503
Looks Like You Can Go the Distance

202
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Costanza

203
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,903
Supremacist and that is why they have gotten rid of 98% of

204
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
There's a second because for years I served as a i

205
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,399
Immigration policy and that's

206
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
I'm so

207
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
Politicians who wanted to Curry favor with that side of the

208
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
The Republican Party

209
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,591
With him in a way that I

210
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
I've seen a couple of reporters described as like he was a kingmaker

211
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
Right-wing immigrations.

212
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
But now he isn't that anymore Trump is so he doesn't even function

213
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:45,023
For the right-wing

214
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:53,215
Together the primary candidates successfully without the baggage

215
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
He doesn't serve what role he used to serve

216
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:01,919
Make a list of course they're going to throw them away. It's nothing to do with his white supremacy the comments that he's making

217
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Understand

218
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Ignored

219
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,551
4 years

220
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,135
Steve King has always been on some b*******

221
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,463
But this current examples that he's going through right now

222
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,047
Him questioning why what's white supremacy is considered a bad thing

223
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
Then claiming that the New York Times made up

224
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:30,335
2018 The Weekly Standard reported that while speaking with

225
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
Stop

226
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,991
He was talking about how some local jalapenos were grown in Mexican shirt

227
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:43,391
Which conversation turned from literal dirt to Heather's metaphorically a lot of dirt

228
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,743
After the article came out tonight ever having said such a thing

229
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
Accused The Weekly Standard a notoriously conservative Outlet

230
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:57,471
And demanded proof. They released the full tape

231
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:03,103
Leftist lies exist without original sources because they are false and manufactured accusation

232
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,895
So they did

233
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,711
They release the tape exactly what the

234
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,015
And showed can clearly calling immigrants

235
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,551
And asylum-seekers.

236
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,647
Play this game again with the New York Times

237
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
I don't feel like I have much interest in giving him the benefit of the doubt

238
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
Is it possible that such an out-of-touch bigot

239
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:29,215
But he doesn't realize how old vert might be

240
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
I don't care

241
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,335
Because the evidence that Steve King is a real f*****-up raises a******

242
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,151
Go far deeper than not liking illegal immigration

243
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,199
I've been quote-unquote proud of the West

244
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:42,271
Is Alex's asserting

245
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
One time

246
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:49,695
Give me the comic

247
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
ER that's

248
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,399
And so that's why he can throw around the n-word all the

249
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
He's not a racist

250
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,103
I've heard a lot of those doing comedy over the years down

251
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,831
The US House of Representatives in 2000

252
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,415
Over that span of time representative King assets

253
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Intense

254
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,887
Also did you know that until at least 2016 Steve had a Confederate flag on his office desk

255
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:38,591
Which was in the union during the Civil War

256
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
People like to say that's a message

257
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Kemah go on to remove the flag

258
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:48,063
From his desk after Scott Michael Green murdered two police officers in a style killing

259
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
In 2017

260
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,671
Footage was found of green being asked by other police officers

261
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
The Urbandale High School football game

262
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:01,375
Who's attending a Confederate flag black students

263
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,775
Charleston South Carolina

264
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Because of his racist ideology

265
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,127
And everybody started talking about how it's f***** up

266
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Confederate flags are flown estate houses

267
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
King it with speech

268
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,807
Confederate flag calling it wasn't for the South

269
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
And saying quote

270
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,927
I regret deeply that we're watching this country be divided again over a symbol

271
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:30,303
Again he represent Iowa

272
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Different different thing

273
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,103
Different things different

274
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:45,919
Iowa

275
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,991
Better if he was from the south

276
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,575
Like one of the actual Confederate

277
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,927
The argument of Southern Pride and that sort of thing would make way more sense

278
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,487
Bent to be doing this SB

279
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
Representative for a Union state

280
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
I don't know anyway

281
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
In September 2016 he went on a little

282
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:08,447
Condemning black people having abortions

283
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Because they listen to people in the

284
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Congressional Black Caucus

285
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Same quote

286
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
They chose to have a Congressional Black Caucus

287
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
They chose to have an abortion

288
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,783
I would give you even money that a vast majority of mothers who say they can't afford an abortion have an iPhone which cost more

289
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
That's a cool comment

290
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:33,791
How about them welfare Queens

291
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
It does feel a little bit subtle their reason our way into this

292
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Betty literal red flags

293
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,295
Benefits there was the time in 2018 with members of Austria's freaking party

294
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,111
The political party that was

295
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
A literal member of the Nazi SS

296
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
When asked about it

297
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,327
Every presently set of the group America pushing the platform they push they would be Republicans

298
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,607
No

299
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
That doesn't mean what you think

300
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Spell probably

301
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:21,663
Of course this was his campaign for the

302
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,295
Toronto after the 14 words of white supremacy

303
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:32,671
Patriots prize no on that he supported

304
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
The 14 words

305
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:37,791
We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's baby

306
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:41,631
By the way was repeated by David in all caps

307
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
Said

308
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,679
God for Steve

309
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,727
#truth Rising

310
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
This guy is never been opened

311
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,039
Out-of-control Chevrolet

312
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,439
David July 2016 parents on MSNBC right around the Republican National Convention time

313
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Steve King extolled the virtues of

314
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
People

315
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:15,167
I'd ask you to go back through history and figure out what contributions have been made by these other categories of people that you're talk

316
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
Talking about any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization

317
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:27,711
He was later called on it and kind of apology meant Western Civilization instead of white people

318
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,015
Which is really just a perfect example of giving up

319
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:34,367
The game dog whistles rsf1

320
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
What I meant sorry I've already

321
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,583
Which means

322
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Jordan a******

323
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:55,359
In July 2013 he didn't interview with Newsmax quote Forever Young

324
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
Undocumented immigrant who's a valedictorian

325
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,271
There's no doubt there are 130 lb I got calves the size of cantaloupe

326
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,599
Because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert

327
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,135
Cool bro

328
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
Steve King won his first election

329
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,255
22002 by whipping

330
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,327
Proposed bill to make English the official language of Iowa

331
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Why

332
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,447
I just be my response

333
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Why

334
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:27,103
I don't know why that's an important issue unless you're just trying to wedge people a little bit

335
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Drum up

336
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Insecurities

337
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
Some fears about the other

338
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,991
It was it was weird

339
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
Floated that built

340
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
The Iowa City

341
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Official sister city

342
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,671
Berlin

343
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:47,327
Killer with a certain subsection

344
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,143
Berlin

345
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:57,311
In 2012 by illegal aliens

346
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,383
M13 more killed by drunk driving illegal

347
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,919
You just making up stuff

348
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
But the rhetorics.

349
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
And you can hear the same talking point

350
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,551
Repeated ultra-conservative propaganda video

351
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,879
I've definitely heard that exact line come out of Alex's mouth

352
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Lisa doesn't

353
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:16,255
In November 2009 he skipped his son mix wedding

354
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
The cast of pointless vote against the Affordable Care Act

355
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,655
That one battery last point about his racism motor 2.5 a vehicle

356
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
FamilySearch

357
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Yeah

358
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:32,895
Indo I in June 2018 he told Breitbart that he didn't want Muslims working in meat factories

359
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:36,991
Infidel Muslims are not eating

360
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:42,623
So as long as they're preparing for infidels to help send them to hell and must make happy

361
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,927
I don't want people doing my

362
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,231
Doing that with my pork that won't eat it

363
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,303
Let alone hope they go to hell for eating pork chops

364
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:56,703
Convoluted understand I think what he's trying to express his he's worried

365
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
That Muslims will taint the pork

366
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
Because they know that other Muslims aren't eating

367
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,919
Or something like that I think that's what he's trying to express

368
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
Uncle thing but I cuz otherwise because otherwise

369
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Eat it so

370
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
F****** what

371
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,391
I think he's

372
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
Sounds like I'm

373
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Call Shirley

374
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Sensitive to

375
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:27,424
As long as they're preparing the report for infidels and help sends them to hell

376
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,240
Infidels are sent

377
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
Yeah you're going to the meet somehow

378
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,176
Even if you're not

379
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Scary muzzle

380
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Mozart

381
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,600
What he's saying is that Muslims

382
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,624
Are joyful

383
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Preparing

384
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,184
For white folks

385
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,256
In order to ensure that by Vera Lynn

386
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,536
Code

387
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,096
People go to hell problem with that part

388
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Which

389
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,680
About like the idea

390
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:03,264
That they're doing a great job cuz they know when people eat it

391
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:10,176
Can you get great pork I guess

392
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,784
The real

393
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
Pretty f*****-up

394
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
Good way to look at that

395
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:22,976
28

396
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,816
Tweet when he posted Bart article and editorial

397
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,632
5% of Italians

398
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
Now oppose Mass immigration

399
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,960
Europe is waking up

400
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,032
King retweeted that saying quote Europe is waking up

401
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
Will America in Thai

402
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,664
I hate to see her

403
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,712
This takeover

404
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
I hate

405
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
To see our country

406
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
Hate to see prisoners at Abu ghraib prison were revealed

407
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
Just teasing

408
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,376
You know how I say that

409
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:12,384
Through The Years Kingsman supporter of all the far-right foreign politicians that Alex also love

410
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,504
We see we seen Steve King strongly support geert Wilders Marin the Viktor Orban

411
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,112
He was being interviewed by those Austrian Nazi descendants I mention

412
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
Advocated the position that Soros

413
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Was behind the grate

414
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:28,256
Westerners may replace culturally

415
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,792
The demographic Lee

416
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:34,656
So he has been for his entire

417
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
This kind of

418
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,824
His story is an interesting story

419
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
The conservative body politic

420
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
This country

421
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,248
In order to understand a little more about how that's

422
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,552
It's important to follow the money

423
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,648
If you look at the information to the public about Steve Canyon who's donating

424
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:57,440
You seem interesting picture

425
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:02,048
The first thing that jumps out to you is that in the 2017 2018 cycle

426
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
Do you like me

427
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
First place among his donors

428
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
But $10,800 in donations

429
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,008
Individuals being sent that his way from within the Navy

430
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Which it does not make me

431
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
Doesn't make me feel great

432
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
He also got $10,000 from the John Bolton political action committee but I don't know what to make

433
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
But

434
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,600
If you look at his past fundraising

435
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
You'll see a very interesting trend

436
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
Name of it is numbers are pretty normal for most years

437
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,512
Then take a massive Spike

438
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
In the 2012 election

439
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
He goes from 1.02 million raised

440
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Cycle

441
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
The 3.8 million just two years later

442
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
A lot of that money

443
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:46,080
Over 250,000 organization called Club

444
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
For growth

445
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,664
Which seems like a really fun nice name

446
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:55,296
In reality the group is a far-right fundraising outfit whose activities went into overdrive in

447
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
2012

448
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
Least 10 billion dollars that then governor of Wisconsin

449
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:01,440
Wisconsin Scott Walker

450
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
To oppose his recall vote and support his initiative to strip collective bargaining

451
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
Protection

452
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
And crippled you know

453
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,888
You misunderstand their name

454
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:14,752
You think it means a collection of people who are pro-growth

455
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,336
What it is is a literal

456
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
That is for the growth of the white nationalist

457
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:26,528
Orthopedic back road

458
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Notzoey

459
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,488
What's interest

460
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,768
Koch Network fun

461
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,792
Like Freedom partner

462
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,376
Gamefowl Steve King 11000

463
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,776
$300 in the family research Council

464
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:50,080
Suspiciously named political action committee

465
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,616
Clearly aren't front

466
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,224
On the nose

467
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
There's a huge push in the 2012 election to retain what

468
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,904
Seawing of the Republic

469
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Looking party

470
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,744
And to not succumb to dwindling support

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,024
But definitely was happening

472
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
That point

473
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
Part of this was a massive cash

474
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,400
Confusion in the coffers of various people

475
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
We're carrying the banner of

476
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,984
People funding the Tea Party were into

477
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
And Steve King was absolutely one of the main figure

478
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,384
Face swelling of his

479
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,456
Really hard to think that's not

480
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
The case was about

481
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:33,344
Small-government Dan it had no reaction to black president

482
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
Sooner

483
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,304
You see that exact same pattern when you look into the money going into other Tea Party

484
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:46,912
Louie gohmert is a bit of an exception because he was a republican running attack

485
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Pretty much a sure thing

486
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,264
But Michele Bachmann is another great

487
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,360
She raised just under 3.5 million of the 2008 election

488
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:01,504
The number skyrocketed to 13.5 in 2010 and 15 million in 2012

489
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,040
Who is Michele Bachmann

490
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,576
Top donor throughout her career

491
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
You guessed it

492
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
The Club for Growth

493
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Who is Ted Cruz's all-time top Downer

494
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:09,952
Call Firgrove

495
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,768
Who is Rand Paul's career spanning top donor

496
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,048
The Club for Growth

497
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,400
With over a hundred thousand dollars from them coming in the 2012

498
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:22,496
There's a concerted effort on the part of very rich conservative interest

499
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
To ship the politics of the right to a more extreme version of

500
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,336
Conservatism

501
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
In the 2012 election cycle

502
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,432
And before but that was crunch time

503
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,712
That's not news

504
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,784
It's not even news to say that Steve King was a big part of

505
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
What is important

506
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,928
Because it demonstrates the sort of things that they were interested in being part of that ship

507
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,024
Defected it outright white supremacist was among their top guys

508
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,328
Should tell you everything that you need to know

509
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
About what they wanted

510
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,656
The Overton window to move towards

511
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
At that time

512
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
What was it what was the word you used

513
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,080
I suppose

514
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,384
It wasn't disintegration it was

515
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
Descendants

516
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
Descendants

517
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,552
Deterioration

518
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,136
Raz-b apotheosis

519
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:20,096
We're talking about the same thing just looking at it

520
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:23,936
Who is mayor of former Republican National Committee spokesperson

521
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:27,520
Just Steve King has done for the Republican Party

522
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:32,128
Very very few Grassroots Conservative Republican

523
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,432
Actually

524
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
However

525
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:42,112
Do you Mabel's elected Republicans were more restrictionist or otherwise hard-line to strike a pose if it reads as mod

526
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,416
That's the kingmaker

527
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,488
Yeah he is the person who people are able to

528
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,024
Be around

529
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,632
Is that Donald Trump is that you don't have to

530
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Ostensibly

531
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
Distance himself from

532
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,616
Steve King

533
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Where is like

534
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
This guy says all the stuff that I want to stay

535
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,224
But because I can

536
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
Myself from him

537
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
I can do all the stuff

538
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
That results

539
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Without ever being

540
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
Associated

541
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,232
Really you're if you're pretty far right

542
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
Card right

543
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,536
And you have a guy who's

544
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
Outright

545
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Fascist

546
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,984
You look like you're pretty close to the middle

547
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
And that's an important person to have around

548
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,824
Absolute quite frankly

549
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Explain

550
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
In some ways

551
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,200
Spend so much money

552
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:46,112
Keeping him around despite his horrible

553
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
And I think almost everybody

554
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,512
Who understood politics

555
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
To an extent

556
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Knew that that's the role these are

557
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,888
And why Republicans would never take Target

558
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,192
And now we've come to a point where

559
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,216
Where he's no longer needed

560
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:01,984
Would you like a

561
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,752
Appendix

562
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
Is a vestigial organ of

563
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,080
The bigotry machine

564
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,128
That needed to be put in place

565
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,920
The machine is in place now

566
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,504
You don't need that appendix right so he's getting removed

567
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
And

568
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
That's that

569
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,952
Whatever his nonsense about Steve King being all aboveboard about stuff

570
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Nonsense

571
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
That idea of a liberal

572
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Pedialyte

573
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,448
I don't think anyone who listens to our share of that

574
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
New disguise

575
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:38,592
But I just wanted to

576
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
Really

577
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,640
And I think it's some of that

578
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,432
Important stuff

579
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
Important again to note that in the

580
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,248
The 2018 election

581
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
All of his wife

582
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Supremacist views where I

583
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
WYD

584
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Like

585
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
See them

586
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Super clear and

587
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,696
You still won re-election

588
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,768
Buy 1/4 + 1

589
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:04,448
You still need it

590
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
Hit his Challenger with a Dumber

591
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,544
Republicans

592
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,824
They're still going to defend him

593
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
There's another option

594
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,664
So we have that other option

595
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,992
Well Steve will be out of office in 20

596
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
Yep you'll lose that primer

597
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:25,696
Any something in this next clip that I think is a brutal slippers

598
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
For the tongue

599
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
Not like saying something racist

600
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:34,656
But I bet you just as Edward Edward Edward Edward Edward Edward a Alex

601
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
He said something here

602
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Just makes me think

603
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:46,176
Oh my gosh oh my gosh

604
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,296
Organization organization

605
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
Clearly

606
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
And the New York Times removes that out

607
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,216
You asking up there

608
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,008
It's incredible

609
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,824
The mapping white people making up the internet

610
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,408
Marc Jacobs the internet with their opinions

611
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,944
Pissing on fire hydrant

612
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,272
Dry white piranha

613
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,880
I think your eyes perked up at exactly the point about

614
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,672
We all know his talk

615
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:34,048
That's a weird thing for Alex to say I think it's a real bad flip up because

616
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,144
That implies that ideas that King 1000r talkin

617
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
And the fact that Alex leaves her with them

618
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
To the point of claiming to know what he meant to say in this interview

619
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:51,456
Seems to imply that they might be getting talking points from the sniveler source

620
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
I don't know

621
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,016
It seems very

622
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Very strange phrasing

623
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,928
Arthur's one

624
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
But you've always been

625
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
It's so unfair to

626
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:11,680
Maybe a little unfair

627
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Being super fussy

628
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:21,664
I could see an argument that I'm making a mountain out of a molehill very strange

629
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
We all know his talkin

630
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,112
Every Republican and Democratic

631
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:34,208
Never says that people who agree with him have talking point

632
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,864
That's a fair point always talks about how like all of his weirdo Patriots

633
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
They're just on the same page naturally

634
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,032
Everything

635
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:50,336
It's because they just know the truth

636
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,384
And they're right about everything

637
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,688
So for him to be saying something about

638
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,968
Steve

639
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
But he has talking points

640
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
It seems like

641
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
Little bit of a

642
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,160
Really good point

643
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
King isn't

644
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
The one

645
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
Controlling what's

646
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,888
Marriott points that means

647
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,912
That they're coming

648
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,728
From somewhere you didn't create the

649
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
Exactly

650
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Does implied

651
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
I don't know

652
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
Anyway

653
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
In his next Wipeout

654
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
I'm going to go through every angle

655
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
That true

656
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,696
New York Times machine how they twist

657
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,512
Once they put out one big lie

658
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,584
Define someone

659
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,656
No.

660
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,496
Real things they said that's defining

661
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Illegal aliens

662
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,128
Have double the crime rate of the average citizen that's it

663
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
Becomes the white supremacist

664
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:07,392
The bus and

665
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
Signal

666
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
What else is trying to describe there is basically house

667
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
He does stuff

668
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:17,632
Yeah like the idea of attaching things to people and like rating

669
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,216
Perception based on

670
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,496
Well blurring lines

671
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
And stuff like that absolute

672
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,384
Idea about like immigrants committing

673
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,968
Stuff like that

674
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,784
That is a white supremacist

675
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,576
You don't need

676
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
Latched onto him

677
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
Statistic of being

678
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
Somehow I supremacist

679
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Things that

680
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,888
Is bulshit or at least white nationalist

681
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Justin Bieber

682
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,752
Is it like

683
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
That's unfair

684
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Virtual level that is

685
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Ridiculous

686
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
It's just because the report

687
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,664
News like

688
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,456
Muzzling

689
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
Things

690
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
Some have described this as races

691
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,464
Can't be more overseas

692
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
He is

693
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
Indigo

694
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,584
Directions

695
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
Score going out of their way

696
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,656
To try and be

697
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:23,936
Quotes

698
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
Fair

699
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,984
And s*** like that

700
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
Liberal

701
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,872
Media Outlets don't want to call racism racism

702
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Yeah yeah yeah

703
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,136
4th and he keeps a couple times now

704
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Immigrants

705
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,976
Crime

706
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,584
Are the Oxford criminology and criminal justice Research Unit did a study on immigration

707
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
And crime

708
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
In 2017 that

709
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Reflected a bunch

710
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Different studies

711
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,960
Compiled

712
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
2

713
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
Here are some excerpts

714
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,736
Research has consistently shown is negatively associated with crime overall

715
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,832
Colin is not significantly either violent or property crime

716
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:16,672
If an undocumented immigrant is arrested for a criminal offense

717
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Before a missed.

718
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:24,608
Additionally

719
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
We're such access is not available

720
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,800
That last part is completely obvious given the being charged with the crime might jeopardize our access to essential services

721
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
Which is entirely against

722
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,152
The study further found that foreign-born victims

723
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
The crimes are much less likely to report crimes against them

724
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,040
Because of fears of being mistreated by the police or being deported

725
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:46,368
Some statistics they found for pouring over all the data

726
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
Between 2005 and

727
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
2010

728
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,512
Incarceration rate Rose 16% Among Us

729
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
But only 7%

730
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,096
Foreign-born

731
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Nonsense

732
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,704
They started his own Hometown to be there was any pattern

733
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,264
Between

734
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,568
Using Austin city

735
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,896
Retract level analysis

736
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,920
2042

737
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
2006

738
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:16,576
Mansfield found no relationship between doing the immigration and serious property crime

739
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,672
Deposited the new arrivals might have revitalized neighborhoods

740
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:24,512
By causing a bottom-up growth among Mexican immigrants commercial Enterprises

741
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
They reviewed violent crimes

742
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:31,168
Statistics in cities of high drug and homicide issues like Miami

743
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
Immigrants were not the people committing

744
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
These crimes

745
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,520
But in many cases

746
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
Second generation

747
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Brett's work

748
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,944
So they refine the data analysis and found the places with high rates of Financial Security

749
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,320
Just to say jobs and access to Social Services slower than average

750
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,160
Which cities yes this is effects

751
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:56,000
Poverty is mitigated by access to Social Services

752
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
And employer

753
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
Those are two things being around has no relation

754
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
To Immigrant status

755
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,912
What I would find

756
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,448
This would be such a

757
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
Interesting experiment

758
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,544
Worthy

759
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
Consequences

760
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
Is for misdemeanors

761
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
End end

762
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
Keno like nonviolence

763
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
Crimes

764
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
Equal 4

765
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
As they are for

766
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
Demented

767
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,928
Would we see a massive drop

768
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Do you know I'm saying like

769
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,560
Imagine if there was a real threat that you would get to

770
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Deported

771
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,632
Dollar Tree

772
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:35,936
You know like

773
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,216
I just you and I

774
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,520
How much lower do you

775
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,104
If the threat

776
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,712
Disincentivize and aspect

777
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,552
It's almost it almost seems like that is

778
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
More of a deterrent

779
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
The death

780
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,904
I don't have

781
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,512
You know I accessed the statistics on that but it makes intuitive sense

782
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,352
Like that

783
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Kind of

784
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Account for a

785
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,960
Interesting idea

786
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
Saudi studies also looked at Chicago

787
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,872
A 2009 study looked at neighborhoods of poverty rates in low employee

788
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:21,248
And the researcher found in areas where there were large populations of recent

789
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
The number of homicides

790
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,112
Priest vallon

791
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,952
Reinvigoration of neighborhoods when do immigrants arrive

792
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,792
There is there is very good

793
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
The crime goes down

794
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
When there's an inn

795
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
Influx of immigrants

796
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
City

797
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,008
Like when

798
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,824
Always been the case for first-generation immigrants

799
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
Has always been

800
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
Dude weird scraping to get buy-in

801
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Your f***

802
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
Not our

803
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
We're trying to make it our own

804
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
Impossible

805
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:02,208
Fit into

806
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,024
Like when they talk about

807
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
Bastardization

808
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
It's awful all of this

809
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,656
Diversity and we don't have enough

810
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
White representation

811
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Infinitely

812
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
We better

813
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,896
And just even in ways that are statistics

814
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Retractable

815
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,432
Yeah

816
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
You can find 100 studies again to the

817
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,808
The minutiae of exactly how the idea that

818
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,856
Commit more crimes than citizens

819
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Wrong

820
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
We can leave that here for now

821
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
The only studied seems to indicate that immigrants commit more crime comes from the prevention Research Center in Atherton

822
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
Undocumented immigrants

823
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,936
146 percent more likely to be convicted of crime

824
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:46,240
Then the control subsets there was used

825
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:54,175
Throw the data out here because it relies on arrest numbers for 1985

826
00:41:54,431 --> 00:42:00,575
2017 in Arizona know that Joe Arpaio was busy

827
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,671
Police Department in recent memory in Arizona's most populous city

828
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:08,511
I'm not sure how much that skews the data but I'm sure it does

829
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
I'm sure it at least

830
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,399
Is a factor in it so I'm going to go ahead and say I don't accept that study

831
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:19,775
Well I mean if they just arrested for all the crimes he committed then that

832
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:26,175
30 would be reversed by a million percent

833
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:31,295
Committed immigrants had in Arizona if you just arrested Joe Arpaio

834
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
Did a crime it would Reverse by

835
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Margin of 221

836
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Perhaps

837
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:42,047
All this is just to say that claiming that immigrants have double the crime rate in the United States is an expression of white supremacy

838
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
It's a talking point

839
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,167
Of the people out there who seek to spread fear of Shifting demographics

840
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,751
And faceless paranoia about white genocide

841
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
Italics

842
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,335
What's going on

843
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:55,871
Anyway

844
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,943
It should come as no surprise especially based on

845
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
Start

846
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:07,391
Always lying about immigrants

847
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
It should surprise

848
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Nobody

849
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
Immediately decide

850
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
Start season 2 of Caravan paranoid

851
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,655
Big Caravan is on its way

852
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,287
Decision

853
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:30,431
Hundreds of Honduras

854
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,319
Look up the Apple photos and those countries hits.

855
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Just like they said

856
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
Hundred

857
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,839
Always a close shot of a woman

858
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,119
Weather child

859
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,495
Camera

860
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,847
And it's 10,000 20,000 30,000 40,000 50,000

861
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
Oun fun

862
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,711
Childish works

863
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,783
That's how the globalist get this job done

864
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,831
Another tree welfare

865
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
Everything else up here

866
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
So

867
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,583
That's that's that's that's

868
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:28,031
Cool you're a f****** piece of s*** feel the need to respond to that that's just

869
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:33,151
That's the that yeah

870
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Surprises

871
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,711
More than anything else

872
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
Is that he didn't

873
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,575
I don't get why it's wrong

874
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,855
You say you're a

875
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,255
It's wrong just don't know he does a little bit but he's just talkin about the Nationalist

876
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,119
You deflect that sorta stuff is easier for him to vent

877
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:58,239
Like fully own that space

878
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,799
Coach Dave did

879
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
But Alex is being assertive

880
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,199
Nationalist is just

881
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
White

882
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:10,527
And nationalized not a compound

883
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,831
Noun like with Coach Dave

884
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,159
Oh man you might

885
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,695
With Alex

886
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,999
You f*** your deflector

887
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:20,767
You f***

888
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,095
The Caravans coming back

889
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,447
Caravans it's bigger than ever

890
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,519

Madagascar

903
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,375
With the antenna Revo

904
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:02,751
Fun

905
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,943
Yeah not that I can't get on the trade routes I've had

906
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,063
Between there's news that this is happening

907
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
And that is what the leftist

908
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:23,743
Mule

909
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:34,751
Machete funded by the

910
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,055
Shooting Hispanic pregnant women

911
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,663
Watch all that

912
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:49,855
Believe it and then they that go to

913
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
That makes no sense

914
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,439
Watch machete

915
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,559
Directed by Robert Rodriguez

916
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
That's cool man

917
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,639
I told you

918
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
A second ago that we didn't

919
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455
The Robert Rodriguez and what do you know

920
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,527

Super Why

922
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,303
I took care of all that

923
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
We are great in that sin

924
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,103
Robert Rodriguez

925
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,895
Do you know do you know what's really

926
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,711
He does not say

927
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
Danny Trejo

928
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
No

929
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Fuckingawesome

930
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,135
Danny Trejo is

931
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
The coolest I mean after all of his

932
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
But he's a f****** cool

933
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:03,583
Did you know that he owns a f****** Donuts

934
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,631
I didn't know that

935
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Play music

936
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,215
It's amazing when I was in LA he may

937
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:11,519
Incredible

938
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Is great

939
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Danny Trejo

940
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
Coupon out of donuts

941
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,343
Adult

942
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,903
Feel good you could have just said a new sentence

943
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,207
Complaints about Robert Rodger

944
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,935
Taking issue with Robert Rodriguez

945
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:44,543
That being in his list of complaints it's strange

946
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Disinfect

947
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
You brought up the

948
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,639
He was raised by white

949
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
People suggested

950
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
You think he's a race traitor or that he owes them

951
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,927
To be one of us

952
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
We will

953
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,327
Manifesting a lot of these sort of

954
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,887
Text Ernest ideas whether it's insulting

955
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,679
Robert Rodriguez

956
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,703
Complaining

957
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Sister working

958
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,055
These drug cartels

959
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,615
Spouting this b*******

960
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,943
Things about that immigrants

961
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,087
He gets a little bit of that out of his system

962
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,559
I didn't say that

963
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,935
Mark

964
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,495
It kinda is though we shouldn't be proud of

965
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:52,127
Yep kind of sugar group

966
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,663
They are alive

967
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:58,271
They remove the words are out of the quote

968
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,159
One word or two words

969
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,767
White supremacist

970
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,839
Surrounded

971
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,263
That is pure evil

972
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,943
Want to

973
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,247
Purchasing

974
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
Love The Virtue signaling today

975
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,111
Even voted

976
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,671
Everybody to say Steve

977
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Save that shitt

978
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
House of Representatives

979
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
Representative

980
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,071
Garbage

981
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
Steve King was like

982
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,631
Yeah I agree with you

983
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:52,287
We could definitely tell me not to say that s*** in his speech of around that he met

984
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,823
And his response

985
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,895
Look let's just be clear about this the quote in the New York Times

986
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,199
Wasn't just one or two words in quotes

987
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
And then just

988
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,295
Creating a quote around it

989
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
And even Steve King admits to that you're in a second

990
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,415
Alex's make it back s*** up

991
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:13,279
So steep King up to the podium on the house floor and wasn't racist

992
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,143
But him saying these things that the New York Times

993
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
Disclaimer

994
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
His case in general is very

995
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Convincing

996
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,847
So I'm going to tell you that the words are likely what I said but I want to

997
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:31,455
But I want to read it to you the way I believe I said it

998
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,991
And that's where

999
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,087
White supremacist Western Civilization

1000
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
How did that language become offensive

1001
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
First of all

1002
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:41,695
He keeps saying

1003
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
This is what I believe I said

1004
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,047
What is track record on these things it's pretty shity

1005
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:51,167
But he's not offering anything anyways any more convincing than what the New York Times

1006
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,799
Just adding western civilization in the middle of the quote in no way makes it better

1007
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,663
These feel saying exactly the same thing as the original quote

1008
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:08,319
He's just now making it clear that he believes Western Civilization

1009
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:13,951
Directions to making it worse

1010
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:18,047
In the era of shity apologies this one is particularly Wild

1011
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,887
Even says quote it's 13 words ironically that caused this

1012
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,935
If you want

1013
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
Why is 13 words a run

1014
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,871
In what sense is 13 words and ironic number unless it's because

1015
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:36,735
The topic at hand was white supremacy and that's just the 14th

1016
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,271
In his apology

1017
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
On the house floor

1018
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,343
He's signaling to whites

1019
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,111
Supremacist

1020
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,951
Exactly what he said and he isn't sorry about it at all

1021
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,487
I think everybody would like

1022
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
White

1023
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Coding a lot more

1024
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,351
Thousand words

1025
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
Instead of the four

1026
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
Show me 12 though

1027
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
The Bakersfield

1028
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,263
I know but

1029
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,615
Do you need to make a Baker's like a

1030
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:10,271
Super ambitious Baker, 14th

1031
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:12,319
Keywords for beatitude

1032
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,647
I don't want to

1033
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,463
Ourselves is sort of

1034
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,767
Editors for haggai

1035
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,839
Supremacist

1036
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
Supremacist

1037
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,935
But I love

1038
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,983
Really well well written

1039
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,031
More than

1040
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
Psychic

1041
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,175
To put a fine button on it that even in his apology

1042
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,991
She's making clear the what he saying

1043
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Be more clear

1044
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,111
Defend

1045
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
Steve Vai kind of using wipes

1046
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Defend him

1047
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:50,719
Weird

1048
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,511
Alchemy

1049
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,279
What's the score

1050
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,607
White supremacy

1051
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
Which they don't

1052
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:16,575
White supremacy 2

1053
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
Wichita

1054
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,023
See how he does

1055
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:26,815
The balcony

1056
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,655
They take the words

1057
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
And you go

1058
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,543
See what they did

1059
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,151
Tricky very very sneaky these New York Times

1060
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,087
I don't know I don't know what what else to say about that other

1061
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
That's that

1062
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,159
That's very dumb

1063
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:59,071
I feel like you got if you're going to bring up Alchemy

1064
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:04,191
Ogden 6 Fullmetal Alchemist

1065
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,287
Which is weird

1066
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:13,663
If we're in 2018 you better believe Alex is going to complain about the Chinese

1067
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,783
Alex finally gets around

1068
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
Complaining about something

1069
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,439
Because the Chinese are totally ethnocentric

1070
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,487
Completely maximum

1071
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:37,471
And they know that their funding for Hollywood

1072
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,991
Weathers race war in America in division

1073
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:55,391
Execute you for that

1074
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:03,327
It's on your record it's not on like the real real

1075
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:09,727
It's not like real it's on your six of the eight movie houses are not trying to force everyone

1076
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,287
Which one which one

1077
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:17,407
I mean we went over this like a year-and-a-half ago when you started this.

1078
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,943
Names I wouldn't know

1079
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Do they own you

1080
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
Dan is Disney

1081
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,391
Still American

1082
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,719
22 the new it

1083
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,023
Incase

1084
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:39,935
You know one of the things that I'm really trying to do is highlight how Alex Jones

1085
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,471
Really him defending himself

1086
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,519
Because we are the same

1087
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,359
They're very similar in terms of what they believe what they stand for

1088
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,383
In the same way

1089
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Steve King

1090
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,967
Existed in the world of politics to be the guy

1091
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:58,623
Look less extreme next to Alex Jones in the world of media existed in the exact same capacity

1092
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:05,023
Actually does and Compares himself to seek it

1093
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,983
A good decent Christian man very wholesome I watch this because many times I've read is right and just

1094
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,263
Mine just good

1095
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,543
Wholesome Americana

1096
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:31,391
Got to love it

1097
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
What happened

1098
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
I mean like

1099
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,983
If you look at this he probably met a little further back in the third act but we know

1100
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,335
You don't need to like

1101
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:57,247
This is where it becomes almost absurd that we're doing the show

1102
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
I lost

1103
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:05,695
I think he's a great man he's just like me I'm good wholesome

1104
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:13,119
Alright

1105
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:18,239
Rope and the amount necessary to hang yourself but did you give yourself the correct amount

1106
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:25,407
It's wild to me that I even try to lay things out like information

1107
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,687
It like that

1108
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
Do a 5-minute episode radio playlist

1109
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:34,623
Out of the same dues this but knowledge fight

1110
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,207
Martin Luther King Junior has a street named after

1111
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,303
Not just 1 hour.

1112
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,631
Classic

1113
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,191
White supremacist white nationalist

1114
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
Pinpoint

1115
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,007
No

1116
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:55,615
So bad everyone wouldn't be trying to get into white Christian

1117
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,967
That's very basic white nationalist

1118
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:06,623
The idea of like which kind of just

1119
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,647
2

1120
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:12,511
Try to rewrite and undo all the history of how did those countries get

1121
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,351
There's that but even after we deal like

1122
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,167
Just on an economic monetary level

1123
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,727
Before we talk about that

1124
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,799
You have to unpack his language and he's saying White

1125
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Christian Nation

1126
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,895
So it's just taking his red and assume for Alec

1127
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,175
What's that America is

1128
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
Nation

1129
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
Which is

1130
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,271
Kind of again

1131
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
A black

1132
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,575
People didn't want to be here so bad

1133
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,367
Why did they get on those boats

1134
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Do it huh

1135
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,999
Come here

1136
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,607
Thrown off those boats

1137
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
Whenever I

1138
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
In a legal slave trade

1139
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Miserably

1140
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,223
Nephew flash forward to the modern day

1141
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,575
Exploding of the Decades

1142
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,111
The Decades of generations

1143
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
The affluenza

1144
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,463
From the amount of infrastructure

1145
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,047
The relative security to the rest of the world the stability

1146
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
That's the thing is

1147
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,167
Built on the backs of these other countries that we

1148
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
Pillaged

1149
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Exploited

1150
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Over the years

1151
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,287
So dis ideas

1152
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,335
If we're so bad why do people want to come here

1153
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,359
Because of

1154
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,663
The things that we've been able to afford

1155
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
Based on

1156
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
Adventurism

1157
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,759
We're so bad

1158
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
Nation

1159
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,671
I want to come here

1160
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:48,255
Why is it that when we strip behind all of South

1161
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Forgot

1162
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,071
Destroyed

1163
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:58,751
They would then want to come to where the resource

1164
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,359
And this is demonstrative of why this is

1165
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,943
Alex

1166
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,223
So flippantly is just like

1167
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
Come on man you got it yet to try better

1168
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
And have you heard

1169
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
The Africa

1170
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
Want to tape

1171
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,391
Landowner

1172
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Watch

1173
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Yeah

1174
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,767
That's a different episode of Alex's show but yeah

1175
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
So you know

1176
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
Here he just had some more

1177
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
Wax yet

1178
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,519
What was no the West has a guilt christianese us it's good to keep us from killing each other

1179
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
Used against us

1180
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:40,735
Gilt Gilt turned into foaming at the mouth

1181
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,015
Racist

1182
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,551
Against white people

1183
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,343
What is a become the majority

1184
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
Chicken

1185
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,303
Why people are being taught them

1186
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
Be guilty and stand

1187
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,143
Into a frenzy

1188
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,191
Justice they're taking power

1189
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
Gross

1190
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Pretty grab

1191
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,823
Yeah I mean

1192
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,895
No there's not much do you need to unpack there

1193
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
It's just an expression of the

1194
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,503
These really messed-up racial ideas that

1195
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Expresses

1196
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,295
Yeah

1197
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,575
Feel the need to say anything

1198
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,671
If you listen to that clip and you disagree with what you already know I think

1199
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
We're done

1200
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,399
You can you can stop

1201
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
You can stop listening now. Already

1202
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
Present

1203
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,359
You don't you don't get

1204
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
Through an episode

1205
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
Complain about the Chinese

1206
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,271
You don't get through an episode without hearing praise

1207
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,807
For someone else

1208
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:52,415
Going to the highest level of Martial law under dictatorship

1209
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,023
I'm at the world

1210
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
As even more authentic

1211
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
Text our yes

1212
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:10,591
He doesn't

1213
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,967
I just like George Washington TV was a colonel and all the rest of it

1214
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:21,599
The Real McCoy mean I don't disagree with most of the things he's saying except I think they're bad

1215
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:23,647
You know like he's The Real McCoy yes

1216
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:28,767
Of power and

1217
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,303
Shoring up his power

1218
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:33,375
He's more well-spoken than Trump you bet you

1219
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:37,727
Almost everybody

1220
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
Direct

1221
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
Comparison would be when

1222
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
You can grab them by the p****

1223
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
And I moved

1224
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,175
He would prefer to hear

1225
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
Bolsonaro

1226
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,807
Because you're not attract

1227
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
Rape you I guess that's what he wish Trump would have said he wish

1228
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
No

1229
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,023
Brightright

1230
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,047
Because they weren't

1231
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
Attractive enough

1232
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,607
I guess it's

1233
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:09,215
I guess it's kind of debatable which is more better spoken

1234
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:18,175
We already went over this last week about the idea that Alex is really showing his cards about really loving authoritarian

1235
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:21,247
Dictator types

1236
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,271
The coverage

1237
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
Bolsonaro

1238
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
It's it's

1239
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,367
F***** up bud

1240
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Not surprised

1241
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,671
Not surprised

1242
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:31,743
No that wasn't coming out

1243
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,023
Anyways

1244
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,815
In terms of his like

1245
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,911
This episode is Aurelio for document of his wife

1246
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
Supremacist

1247
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,215
Which surprise

1248
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,567
The authoritarian dictator bootlegging

1249
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
10 diabetes

1250
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895
Came out really to the Forefront

1251
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
And surprising at all

1252
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
The present day

1253
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
Becoming

1254
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,599
He's always pretended not to be pretending like it's not

1255
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Against every

1256
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
Pretends to be

1257
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
Bucked up

1258
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
That

1259
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Look this is

1260
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,679
Is all white

1261
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
But it is

1262
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
Also

1263
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Misogyny

1264
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,871
All he is choosing

1265
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,175
Every every person

1266
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,455
Who ha

1267
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
A f******

1268
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
Credibly

1269
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
And

1270
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:32,159
Incredible

1271
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:34,463
And proven to have committed

1272
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,231
Text Melissa

1273
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:40,351
Patterns of behavior sort of run together a little bit

1274
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,727
I think that all of that

1275
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,495
Is

1276
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,847
It's always hard to tell exactly what piece of his identities more defensive about

1277
01:05:55,455 --> 01:06:00,063
When over Monday when you complaining about Gillette

1278
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,855
I think that we would have much more of a

1279
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,135
Speak based on his

1280
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:08,511
Like horrible Chauvin if nonsense

1281
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
His whiteness

1282
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,839
Descendants

1283
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
Is more prevalent in

1284
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:15,423
The conversation

1285
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:17,215
Just just just

1286
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,263
Really hammered home

1287
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,031
Men

1288
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
That he thinks

1289
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
Is that is that is

1290
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Nothing that is

1291
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,919
Is part of that whiteness

1292
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
Soupremacy is

1293
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,271
Absolutely

1294
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,551
Steve King also thinks

1295
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,319
Women should

1296
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,087
To be subject

1297
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,647
Absolutely Alex

1298
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Women are sexy

1299
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
Class C

1300
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Abs

1301
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,375
These guys are going home

1302
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:49,215
Their Call to Arms or whatever is that they believe that

1303
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,263
They won't apologize for

1304
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,847
They're chauvinism the living in the world that men created

1305
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
So yeah

1306
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,199
That's part and parcel of all of the

1307
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:03,295
These these dudes absolutely look at

1308
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Alex's

1309
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
Argument about

1310
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
Immigration

1311
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
And that sort of thing

1312
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,255
Seems to have

1313
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
You know

1314
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,119
There is the idea that a Sovereign Nation can

1315
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
Can just not let people in

1316
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,495
Big piece of

1317
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,567
He doesn't want open borders

1318
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,359
No you do not come in

1319
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
Unfortunately because

1320
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
He's a s*******

1321
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
The undercut

1322
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
Entire argument

1323
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,759
Because he wants

1324
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
To defend Michael Savage

1325
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,463
Preachers preaching

1326
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:48,863
Savage

1327
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
You can go

1328
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,455
Yeah where are your papers exactly

1329
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:11,647
Destination post

1330
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,927
So if I understand correctly

1331
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:13,951
His

1332
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Nations

1333
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,767
Should have sovereign

1334
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,559
And they should be able to

1335
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,583
Enforce their borders

1336
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,399
Which is why it's okay for America

1337
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,679
To keep out

1338
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,215
Whatever immigrants

1339
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,495
If we decide our bad

1340
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
But

1341
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,847
Other Nation

1342
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,687
Should not be allowed to exercise their sovereignty

1343
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,527
By keeping out people

1344
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,319
White people

1345
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
I think we got that

1346
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,903
Ha

1347
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
So some Nation

1348
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,231
Maybe

1349
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,047
One in particular

1350
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:52,863
If you will

1351
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
Should be allowed

1352
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
Non-white

1353
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,031
God

1354
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,335
Not know how dumb

1355
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,919
I don't know I think he just knows that

1356
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
The audience

1357
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:12,831
Prone to pick up on those

1358
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
Stove

1359
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,647
Stupid

1360
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,415
Lakeview dump

1361
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,695
Have to say like

1362
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,743
Good Sarah sovereignty

1363
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,279
So we're not allowed to visit

1364
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,095
Literally

1365
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,143
Seems like

1366
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,727
They set their own immigration laws and

1367
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,543
Fire right by your principles

1368
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,847
You need to support that

1369
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,383
It's just stupid

1370
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,407
Who cares

1371
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:40,735
This is an interview with the guy who

1372
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,271
May or may not have stopped

1373
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,319
Is running Breitbart

1374
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Europe

1375
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,391
I really care he's has a bunch of stupid nonsense

1376
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:49,951
Interview Alex

1377
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
Long time

1378
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,263
Just good like mine though

1379
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:06,591
This guy agrees with everything I'm saying

1380
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,199
This interview was

1381
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
In no way was

1382
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,551
Changing it all

1383
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Have to

1384
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
Even say

1385
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
Dank nope

1386
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Just a random

1387
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,695
I'm shittin that guy wouldn't

1388
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:26,303
I went along with it and felt really good

1389
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,887
Now we had a great agreement Fest and it really nailed at home

1390
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,239
Bummer

1391
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
There

1392
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,431
Almost

1393
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
It's like

1394
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
We've we've dealt with

1395
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
Over the years

1396
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Stroop

1397
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,087
Soma

1398
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,719
It is it is incredibly stupid

1399
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,327
There's very little coherence on his show anymore like

1400
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,863
Listening

1401
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,143
Incredibly frustrating

1402
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Because

1403
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,983
You can always get a sense that he doesn't want to do it

1404
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,055
Anymore the feeling of that

1405
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Camp Layman

1406
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,871
But now I agree with

1407
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
I don't want him

1408
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:18,527
A lot of

1409
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,647
White supremacist apology

1410
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
And the trend has been in

1411
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,719
In the past

1412
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,815
More of that earlier with

1413
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,607
Praising bolsonaro

1414
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:35,167
If you like you can't make it more clear

1415
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Lowe's

1416
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
Dictator

1417
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,519
We are watching

1418
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:45,919
Rebellions against the globalist very very

1419
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,991
Very closely in

1420
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,343
Brazilian

1421
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,903
Emerald Isle

1422
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:02,047
Brazilian out of kingdom here in Australia they are quietly

1423
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
The Irishman

1424
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:11,007
Watch that with a very very please die

1425
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
You know

1426
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,343
You clearly said

1427
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:27,903
Which side of that battle you're on

1428
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,951
That that

1429
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
Literally made in

1430
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:34,303
You literally made an evil laugh

1431
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,071
In regards

1432
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
To a large group

1433
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,911
Engaging in a battle

1434
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,471
Everyone who is non-white

1435
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,775
Yeah it was like really

1436
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,055
Dangerous

1437
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Restriction

1438
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
Policies

1439
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:53,759
Emerald Isle

1440
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:58,623
I don't know what I think that was

1441
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Yeah

1442
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:03,487
I think he just was really grasping for words

1443
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:04,767
I think you forgot

1444
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:11,167
I forgot the countries clearly

1445
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,775
I got to come up with a noun or a pronoun this is weird

1446
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,823
So

1447
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:22,175
After this Alex has an interview with this guy Dan lineman who runs

1448
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,503
Europe wards.com

1449
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
Just a little bit on the nose if we if we

1450
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,999
One of our characters

1451
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,815
Dan Lyman Lyman

1452
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:43,679
Yeah a little bit Yeah Yeah

1453
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,983
Give us that was a great novel

1454
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
But that characters

1455
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,079
What are you guys doing

1456
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383
Avenue 2nd

1457
01:13:54,175 --> 01:14:00,319
Alex started newswars and Europe Wars because he had a Infowars

1458
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,111
You know maybe

1459
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,135
People work trucks

1460
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
So much

1461
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:09,023
So you keep it on brand with newswars in Europe Wars maybe people who see the links

1462
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,423
Know that it's a war

1463
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,447
Infowars

1464
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,215
Lakes

1465
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
It's not important

1466
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:26,175
But they do end up talking about her

1467
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,991
I talked about this fast food buffet

1468
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,551
But he gave Clemson football team

1469
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,623
We're not going to talk about that

1470
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,671
But it is

1471
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,719
It's only it's only brought up as a

1472
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,487
Transition

1473
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,535
About why Trump

1474
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,559
Eat so much fast food

1475
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
Little

1476
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,631
Defensive about it

1477
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:47,167
Guys

1478
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
We get it

1479
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
You like

1480
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,007
Young love the president

1481
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
We don't need

1482
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,823
You could not

1483
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,919
You could just we could all just not give a s*** about what he eats very

1484
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:05,855
I don't I don't know if they do

1485
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,695
They're only bring it up because they want to create this idea

1486
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,767
Trump is under like an intense amount of

1487
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,351
And so they rationalized

1488
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
Is so he doesn't get

1489
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,167
Get poisoned by the globalist

1490
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
Which is interesting Eminem

1491
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:25,567
I leave

1492
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,847
Giving us a revelation

1493
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
His own life

1494
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,895
Visa V poison

1495
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:36,063
It has been said that Trump has a lot of fast-food especially now at this point because of the the low-risk

1496
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,159
I'm having his food contaminated which you know I don't think any of us can really

1497
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:52,447
Yes I mean

1498
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,543
Poison

1499
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:03,199
And I'm so

1500
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:10,367
Date

1501
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,927
President

1502
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
No certainly not

1503
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Certainly.

1504
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:18,559
Arsenic

1505
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Larger question

1506
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
Why isn't

1507
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:29,055
I don't know maybe some people are

1508
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,103
You never hear about

1509
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,407
Attempt

1510
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,735
Threat against Obama when he was in office

1511
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,599
A good strategy

1512
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Not

1513
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Make a lot of those

1514
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:43,903
Publix

1515
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
So I think there's probably

1516
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,487
Maybe there are some sort

1517
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Taste like

1518
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:53,887
Again a medieval

1519
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,655
Prior to

1520
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:57,215
There already is that in place in the White House

1521
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:04,383
Already

1522
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,407
Getaround

1523
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,479
But there's already there's already protocol in place

1524
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,807
50s trying to rationalize away while you eat a ton of fast food

1525
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,367

Tyrants

1543
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
Love and authoritarianism

1544
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
Just a little bit

1545
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,007
Paul Joseph Watson

1546
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,383
We're working at this clip and I don't understand how this isn't Alex G

1547

I don't like

1552
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,511

Relegated

1555
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
It's just that

1556
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:40,383
Play sad and pathetic and I wish I could get more worked up about it because the things

1557
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,919

01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,551
Apologizing for someone

1561
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
And making

1562
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:51,391

1570
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,543
Deactivate isn't really that in

1571
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,079

1572
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,639
It's just like flap dipster seen that coming

1573
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943

1575
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:18,783
So important

1576
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,087
The point it out because

1577
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,279
Teagan

1578
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,071

1579
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095

Dismiss

1583
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,799
Yeah of course that's

1584
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,639
To maintain

1585
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:48,991
He said he's shifted over to the window of interesting

1586
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,039
That's not good

1587
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,087
The fact that

1588
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
Goddamn

1589
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879

1592
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:07,935

The Twitter outrageous you where it's like yesterday and then the next day

1596
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,504
It's

1597
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,064
It's a battle to see things through fresh eyes

1598
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,600
See the same thing a new

1599
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,392
Yeah whenever you see it

1600
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:31,232
The present

1601
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,000
With that

1602
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:32,768
But

1603
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,048
Hey it's important

1604
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864

Take a look at it

1606
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:42,240
Alex is living up to exactly all of the things that we would expect

1607
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,104
Well it would be scarier actually I got to see growth

1608
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:51,456
Cuz then I'll know I don't know what would that would pretend

1609
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016

First time you've heard Alex
