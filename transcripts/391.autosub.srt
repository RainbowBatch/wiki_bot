1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge like I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
Everybody

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Allie

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
Alex Jones

7
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
What was the last

8
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Live

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,424
TV event

10
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,776
Something that you felt like I got to watch this

11
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,432
Live impeachment hearings on like not I don't have a TV to watch it on a S3 considerate

12
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
Is that

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
I don't know

14
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:32,160
But I ain't going to cuz you don't watch sports not really never do that live

15
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Though

16
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,256
I meant something more like what you wanted to say

17
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,840
Some people are like it's Monday I got to watch the f******

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
Something like wrestling pay-per-views in the past

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:50,336
Is a lot of listeners may assume based on

20
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
Knowing things about it

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,384
But

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
This weekend's the Royal Rumble I'm excited about

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
I can never not get excited about a Royal Rumble

24
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,488
You know trouble is what you you live and die for

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
It's great

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,656
You got 30 dudes that end up having to be fighting with each other again thrown over the top rope before this thing can a

27
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:19,008
The whole thing and the way it's structured actually I should say now there's also a women's Rumble

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,824
Both lose 30 women also in a in a match

29
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,128
The way the matching structured is

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,736
The first person comes out and then the second person comes out

31
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,576
Supposedly two minutes later someone else

32
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
Although that time frame is

33
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Is very variable

34
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
Random

35
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
But the excitement of the

36
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,720
The countdown is like

37
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,488
5

38
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
You don't know who's coming out alright music hits

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,584
And they just give you that at

40
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Like that to dopamine Rush

41
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
30 *

42
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
It's very exciting

43
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,520
New people from the past that come back on

44
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,616
Oh God I watched a few Rebels there was a couple of

45
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Comedian friends

46
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Used to do a like a fantasy football game with it and trying to guess like surprise entry

47
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah yeah everybody

48
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Money put on it is fantastic

49
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,416
Is Greg Lovett

50
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,976
Even if take even the wrestling

51
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,000
Respect out of it just

52
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,536
Random people showing up

53
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,560
You somewhere

54
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,168
It'll procession

55
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
Really taking up a noon

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
Alright

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
One ring

58
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:23,776
But

59
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,056
2 rings

60
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,920
In the back so there's a ring there's one whole thing and then only one ring divided

61
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
It sounds like two rings

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Smash together one wall

63
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,392
On either side there's the women's Royal Rumble and then the men's Royal Rumble

64
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,720
Stack of every staggering every minute somebody news coming out

65
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
And you can

66
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
Throw a woman or a man over those Central Buckle men's or women's Royal Rumble WWE

67
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
He is very much

68
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
Not super into inter-gender wrestling

69
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,312
At this point

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Of men hitting women are super into that they sell a lot

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,992
Lot of toys

72
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
Sprayer

73
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
I think their sponsors are not

74
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
Not interested in them

75
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
What about drawing women out of a

76
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,536
Call me if it's other women doing other women wrestlers

77
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,303
Specs

78
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,887
This weekend so that'll be the next time I probably watched

79
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
Something live Lovett

80
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
I know it is because I don't know too much about live TV entertainment but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

81
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
That's not appointment

82
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:39,551
I'm so Jordan we're back today cuz we have a little bit of that minisode on when

83
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,647
Wednesday wanted to have a full-on normal app we're actually have to look into things

84
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,743
We had a mini set the length of other pot

85
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,071
Podcast Regular Show

86
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Most of it was just sort of Alex's

87
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Add

88
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Is weird ad

89
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
There's not really anything to look into that I have

90
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
There's no way I can find a database of his stock

91
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
It is Warehouse

92
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,919
That's probably true that we're out of work for it

93
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:10,527
January 22nd

94
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
2020

95
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
I'm Dan this

96
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Alright alright

97
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
2020

98
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Do January 22 2020

99
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
Yep

100
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,935
I think this is an interesting things with one of the things that we can do is really keeping us in the present day is the fact that the Trump impeachment is

101
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Beginning

102
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
There's these flare-ups that keep happening like Alex

103
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,591
Declaring a Civil War was going to break out on Monday

104
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
So there's beat these are the things with the impeachment hearing

105
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,711
Then the trial is really what

106
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
I would figure

107
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Is going is the most

108
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Compelling most

109
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,575
Thing thing

110
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,343
Alex

111
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,879
Should have an angle on it

112
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
So that's what I was mostly looking for here

113
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,255
In this episode and I didn't really get it

114
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
Punjab not surprising my guess

115
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,583
We're talking all about

116
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
Beezus

117
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
This phone no bees on this phone does not come up

118
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,823
I know but we have another overarching

119
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
Narrative that is

120
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Awesomely stupid

121
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
And we'll get to that here and Mama

00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735

But anyway you're closer if it's a real name

148
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,551
Sparks I apologize for apologize

00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,831

00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:12,031
Thank you know Jordan we have an out-of-context drop to get to that is very off-color and very not a family

164
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,055
Text drops

165
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Rex no

166
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
But before we get to that I want to talk about this

167
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Don't forget remember

168
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Michelle I think the audience

169
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Might enjoy this

170
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
So I

171
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,391
I have some trouble sleeping cuz of noise in this house speaker

172
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,511
In order to play like always greater volume

173
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,047
Can on my phone

174
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
The phone speaker isn't it it doesn't work

175
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
It does work a bit better but

176
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
I downloaded an app

177
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
That has a bunch of different sounds

178
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
And you can play them

179
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,359
Together or you can make your own blend of sound

180
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:50,431
Amazon employee listening to you

181
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,831
Pacifica got one that has no internet capability

182
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
No I got it has all these these noises

183
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
That's cool

184
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
I think there's some promise

185
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,791
In terms of being able to block out the troubling noises

186
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,607
So that's good that is a plus

187
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:09,887
However

188
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,935
There's also one option where you can get the

189
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
The sound of a cat

190
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
No

191
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,311
It's just a cat going

192
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
I started to think about it really bummed me out cuz I who would want

193
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
Someone who's cat reason

194
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
We died

195
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,063
I was thinking somebody who is trying to drive another person in

196
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,855
Insane

197
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,207
There's a cat in there wall it's either prank like that or someone who's

198
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,071
Grieving the loss of a pet wants the comfort of the illusion of that pet still being there

199
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
Cuz otherwise it's very distracting

200
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
And that is a bummer

201
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
That is a bummer

202
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
What focus group was that

203
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
Idea flood at this very second

204
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Could you put a cat sound on they feel like that

205
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,199
Like a person who would want that

206
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,247
I'm going to suit the sounds like

207
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,783
Celine

208
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
I got my cat

209
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
Immediately

210
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
I went crazy in a way that I've never seen before I started stalking around the house like trying to hunt

211
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
For this other cat is in the house okay

212
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,191
So I started using that the f*** with her

213
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,287
Wheeling third possibility

214
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
It was like

215
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,663
I never seen her go into like real hunt mode before it was it was fascinating

216
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,455
Anyway that is the saline up

217
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Gotcha now let's go

218
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Get to this out of color

219
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,855
Rust color out of context drop that is not

220
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
This is not a family drop

221
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
But you know why

222
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
He had a good side job

223
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,071
Okay

224
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,751
If you're out there if your dad

225
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,567
You look down at your son and you like

226
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Wow

227
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,663
Even though you're a full-grown adult misses a weird thing to be doing

228
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
I know why

229
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
Little bit that's the chemical that Alex has based his the tap water is a freaking

230
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
Can gay bomb ran out of time the frogs gay stuff on development

231
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
To talk about

232
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
Before we get to that that'll be a little bit later

233
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
Alex said some other business

234
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
Take care of it out of the first

235
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,727
He starts the show doodle

236
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,847
Talking about how great it was that he took over the women's March in DC

237
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,199
They took over the Virginia rally

238
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Every report

239
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
And the security people had just done a 100-percent job

240
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
Everything fell into place

241
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:48,095
Everything we did was wildly successful and game-changing and national news

242
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
Taking over deep state

243
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,727
Narratives that gun owners were going to cause a giant murderous Bloodbath

244
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,591
Turned it around on them educated the folks by the governor was trying to cause a false flag

245
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Accounting for people John's

246
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,503
Same thing I'm with the women's March how it's run by Soros how it's been to divide the family we totally took

247
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
And not the majority of the car

248
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Highbridge

249
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
Billion buxoro spent on that. Mitch

250
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
We took it

251
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Boom boom

252
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Soros admits it

253
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
This is George Bush putting up a mission

254
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Accomplished

255
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,119
You didn't do a goddamn thing

256
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
You're an

257
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
I think this offers us a really interesting

258
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Interesting window in

259
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,007
Into seeing how Alex

260
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:27,775
Excuse the world

261
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,567
Like in his mind globalist

262
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,383
You're saying that all gun owners are evil and what he did was

263
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
Hijacked that narrative and show the world that isn't

264
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
True

265
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,807
But in reality no one really was saying the gun owners are all evil they were saying

266
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,855
But The Sensational way that's certain

267
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
Extreme is good weirdos were building up that rally in Virginia

268
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Was having the effect of attract

269
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Like unstable and very dangerous people

270
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
And that could be a recipe for trouble

271
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
The thing though

272
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:57,983
Is that Alex isn't really responsible for demonstrating that the globalist positions are wrong

273
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,775
Because he was responding to a strong

274
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,431
However he was partially responsible for The Sensational coverage of the rally and how is going to be the side of a globalist false Flags

275
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Is the kickoff a new race

276
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
Slash Civil War

277
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
He was part of creating that app

278
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,087
Atmosphere where extremists like the members of the base

279
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,879
Felt the rally was prime target

280
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,183
To create an event that would Advance their acceleration

281
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Mister genda

282
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
Alex is part of the problem in the real world

283
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
In his head

284
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
He's created an imaginary problem

285
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Witchy is the solution

286
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
This is how the rhetoric work

287
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
He's a f****** loser

288
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Well yes

289
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,103
But I don't say that cuz it kind of marginalizes people who

290
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
No that's

291
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
I think what's interesting about the rally is

292
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,295
Statistics and everything that they put up

293
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,879
It makes you realize that responsible gun owners are by and large

294
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,903
Very responsible

295
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:53,279
Liking a what was it like 80% of gun owners supported every single one of the

296
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
Gun control measures passed

297
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,863
And the only problem are these

298
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:01,215
Plugging thousand Gunn weirdos who are absolutely out there looking

299
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:01,983
Infor

300
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:02,751
Danger

301
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
I do I don't think most

302
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
People are particularly that

303
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Concerned

304
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
About

305
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Only being able to buy one-gun-a-month

306
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
Doesn't seem like it I don't know but it's the rhetoric that surrounds it that involves like okay yeah they want you to

307
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,879
You're only be able to buy one-gun-a-month

308
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Unless

309
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
You have the concealed carry permit cuz it

310
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,839
Concealed carry permit is the way they can track you to come and take your gun registration is

311
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
God wear world

312
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,751
Yeah that's the way you make it so there's never any progress

313
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
So the issue that Alex has is it this is a lot of victory

314
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,807
How you going to make people scared because all these Victory time to roll out

315
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
Fear

316
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
Ball is the stock market

317
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,255
The other big car ball is this Coronavirus

318
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
That did you know there it is

319
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
Just

320
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
A month

321
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,399
Days ago

322
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Got

323
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Certified with a vaccine

324
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:12,639
And blow and behold the exact same virus pops up

325
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,223
Start spreading

326
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:23,135
That's just amazing I wasn't insinuating voice of his again like he did with the

327
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,207
Caller who's talking about the the shooting hoax

328
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,255
Around the time of the Virginia Bells

329
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,535
This is a pathetic man

330
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Pick a day

331
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
Weird weird a bit of an interesting situation

332
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
Concurrently as a relates to what's being called the Wuhan

333
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
Coronavirus

334
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,799
This novel strain of coronavirus just come out of China

335
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,615
At the point where recording us a lot of the basics regarding

336
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,455
The spread in scope of the virus are not entirely clear but it's definitely some

337
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
The merits attention in to be taken serious

338
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:54,879
Most of the people who come down with the virus or believed to have caught it when they were in Wuhan

339
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
Hey I travel Hub in China

340
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:00,767
We thought they were exposed to fish and seafood market

341
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
The Danimals

342
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
At this stage

343
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:09,983
It doesn't seem sorry it does seem like there has been some human-to-human transmission of the virus

344
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:13,567
But passing it along still would require transmission of bodily fluids

345
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,615
So according to available information

346
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:21,247
It's not like something where we need an extreme Panic surrounding this like it's an Airborne

347
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,807
Everyone's going to get it right

348
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,855
No no plague masks just yet

349
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
Perhaps not

350
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,279
I'd really like to say more about this but honestly according to the information I can find from the CDC and other official sources

351
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,375
We most likely won't know the extent of this outbreak for a little while at least

352
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,167
It's being said that

353
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:44,287
To be a serious concern among the elderly babies and people with compromised immune systems but

354
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
It seems like for most people

355
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,895
You might just end up even if you get it with a bad cold

356
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
Yeah yeah so I assume that

357
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,855
The Chinese are trying to slightly lower our productivity I don't know if Alex is the Chinese on this one

358
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,791
Ambiguity and the uncertainty that surrounded the situation right now is

359
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
It should lead people to approach it with

360
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,911
Some caution with their reporting

361
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,495
And then forward

362
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
They Come Out Swinging with

363
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,055
Sensationalism in

364
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:22,175
Dearborn the likes of which I haven't seen since the last time I was yelling about Obama trying to sneak Ebola

365
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Normal Outlets like CNN or quick

366
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,135
The point out that even though there have been deaths from this strain that the rate is lower than stars or Mercy

367
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
Two similar viruses that have come up

368
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
In the past

369
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,743
In the recent past

370
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Infowars

371
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
Article about how Imperial College of London Professor Neil Ferguson

372
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
Was quoted as saying that this cold start this could

373
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:48,543
Have a similar death rate to the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak

374
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,359
MMA editorialize that could mean that 100

375
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
85 million people could die from

376
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
Sad is that might be a bit of a

377
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,039
At least in the early going

378
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
What Infowars fails to point out of the rest

379
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Ferguson's commentary

380
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
He was talking about

381
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,231
The current rate of death among known cases of the virus

382
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,279
But according to CNN quote

383
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
Ferguson believes the fatality rate is likely

384
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,423
Play to be lower due to an iceberg of milder cases we're yet to find

385
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
Once there's more information a lot of this

386
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,543
To probably end up looking a lot less

387
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
Drastic and severe that it does immediate

388
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,431
Okay so you're saying that some media Outlets

389
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
Took noted expert entire phrasing and and wording and answering questions where

390
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,367
Basically he

391
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
Canceled everybody to be cautious about

392
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Making this a ripped

393
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,767
Diculous sensationalize thing

394
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
And the media Outlet grabbed the one

395
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
Hypothetical where is like

396
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,119
Well it could be

397
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
I think you Ferguson

398
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,983
Comments could be better characterized as not saying like

399
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
Worry about it seriously

400
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,151
Amanta a reality of these the surface

401
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,431
Situations is that

402
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,271
Oftentimes what you see is it looks really bad

403
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
And then when you find that there are I don't know

404
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
10000

405
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,975
Additional people who had the virus

406
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
You realize I

407
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
Okay it's not as deadly as it

408
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
It appears immediate

409
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,887
That's the gist that I got from

410
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:18,911
From Ferguson

411
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,935
There were mysterious

412
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,471
Incubus in their absence

413
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
From the invoice article

414
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Not as bright

415
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,359
I can't tell you what's going to happen with this this this virus

416
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,175
But I do think it's repugnant for Alex to behave the way you

417
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:34,271
No matter the scale of the eventual outcome this is a public health

418
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,855
Issue and people should be given the information they need the best equip themselves

419
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
Keep themselves in

420
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
The family safe

421
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
A situation like this there's no place for

422
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
Sensationalism

423
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,535
But honestly Alex doesn't have any other games

424
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
To play

425
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
All he has is

426
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,351
Insinuation

427
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
In a position that is

428
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
Equally knee-jerk as it is uninformed

429
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
That this virus is a globalist attack

430
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
As opposed to just a reality of life in the modern world

431
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,103
Every virus in

432
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Condition is unknown until it's

433
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,991
Not people who work on this stuff understand that Dynamic perfectly well

434
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
But Alex

435
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,111
He has a piece of information that blows this whole thing wide open

436
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
A month

437
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Four days ago this virus was

438
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Was patented

439
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
Vaccine or whatever

440
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Which definitely prove

441
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Set this is a global

442
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
I can find no evidence of what he's saying

443
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
This would be December 8th

444
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,775
Keep 2019 that he's talking about there's no and no indication that I can find it

445
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
He's not just making this up

446
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
On December 20th 2019 mark

447
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
Announced they've gotten FDA approval for an Ebola vaccine

448
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
You called

449
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
This is huge news but has nothing

450
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
You do with the Wuhan situation

451
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,599
As best as I can tell there's a

452
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,695
Conspiracy running around there was a patent put on this vaccine virus tumor

453
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,767
Make a vaccine prior to the outbreak being reported to the World Health

454
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:54,399
But I've reviewed the arguments of basically it all boils down to these online Dum Dums not realizing

455
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
That the word coronavirus is not unique

456
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,471
To this outbreak

457
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
It's an umbrella under which there's tons of

458
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,079
Specific viruses including SARS and MERS

459
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
I can find

460
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
Conspiracy theorist talking about it

461
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
Prior

462
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,479
Coronavirus patent

463
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
Suspicious

464
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
I can't find anything about December 18th

465
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,575
That s*** that Alec

466
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:13,343
What is talking about

467
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,184
Infowars opposed to time two articles but I need to be very afraid

468
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,488
But none of them have anything about this

469
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Mysterious Pat

470
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,536
I have searched

471
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,864
Natural news as well and I couldn't find any information on

472
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:26,144
I have no idea

473
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,424
At this point what Alex is talking

474
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,728
But maybe a little bit later in the episode

475
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
Alex will reveal

476
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,384
And we can figure out whether or not he's making s*** up

477
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,176
I wouldn't be surprised if he was like

478
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:40,736
They make you put a lime in the in this

479
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,040
Alright

480
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Coronavirus

481
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,368
It's a it's a

482
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,416
Very heavily featured in the fast

483
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
The Furious movies

484
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,024
That's all Ludacris tricks

485
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
So Alex

486
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
This is going to get back to this and

487
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
It'll be very hilarious when he does

488
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Just because the roots

489
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
To this are very

490
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
And very soon

491
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:03,776
Before he does he's got to ramble that's another issue

492
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,384
Medical free press that I find

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,176
Very stupid

494
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
Text to be talkin about

495
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,504
The breakdown

496
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
Brazil is going after

497
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:21,696
Atlanta

498
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Ion

499
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:25,024
The leader of Brazil and on

500
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
But he's not nothing

501
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
I don't know why Alex is surprised

502
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
Why what's happening with Glenn Greenwald in Brazil

503
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
What is a dashiki

504
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:37,056
Did he think the jilber sinaro wasn't going to attack Nebraska

505
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,616
We'll get to that here in a second because like

506
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
Alex's just like

507
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,176
Back way out of

508
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Out-of-left-field on the

509
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,736
And again

510
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:47,296
I have my own going

511
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,624
Theory that Alex does not know bolsonaro's name

512
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:57,280
Play the leader of Brazil becomes much

513
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
Stronger every time Alex toxic

514
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
Modern communication is Facebook his YouTube is Twitter

515
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Altona

516
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,544
Play myself

517
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,592
Don't even

518
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,920
Pick the phone up you just sent a text message

519
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
You send voice message

520
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,808
Communication is down

521
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,672
We're looking into Banning Jones off of

522
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
Text messages

523
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
For Nissan

524
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,536
If using Whatsapp

525
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
He doesn't

526
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,936
Baby tries to use private messenger without the wheel bearing in there

527
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,728
And now Brazil

528
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,848
Facebook is using at the block people there that support balsara

529
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,736
Journalism

530
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,040
Dangerous situation

531
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
Yeah it certainly is

532
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
This is

533
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Hellboy

534
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
Talking about there with is like

535
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
Give me to not be able to

536
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,608
The text or whatever isn't Facebook there was a conversation

537
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
I think on Sienna and maybe

538
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Some sort of adjust

539
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,288
Casual conversation with a reporter who owns WhatsApp

540
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:16,128
Is he kicked off that too I don't know

541
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
Yeah I don't know this whole thing is baseball

542
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,088
More of a hey you're kicked off Facebook does that apply to

543
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,624
The other business is a Facebook on

544
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
Yeah yeah

545
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,672
How does

546
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
Roll that ball down the hill

547
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,024
Now ever want to know what apps I'm on

548
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
Yeah that is that is like

549
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,120
You're not allowed to watch Disney movies

550
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Did you like okay

551
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
But also all the

552
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Things that Disney owns

553
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:45,312
That's like 40% of all entertainment Star Wars

554
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,848
I'm a 1/2

555
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,152
And I'm glad that I was supposed to have Glenn Greenwald

556
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,456
What is being treated by boss

557
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:57,088
Brazil

558
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,672
On the other hand I have no idea why you surprised by what's happening

559
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
Alex has absolutely supported Boosie too

560
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Up to this point

561
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,216
Supported bolsonaro up to this point when literally everyone who knows anything

562
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
Think it's been shouted warning

563
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:17,568
About is repression of the press and his authoritarian leanings

564
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
Alex knows enough

565
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Think about the country

566
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
He doesn't even know the name

567
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,432
It was never important

568
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,968
He was just Brazil's

569
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,504
Trump and that was good enough

570
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
That's all you need to know

571
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
In his campaign bolsonaro called the media trash

572
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:33,184
Reporters Without Borders sounded a very serious alarm noting

573
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,232
That after the first round of Elections

574
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
You'd said he

575
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,816
You plan to quote put a final stop to all forms of

576
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,096
Activism in Brazil

577
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
Which is the sort of thing only

578
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,168
Dictator would probably say papa

579
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:46,752
Well I mean that in like praising previous dictator

580
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,776
Only dictators

581
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Is it probably do that

582
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Did that did he

583
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
I don't know

584
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Yep

585
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,200
He later qualified his position that the media was trash tweeting quote

586
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,480
When they cover the fact

587
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,088
Without political activism in partiality the media fulfill a valuable role of informal

588
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,880
The rest of this is in all caps

589
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:09,536
Quote we are against any type of social control of the media and internet yes pictures

590
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,608
Maybe political activism and partiality is only a problem when it

591
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,400
It's not in agreement with you

592
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
Innocence it seems like yeah

593
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,472
You could be called the

594
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Brazil drop

595
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
I mean you know he hasn't murdered a journalist on his birthday

596
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Drew

597
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
That's a good start

598
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,248
Reuters reported during the campaign that quote the Brazilian Association

599
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,320
Investigative journalism is identified more than 60 in

600
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,392
Listen to the physical violence or it's imminent threat against journalist

601
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
Stirring the camp

602
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Champagne

603
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,744
This probably explains why bolsonaro tweeted in Ark

604
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,048
Really attacked over stressed these attacks

605
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:44,608
Start the natural result of his rhetoric

606
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,728
What we're seeing now with the targeting of Glenn Greenwald is terrible but none of it should be surprising

607
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,616
In the campaign Brazilian journalist Miriam Nieto was aggressively targeted and threatened by bolsonaro

608
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152
Supporters for an article

609
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:58,432
But they wrote about the threat

610
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Did he pose to

611
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,248
Reporters Without Borders

612
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
Cover the female journalist who cannot be named for

613
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Security reasons

614
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Who work for any 10 News

615
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,952
She was hit in the chin and arm by bolsonaro supporters who threatened

616
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,048
Draper and said quote when the commander is President the whole press will be killed

617
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,960
Bolsonaro himself attacked and threatened to remove any government advertising from Full hot Due South Paulo

618
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
The newspaper

619
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,640
When a closer examination reveals is probably just mad that they ran critical coverage of him

620
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
And Brandon story affirming that he had threatened

621
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Did you kill his ex-wife

622
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,856
Is constant and aggressive attacks on the media created a very hostile and very non-free

623
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:38,624
Environment

624
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,464
For the price of the country and it's exactly what everyone who cares at all

625
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
All that time Alex is not given a single s***

626
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
He supported bolsonaro

627
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
Because nothing matters to Alex other than opt

628
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,496
This guy was being called Brazil Trump

629
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
And he was acting a lot like Trump

630
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
He was friendly with drop use the same words like

631
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
Like fake news

632
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,408
How the f*** are you supposed to

633
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,224
To criticize him without it being very clear that you're fine with

634
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,760
The same thing from Trump

635
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Alex has now entered

636
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Is the place of

637
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,696
The. We're criticism about Trump for not free Julian Assange that's become normalized

638
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,280
So now he can feign some kind of concerned about Greenwald situation

639
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
Without jeopardizing losing

640
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
When is audience

641
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Dumb dumb

642
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
This is all just very sad and

643
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
Clear demonstration

644
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
How's little Alex cares about any of this s***

645
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
We Care

646
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
You know bolsonaro's name

647
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
If he cared

648
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,872
He would have noticed the very clear pattern of attacking

649
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,432
The press in Brazil for a long time already

650
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:41,088
If he cared he would take a look in the mirror and realized that he would absolutely lockup Brian stelter

651
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,880
If you had the power to do so

652
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
What I'm getting at

653
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
Is it if I were Paul Joseph Watson

654
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,840
I probably accuse Alex of virtue signalling hear about caring about the Press

655
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,376
Probably what I would do

656
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Yeah if you're surprised

657
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:58,240
Is that bolsonaro went after Glenn Greenwald

658
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,616
The guy who revealed operation Carwash was AJ corrupt bullshits

659
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,224
The guy who revealed that today illegally ousted

660
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,576
Silver in order to or not silver

661
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:18,976
They all stood her in order to install to Mayor even though that was illegal and he wasn't even allowed to f****** run and then because

662
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:23,328
Lula was in prison at the time again it legally for no reason

663
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Visa political

664
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,168
He wasn't allowed to run even though it would have won by a f******

665
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,008
Miles said bolsonaro is in with a f******

666
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,800
Absolute Stranglehold on power

667
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
I don't know why

668
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
They would go after

669
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Glenn Greenwald

670
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,432
Only thing that's surprising is it took this long

671
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Yeah exactly I was kind of surprised

672
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
But my point is I course this is

673
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,368
I'm glad that I was bringing attention to it to his audience

674
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
But at the same time it's

675
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,720
It's indicative that the issue isn't he

676
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,024
He presented to be cuz if it was

677
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,840
You should have heard These Warnings long ago

678
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:59,168
End. Just been blindly and stupidly

679
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
Supporting

680
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
Gennaro the rest of the world said

681
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Lookout

682
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,640
I think that very simply the he's lighting the entire Amazon on

683
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,456
On fire would have been a good warning sign for he's probably going after

684
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,040
Regardless how much does a care about that that's been to release more carbon

685
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:21,440
Now that's right plan for God tonight then I forgot about that sometimes you say stuff like that

686
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
You got to make sure you do that to look like that and it just think man

687
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,560
This guy does not pay attention

688
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
Just an idiot

689
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,352
So stupid

690
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
So

691
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
Alex is is dumb on that count

692
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:36,544
And he starts talking a little bit about the impeachment but instead of talking about the excellent

693
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Trial he wants

694
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,848
To distract with

695
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,408
Boutique right-wing victimhood narrative

696
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:44,224
And this is before him that it

697
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,504
For today

698
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,040
What they don't want is

699
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
People tuning in

700
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,880
See the impeachment feed

701
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,232
Or nymphowars or right side

702
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,280
A Judicial Watch

703
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,608
In the Modern Age

704
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
A couple hundred bucks

705
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
C-SPAN

706
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,984
Congress and they'll just give me the feed

707
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
I can carry

708
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,872
And CNN is always behind us and you know

709
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
It was

710
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
Oliver Darcy one of those guys called up

711
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
YouTube

712
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,600
They got the contact the top of it what are you doing

713
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:28,256
So the story is the Judicial Watch and right side broadcasting streaming the impeachment hearing

714
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
YouTube shut down the street

715
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,608
Alex is completely making up

716
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
B e n n and Oliver Darcy were in any way involved

717
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,448
In the story that he

718
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
He's talking about

719
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,056
He has nothing to base that on other than his imagination

720
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
I'm making this up

721
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:48,992
It feels to me like CNN and Oliver Darcy probably did that you are discounting his

722
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Deduce

723
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,928
Information rather than

724
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,696
I'm not disc

725
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Accounting pad

726
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
IMDb

727
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,048
I'm putting it on trial

728
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Matt Silva

729
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,936
I find the story hard to care about too much

730
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
41

731
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,080
Right side broadcasting is an extreme right-wing organization that is employed Nick Fuentes @joeysalads in

732
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:14,848
In the past right

733
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,688
Mayweather streaming capabilities taken away by YouTube previously due to a breach

734
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,712

735
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
It seems believable to me

736
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,272
That they were in violation

737
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
In the game here and Heather's

738
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
Suspended again

739
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
I don't care

740
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:32,000
As we're Judicial Watch their ridiculous right-wing propaganda Outlet who received YouTube strikes recently for things like

741
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
Revealing the alleged Ukraine whistleblowers name

742
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,888
It seems very believable again that they were not just providing

743
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,704
Some kind of commentary on the impeachment operating

744
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Single bed Outside YouTube the rules

745
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
This is specifically a YouTube thing

746
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Judicial watches stream the impeachment

747
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,384
Continued on their own website

748
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
Is just something about their stream was not appropriate for you to

749
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
I've been doing this show long enough

750
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,904
Not to care about Judicial Watch and I cannot possibly believe anything the right side broadcasting says

751
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
We will remain

752
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:01,952
Forever

753
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
Who cares

754
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
Yeah yeah

755
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,560
If you can watch

756
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
Throughout a bunch of Edward they'll be like

757
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Go to eBay.

758
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
Whatever it is they had it

759
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,520
Yeah I don't know what the issue is precisely here but

760
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,288
Actors

761
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,592
This is Alex isn't telling the whole truth

762
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
The story and I don't

763
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
Really cared

764
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Nope

765
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,688
Care to look into

766
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
The judicial watch this

767
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
So

768
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
Another thing is like I can't be distracted

769
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
Drive to buy this

770
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,136
There's bigger issues at the coronavirus was Patton

771
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:33,952
A bump in 4 days ago

772
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
I just get really

773
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Excited when I hear Alex

774
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
Get to it, stop

775
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Confirm

776
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,400
Belmont report

777
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,936
We're going to break it

778
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:45,984
Bodily harm

779
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
Coronavirus

780
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,592
It was patented certified for

781
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Authorizes a vaccine

782
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,296
And magically that's right after that happens if

783
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,600
I'm saying

784
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Yes you are

785
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
What do sometimes equals 4

786
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
Water

787
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,328
Marshall and Skye

788
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
That's an upside down

789
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,424
Lana's real loud

790
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
Today no one died today

791
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
At the doctor last month

792
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:26,176
This is very serious situation were to be laying it all out

793
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
And breaking it all down

794
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
Here today

795
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,064
Please remember that

796
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,112
Without you this dog doesn't

797
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:37,440
With your elbow supported does and right now we need financial

798
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
4 +

799
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,512
Products you really need regardless

800
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:45,376
So if you're listening or paying attention what is just happened to yours Alex said that

801
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:50,752
This coronavirus was patented for a vaccine a month and 4 days ago and then there was an outbreak

802
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,824
Hey isn't that suspicious I'm not saying that the globalist

803
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:59,712
To doing this but sometimes bananas are yellow bats hang upside down two plus two is four

804
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,016
That they are attacking us

805
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,088
The world with this bio-weapon on Coronavirus

806
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,624
I need some

807
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,672
Yeah yeah

808
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,232
For the products that will almost certainly

809
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Text you from this

810
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,304
Oh I don't know

811
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,704
He doesn't go that far as to imply that his products are going to help you with this situation

812
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
Commercial that he plays is that one about like

813
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,800
Hey knock on wood

814
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:30,688
I don't get sick often I take my products and I don't get

815
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:36,832
Who is still the understanding among his audience that he sells product that will help you not be

816
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,440
I take iodine and colloidal silver I won't catch anything

817
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,280
So I don't know what if you what if the only thing

818
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,560
It stops Coronavirus

819
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,328
This Is The Life

820
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:48,864
Then word

821
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,984
Serious drop me another quarter that's going to be no good me another quarter before that gets passed the standards

822
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
So

823
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:01,408
He's just teasing though he doesn't get any specifics on this there's not much I can do is no information

824
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,200
Based on this bit is

825
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Is readily available

826
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
And so I just need

827
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,552
You know I'm like a rock climber

828
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
I need something to eat I need a whole

829
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
Yeah I need a hold beyond the pole

830
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Myself

831
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
We just got to see what happens

832
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
So he starts talking more about the impeachment

833
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Trial

834
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
Complained about this they think is very dumb

835
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:25,472
Savannah Hernandez

836
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,872
And Owen adjoining us coming up in the second our here today and again live reports from

837
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,640
DC

838
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,480
With the second day of the Trump profit all it is is the Democrats

839
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,784
Grandstanding and

840
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Again telling us over. We're going out guilty

841
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,160
Trump is trying to game the system

842
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Game

843
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,464
The house

844
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
He's complaining that it's just the Democrats grandstanding it's the

845
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Democrats

846
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,352
The opening statement.

847
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
Yeah like what the fuc

848
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
Why are you

849
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,704
Just Democrat stalking

850
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
That's how

851
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,104
They agreed for the structure of the hearing to be the f*** are you talkin about

852
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Great doesn't matter

853
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,760
Lawyer for the Republican said none of them were allowed to look at the stuff

854
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,880
Even though everybody sucks everybody was everybody knew you was fine and you can just lie in there

855
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,280
Because it doesn't f****** matter could you imagine like during the period where it's the you know the Republicans

856
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,304
Opening

857
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,400
A couple days can you imagine like a serious

858
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
Left-wing commentator trying to pull that kind of s*** like

859
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:35,872
Is grandstanding up here same props innocent you telling me that they're just going to talk for 3

860
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
3 days

861
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:43,040
What kind of ridiculous pop party would talk for 3 days

862
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,344
Exploitative of his audiences

863
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:48,160
Lack of grasp of the specific things

864
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
And how they work

865
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
That is what is going on in the trial right now

866
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,048
You may be annoyed by

867
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,608
But it's part of the agreed-upon format

868
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
So

869
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,704
Shut the f****** just because I agree

870
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,544
To do this doesn't mean I can't still Moline you while you're doing

871
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Stupid

872
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:09,152
Sonic says the ONN Savannah Hernandez are going to be in

873
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
We're not going to hear anything

874
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,016
From Savannah because they're Skype doesn't really work out now it's like f******

875
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Alright

876
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,856
He does have Owen Shroyer come in and

877
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,624
Before he does

878
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,720
He plays a video of Owen going and like

879
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
Roofing

880
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
Reprove

881
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,584
Good protesters on the left

882
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
Any pro impeachment protesters

883
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
They don't even know why the mm

884
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
Impeachment

885
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,288
You got to listen to a little bit of

886
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
The impeachtrump Rousseau and

887
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:56,000
I'll go ahead and school I'm on the issues

888
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
You don't know the reason you don't know the reason

889
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,752
Do you get ready

890
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,896
We're going there for a second because clearly this person who's trying to talk to has said I'm not here to talk

891
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Even

892
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:19,040
If I know that a lot of people on the

893
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,856
Let you know what's a people who work for The Daily Show

894
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,136
Big only talk

895
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,208
Two people at Trump rallies like

896
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,744
Make fun of

897
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,096
If he had a video where one of them said I don't want to talk to you

898
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,888
And then he kept antagonizing them

899
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,936
I would say that that is f****** b*******

900
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,288
Even though I agree with the idea of making these people at Trump rallies look stupid

901
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,080
I agree that good funny.

902
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
I'm not sure if

903
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,944
But it's fine you know it's entertaining

904
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,224
If one of them

905
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,248
Open the group

906
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:53,088
That I don't care much for said I'm not here to talk

907
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,880
And then Jordan clever's like

908
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
Dominate this person

909
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,976
Then I would say that this is not cool

910
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,512
You are now harassing people

911
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,792
Pretty sure you still have

912
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,840
The signed releases on broadcast

913
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,912
Stevie apparently

914
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,984
Just be like this person for a while

915
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,568
Give explicable thinking that he's going to dominate anybody in Onarga

916
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:19,968
Go dominator

917
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:26,368
Claiming that trumps impeachment is for Ukrainian quid pro quo the only problem is

918
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:32,768
Nancy Pelosi

919
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
How can the impeachment

920
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:43,776
Look for something he did as president

921
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,616
My cameraman please

922
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,688
You can see the strategy there is

923
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,808
Let's get ongoing gay

924
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Let's argue let's fight

925
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:04,000
That is all they have that that is all this and really they should stop putting out videos that include those

926
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Worship yeah

927
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,792
Because it's

928
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:10,656
To clear that these people were like I don't want to talk to you

929
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
Not block

930
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,472
Us or whatever

931
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,056
There's a clear disinterested engaging and then he poking

932
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Antagonizing

933
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,432
You need to cut that out in only leave in the part where they're yelling at you later

934
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
This really hurts the optic

935
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
It does if it doesn't

936
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
But if your intended no I mean

937
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,976
And it does for for us who are like there are standards and things

938
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
You should do an

939
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,024
Maybe just

940
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,584
Birra polite person that reveals too much of that

941
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,864
The goal is

942
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
The album

943
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:47,520
The goal is eliciting the outburst and they don't care the people

944
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
May say

945
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
I don't want to talk to

946
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
Owning the libs

947
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Is

948
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Not about

949
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Arguments

950
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,199
Norwin

951
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,015
Or being correct it is about making lives

952
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Right

953
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:02,623
So when is that going to be on the show and talk

954
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
The Alex about his

955
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
His plates

956
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
And how difficult it is

957
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,487
He says that he is

958
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,255
Like a second

959
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,095
Can class citizen there's a two-tiered justice system against

960
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,751
People like him I would like to put him down to 3rd can we put him down to a third-class citizens are you think he is a just fine so

961
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,055
He's doing all right

962
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
Put them down first

963
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,103
Anyway Alex

964
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Some thoughts

965
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Was just stupid

966
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:30,527
You know what Infowars tells you something's bombshell news we're not hyping it

967
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:36,159
The future of Humanity on this planet and Beyond

968
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,463
Beyond Buzz Lightyear lights

969
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,095
But I just got a call or the producer did Daria

970
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,143
2 minutes ago

971
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959
Dinocore

972
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,263
It's bomb shelters are trying to put him in jail

973
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
4

974
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
In there at the kickoff of impeachment saying

975
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
Is the Democrats and the Deep state

976
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,807
We can't find cases for the Democrats

977
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Sometimes

978
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:09,183
They've actually been indicted

979
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,255
But when will the Democrats take over Live Events

980
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,095
They might get arrested but they're throwing the book

981
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:23,007
You can find tons of left-wing protesters and activists who are nonviolent do been arrested for demonstrating

982
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
And face

983
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Consequences have to go to trial

984
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,639
How to completely making up the idea that none are in order

985
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Exaggerating

986
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,967
A few of the right-wing victimhood that animates his business

987
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,527
Turning on Troy into some kind of a martyr

988
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,575
Although I do think this is really interests

989
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Think because this is

990
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
News

991
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
On the 22nd

992
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:39,903
End of January

993
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,975
Owen Shroyer disrupted that impeachment Hearing in early too

994
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
December he's just had to go to a court date

995
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,119
This makes me realize why he's still in DC covering the impeachment

996
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,679
Because he left

997
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
So he

998
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:01,151
DC providing coverage

999
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Joe argue about a ticket

1000
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:10,367
I appreciate that

1001
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:15,487
DC anyways might as well block a few hours I'm laughing because it's funny

1002
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
Not because it's not why

1003
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:25,215
Alex has been teasing this coronavirus thing and it really was me hitting my head against the wall trying to figure out what the fuc

1004
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Talking about I have no

1005
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
Is really absurd

1006
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,567
Then finally

1007
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Here

1008
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
At this point

1009
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:32,639
Alex uses a specific

1010
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:33,919
And I'm able to run with

1011
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
There is a

1012
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,271
Eyebright Instituto pronouncing that right

1013
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:45,951
The shadowy William secretive group

1014
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,535
Twerking

1015
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
On

1016
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,375
Trying to create

1017
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,727
Vaccine for this

1018
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
They've patented

1019
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,079
Over the years

1020
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
Mutations

1021
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
The virus

1022
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,623
Until I just find it very very interesting that

1023
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
Magically there's a vaccine for this now and

1024
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
Well there you go

1025
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
This coronavirus grasping at straws this is pathetic

1026
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,191
Talking liar answer isn't there isn't

1027
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
Cream for that there's one in the works

1028
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,799
Probably won't be ready for a while

1029
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,871
Literally never heard Alex bring up

1030
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,967
The hybrite Institute on his show before and he's obviously unfamiliar with them

1031
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:46,367
Being as he isn't sure how to pronounce their name and he pronounces it

1032
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:49,183
Is reporting on them as a shadowy organization that's up to no good

1033
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:54,559
He's making insinuations about them as if they're a long time bad guy on the show but this is all new s***

1034
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:58,143
Also point of order he's completely making up if they're funded by Bill

1035
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
It's entirely possible that some

1036
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Funding for that Foundation does

1037
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,335
Exist from Bill Gates but Alex is absolutely just guessing and making that up

1038
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,919
He is no reason to suggest that other than to make the hibriten

1039
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:14,015
Look Evil by connecting them to an established bad guy in his cinematic

1040
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,087
Now that is some information I can get to the bottom of

1041
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
Edit this clips

1042
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
Aesthetic rambling didn't already tell you this

1043
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
This is complete b*******

1044
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,023
There is no article on Infowars

1045
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Nord newswars

1046
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,095
North summit news

1047
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,631
Nor natural news

1048
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,911
Does that include the words

1049
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Hibriten

1050
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,471
Ever know

1051
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,775
There is a headline quotes

1052
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,311
Secretive Institute patent

1053
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,359
Did coronavirus vaccine recently

1054
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:44,735
But that article on Infowars is just a video this episode that we are listening to it right now

1055
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,783
There's legitimate

1056
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,831
No proof of any of this ship

1057
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
I won of things it's the most difficult is that there are a number of ways you could spell hybrite hybridlight

1058
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
H i h i g h

1059
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,303
Who knows

1060
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
Thankfully

1061
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,607
I'm an old salt

1062
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
If this game

1063
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:05,727
And I know the odds are that Alex flash something up on screen that could help me out here

1064
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,543
So it turns out I went

1065
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,311
Consulted the video

1066
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,871
And turns out when he says hi bright

1067
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
It's actually.

1068
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
Cirb HD

1069
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,015
So he meant

1070
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
So he said

1071
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Fire bright

1072
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,647
No he said hybrid he said hi right

1073
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,927
Pure bright

1074
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
Alex appears to be getting this information

1075
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
About the purebright insta

1076
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:33,375
Two and how they got a vaccine patented in December from Jordan sather

1077
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,935
Noted qanon weirdo on Twitter

1078
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
And a guy who recommends people drink bleach

1079
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
For healthcare

1080
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,543
After tweeted about this

1081
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,591
Conspiracy back on January 21st

1082
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,407
The day before the episode we listening to now

1083
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,943
And it spread a bit from

1084
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:51,295
If I had to guess I would say that Alex saw this but would absolutely never admit that this

1085
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Who's this source

1086
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,855
Unfortunately

1087
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,903
The Panthers owned by the pier Brighton

1088
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
If it's related to the Coronavirus

1089
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
Is not

1090
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:03,839
For human use the one that Jordan sather was tweeting about the one that's Central to all the

1091
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,607
The conspiracies

1092
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
The group from there

1093
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
From the patent

1094
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,311
Although live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines are universally used in the control of ivv

1095
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
Desired condition is related to a Coronavirus

1096
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,199
They're protected game by use of vaccine

1097
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,527
Be lost either due to vaccine breakdown or to the introduction

1098
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,087
Of a new ibv stereotype

1099
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,671
0 type that is not related to the vaccine use

1100
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,207
Posing a risk to the poultry

1101
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,511
Further there's a need in the

1102
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,047
The industry to develop vaccines

1103
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,839
Are suitable for use in OVO

1104
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,631
In order to improve the efficient

1105
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,935
And cost-effectiveness of vaccine program

1106
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,495
Jordan pits for birds

1107
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,031
If it's given

1108
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
Chickens is the VMAs

1109
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:49,151
Fervor

1110
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,175
Yes all right

1111
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:55,039
Isn't it a little bit convenient that this vaccine is for an oval chick

1112
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
What do we eat

1113
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
Chicken

1114
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,647
That's how we're going to get the vaccine virus

1115
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,951
This is the problem with people not reading

1116
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,399
If you read over this patent you find a dead giveaway when they're talking about clinical indications from the vaccine and the

1117
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,727
The main side effect they're talking about and are concerned with is Snicker

1118
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,519
Which is a respiratory condition

1119
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
Chickens

1120
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,895
There's no conversation in this padded all about human used because it's a vaccine for f******

1121
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,663
Chicken

1122
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
That's an issue

1123
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:25,503
There's only one sliver of plausibility here

1124
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
And I need to stress

1125
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,063
But this story Alex is talking about

1126
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Propulsion

1127
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
Bluebird observable reality is

1128
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,719
That's a pride Institute does study animal diseases that have a

1129
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
Potential possibly spread to

1130
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
Like in the case of the Coronavirus

1131
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
Some chicken

1132
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
But that's not all that they do

1133
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
They're primarily an Animal Health Organization

1134
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:45,471
As one might learn from looking in

1135
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Maybe some of their other

1136
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:49,567
Search like they're recent breakthrough related to foot

1137
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
Mouth disease

1138
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,639
Which only affect hoofed animals

1139
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,663
Which humans are not

1140
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,223
The body Galaxy's foot-in-mouth

1141
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
Cuz he's all right how we doing

1142
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,575
The bottom line here is that this vaccine for chickens

1143
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,671
Is not even the same strain of coronavirus it's currently showing up out of Wuhan

1144
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:11,071
Physical play Leon related padding for an animal medicine that Alex is reporting is being related to the Wuhan outbreak

1145
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
As best as I can tell

1146
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,167
These sources be Twitter account of a dude who tells

1147
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Followers to drink

1148
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Which

1149
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
This is bad work

1150
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Yeah that's

1151
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,591
Probably not what I would say was going to get you a Pulitzer

1152
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
I don't think he's going to win on this one

1153
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,919
TV

1154
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
The Great

1155
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:34,111
Somebody patented of vaccine for chickens and that's why we're all going to die a story of 2020

1156
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,135
Probably isn't going to

1157
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,951
I'm going to win anyting now I doubt it

1158
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,767
So that's a big guy that's the big scoop out

1159
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,839
Jordan sather tweeted out a f****** patent

1160
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,911
For a chicken vaccine representing as being the same thing

1161
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:50,751
Is this Wuhan coronavirus outbreak

1162
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,311
It's proof that the globalists are attacking everybody

1163
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
People need to go to school

1164
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
I'm going to say this quite a bit

1165
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,223
Just go to school

1166
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:04,575
You really need to go to school a little bit critical

1167
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
That's what I'm

1168
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,903
What's the problem isn't like people not knowing

1169
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:08,671
How to read

1170
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
It's blind trust in people like Alex

1171
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
Jordan sather

1172
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,791
Those types of people who

1173
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
Don't do any work too

1174
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,375
Throat spaghetti against the wall

1175
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,911
Presentational effect

1176
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,983
People just need to not trust them

1177
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,287
And go and read these things

1178
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,871
The people who is like tricked by a lot of this stuff they know how to

1179
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,407
They just don't

1180
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
Do it and don't

1181
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Confirm these things

1182
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,735
Like with Alex

1183
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,063
If any of his listeners went and actually red

1184
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
The Texas

1185
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,135
Domestic terrorism threat assessment

1186
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
It would puncture the entire world

1187
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Recreating

1188
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Why would they

1189
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
Why would I

1190
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
How to say this is all about themselves it's

1191
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:50,143
Very clearly about white racially motivated terrorism

1192
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:53,727
Cause that

1193
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
Depressed in these figures is what

1194
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
To be eroded

1195
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
Because they're bad Act

1196
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,663
They don't they don't present the information

1197
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Accurately

1198
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,271
Alex is presenting his f****** dumb s*** about a chicken vaccine

1199
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,367
Has presented the information

1200
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,695
That you're if you're presenting information you should have

1201
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:17,279
To present the information for you should be

1202
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
To and receptive to calls

1203
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:19,839
2

1204
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,655
Address the information you're putting out

1205
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,215
If you're wrong about something you should be

1206
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,007
You know you should be open

1207
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,823
Open to that as opposed to Alex and now he's going

1208
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
Like this is going to be established as a

1209
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
Piece of his rhetoric moving forward

1210
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,431
That the globalist

1211
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Planned

1212
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
Muffin

1213
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,527
Four days in advance with this vac

1214
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,295
Dean Patton

1215
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,927
Everyone will just internalized it as a real talking point as opposed to it being based

1216
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
On a f****** chicken fix

1217
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:49,279
Vaccine for chicken

1218
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Correct correct

1219
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Now

1220
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,399
And there's some point soon about a nickens

1221
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
What he say

1222
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,703
Is that

1223
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,239
Lapeer pregnancy

1224
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,007
Dude

1225
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:04,383
Patented a vaccine for the coronavirus that is now being treated

1226
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,223
Wuhan as a possible issue

1227
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,039
But it's Fortune

1228
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:14,623
None of this is real

1229
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,695
But this is the kind of dangerous news that Alex covers

1230
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,559
And that's why they need him to be taken off the air at Banana yellow

1231
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:23,839
But not when it's brown

1232
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,215
They want us also here because

1233
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,287
Broadcast

1234
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,359
Government

1235
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,407
Buy from the government

1236
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,807
The hundred bucks last time we did it

1237
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:55,839
Oliver Darcy Oliver Darcy calls up and says that's his job

1238
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:59,423
YouTube

1239
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:06,847
That's in the news right here at some level they don't want us on there they don't want us being able to cover any of it they are the

1240
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:11,711
Are the controllers

1241
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:17,599
So now it's become Alex is implying that it's in the news that Oliver Darcy in CNN

1242
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,183
We're behind getting right side broadcasting in Judicial Watch

1243
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
Is dreams on YouTube take a Daddy has nothing

1244
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:26,303
Nothing to base that on he just made it up earlier in the show

1245
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,351
And now he's repeating it as if it's

1246
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,191
He even added something to Oliver Darcy's LinkedIn page

1247
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215
Apparently he's in

1248
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,495
In charge of getting people

1249
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
Kicked off YouTube as well

1250
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
So this is how this is

1251
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
Again how's this

1252
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,455
Mutates over the course of just Alex's rambling

1253
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,759
I'm completely unhinged

1254
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,039
Ungrounded

1255
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,343
Show like

1256
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,623
Just him talk

1257
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,927
King s*** that Condition Nothing spiral out of

1258
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
Controller

1259
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
Things become

1260
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,023
Substantiated

1261
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
Things become concrete

1262
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,119
Without any real confirmation of anything

1263
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,215
It's just I said it it felt good to know it's the truth

1264
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,031
And he can't remember long enough because

1265
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
This memory is very similar to that of a chicken

1266
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,175
Bright and so he just assumes that if I said earlier that means it was

1267
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,223
Confirmed what I said it do we

1268
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
Yeah

1269
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:21,087
So Alex now gets back to complaining about Owen Shroyer is victimhood

1270
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:25,439
Call little bit of a remote thing

1271
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,463
Anti He-Man

1272
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,255
You know this is just all bulshit

1273
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:32,607
He didn't disrupt our receipt he injected one little bit of Citizen truth into it

1274
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
And he's been arrested

1275
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
Go to pay for a lawyer

1276
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,799
Stock price

1277
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Again

1278
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
Yes I did

1279
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Unequal

1280
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:46,943
Weights and measures its selective

1281
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,223
Enforcement

1282
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,319
Push our they're trying to bamboozle and they're trying

1283
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,879
To Shanghai and they're trying to Buffalo him

1284
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Infowars

1285
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:04,351
All of that why when you buy the coffee

1286
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,935
That's why when you buy your good thing for my

1287
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:11,007
So I mean this is what this all is

1288
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,079
You see the transmutation hereof

1289
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:17,663
The victim of the exaggeration the lies about like

1290
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,223
There's no complete selective enforcement

1291
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:24,575
He's Democrat to just rub don't ever have to deal with any consequences but people like me and Owen

1292
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,111
The Deep state

1293
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,671
I'm so brave to do this bike week

1294
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,207
Alright acted pleased by my

1295
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,511
Did he tell it how the victimhood

1296
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,351
Gets translated to a call to action for sale

1297
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:39,167
Captain mind activist

1298
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,191
Feds

1299
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
The Government tried to put

1300
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,775
In prison for the rest of his life for leaving water out

1301
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,919
I don't know and I don't think he knows

1302
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:56,319
The left never gets any consequences for that offer the government trying to put you in jail for the rest of your life for keeping

1303
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,367
Well look dude

1304
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:02,719
Who cares about that stuff cuz I want troyer's getting Bamboozled and buffalo

1305
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,535
Man also Shanghai

1306
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,839
So I kind of hope it gets Wuhan

1307
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,143
Alexandra

1308
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,679
They're convinced

1309
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:18,079
That Jerry Nadler himself is behind Owens persecution

1310
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,615
They talked about this a little bit

1311
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
And Alex gets a little weird

1312
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,431
Play Protest

1313
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,015
Come out here that I've no idea what the impeachment hearing about but oh my gosh

1314
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,575
If you're one lowly peon

1315
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:32,415
If you're one tiny little and one little citizen

1316
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,463
DARE stand up for your ride

1317
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:40,095
DARE stand up to the Halo

1318
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,143
But he is one hot man

1319
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:50,335
You know what I'm not attracted to Umpa Lumpa is Alex so I'm not going to comment on that

1320
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Great riff

1321
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
Glamourtress

1322
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,223
Yeah Marvin Gaye's great good comedy

1323
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,295
Alex is like I'm not I'm not gay but

1324
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,087
That Jerry Nadler is real hot

1325
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,415
Does dead Arrow ingest

1326
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:09,023
Not not a yes and Guy

1327
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,559
That starting point for the

1328
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
The bet

1329
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,119
First of all and then Towing

1330
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,143
Just really

1331
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:19,007
No butted him

1332
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
Not great

1333
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:23,615
So they're stupid and not worth even really talking about

1334
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:25,919
Alex Goes to break and he comes back

1335
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
I don't know what happened during the break

1336
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,991
But Alex's

1337
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
Really mad

1338
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,671
You know this happened she can hear poner and Anderson total transparency

1339
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:39,231
Why does lighter on the 4th hour around a play at now

1340
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,279
So important and

1341
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,839
We got so many incredible clips

1342
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Rapidan Virginia

1343
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
That during

1344
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,287
Tried to decide again which ones were going to play

1345
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,079
They're also powerful

1346
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,687
And then other people come in the room and ask why do this problem

1347
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,223
Open Newsroom in here

1348
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:03,039
People doing too much I'm not complaining

1349
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
Then I get angry

1350
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,647
Instead of getting angry

1351
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,255
Just say hey I'm going to pick what I think was most important report I just play

1352
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
So this is a devel

1353
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,143
This is furious but he's keeping it

1354
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Together enough

1355
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:23,519
To throw it to an ad

1356
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:28,127
So he does that he's plays for the rest of this entire segment a video of Millie Weaver

1357
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,407
At the Virginia rally

1358
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
And I mean I guess it's

1359
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:35,551
Probably less abusive especially if it and like weird to your audio

1360
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:41,183
It's that just scream and storm outside

1361
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Just off air

1362
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:45,023
This is really really bad

1363
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Seems like

1364
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:50,399
Somebody just pointed out to him that he's abused his staff on are maybe a little too much

1365
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,935
It's bad luck

1366
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
Yeah you can just

1367
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:58,079
Throw it to a segment maybe one of his producers came up and was like hey Alex that

1368
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
Cool thing about the Coronavirus

1369
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Stupid

1370
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:06,015
Like that you said dumb s***. About it

1371
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
So he's got to throw to Emily Weaver report

1372
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,111
Now there's something interesting

1373
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,903
When he comes back

1374
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,951
His coverage takes a real ship

1375
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,231
And it becomes

1376
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,023
Very anti-islam

1377
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:21,887
It seems to me that there's a possibility that when Alex gets really mad

1378
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,679
The only way he can really out

1379
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,447
Allow it

1380
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
To get out

1381
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,751
Is googol about Islam

1382
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,031
Complained

1383
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:30,847
So he starts doing that a little bit here and there

1384
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:38,015
Well it's Now official French government admits there are hundreds and hundreds of no-go zones

1385
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:44,415
In which French cannot go to be black YouTube eyuboglu Young if you're not a mug

1386
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,815
Get your ass attacked American rapper

1387
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,119
Your ass up

1388
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:59,519
The President Trump get you out of jail short

1389
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,591
Islam has come up

1390
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,151
White guys fight back

1391
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
The Americans

1392
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
And they go to jail

1393
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:12,575
How Europe has rolled out the red carpet Islamic

1394
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:18,207
Generally speaking I try not to pay too much attention to things like celebrities getting into fights

1395
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,487
Particularly when there's a

1396
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
Play some ambiguity to it

1397
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,583
I don't care about celebrities and I'm not impressed by fight so it's

1398
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,375
It's just not really a

1399
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,655
With the ASAP Rocky

1400
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,703
Situation I have no idea what happened

1401
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,751
But it's literally nothing like what Alex

1402
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:31,519
Describing

1403
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,543
There's a video of

1404
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,895
The fight and it's not a bunch of black guys walking down the street only to be attacked by little Islamic

1405
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,943
Is Alex is Alex puts it

1406
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:43,295
This is gas-lighting because whatever the reality of what started that fight is

1407
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,111
Documented reality is not what Alex's describe

1408
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:53,023
The nineteen-year-old who ended up getting beaten up didn't get charged by the Swedish government because it was determined in court that he only acted in

1409
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:53,791
In self-defense

1410
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
Also even if Trump did push to get Rocky out of prison

1411
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,423
It's hilarious how stupid is attempt

1412
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
Decoding article in Reuters

1413
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,751
Nervous about it quote

1414
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,823
Trump had said he would personally vouch for Rocky's bail

1415
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,407
Sweden does not have a bail system that's an issue

1416
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
Ultimately Trump

1417
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,223
Didn't get ASAP Rocky release

1418
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,503
On August

1419
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,575
August 14th 2019 he did he had an appearance

1420
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
Before the Stockholm District Court

1421
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
Where he was found guilty

1422
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
But the court decided not to give him a sentence

1423
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,487
Demon time served be sufficient

1424
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,511
As well as an order to

1425
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,303
Pay for his victims medical card

1426
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,911
Trump really didn't do s*** in that case other than act publicly pretty embarrassing

1427
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
I don't

1428
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,727
It's the story of his birth

1429
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:37,055
Do it do it nothing just being loud

1430
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
An embarrassing

1431
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,871
I don't think that Alex is right

1432
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:46,271
To claim that the French government is admitting that there are no go zones a hundreds and hundreds of them but I think I understand where this story is

1433
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,111
He's reporting on a Breitbart story that uses

1434
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,695
The story in a French paper Lowe's

1435
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,975
As its source

1436
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,279
There's a little bit of a slippery translation

1437
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:03,679
In here I think the story is saying that a classified document allegedly says that 150 districts in France are how

1438
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Held by Islam

1439
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Islamists

1440
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
This document is reference

1441
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:12,895
Expect the article in the journal dude tomorrow's also says that a quote has not been disclosed

1442
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,711
So it's not clear even what this document says

1443
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:20,063
But the article does go on to discuss polling numbers animal bears

1444
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Mobile

1445
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Magoo's

1446
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,695
Where do you

1447
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,279
Where the union of French Muslim Democrats got a 40% approval

1448
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,047
Interpol

1449
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,095
So it seems to me like there's a d

1450
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,119
Decent chance

1451
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,679
This is about is that there's a Muslim political party

1452
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,495
It's popular in communities where there are more Muslim

1453
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,079
And this is being translated in reported as no-go Zone

1454
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,407
I think that there's a possibility that that's what this is about right

1455
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,063
So I looked into the union of French Muslim Democrats a little bit it seems like Alex and his ilk should really be

1456
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
In favor of them

1457
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,183
Also to be clear just so you know off the top like that party has fielded

1458
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
Candidates for office that are not Muslim

1459
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
It's naughty

1460
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,791
Uniquely strictly Muslim

1461
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
Party

1462
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,351
Anti certainly not

1463
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,679
According to an article in Deutsch

1464
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,447
Well

1465
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
From 2050

1466
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
The UFM

1467
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
Dee is an attempt

1468
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
Combat islamophobia

1469
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,847
B A by encouraging young Muslims

1470
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
To get engaged

1471
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,383
With a

1472
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Go process

1473
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,271
The article spoke to a 28 year-old woman who's involved in the party who stressed that getting involved

1474
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
In this sort of activity is

1475
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,087
Important impart

1476
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,135
It's an important part of quote

1477
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,927
Showing that we are not like them

1478
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,207
Referencing ice

1479
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,511
In the article sociology

1480
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,279
Just named Pietra

1481
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,095
Reflect on the party and notes that there is

1482
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Is little chance

1483
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,167
The making real strides and Regional election

1484
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,191
But

1485
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,495
Quote the fact they Embrace their attached

1486
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Secularism

1487
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
And the French

1488
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Republic

1489
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,103
Can help Indy demonizing Muslim

1490
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,407
As their people

1491
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:53,503
Appear in the media and get better now they'll be seen in a

1492
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
Way

1493
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,087
I don't know how much of this article proves that the government is

1494
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
Admitting that there's hundreds and hundreds

1495
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
The no-go Zone

1496
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,975
But it definitely doesn't appear that that is the thrust

1497
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:03,743
Does the article

1498
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,327
I feels like this might just be the spin that's put on it by Breitbart

1499
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
And then exaggerated by Alex

1500
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
And in reality

1501
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703
I think that there's probably

1502
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
Blade

1503
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,031
Bigotry finest

1504
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,871
So this article is referencing a document that hasn't been read

1505
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
By anybody

1506
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,687
That has alleged contents

1507
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:23,967
And then

1508
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,271
The article itself immediately goes

1509
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
What's the polling

1510
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,063
Suggesting that

1511
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,391
In reality this is just where Muslims are

1512
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,671
And

1513
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,255
I'm not I'm not certain I mean like I don't know what this Secret

1514
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,583
Classified document says

1515
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
What is the article when talking about these

1516
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,495
Areas that are quote-unquote held by islamist

1517
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:50,847
It then immediately talks about this Union of French Muslim Democrats

1518
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,663
So it seems to me that there might be some sort of

1519
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
The connection between the definition of

1520
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,991
Held by islamist

1521
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,831
The USMD pulls well in this play

1522
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,159
Play connection from the text

1523
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,231
I'm not entirely sure I don't trust Breitbart or Alex

1524
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,279
To spend on these sorts of issues

1525
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
So whatever

1526
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,839
I think this is just islamophobe

1527
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,863
Yeah that sounds just

1528
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,423
Be because

1529
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,959
From here Alex just descended

1530
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,495
Complete nonsense about Muslim

1531
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,567
And I had Muslims repeatedly come up

1532
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,895
When I was in d.c.

1533
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
Listen

1534
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
We're going to conquer you just lie

1535
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
Like we talked her parents

1536
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:37,183
On our way to start a conversation

1537
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,023
Add

1538
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
And

1539
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
I guess this later but

1540
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,727
Story

1541
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:53,567
But I got a group of Muslim covertly messing with my wife

1542
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
When I took round trip

1543
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
What

1544
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,151
Mess with me

1545
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
I would mess with her

1546
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
Crazy

1547
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,319
But I was a really and that I caught one of them doing it and hotel

1548
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:09,439
Doing what happened gaslighting

1549
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:14,047
It's just incredible that I know how to not go frontal up against the man they mess with your woman

1550
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,631
And it's really just it's disgusting for us

1551
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:20,191
I don't believe a single part of the story and here's why

1552
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,007
41 Alex seems to be trying to come up with a story

1553
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,543
Here in his brain isn't so fat

1554
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,847
Lastly just randomly cobbling together some b*******

1555
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,455
Second he has no video of this yet his team was surrounding him with cameras the whole time he was in

1556
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
DC

1557
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,623
Third he says that Muslims are messing with his wife because they know not to go frontal and mess with the man but not 10 seconds

1558
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:41,183
Prior you just said that Muslims repeatedly threatened

1559
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,463
The Conqueror it while he was in

1560
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:43,231
DC

1561
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
What is it

1562
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,303
Are they so bold that they openly threatened

1563
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
To conquer the big strong Alex

1564
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,863
Or are they so slow

1565
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,167
Ricky that they dare not confront big strong Alex

1566
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,447
But instead mess with his wife

1567
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
This is so incoherent

1568
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
But it makes total sense

1569
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:59,103
If you look at it as just random bulshit Alex's making up to

1570
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
To demonize Muslims

1571
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
Cuz he

1572
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,479
Whatever it is they're doing it

1573
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,575
So I'm going to say they're doing this in this bad not say they're doing that and

1574
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,879
Bad and it's all bad Dan

1575
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,207
Reissue though is that

1576
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:16,511
Like Islam is intolerant

1577
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,839
Brave Christianity really don't think that's where we're going

1578
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,655
This clip is really stupid

1579
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
We need

1580
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:26,495
Christianity

1581
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,311
Are the answer unified Humanity together

1582
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,871
Appreciate

1583
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
Islam is not

1584
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,271
By making it the world religion everyone

1585
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,063
Globalism shows

1586
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,415
The future

1587
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
A weird globalist

1588
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,255
Secular system

1589
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
Is

1590
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Islam

1591
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,631
It will be able to persecute whoever it wants

1592
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,495
And the Beast the same time

1593
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:01,823
Everything was Satan is a fraud and a contradiction

1594
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
As you can see the whole thing

1595
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,455
Clearly clearly interview

1596
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Really

1597
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,783
The Beast of the horror rides

1598
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,855
That's why the vatican's converted to Islam in

1599
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
Remove

1600
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,927
The Catholics are rejecting

1601
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:20,511
Is a longer Catholicism that is in Rome

1602
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,303
Idiots 100%

1603
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,095
Satanic religion

1604
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,143
Captured by the devil

1605
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,079
Is a big get for Islam woowcool poker

1606
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,359
Is like a baby priest

1607
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:41,759
Good f****** he's like well it turns out you're a line with his love now realize that the Vatican and converted to Islam

1608
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,039
That's that is a

1609
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:45,599
The big guy

1610
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:49,183
Tom Cruise and Scientology level get right there so dumb

1611
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
So dumb

1612
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:56,607
I mean all Alex is really expressing his basically he wants his weird version of Christianity to theocracy

1613
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
Globally

1614
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:04,031
So great what we need to unite humanity is my weirdo Christian today because that's so taller

1615
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,079
That it will absolutely

1616
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,127
Crush Islam if I didn't cut

1617
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,919
Intolerant

1618
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
One person who

1619
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
Subscribe to Alex's religion and that's a lie

1620
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:16,063
There's one word I would use to describe him

1621
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:18,623
Taller taller

1622
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,903
Just one of them like a

1623
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
Beacon Thunder standings

1624
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,743
And unity and Oneness

1625
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
It's at

1626
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,863
So amazing to me how intolerant everybody is and thank goodness for Alex

1627
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,447
Pointed out to us in a very vicious and racist play total

1628
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:37,823
It's amazing how intolerant everybody is get rid of them and smash them

1629
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
Kaitlyn from the Earth

1630
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:40,127
Cuz they're so intolerant

1631
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,455
So he's descended into like a pretty stupid

1632
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,735
Islamophobic

1633
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:49,087
Chunk of his show right after he came back from break saying that you

1634
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,367
Super angry

1635
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
And

1636
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,439
Are you saying those two things may be related

1637
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,463
Feels like it

1638
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,767
Okay I said I'll get to all the sudden I have

1639
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
I'm just angry right now

1640
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,911
Absolutely angry

1641
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,895
Coveranything

1642
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
Stop it

1643
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,991
Just seem like

1644
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:18,271
If you save this

1645
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,039
Often enough

1646
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,111
If you say often enough associate

1647
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
Then you should buy now

1648
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,927
Have a strategy to

1649
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:31,327
I often feel like there's too much going on in the world and it's kind of overwhelming

1650
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,423
I kind of deal with that especially someone who has a show and put out a product

1651
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
Is that I just have to make peace

1652
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
With the fact that we

1653
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,799
Can't cover everything that's important right sucks

1654
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:46,943
Because there is a lot of stuff that's going on in the world that does deserve attention sure that I feel like other shows are probably

1655
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:48,991
Far more capable of doing that

1656
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,527
Can I take a narrow Focus

1657
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:53,599
And I really only cover the stuff that Alex brings up

1658
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
And that allows me

1659
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:59,231
To actually cover thing alright so you said supposed to be

1660
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,279
Deeply deeply overwhelmed by

1661
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:02,047
50000

1662
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,583
The stories that are going on in the world

1663
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:07,423
All I can do is really like well Alex brought this up so here we go

1664
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,447
Oh hey

1665
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,751
Is there a patent for this

1666
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,799
Coronavirus thing

1667
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:16,895
I know this is a dumb qanon weirdo tweeted about this and it's a chicken vaccine

1668
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
We're able to cover it

1669
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,575
I would imagine what I showed be if you just open it up top with just

1670
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,903
Alex said just too much for us to cover today

1671
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:33,023
He just said too much for us to cover so let's bulshit for the first half hour 45 minutes

1672
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,583
Maybe we'll get to something you said I have

1673
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:39,423
7000 clip stacked up in my iTunes

1674
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,823
Next hour in the next hour I'm going to go to 10 Clips or 10 clips

1675
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
But

1676
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,919
You got to fight you got to fight back against a dude

1677
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Do something

1678
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Can I drink

1679
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,551
Part of that is because he knows how flimsy all of the

1680
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,879
The thousand of new news stories that he needs to cover all that

1681
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:01,183
Like you can't get in any greater depth

1682
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:05,023
On that vaccine story because he knows that is soon as he does

1683
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
It becomes clear the visit

1684
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,631
He can't get in any greater depth about his

1685
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
Complaints about the impeachment because it

1686
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
If he does

1687
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,007
He then has to address the fact that this is the Democrats opening

1688
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:25,503
His lawyer is grandstanding whenever he says is he taking in any greater depth about how

1689
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,087
Owen is being singularly persecuted because if he does it opens up

1690
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,415
The possibility of recognizing when people do get

1691
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
For this sort of thing

1692
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,511
You can't get into a greater depth about the no-go zones in

1693
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,535
In France because

1694
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,839
He does this primary source that is

1695
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
We're going back

1696
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:41,375
Doesn't

1697
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,167
Necessarily prove what he's talkin

1698
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,191
You can't

1699
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,751
He has to get overwhelmed by the amount of news

1700
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,311
Because all he can deal with his this surf

1701
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:52,895
Doll that it and that is overwhelming and I feel bad for him

1702
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:53,919
I don't

1703
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
I mean what he could really do is

1704
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Instead of having too much

1705
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,575
He could take a few subjects

1706
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,879
And really make up some good b*******

1707
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,927
You're not you would have done that

1708
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:08,511
15 years ago probably but he's old

1709
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,839
He's tired and he's not good at this I guess I guess he's just trying to

1710
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
To kill a little bit

1711
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:13,887
Time is

1712
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:16,447
Because you wait enough time

1713
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:18,239
And you get to do stuff like this

1714
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,799
So you come here legally and then you're producing

1715
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,551
Immigration

1716
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,831
Play John

1717
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
I don't break

1718
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:41,023
Didn't plug wants to shower we're not bringing in really any money right now we got

1719
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,303
Two big sales running

1720
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:47,935
I really need you to support us and get products you already needed to tell them when to just take action if you see him forward busting our butt

1721
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,471
Killsometime get to a pimp

1722
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
Get

1723
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,967
So ever that's what I'm asking for some money discussion of like

1724
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:05,855
Illegal undocumented

1725
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,671
So Alex's wrestling when he gets back for

1726
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,951
From commercial about Heather

1727
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:12,255
Maybe said he was going to take

1728
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,583
Calls or talk about news but he hasn't done any of it

1729
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:21,983
Make calls today but I forgot mine on the news here

1730
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,383
Water breaking news

1731
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:34,783
Also the latest on the virus their hyping up he's really this Mega deadly threat

1732
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,879
Eby

1733
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
These dump

1734
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,303
Could be a threat but there's more information that's needed to assess like the realities of it and all that stuff

1735
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
Just if you can't you can't behave

1736
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:51,679
Any issues of like

1737
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
Serious Public Health

1738
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:53,983
It's just

1739
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
It's bad

1740
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:57,311
The Trump and Greta stuff like who cares

1741
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,335
It's like this is just

1742
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,359
This is nonsense

1743
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,407
Looks like Alex is only point is that like

1744
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
She's not

1745
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,967
Complaining about China

1746
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,015
And the issue is that with her app

1747
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,063
Perkasie you'd like through the UN filing

1748
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
Complaint on the behalf of the children of

1749
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
The number of countries

1750
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,671
She can't

1751
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,743
Complain about China they're not signed onto that treaty

1752
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:16,767
RockAuto

1753
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
That kind of

1754
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
Falls apart

1755
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,119
They complained of likewise itchy

1756
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,167
Singling out China as opposed to

1757
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,959
These countries that she has listed

1758
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,751
There is no mechanism in place

1759
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,311
Daytona has a sign that read

1760
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Very simple

1761
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,871
Why am I not calling out China

1762
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,407
Because they're not listen

1763
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,687
I'm talkin

1764
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:35,455
To you

1765
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,735
So I'm not going

1766
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
To talk to you about China

1767
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,831
Anybody any f****** good

1768
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,599
It's

1769
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
It's everyday

1770
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:48,511
Just so you know it's all China's fault I'm so mad at China so of course you guys

1771
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,791
Should do everything

1772
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:50,815
So Alex

1773
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,119
He has

1774
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,399
To address something

1775
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Because

1776
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:58,239
It's something that Tucker Carlson talked about on his show

1777
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:02,335
Otherwise I would probably just f****** ignore because you didn't want any part of

1778
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,127
Brought it to the

1779
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
The mainstream

1780
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
Consciousness

1781
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,223
And that is the fact that Trump

1782
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,015
And his Environmental

1783
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:10,783
Turn agency

1784
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,087
Are rolling back restrictions and regulations

1785
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,111
Shinzon atrazine

1786
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,183
Write reports is the chemical that is turning the freaking frogs gay

1787
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,207
Right

1788
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,743
There have been in place

1789
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,767
Restrictions on

1790
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,327
An oversight regulation regulator

1791
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,655
Testing of water pipelines in order

1792
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
To have hard limits

1793
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
It's on what

1794
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,471
Come Out of Africa

1795
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
In any

1796
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,567
I drinking water

1797
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
Right

1798
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:40,223
But Trump is loosening those regulations will have the effect

1799
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
Of leading to more

1800
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:48,671
Prove that I am sure that private entities as always our will

1801
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,207
Going to regulate themselves and

1802
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,255
Keep problem that's not Alex's angle

1803
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,047
Because Tucker Carlson is docked

1804
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,119
About this and Tucker and Alex have a very

1805
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,959
It's a Venn diagram that's a circle

1806
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,495
Although Alex the circle as much

1807
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
Smaller

1808
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,543
Butts

1809
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
V he has to address

1810
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,615
You can't just

1811
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,687
Sweep this under the carpet short and so he has to

1812
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,711
Rationalize

1813
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,295
But yeah there's no perfect way to stop this we just got to take action

1814
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:18,623
A lot of chemicals

1815
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
They don't even the same class as bad as atrazine

1816
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,535
Crump has

1817
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
Lucian.

1818
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
Restrictions on

1819
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,679
Bazine when they've been Crackdown on

1820
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,007
He just saw everything the Democrats will restrict

1821
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Week

1822
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,759
So like I said addressing the chemical it's behind the moment that most

1823
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:49,343
People probably know Alex for the turning the freaking frogs gay rant

1824
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:55,999
Obviously Alex doesn't understand the science behind the effects of atrazine pollution but we've gotten into that in the past

1825
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,023
More important

1826
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,839
Thing here is that you know after seeing is not a chemical that

1827
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
Good for people

1828
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
Go to be exposed to in large quantity

1829
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,959
Not going to turn people gay like Alex mites

1830
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:09,311
Suggesting all the available evidence seems to suggest that he's over blowing the dangers of it

1831
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,127
But I feel like no pollution is good pollution so what are

1832
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,431
All agree that we should regulate the hell out of these

1833
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,967
Pesticides and herbicides

1834
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,247
So they're only use the proper

1835
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
Alex

1836
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
Agree with that

1837
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,319
You shouldn't

1838
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
Is no way to put

1839
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,463
This chemical is a gigantic part of Alex

1840
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
His career

1841
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,279
And now he's gyro King Trump

1842
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:34,143
That is presiding over an EPA that wants to loosen regulations that experts say could increase

1843
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Atrazine

1844
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:37,215
Contamination in water wave by up to 50

1845
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Percent

1846
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:42,079
Another interesting move on the EPA part is that they adjusted the amount of

1847
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
The chemical that's

1848
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,127
Considered safe for human

1849
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
To make easier for pollution

1850
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Contigo en punta

1851
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:53,343
The amount they decided on is taken straight from the primary Factory manufacturer of atrazine

1852
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,623
Syngenta

1853
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,159
The company that makes it

1854
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:58,975
Made a suggestion EPS followed that suggestion

1855
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:03,327
As the EPA just finally admitted to changing its name to

1856
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,095
To be Environmental

1857
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Destruction age

1858
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,887
Environmental

1859
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
This is

1860
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:13,311
Same much like bolsonaro attacking depressed surprise for any

1861
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,176
Of course would thought Trump would sell out the safety and protections enjoyed by all the little p

1862
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:20,224
People in the country to benefit a large busy

1863
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,760
That's what he's into

1864
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
He's made it super

1865
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
Everclear

1866
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
Alex can't ignore this one

1867
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,136
Tucker Carlson talked about it

1868
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,928
And after seeing is Alex's /

1869
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,488
A hero to be doing the opposite of fighting

1870
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,024
Against a well that's a problem

1871
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,352
Trump not further restricting atrazine

1872
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,144
Further implying to Alex's.

1873
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:40,448
He doesn't know or doesn't care about the

1874
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
Does chemical

1875
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,776
Which I guess is the angle Alex is going with

1876
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,824
That seems like a really sad spin

1877
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:51,712
The best Alex can do is say that you have the Democrats are pushing regulations on ton of stuff so Trump

1878
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
Didn't even look into the thing

1879
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,808
They were regulating and just said about on doing all of this

1880
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,344
That's what a child

1881
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
Alex's describing

1882
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
An idiot

1883
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
Being in charge of the country

1884
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
And not for nothing

1885
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,072
Alex is also being very clear that the Democrats were the ones who were doing what he wanted

1886
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,864
Which is to limit atrazine use

1887
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,144
This is true

1888
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
Going back to the food quality protection Act of 1996

1889
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,264
Which Bill Clinton signed into law

1890
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,592
That was about creating safety standards or pesticide

1891
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,384
Particularly aimed at protecting

1892
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,408
Children's Health

1893
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,760
Here we have a chemical that Alex believes is a part of a giant globalist

1894
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:31,392
Attack on the public and it feminizing the Benz of the can of Western Civilization or whatever and what we find

1895
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,416
We find Alex

1896
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:35,232
Does big enemy Bill Clinton signing legislation to restrict

1897
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,280
It is hero Trump

1898
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,328
Pushing to rollback these regulation

1899
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,864
Expose more people to it

1900
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:42,912
And the best Alex can come up with his Dad

1901
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,680
The drop is just

1902
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:47,520
Now he's exposing everyone two dangerous chemicals because the Democrats didn't want him

1903
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:48,800
Who's pathetic

1904
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:53,152
Even at the propagandas this is just the weakest s*** ever yeah

1905
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
This

1906
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,224
The the Trump years and

1907
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
The last

1908
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:58,528
Aubameyang

1909
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
Really

1910
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,344
Changed

1911
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,392
For too long during Obama's years

1912
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
I was I defend

1913
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:08,512
You know like with why did he close down Guantanamo Bay

1914
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:12,608
Well these are the political realities of the time and he's got to spend his Capital this way

1915
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,632
And this

1916
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:15,424
This whole thing with Trump and looking

1917
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,216
Can Alex turning into this f******

1918
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,520
Weak Toady b*******

1919
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,848
I just realized it now there's no defending the president

1920
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,176
F*** him if he's if the president is doing some b*******

1921
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
Then it doesn't matter what

1922
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Team Iran

1923
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,016
F****** get on it

1924
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,808
I'd still on the president

1925
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,112
I think that there I think that there are different

1926
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,440
I think that there's a difference

1927
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Tween recognizing

1928
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,768
Political realities and making excuses

1929
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,304
It's sometimes a gray

1930
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:45,888
Think I think I think that there is sometimes a little bit of

1931
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:49,216
661 half dozen of the other

1932
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,776
You know I understand that but

1933
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:54,080
I don't disagree with the point that you're making

1934
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,104
But I also think

1935
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,128
That

1936
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Take him to the

1937
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,200
Extreme that argument is

1938
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:05,344
An untenable wave

1939
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Lead to a

1940
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,136
Sweetly

1941
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,488
Piranha like infection

1942
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,048
Throwing bricks

1943
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:18,144
F*** you

1944
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,032
I just read that it is a smart idea for us to have a

1945
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,432
Baseline adversarial relationship with our government regardless of whether or not it is the

1946
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,480
We have voted in

1947
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,528
They need to be held to the

1948
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,296
Fire at

1949
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:41,696
All f****** type single moment that adversarial nature needs

1950
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,232
To be tempered with

1951
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
A collaborative

1952
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,304
Spiritual

1953
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,840
It has to be otherwise

1954
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Otherwise

1955
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
It's incredibly out of

1956
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:51,680
Cancel course

1957
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,704
But yeah

1958
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,984
Point point well-taken

1959
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
I still think

1960
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
Even whatever your

1961
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,336
Describing about your path in the time where you were

1962
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,896
Making excuses for Obama has nothing

1963
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:06,784
In relationship with Alex is like

1964
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,088
Really just escaped that

1965
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:09,856
Concept in Thai

1966
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,976
Is the same that you know it

1967
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:17,536
It's revealing how silly it is to go

1968
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
To make it

1969
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,328
Excuses

1970
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,096
At all

1971
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,656
Do you know I'm saying this is where you f******

1972
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:29,056
With his rambling about how it's okay that he's putting this chemical that I'm spent my entire

1973
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,592
Bakery railing ago

1974
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
Into the water it's not okay

1975
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,176
But the reason he's doing it is B

1976
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,200
Because he's just a post

1977
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,992
Everything the Democrats

1978
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,272
So he's

1979
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,064
That's even worse

1980
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,856
That implies

1981
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
Did Trump's decision making process

1982
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,464
Sweetly reactionary and it's completely

1983
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,256
F****** what they want

1984
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,792
And that to me is like

1985
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,352
You're describing then a bad thinking pass

1986
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,144
That leads to decision

1987
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:56,704
That may be right or maybe wrong

1988
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
Process

1989
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,336
And therefore everything is

1990
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,384
Yeah yeah end ended

1991
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,664
It's good that it bad

1992
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,688
Is borne out by

1993
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,760
It does seem like literally everything that Obama did is

1994
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
Is exactly what Trump is trying to untie

1995
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,600
Seems Seems like as a pattern

1996
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,928
But it's important to recognize that address

1997
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:18,976
It's shrinking dick

1998
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,512
There's just no way around

1999
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,096
The last 70 years or so that was in the water

2000
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,656
The genitals this is a

2001
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,936
Uterine

2002
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,544
Development of the

2003
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:38,944
Where males slowly are having their genitals waste away until soon

2004
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,552
Men are going to have genitals the size of a woman's clitoris

2005
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:46,624
In about two generations

2006
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,416
If you like your son's not having a car

2007
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,952
Then you're going to love

2008
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
Trump is getting rid of American Cox and then we got a chicken vaccine and a cop killer

2009
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,192
This is

2010
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:04,288
Is the family show if you like your children having dick

2011
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:09,152
Or whatever boys are weird

2012
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
I looked into a little bit and there are

2013
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,992
Some instances

2014
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:17,344
Is of like genital malformation they can be attributed

2015
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,672
To potentially attributed atrazine exposure

2016
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,976
But what I think Alex has been

2017
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,304
Mistaken because it's not a giant issue that is noted

2018
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,072
From mattress

2019
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
I think he's mixing up

2020
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
Congenital

2021
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:34,240
And genital I think he's mixing up that with the word congenital and thinking it means

2022
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,032
Askew

2023
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
That does not

2024
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,872
Right

2025
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:42,176
This is all it takes to wipe out dicks on to the play

2026
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,480
That's surprising

2027
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,272
So we're in a serious situation

2028
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,552
Alex

2029
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
Besides

2030
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:49,344
Time

2031
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
Send a message

2032
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,440
Trump director the show

2033
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,488
Talk about this

2034
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,768
As well

2035
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,816
Because really it's a message the light off

2036
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:02,144
I got the White House reach out through a lot of people

2037
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
Save-A-Lot

2038
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,472
Legacy auto parts

2039
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,312
Because all the phones are tapped

2040
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,640
Location of myself is down

2041
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,712
The Russian as well

2042
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,064
BFDI but it is edipi

2043
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,600
Juan Capistrano

2044
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,928
They obviously know I'm not a Russian understand what's happening

2045
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
Don't want I don't need

2046
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:31,840
Call me

2047
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,120
I don't need Trump dead

2048
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,448
Have other journals contact me to the present wanted to thank you and

2049
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:38,240
We appreciate you and appreciate what you're doing

2050
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,544
Don't need to be pat on the head like a

2051
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,568
Donald Trump when he calls me

2052
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,616
I need action from the president

2053
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
Bolt action

2054
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,456
We need to get on the offensive

2055
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
We need to indict the Deep state

2056
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,528
We need to indict

2057
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,552
Deptford

2058
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,320
Racketeering

2059
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Surprise

2060
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,880
And that ended ever

2061
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
We have

2062
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,256
The authoritarians are the danger

2063
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
President Trump

2064
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:03,840
What do we want them

2065
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:08,704
2 Generations

2066
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,776
Pomp and Circumstance

2067
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,824
What about the song

2068
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:18,944
That's all I'm asking for

2069
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,016
And I know you're giving this action on so many fronts

2070
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
I'm just simply telling you

2071
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
What people want

2072
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
What's right

2073
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,136
But we need to see happen

2074
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,696
Who can take action

2075
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:40,704
The fusion of the Republic 1776 and real Christianity

2076
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
Not fake

2077
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:46,592
In-your-face Pharisees a holier-than-thou stuff is I love God

2078
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,664
Take action and I know you do too let's do it together

2079
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:56,832
Buying products infowarsstore.com and sign up for auto-ship learning support

2080
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,208
Now

2081
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:09,376
This raises a really interesting question and that is was that add pivot part of the message to the White House I'm pretty sure it

2082
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:14,496
Cuz if you do it in the same way that like when you're praying it doesn't end until you say Amen

2083
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
He didn't even put

2084
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:20,896
You like it that still seems like a

2085
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:23,200
Message to the White House

2086
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,016
You need to get our great products

2087
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:29,088
While you're wearing a diaper nothing keeps you from getting your pants

2088
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:29,856
That's quite like lights

2089
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:34,464
How many distillate also does raise the question of like why isn't Trump giving them a bunch of money

2090
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,280
But he clearly has no

2091
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,304
Has never

2092
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
Ever

2093
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:42,912
Ever given anyone money right but to the to the

2094
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,240
Like the viewers who believe in everything Alex is saying

2095
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,544
Obviously Trump is corrupt

2096
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,312
The shed

2097
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:54,432
He would not have any problem with like R8 Alex and you two million dollars in your job

2098
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,736
You get the Ukraine military

2099
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
Through some sort of busy

2100
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:03,136
Hiding money

2101
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,160
I did

2102
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:06,720
And I think that actually is kind of like

2103
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:10,304
The way that activity structured it really does kind of draw tents

2104
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
To the fact that I

2105
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
Yeah

2106
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:14,144
Wait

2107
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,936
I'm not a right-wing billionaires give

2108
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:16,704
Tons of money

2109
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,032
Why would you ever have problems

2110
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,824
Money-wise

2111
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,432
Billionaires are notorious for their loyalty

2112
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:33,088
Billionaires are noted for when you stop being used

2113
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
Spell for them

2114
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,160
For them taken care of you for the work that you

2115
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,464
They may be much maybe

2116
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,256
Sometime around

2117
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:42,560
Don't know

2118
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:46,144
So earlier Alex was talking about about the deck

2119
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,448
And receive

2120
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,984
Trump is getting rid of America

2121
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,872
Alex Jones says

2122
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,968
Trump is shrinking American Dick's put that on right wing watch

2123
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,504
Now

2124
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:08,928
But I was talked a little bit more about this afternoon situation I think you can really see like the mechanic

2125
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,208
Behind what he's doing

2126
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:10,976
In this clip

2127
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,792
Apologize to Corn farmers and tell him that

2128
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
You noticed it for

2129
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,912
Farmers Mills areas have a lot of cancers lot of problems and

2130
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,704
Your daughter can't have children

2131
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
Anderson

2132
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,032
Can't have sex if they don't have genitals

2133
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,408
Lightly the detachable Donuts

2134
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Get reported

2135
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
But you know what

2136
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Wonder why

2137
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,368
He had a good side job

2138
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:46,048
Concorso scary bunny

2139
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,400
Don't do this

2140
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,680
Still not good for your liver

2141
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,240
Bioaccumulate

2142
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,520
In the corn

2143
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,568
The water table and it stays there

2144
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,616
4 years

2145
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,664
The same time

2146
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
You got well water 11 anywhere near farming

2147
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,320
You are

2148
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,856
Insane

2149
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,392
If you don't use

2150
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,928
Gravity

2151
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:14,976
That takes out

2152
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:19,840
All the bad chemicals in the highest rated

2153
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:22,144
Filtration system to find out there

2154
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,800
This is a perfect example

2155
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:34,176
Situation

2156
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:37,504
The reason for this is that he doesn't appear to be saying

2157
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,272
Accurate thing

2158
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:42,368
In order to make his farmer listeners scared of their water

2159
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:43,904
Then offering them a solution

2160
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,672
For a price

2161
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,488
All the stuff Alex seems to be getting

2162
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,048
About Dick shrinking like I said I think

2163
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:53,632
I had to gansett to not understanding what congenital mean

2164
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,400
Yeah that sounds

2165
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Think that's

2166
01:32:55,680 --> 01:33:01,568
I think that's what's going on you want your kid to have a dick well then you better get this

2167
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,152
Walking water filter I think you just as misunderstanding words in the rain

2168
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:05,920
Anything about them

2169
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:12,320
From the data I've seen from like the NIH there are some very small indications of possible genital deformations can I

2170
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,880
Make a diet Racine exposure but it's near the top

2171
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:19,488
Concern related issues for example are far more common

2172
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,792
The big giveaway that I was just talking

2173
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:24,608
Come sit here is that he says that after seeing bioaccumulate

2174
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,400
This is not true

2175
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:27,680
According to the age

2176
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,704
Toxic Subs

2177
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:29,984
Disease registry

2178
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,288
3A division of the Department of Health and Human Services

2179
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,896
If Youmans taken atrazine it is quote primarily excreted in the urine

2180
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
And quote

2181
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:44,320
Some atrazine and its metabolites might enter the organs or fat tissue but they do not buy with cumulate or buildup

2182
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,344
Or remain in the cube

2183
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,136
Body so not only do they not

2184
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,464
Call man

2185
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
Not even like a little bit

2186
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,536
So that's within the human

2187
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,304
Body though

2188
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072
What about

2189
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,864
The corn that Alex is talking about

2190
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,936
From the same report by the 80s

2191
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,752
HDR in their section about atrazine in the environment

2192
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,520
Quote

2193
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,312
Atrazine does not tend to buy a week

2194
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,104
Another report

2195
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,664
Put up by the 80s.

2196
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,456
Doesn't buy to accumulate in fish

2197
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,480
End quote little

2198
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:15,296
Food chain accumulation of atrazine has been observed

2199
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,344
It does not tend to bioaccumulate

2200
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:22,976
A 2014 paper put out by the Journal of environmental science and pollution research

2201
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:23,744
Compromise

2202
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,024
Of identifying a person

2203
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,560
Circular green microalgae

2204
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:30,912
They have the trait of actually accumulating atrazine it and then biodegrading it

2205
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,936
Within itself

2206
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,728
This is interesting

2207
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:38,080
Does most plants don't behave that way and this would be a way of

2208
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
Cleaning up

2209
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Places that have

2210
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:42,176
Atrazine pollution

2211
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:45,248
Atrazine is a chemical with a fairly short half-life

2212
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,576
Between 14 and 109 days in the

2213
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,928
When it says the human body is only detectable for approximately Forty-Eight Hours

2214
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,464
It's flushed out really quick

2215
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:58,560
None of this is to say that it's perfectly safe for doesn't still pose a risk for

2216
01:34:58,816 --> 01:34:59,584
Particularly

2217
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:04,448
In utero Shrek the story that Alex is telling us specifically not true

2218
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,032
Atrazine is a chemical that researchers have found is not prone

2219
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,056
Bioaccumulation

2220
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,592
He's saying that it is

2221
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:11,360
Or as I call

2222
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
Lion

2223
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,408
Because it creates a

2224
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,688
Problem for his list

2225
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,480
These listeners

2226
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,760
Well then have a reaction

2227
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:19,552
I'm getting scared of their water

2228
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,856
It's going to make their sons have no text

2229
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,392
And there is Alex

2230
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,672
The perfect solution

2231
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,208
This giant water filter

2232
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
City sells

2233
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,072
Alex talks all the time about the globalist using the hegelian dialectic

2234
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,864
Where they create a problem

2235
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,424
To cause a reaction in the public so they could be there with

2236
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,704
The solution to the problem

2237
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,240
They themselves have created

2238
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:39,776
It turns out

2239
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:43,104
It is also a very apt way to describe Alex's own

2240
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
Miss Molly

2241
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
Well I mean if they're doing it

2242
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,224
I don't know if they are

2243
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:54,624
All the time now

2244
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,952
Yes in the context of Alex's own sales

2245
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:02,048
Those practices it seems like all liquor

2246
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,096
Anyway

2247
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,656
Sew-ins next clip

2248
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:09,472
Alex says talking about having a breakthrough

2249
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
I'm quick when

2250
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,312
Right this is filter even filter out

2251
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,384
The chemical table

2252
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
You think so

2253
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:24,064
Probably won't I think that I looked into it quite a while back but it seems like the filters

2254
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,856
Play really good

2255
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:29,184
It's a third party that makes me feel better

2256
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,768
I know Alex isn't f****** backs basket weaving

2257
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,072
Everything to about this is like these are

2258
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
Big f****** purchase

2259
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,424
If he's talking about a farmer getting one of these

2260
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:44,800
Like these water filters

2261
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:48,128
Swinging for the fences in terms of like

2262
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:50,688
Big Ticket items to get big ticket items up

2263
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
The Shelf

2264
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:54,784
Imagine they take up a lot of space in the warehouse

2265
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:57,088
These are so I can't get anymore

2266
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,208
Please art on the Shelf is it as he gets a cut for any sales that the filter bli

2267
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,280
So Alex gets talking about the impeachment

2268
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:08,096
Brighten air brakes are about why the impeached

2269
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,120
It's happening

2270
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,144
If you listen carefully

2271
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
You might miss it

2272
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
If you're not paying attention

2273
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,520
Little subtle plug for his coffee

2274
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,056
Something really hit me

2275
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,104
During the break I was

2276
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:26,272
Back there in the coffee room I've been busier than that little bit more today cuz I do mostly positive town I'm exhausted

2277
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,832
You just have maybe two cups by now my life

2278
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,392
Number for this wave America Coffee

2279
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,816
Libertarian I was so delicious

2280
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,096
Everybody

2281
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,192
Very subtle

2282
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:47,264
Watching Adam Schiff

2283
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,568
Bed bug

2284
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,104
Obstacle course

2285
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,160
The grass is green next

2286
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:10,816
All the reasons they keep nice impeachment going and the fake investigations going all of it is

2287
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,400
To change the subject

2288
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:19,264
For what losers they are in other cities are collapsing and how corrupt they are now able they are

2289
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,872
All the time and energy to be the center of attention

2290
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:33,344
Is there racing to dig up more fake dirt

2291
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Okay

2292
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,720
But the length of the trial is already

2293
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,000
Right

2294
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,816
I guess that means we're done

2295
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,840
I don't care

2296
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:47,424
I don't I don't

2297
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,472
But like these aren't even do thoughts

2298
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:55,360
He's talking about this is a breakthrough these pigs out all the time

2299
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,128
Fourth cup

2300
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,736
That's almost as much as I drink

2301
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,320
So this is our last clip and it's Alex talking about the impeached

2302
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,600
Spencer Moore

2303
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,368
I really

2304
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,160
Thought when I

2305
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,464
Came in on this episode

2306
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,000
I really thought there was a

2307
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,536
A good likelihood that

2308
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
This was going

2309
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,328
To be a real break

2310
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:20,448
Like a real freak out his hero is actually having the trial in the Senate

2311
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,984
For impeachment

2312
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Right but then

2313
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,336
When he said this I realize like

2314
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:30,176
Course he's not going he's not even going to talk about it at the most part

2315
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,992
Oxygen out of the room

2316
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,880
The impeachment very much with the trial

2317
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,928
Chapter

2318
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
I will cover that

2319
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,608
So I'll just go

2320
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:53,984
Can I cover the Republicans

2321
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:58,080
Pretend all the others

2322
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,616
Advance

2323
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,408
To know that there are going to be

2324
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Very

2325
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,016
Very biased coverage of my show

2326
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:10,368
Village of Andy Daly podcast pilot project whatever is left

2327
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:13,184
Whatever he's doing the

2328
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
Character it is just like

2329
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:20,608
The prosecution should be allowed to say anything here's how the trial works I get

2330
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:25,728
Get my defense you guys say I didn't do it and then we go home what do you mean the prosecution prosecution

2331
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:28,800
Miscarriage of Justice even have the prosecution

2332
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,592
Why they allowed to talk

2333
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:31,360
Yeah

2334
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,896
Yep yep

2335
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:37,760
I thought work so anyway I don't expect it to be very fertile pastures for us

2336
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
What's 2

2337
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,576
Cover Alex is coverage of the

2338
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,368
The impeachment so

2339
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,928
That might be a might free up some time and

2340
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,720
Make it much less of a priority

2341
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,512
Talk about the present day

2342
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:50,560
Also on the other hand it makes

2343
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
It would be

2344
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,912
It's almost even more damning just to listen to the Republican debate

2345
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,960
Just because of what could they

2346
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,496
Possibly have other than

2347
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:02,592
It's a deep state conspiracy

2348
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:06,688
It's the cover basically all I hear is him just advocating any kind of

2349
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:10,016
Responsibility to address points that are brought up by non

2350
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
Nunez

2351
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,184
Trump's lawyers Jim Jordan

2352
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
Pipes

2353
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,792
Doesn't want it doesn't want to address any kind of thing that's

2354
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,816
It's not already

2355
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,144
Implicitly and intrinsically on his side

2356
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,168
So great

2357
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,448
Enjoy

2358
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:30,752
What's the definition of being in a bubble

2359
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,288
Socrate Alex have fun with

2360
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,056
That it's a good thing

2361
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,128
The most

2362
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,688
Important thing here is that I enjoyed

2363
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,712
Is the

2364
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,992
The Narrative about this

2365
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:45,088
Institute with the chicken vaccine

2366
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,160
I can't that it turned out to be a chicken vaccine

2367
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,184
And it's just

2368
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,976
I can't stress enough like these

2369
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,280
Did Alex present

2370
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,304
As narratives

2371
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,584
Almost always

2372
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:59,168
Without fail you just look into them a little bit more

2373
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:04,032
And you end up finding that he knows nothing about what he's talkin about it's all just b*******

2374
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,616
Like this and the Texas said domestic terrorism threat

2375
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,664
Not like they're just to prime example

2376
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
Of

2377
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,992
Him trying to make hay out of b*******

2378
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:16,064
Laughable this is just sad s***

2379
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,344
The how anybody

2380
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,392
Confused them or ever

2381
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,672
Confuse them with a

2382
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Actual journalist

2383
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,512
Mind-boggling because they're fun

2384
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
Does on people

2385
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,048

2386
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,328
It will ya

2387
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:33,984
Get you in with the yelling about gay frogs or laughing before you know I do like

2388
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:39,616
Maybe wrong about everything it's literally not possible to be wrong about everything I do

2389
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,408
Right it turns out it is

2390
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,456
Is literally possible to be wrong about every

2391
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,480
Does he know why

2392
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:49,856
