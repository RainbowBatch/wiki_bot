1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:05,120
Everybody welcome back to knowledge fight I'm the voice you will hear shortly

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,424
Is my co-host into your friend

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,752
This is our final AR-15 final installment

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:14,592
In our ongoing coverage of Alex Jones is very very stupid

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,872
Sophomoric

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:16,896
Amateurish

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,432
You come up with a number of other

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,832
Not very complimentary words to describe documentary

9
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,440
This is the end this is the final chunk

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,280
You may note that at this point Jordan and I are a little buzzed

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
A little

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,632
Fed up with the b*******

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,776
There's another there's an endurance aspect that comes to into this when you're 7 hours into stopping and starting a

14
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,616
Very bad documentary to point out

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
Also this isn't true

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,784
It gets it weighs on you and you may sense that a little bit here in this final installment

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,160
But not a good stuff to look forward to there's a couple of my favorite thing certainly

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,512
How's that we run into and

19
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,816
The final shot of this documentary

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,352
Is in hindsight

21
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
Incredibly funny piece of History

22
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Or Alex Jones

23
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
I want I want to give it away

24
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,056
Anyway I hope you guys enjoyed this

25
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Really

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Conclusion

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,408
To our coverage of Alex Jones

28
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,200
The game

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,832
Oh oh so I'm not going to come back at the end of the episode because the you know the episode has a natural end

30
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488

Thanks to everyone who made this possible

37
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,272
And I apologize that there's still two more hours left to this

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
Alright

00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,064
Enjoy

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
Holding

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,000
Alex

42
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:09,024
So cute

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
He's kind of worried about the ecosystem

44
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,608
The more than he is about Humanity

45
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,752
F*** your feeling feeling

46
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
F*** your feelings bro

47
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,664
Jersey Shore Ben Shapiro

48
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,272
We're on our way

49
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Just trying to make him

50
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Immigration

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,584
Because they have a police car.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Probably said it but who gives

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Much of its Nazi baggage

54
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
As usual

55
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Most people don't

56
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Like you'd want to breathe clean air

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,528
Have a good one

58
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
And parlay it

59
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
The support

60
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
Global policy

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
Let's further destabilize the third world

62
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,752
Okay

63
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
He

64
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
Flashes up on screen here

65
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
The Sierra Club and the nature cat

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Conservancy

67
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,016
Phony conservation

68
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
Groups of the largest private landowners in the world

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Funny

70
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280
The owner of Charter Communications

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
Coming in at number 1

72
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
Germs

73
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
The private landowners

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,888
In the United States

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,288
That's the number one is the guy from Charter

76
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Charter Communications

77
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
Like I needed another reason to want the guy from

78
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,272
My boy 1 billion Acres

79
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
The 90s

80
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,119
Still Turner these conservation groups that are listed aren't even in the top hundred of the private

81
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:27,519
Who was all billionaires

82
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
1.9 billion Acres of

83
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Usable land

84
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Lower 48

85
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,943
Of that 139 million of those acres are considered to be

86
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
Developed Urban or rural residential

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,551
349 million acres are

88
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
747 million Acres Ark

89
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,903
Consider forests

90
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,231
788 million are range or pasture land

91
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
Where animals can graze

92
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,887
Alex plates an article gear that asserts that nature conservation Conservancy there

93
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Million preserve Acres announced

94
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,727
2 million

95
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
But that does not

96
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
Tell the whole story

97
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
For instance

98
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:05,663
15.5 / 15500 of the Acres that they own

99
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
Are part of Palmyra atoll a series of acres and Lagoon

100
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
1000 miles south

101
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Hawaii

102
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
Don't really seem like he's talking about in terms of

103
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
Controlling America

104
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
You own something out in the water

105
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:24,095
William reiff land

106
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Yeah I would want to control that at all

107
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
It doesn't really seem like what he's talkin about

108
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Bunches

109
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
The bought this thing called

110
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,943
100 thousands of Acres that they own

111
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,527
Finish up the land was required for the Great Sand Dunes National Park

112
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,807
Plus they have offices

113
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,343
30 different countries

114
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
So there's no reason

115
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
Think of it all

116
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
Conserve

117
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
Are in the United

118
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,487
States

119
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,559
What's really is

120
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,095
Are in the job of

121
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
Conserving

122
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,983
Yeah that's kind of what they do I'm sorry I think I said that John Malone and Ted Turner

123
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Billions you did the million

124
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
I apologize to catch myself there

125
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,151
Up to when you look at those

126
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Still way too much

127
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Scarier

128
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,743
How do you know how big

129
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,167
Response to Eddie

130
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
How big is that

131
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:38,591
Can you take it outside of America and go to private landowners in the world

132
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,455
It becomes a really interesting because Alex is even more

133
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:46,271
The largest

134
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,807
Kevin King Abdullah

135
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
He comes in at number two with 547 million acre

136
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,231
Number one

137
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
The Queen of England come-and-get-it 6.6 billion Acres Way far above everybody else

138
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:08,287
Because the monarch of England retained the royal title over the entire British Commonwealth

139
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Sochi technically own

140
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
The entirety of all British lamb

141
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,735
Okay it's the same thing with talk about Edward the 8th

142
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,319
Technically being the king of the Roman British Church

143
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,087
Britain

144
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,207
I get where I get what you put up with his formalities

145
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
You got to get her name off that s***

146
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
Drop it off

147
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:38,751
Don't leave it we all know that now but there's

148
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,799
People don't get her name off the lease

149
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
What if she's late on her bills

150
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
The pope is number 3 because you technically owns all land owned by the Catholic Church + Vatican City

151
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,927
About 177 million Acres worldwide

152
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
King

153
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,255
Different countries

154
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:05,887
I really think about like a authoritarian countries like Russia and China technically the heads of state

155
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,191
All of the land

156
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
Rights are all the stuff these people like so when you start to look at it

157
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,383
Nothing

158
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
What you really see when you start to talk

159
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
About

160
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
How much land these individual

161
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,087
People own

162
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
And how silly it is for them

163
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
You start to realize well

164
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
People can't really own land

165
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
It's like who owns land

166
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
Like what are you doing with it

167
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
In Russia

168
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
You are all of Russia

169
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Right

170
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Peoples

171
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
What are you doing with it

172
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
People playing pool

173
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,895
The real England take the Queen off the lease

174
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
Do it

175
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,991
Libra on the money

176
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:55,807
She's cute

177
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,879
That can't be

178
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
Population

179
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
True

180
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,679
U.s. military dumps millions of gallons of nerve gas

181
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
On the east coast of the US

182
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
They don't say a word

183
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,383
Thousands of companies

184
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,455
Should I worry about chimeras animal

185
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:34,207
How do we get to chimeras we were women allowed to vote he's pissed off that these fake cancer

186
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Service design

187
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Conservation groups

188
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:41,119
I'm mad and there is being released into the wild

189
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:45,215
He had legitimately no Citation for Hannah

190
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
Chimeras being released into the wild

191
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Even for our show

192
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,383
With our history

193
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,735
To go from a living hold on let me start it again

194
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
This is about Bilderberg

195
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
Very got to do about Texas roads

196
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
No it's

197
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
No cuz first it was about World War II

198
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
But I guess up

199
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Railroad

200
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,935
I'll enroll in China population control

201
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
And then I got mad

202
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Spider-Girl

203
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
AR

204
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,199
I get the sense within which Theory

205
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,759
But I felt like

206
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,343
We spent the good first hour and 25 minutes on the first two

207
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,367
Bilderberg

208
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,391
Creepy roads

209
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,927
Don't worry and now

210
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Mirror

211
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:45,375
We're heading around the final Corner we're still close to home

212
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,703
But yeah

213
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,775
Being released into the wild true

214
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:55,359
Turn mic that you can buy

215
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,967
Something I want to tell you something Jordan

216
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
He's going to leave

217
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,855
Cheesecake

218
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,975
Do you ever see likes to come together in the end of Comedy Central

219
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
What is this guy talking about

220
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
This guy is brilliant altogether

221
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,119
That's what he's about to

222
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
He's not going to do that

223
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,495
Because I've seen other people try to do that

224
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
Far more often

225
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,591
The end of this

226
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Is so f****** funny

227
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,455
I keep building it up it's going to be a disappointment

228
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,735
But I love the end of

229
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
This documentary

230
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,807
Speed at which we're going we're going

231
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:36,575
See that ended

232
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
About 2 weeks

233
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
Large environmental organizations

234
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
The corporate

235
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Of the planet

236
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:55,007
Intensify

237
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,847
Hysteria

238
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,199
2007

239
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Hell yeah organizing principle

240
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
As the planets new religion

241
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:16,255
First of all the planets

242
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,279
Nature is

243
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Not a new real

244
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,327
Anyway

245
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
Goes back probably

246
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Probably is the oldest

247
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,167
So old

248
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
Also I'll never forget how disappointed I was when

249
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Watching this Live Earth cons

250
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
The middle of Athens

251
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,943
I like I just got done rocking to somebody I don't know who it was

252
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
UB40

253
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Comes out

254
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:39,807
What

255
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,159
UB40

256
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,303
Alright

257
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
When Metallica came out

258
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,423
Forgot to mention this immediately followed by

259
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
Wizard

260
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:02,591
S*** the ones you did I'm blue Eiffel 65

261
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
BMO

262
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Metallica came out in James Hetfield

263
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
Lead singer

264
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,231
Comes out

265
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Cuz it went to another country

266
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,583
A bunch of country

267
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,607
E-40 did like

268
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
3 songs

269
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,423
There's too many for UB40

270
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
The red red wine that might be it right

271
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Don't know if this is the order of it but then the other thing I remember is Metallica

272
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Metallica gets on

273
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
Before they can even play a note

274
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
For do that song

275
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,463
Make some noise

276
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Paw Patrol

277
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
So like

278
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:58,399
Your heart's in the right place at failed so fake Rebellion

279
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
Limited

280
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Oh I don't even

281
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
AFI

282
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
That's all

283
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,503
Anyway

284
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
A Fire Inside

285
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Anyway

286
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Emoji

287
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
I think so I don't know

288
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,871
They claim

289
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
What's killing the Earth

290
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Adult

291
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
Countries across the world

292
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,743
Marc's

293
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
And raising taxes on

294
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Electricity

295
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
It is a scientific fact

296
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
But the shot

297
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
Scientific fact

298
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Large

299
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,247
Consensus that it's greenhouse gases

300
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
Believe

301
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,951
That the car going on in that

302
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,231
All of it is a hoax

303
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,303
Is because he really miss understands

304
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,423
Two emails got hacked

305
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,703
From the climate research

306
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,335
And they were all taking everybody

307
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,919
It was super taken out of

308
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,599
Also I mean

309
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,183
Do you want to talk about that a little bit so I don't have to read this paragraph

310
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Has been reading f****** paragraphs at you and I feel very guilty

311
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
Know if I remember it cuz it cuz I remember my my dad was

312
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
My dad my older brother were all up in this

313
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,271
If you read the climate emails it actually shows

314
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,855
The whole time that we were actually to Cooling.

315
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255
And all these grafter bullshittin

316
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,815
And then of course 6 months later ever

317
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
Nobody forgets about it until you start

318
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,471
Talk about it

319
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,751
Climate

320
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
He's always been

321
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
The same

322
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,615
They took a bunch of

323
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Text messages with the

324
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Hey

325
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,319
Trump's a f****** lunatic in the like

326
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,903
It's okay to say what is true

327
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Via the big email

328
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,255
The big email jerks

329
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,071
It was an email from the

330
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,887
The climate Research Unit head Phil Jones

331
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,959
Hide the decline

332
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,495
Private Client became

333
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
Buzzword

334
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,335
As if this climate scientists were flippantly talkin

335
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
Who's co-workers about cheating data

336
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
The reality is what he's talking about

337
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
Was a reference

338
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,087
Just something that is well-known part of

339
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
In scientific

340
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
The tree-ring Divergence prob

341
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
As it turns out for a long ways

342
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Where we have data for it

343
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:37,791
Tree-ring

344
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,815
Run

345
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
Consistent path

346
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
With observable temp

347
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,655
However

348
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
And the data is gathered from

349
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Does not match

350
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
The documented temperature

351
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
That we know are the case

352
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
From time

353
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Those tree-ring Sam

354
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
So

355
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,991
We're not entirely sure

356
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Why that's okay

357
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
Phil was discussing using Mike's nature

358
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:04,159
In order to present the data

359
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Completely consist

360
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
With scientific

361
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,231
Cisco ethical practices

362
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,815
Scientists are not sure

363
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Reservable temp

364
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,679
It's due to be discovered

365
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
Aspheric

366
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
Variable that is probably in play

367
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,799
But was not

368
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,823
Before 1950

369
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,383
Other scientists speculate that it could be due to

370
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
The sensitivity

371
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
And maybe a byproduct of

372
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,015
Seasonality that we are experiencing

373
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,831
Increased levels of aerosol

374
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
Send the air that are also causing global dimming

375
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Could also

376
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,975
It could be vaccine

377
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
Absolutely

378
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,607
So did the reality is

379
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Coax

380
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
Invested about 50 million dollars over the last 50 years to spread

381
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
So doubt about

382
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,103
And that's not even including what ExxonMobil is

383
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,199
The carbon freeze sound at nine out of 10 of the most prolific writers were climbing

384
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
Mobile

385
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,831
Including I don't know

386
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Yeah

387
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,183
Directly

388
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,999
And I don't seems like they should have to

389
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,607
Declare that flows

390
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,423
Rochelle company

391
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
Yeah exactly

392
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
He's not one of the top 10

393
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,151
Alex's buddy Lord monckton who's his climate change

394
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
Expert absolutely

395
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
ExxonMobil

396
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,879
Here's the chief policy adviser for the science and

397
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,647
Policy and

398
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
Think Bank operated by frontiers of

399
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
Foundation

400
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,279
Four years were available from 2,000

401
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
2007

402
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
1 million

403
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
337 thousand

404
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
For what

405
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
Probably

406
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,567
Also

407
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Crazy Loom

408
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,359
Justice

409
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
They're just all about

410
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
Sprites being supported

411
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
ExxonMobil

412
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
The science

413
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Supported

414
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:15,487
Inhabit

415
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
Bulshit

416
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
The signs of made-up bulshit

417
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,583
Is deported

418
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,167
Debatable

419
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,959
Is of course supported

420
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
It seems crazy

421
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
Also

422
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
The Sun

423
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
The sun being the

424
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,407
Driver climate change

425
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
Very much

426
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,503
It's very much addressed by climate scientist

427
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,551
It's going to look into any of it

428
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
That's why you can't

429
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
Psych

430
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,559
10000 books about the thermal output

431
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
Call Warren

432
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:05,663
Scientific facts

433
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
Are the British

434
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
We spoke

435
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:18,976
When I called Rothschild

436
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
He just laughs

437
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
Thinking Leon

438
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,376
Population

439
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
The globe

440
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
How did

441
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,800
This is his big gotcha from the energy

442
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:33,824
Is good personals

443
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
Global warming

444
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,064
Ablution base tax system

445
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:21,440
Principal

446
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:28,096
I think he said the planets in the wrong order not you say

447
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:34,752
F*** you your money changing and set up the clip wrong

448
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,056
Friends and we know

449
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,176
We know what happens which is what David Rockefeller that David roster

450
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
Rothschild

451
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,504
Give the order of the planets

452
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,088
You and I know that there's no that you made a mistake

453
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,880
Alex set this up

454
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,184
You're like oh he's going to play the clip

455
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
We have to deal with this bulshit it was an obvious Miss baking

456
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,840
If I were Fallon I'd be like

457
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,144
Play the clip

458
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,776
You cute up the wrong quit baby

459
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:14,176
Still doesn't seem like a mistake it seems like what he

460
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
He's a nut

461
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
It hurts me

462
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
It's like that seems like such an easy slam dunk

463
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,160
You set the clip Up

464
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:30,560
We move on five minutes down the road we all get to have a good time.

465
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
The rest of the time no one has to know I got jebaited

466
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:44,896
Classic Connect the beginning of the documentary to the end he was talking 82 Medics about Nathan

467
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,176
Rothschild the beginning

468
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:51,808
So now he's going to talk to his ancestor if they accept Medicare

469
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
Why is the I got your morning

470
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
If you don't hit that home instead it just you being a dick

471
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,424
To multiple Generations

472
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:11,008
Of everybody I think you might actually play

473
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:17,408
Rothschild later it's inexcusable

474
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
I think she does play it

475
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,832
I recall he does but I'm just weirded out

476
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
And he even gets the orders

477
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
The planets round

478
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:32,768
Jirachi

479
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
Unbelievable

480
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:42,496
Level of mistakes that were made in editing

481
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
AR

482
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:49,152
Outrageous goddamnit sperms of fact checking in terms of the bibliography

483
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Terms of just like

484
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
If I were the guy who is task

485
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
But having to like

486
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Put this together

487
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
It's two and a half hours long or so

488
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,696
Time to put together all the video in the audio

489
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:02,720
It would be like

490
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
It's taking us 10 hours just to watch it

491
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,912
We're going to get through this

492
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
We're causing it mainly

493
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Vast majority of it

494
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,312
The consequences are bad

495
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
And will be

496
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
We Act

497
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Polar ice caps

498
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,552
Faster than ours

499
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,328
Now I know where is David

500
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Rothschild

501
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
My friend

502
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
Attacks is the best way

503
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Cap-and-trade can also do it

504
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
If there were

505
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
Carbon-based tax

506
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,048
Would there be a need for

507
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
Economy-wide

508
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,144
Cap-and-trade

509
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
They are not either or

510
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
We can do both I am in favor

511
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Both

512
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,616
I want to talk a little bit about Al Gore and his

513
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Carbon tax

514
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,456
Connection but Alex Jones lies about a lot

515
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
Cuz I actually

516
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,272
Incredibly fast

517
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,832
The stuff is

518
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
Amazing

519
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
How much Alex

520
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
Texas lying about

521
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,184
All of it

522
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,976
Especially outdoor

523
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
So knowing his personal

524
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
Hatred of Al Gore

525
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,448
I believe he would lie to I read

526
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
I read this one

527
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Blog

528
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Deserve a citation

529
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,080
Asian but they're like

530
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,616
Climate change

531
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:02,272
Coasting along strictly on the Charisma of algor

532
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,928
Stereotypical

533
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
Vici

534
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,888
Every like what I didn't host SNL and every skit was just about how boring he was

535
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,960
He's just been portrayed on.snl is the most

536
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Boring guy forever

537
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Inflated things

538
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
I want talk about Carpenter

539
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Just going to give you a rat

540
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
Example

541
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
So

542
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
This year

543
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,392
Singapore is about to implement

544
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,976
Right and they've lost property

545
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,536
Text effects

546
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
At all

547
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,656
This this write-up about it and here's a car

548
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:53,728
The tax will affect 3240 large emitters

549
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,568
Define disposed admit 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases

550
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
Is annually

551
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,688
The government is looking at charging between

552
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
And $20 per ton of greenhouse gases

553
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
The goal is to incentivize

554
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,112
And create a Level Playing Field

555
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Field for the development of

556
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,416
Stainable energy sources

557
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,744
They're being held down by being left out of large subsidies offered

558
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
Tacoland

559
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Fuel industry

560
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Baby look at that it's 32

561
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,608
240 business

562
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Is there only going

563
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,912
Affected by

564
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:25,472
In Singapore

565
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,496
Just be a number

566
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Businesses

567
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Thousand

568
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
In America that would be a

569
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,664
The reality is that

570
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,432
The bunch of

571
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,456
Countries have imposed

572
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
Carbon tax

573
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
Susan the past

574
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,296
Have they reduced

575
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,392
Because you get there

576
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,208
Based on what I know

577
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,256
If you implement a carbon tax

578
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
Any kind

579
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,400
The entirety of the world will collapse so tell me Dan that that has happened

580
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,960
Many times over

581
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:03,360
Impose one in 2013 Ireland

582
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,224
In 1990s country Sun near immediate results

583
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
Decrease CO2 emissions

584
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
With minimal impact on the economy and no energy outages

585
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
Australia

586
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
Cassie of carbon taxation

587
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
They enacted a carbon tax and

588
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,352
12 in 2014

589
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,656
The weirdness in the other government

590
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:32,288
Things got weird and

591
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,176
It was not the voice of the people being heard it was

592
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
2014 till further

593
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
Strongly urge

594
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Graphs of emissions from the time. Between

595
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
2012

596
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,512
24

597
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,048
What you see is

598
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Consistently

599
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,376
From July 2012 to July

600
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
2014

601
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Dropping over

602
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Team million ton

603
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Visions drop

604
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
Very precipitous

605
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,336
Right

606
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,664
Immediately after the repeal in July 2014

607
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
Trend turns around

608
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
In 5 months

609
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,504
Pentagon backup app rocks

610
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
85 million

611
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
So

612
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:19,648
There is a very clear-cut example of

613
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
This works

614
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
Is effective in terms of cutting down a mission

615
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:26,304
Using the examples of countries that have

616
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Race car

617
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
You can't relist

618
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Weekly claim that they don't work to reduce

619
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,008
The only argument you can make

620
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,664
Go out there that's also true and Australia is involved

621
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,480
Wade and there's not going to be as many

622
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Bulshit Dan

623
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,904
Where's the science the water water Bertrand

624
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,000
So you can really make is it emissions don't affect climate

625
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,792
Reply I'm just a thoroughly address

626
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
The case money is somehow being

627
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Wendell B

628
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Climatech

629
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,704
That's the only thing that you can possibly do

630
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
The ladder

631
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Is a matter of

632
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Really

633
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,848
If that's the case then

634
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:17,248
That's not really a climate changes that's a government corruption issue

635
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,320
Seems like you should get rid of those people

636
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,344
Yeah so

637
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,648
This idea that people with these fat cats

638
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
The New World Order

639
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
It's interesting because

640
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,888
There's these people who are really strong

641
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Proponents pushing for

642
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
For the carbon tax

643
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,448
The carbon tax

644
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,240
They include this

645
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
As a integral part of their proposal

646
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
Quote

647
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,616
To avoid kill whitey

648
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:47,200
That's in there that slower

649
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:53,344
To avoid burning low and moderate-income household

650
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,136
Periodic prorated

651
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Dividends

652
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,488
Or dedicated to reducing the tax burden of regressive tax

653
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
Such as the federal payroll tax

654
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
And state sales tax

655
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
Depending on whether the tax

656
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
Is imposed on the federal or state level

657
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:09,728
There is a precedent for this sort of thing like the Alaska Permanent Fund

658
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,336
For the state of Alaska send every citizen to check for the same amount as payment for the earnings

659
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:17,920
Of Investments made from the state's northslope oil royalty

660
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
Canada announced carbon pricing

661
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
In Florissant

662
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
16

663
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,064
And this is what the plan

664
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Included

665
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,648
British Columbia system is designed to be Revenue neutral

666
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Meaning of the government will take

667
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
No extra money for

668
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
And instead returned it

669
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Tax credit

670
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Alberta sister

671
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864
Some of the costs

672
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
To lower-income can

673
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Consumers in the form of

674
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
Small business

675
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,240
Taxes have been reduced

676
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,264
From 3% of 2

677
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:45,056
Offset coffee

678
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:47,104
So a lot of the money

679
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,456
That is being brought by climate carbon taxes

680
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
In countries that are using it

681
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,808
Is legitimately being funneled directly back

682
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,344
Into the people

683
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,136
You are paying for energy

684
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Now

685
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
Let me tell you why

686
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
That is

687
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,024
And why it will never work

688
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,608
Do you know what is more likely to work here

689
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,216
I hesitate to answer

690
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:16,032
Is if the government implemented a carbon tax

691
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,896
Said we're using it to give back to rich people and then

692
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
Ended the, however one is expected to being along with it

693
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,648
America

694
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
Go crazy

695
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,256
We are more comfortable with you if you were like

696
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Okay so

697
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
On Exxon Mobil

698
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,144
That

699
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,192
All of the proceeds of which

700
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,752
Will go to subsidize exxonmobil's

701
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,776
New home

702
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
Which we have

703
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,592
Hired exhibit

704
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:03,648
You don't like it

705
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,928
You know you guys are going

706
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Feel weird about any news

707
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,912
Stop screaming at me about the estate tax I wish I hadn't brought that up

708
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:21,568
I apologize be state tax only affects that I really I should have stopped should not talk about this conversation

709
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,360
Alright you making a point

710
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Hold on

711
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Calm down

712
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,432
Calm down

713
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
The money waste

714
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Your children

715
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,856
Back to you because you need it and your children need it

716
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,648
We just

717
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,696
Your children are dying because of the

718
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,792
People not only are we not taking money away from them

719
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
We're just taking away the subset

720
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,376
We already get them

721
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,704
Do you know what's crazy we don't even need to enact attack

722
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,264
That's because right now you are paying

723
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
For those Rich oil company

724
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,104
To murder your children

725
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
So what we're going to do

726
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,664
Going to make that better

727
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
I get what you're saying but I completely lost track of

728
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,600
The role-play I don't know what to do

729
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
I was going to ask for a binky

730
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,952
This one is going to do

731
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
Is except I want

732
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,144
Motorworks

733
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,592
For the attempted

734
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
-5 points for the break-even

735
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:34,784
This is a carbon tax that will be applied to the business

736
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,088
But there's no law that

737
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Affect them

738
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,560
Consumers which I think is really what should be done

739
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,888
Instead of charging everybody more the money

740
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,680
That's collected from the text

741
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:55,520
Redistributed to the people have to pay more for

742
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
What is

743
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,872
That if you

744
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,432
On mobile are those

745
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,248
They're just going to then pass that text

746
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Onto you

747
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
Tire prices that's what I just said

748
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
That's what I'm talking about

749
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,232
And I say f*** that there should be something plays that says you can't

750
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
How would you not do

751
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,352
Eat the Pack b**** that's what I would say

752
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,632
Eat the text

753
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:27,264
Either tax bet you can't pass it along that seems like it seems like

754
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,664
Should be able to happen because otherwise how because otherwise there's no way for the government or

755
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,944
Society

756
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Restrained

757
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Penalty

758
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,856
Are there

759
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Alright

760
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,976
Products are a little more expensive everyone's going to buy them anyway they have

761
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,048
Right but that that is the

762
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,864
The point of it though is that if you are going to suck

763
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
Well yeah capitalism sucks but if you are going to do that

764
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
That if you are going

765
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,728
You text like an Exxon

766
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,312
You have to go to remove the oil subsidy

767
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
In the first place

768
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,896
So what you're really doing is making

769
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,176
Making it so expensive

770
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Those

771
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,992
That they are

772
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:11,808
That you are fostering a market chain

773
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
For somebody to do something

774
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
Like what's the highest growing

775
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,720
Creator knows Alternative Energy

776
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,352
Give the subject take all the oil and gas subsidies away from Exxon and those guys to

777
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Today

778
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
Give it to Alternative Energy

779
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,704
You want me to Carpenter

780
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,800
You will go away on their own because it turns out

781
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,944
Built almost entirely around f****** people over there's actually some good arguments

782
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Wouldn't work

783
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
But I can't remember exactly what they are

784
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,856
But there are some compelling arguments about why

785
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
That's like a

786
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
Jordan 6

787
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
No that's not a quick

788
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,560
But even like subsidies for the renewable energy

789
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
Clearly be a

790
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,424
I don't know exactly what it was

791
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,448
Right now

792
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,736
Invested Millions upon millions of dollars in it exploded miserable because it turns out

793
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,552
Renewable energy is hard

794
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
Which is almost like

795
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:24,000
Sometimes it go down the wrong road it's almost like maybe one time on saving the universe

796
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
You shouldn't

797
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
Quit

798
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,608
So speaking of that let's go

799
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,424
Yeah well Jones like to pretend

800
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,704
That this whole tax credit

801
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,752
Is carbon tax thing

802
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:39,616
Carbon tax credits

803
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,920
Bunch of texts

804
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:47,296
Carbon credits that you secretly going to be making billions of dollars off of it

805
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:53,440
Will a Galaxy Note about Bitcoin

806
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,792
So the accusation is just making stuff up so you can get super rich on

807
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
Sustainable energy is ridiculously

808
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
We flimsy

809
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,192
Thousands and thousands of scientists and researchers academics

810
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,264
Some politicians beeline support his scam

811
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,080
Reviewed studies would have to be false

812
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
Slide

813
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
You know

814
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,920
For no reason

815
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:18,272
Just in order to prop up his game

816
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
I know a guy

817
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:25,696
The reality of this is that Al Gore started a business called generation investment

818
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
2000

819
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,512
4 as a means of investing in and

820
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
Open before word renewable green

821
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,328
Technology

822
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
The Firm has been

823
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Is very

824
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,752
Because it turns out sustainable resources can be

825
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Quotes

826
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,848
The message she hopes Generations record will call attention

827
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,152
Is one that the world's investors Canton

828
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,296
Ignore that they can make more money if they change their practices in a way that will at the same time

829
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,832
Environmental and social damage

830
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
Modern capitalism

831
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,672
That's from the profile in

832
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,696
The Atlantic

833
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Like

834
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
If you look at it

835
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,840
His investment firm only working with

836
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,144
Sustainable business models

837
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Has outperformed

838
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Like a cross

839
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,984
The board almost

840
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,008
Every other

841
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Investment firm

842
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:17,152
Makes me angry it does matter

843
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
It does matter

844
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Angry

845
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
It's not

846
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,040
Good for him

847
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,832
I don't know I don't know who to root for

848
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:28,416
I don't I don't root for him implicitly

849
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,952
But I root for him in

850
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Is that what his model isn't trying to get people to

851
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Be selfish

852
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,912
No I think that is a good thing

853
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,192
And the fact that

854
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
Everyone has thought about this idea that what he's of what

855
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
He's doing that's not possible

856
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,616
Anyone f***** around and did it

857
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:51,200
Example of

858
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,760
A lot of money in this

859
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
He wasn't even any got a triple double

860
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,368
Good day come on

861
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Anyway

862
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,584
The Architects of the New World Order

863
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,216
Are going to race to complete the structure of World Cup

864
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Technology

865
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,544
Threaten their Monopoly of power

866
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,384
Not much longer

867
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
The Architects chart

868
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,088
But Alexa

869
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,672
No

870
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
He's mixing up a lot of things

871
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
The first Global Revolution as a reference

872
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
The club of Rome the ultimate Revolution is the name of

873
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
The speech that I actually gave

874
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
Vinyl Revolution is nothing

875
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
And Society itself

876
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,616
Is a construct

877
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,479
Control the civilization Within

878
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,807
Just as a child maintains the environment

879
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,343
What does Miralax

880
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
Living out on a tire

881
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
Never questioning

882
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,231
What's a scientist

883
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,327
New World Order

884
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Is controllers

885
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,215
The closely study human behavior

886
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
For more than 100

887
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,567
Export control

888
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:27,967
Using amiibo for socks

889
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:34,367
I'll be able to control a chunk conscious person suddenly show up in the right after Lohan

890
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,951
Towers of b*******

891
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,047
Here's another

892
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:46,143
By 2020 there will be a one-world government Ray Kurzweil

893
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
1999

894
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Yay

895
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,103
Real but it's actually misquoting

896
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,175
Miss quoted by 2020 there will be a new world

897
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,503
This is from his book age of intelligence

898
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
The sound interesting but not really based on anything

899
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
Other than speculation

900
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,839
Ray Kurzweil has a terrible track record with predictions including the such like this

901
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,447
So this is this was from his book in 1999 season predictions

902
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
A 2000

903
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:26,335
Yes people use personal computer is the size of ring pens credit cards in books

904
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
The typical hormone

905
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,943
I'll give him

906
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
245

907
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
What are you talking about

908
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:36,575
Phillies personal computers the size of books

909
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
That's one

910
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:43,231
Credit cards credit cards

911
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:48,351
Credit card credit when smaller

912
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Fine

913
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:54,239
The typical home has over 100 computers in it many of which are embedded in Appliance

914
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:58,079
What is the computer and yes he is.

915
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
Don't go back the Abacus argument

916
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
Cybernetic chauffeurs can drive cars for humans and be retrofitted into existing cars

917
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
Call them people that we don't talk to

918
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:13,695
Uber they work by communicating with other vehicles

919
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:18,815
The roads don't feel like Uber drivers

920
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,911
He's made a number of like sort of solid prediction

921
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,007
Most musical be distributed electronically and most

922
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:28,799
Transactions will be made on the internet

923
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,871
Lego sort of prediction

924
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,199
It's not just pretty solid guesswork it's not really that

925
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Crazy that is

926
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
Just sort of having a good idea about where to

927
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Technology is going

928
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,343
What is other stuff is pretty crazy

929
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
It's really wild like one of us

930
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
By 2009

931
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,071
Musicians will jam with robot man

932
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:57,215
Robots movie capable of the creativity

933
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,543
And then when he started on it

934
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,895
Guitar Hero

935
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:15,647
2009 through to be like today

936
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,999
2009

937
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,303
You never heard of Herbie Hancock

938
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,351
Robots already

939
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:34,591
The important thing is he is a futurist and a technologist

940
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,663
The only things you really cares about when you make

941
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:39,199
Make predictions to talk about

942
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,223
Not politics

943
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,503
Any other consideration

944
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,855
His argument that he's making in this text

945
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Ray Kurzweil what does he do

946
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,999
Music futuristic also work for Google he's a

947
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,815
He's a very prominent

948
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
Futurist is a f****** dick

949
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,239
You know what you can do you know how like Alan Watts has all those f****** videos that people have online with

950
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,543
Swelling music behind him giving lectures

951
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,335
Yeah that's the same thing

952
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
Yeah have we not

953
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
That maybe our issues that we just have put

954
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Swelling music behind

955
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,111
Documentary certainly has a lot of it

956
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
F***

957
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:25,535
Citric with regular while also was like use a consultant to Google what have you like

958
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:30,911
Victoria what do you think about the future

959
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:38,079
Presenting about this new world government not one world government is Alex

960
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Misquoting

961
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
Is this

962
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
It's about technology

963
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,967
He's making is this

964
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:47,039
The advances in technology that are going to

965
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,439
What happened like the proliferation of internet and space travel and that's who it's going to

966
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
Collaboration to avoid the end result

967
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,511
Complete segregation

968
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,047
Between nations or destruct

969
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,607
Right as it looks now with China and Russia

970
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
Existing in there

971
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
Currency

972
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,935
Stroking up

973
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,775
American nationalism

974
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
There's literally zero reason to

975
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
United government's going to happen in

976
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,663
2 years there's zero reason to think

977
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,063
Yep so this production is pretty s*** misquoted it by using

978
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,367
Air but otherwise

979
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,671
Also Breakers Wells prediction

980
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,447
What's Spirit metastasized

981
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,263
Into the fields of genetics

982
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,079
And Robotics

983
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,383
From their Inception all 3 discs

984
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,199
Dominated by eugenicist

985
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,319
Billionaire founder of sun Microsystems

986
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,183
Courageously went public in 2000

987
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
And if worst

988
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
Mass extermination of everyone

989
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
I took so much courage for him to say

990
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,079
He wrote this article doesn't need us

991
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,383
Alex is completely misrepresenting it

992
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,711
F****** really long boring thing to go through it is

993
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:26,367
Already already abandoned by whole thing

994
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:31,487
Already like the show is going to enjoy this

995
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
The fuc

996
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,935
I'm realizing that now really f****** funny things that are coming up still I promise you

997
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
So self-conscious

998
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,103
Oh my God this 2:13 documentary I'm losing it I'm done I'm done

999
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:50,687
My emotional state is still fly

1000
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,807
I feel so I feel so guilty that I've kept you here this long

1001
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
Look we agreed

1002
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,647
We agreed

1003
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,695
Common Law Courts

1004
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,815
Castle summer for 7 hours are common law married

1005
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
Admiralty law

1006
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,679
Go read

1007
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,727
You can find why the future doesn't need us

1008
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,263
You can find this online

1009
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,663
Actually really interesting

1010
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:26,527
Already talked about

1011
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,831
F****** also heavily featured it

1012
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:36,511
Elizabeth more interesting stuff for us to cover members

1013
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:41,375
Angry we are both going to be for different reasons

1014
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,935
Write a tender both going to be pissed off

1015
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,495
Annihilation

1016
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:51,871
Orgasmic orgiastic pleasure

1017
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,295
She only the beneficial aspect

1018
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,135
Bring

1019
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:14,911
So what

1020
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,935
Is one thing

1021
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
People do not agree with

1022
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,287
Community

1023
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
Help

1024
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:26,687
They all f****** fight with each other all the time

1025
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:32,063
Society fighting with each other meaning of your name is trans

1026
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
Human

1027
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,671
Yeah he's beginning beyond what human is of course

1028
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:41,023
Getting along with other people trying to get you at the same time

1029
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,399
Any important posthumanism I was what transhumanism grew out of

1030
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
This community actually even agrees that that's true

1031
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:55,359
Some people think it's like it is possible they grew out of posthumanism but

1032
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:57,407
That's not a consensus they all have argue

1033
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,063
The prophet Alex runs if he was treating a large diverse group as one individual thing

1034
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Pretending

1035
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
Humanists believe in the singularity

1036
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
No

1037
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
About anyting

1038
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,303
Humanism

1039
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,607
They're mostly interested in watching a bird

1040
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Technology

1041
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,167
Speculating about how those Technologies

1042
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,447
Could be used in the advancement

1043
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
If you Mandy and what the implications

1044
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Of those

1045
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,287
Could be

1046
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,615
The history of transhumanism has been

1047
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
Predictions

1048
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,687
Most of which have been wrong

1049
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:35,039
They 1999 in a different book Ray Kurzweil

1050
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
Spiritual machines

1051
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,855
You couldn't number predictions

1052
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:38,879
For 2009

1053
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Some of these are also failed

1054
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,231
This goes back to the this is where the

1055
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,023
Humans with cybernetics

1056
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Music

1057
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
Translating telephone

1058
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
Speech to speech language translation

1059
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,935
Are commonly used

1060
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
Language

1061
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Absolutely

1062
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
Not even close

1063
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,015
Decade or so that technology will be refined but now

1064
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,295
It's not even close to

1065
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
Good

1066
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:16,767
You can do it but whatever is going to come out is going to be real f****** clunky translation

1067
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,887
I'll give him one that's no

1068
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,191
Most routine business transactions

1069
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,239
This travel reservations take place

1070
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,543
Between a human and a virtual personality

1071
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,663
Often the virtual presentation includes an animated visual presents that will look like a human face

1072
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
He's just watched anime

1073
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
We got high and looked at Clippy

1074
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,527
Yeah that's what happened

1075
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,599
Ante leswing the majority of 10

1076
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,623
Some help with that prediction

1077
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:45,183
Text is created using

1078
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,463
Continuous speech recognition

1079
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,351
So

1080
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,119
Further up

1081
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
Other two

1082
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,287
Animated

1083
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,127
Hanging around with us as we buy shift they don't want we don't want to

1084
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:10,527
Cuz you can just buy things through interfaces on my damn.

1085
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
I'm talking to a robot on the

1086
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
Screen

1087
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,415
Transhumanism drawers in that same area as motivational

1088
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,559
Most people never ever hear about them or flowy speeches

1089
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,143
At all this fun stuff about human futures

1090
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,007
More diverse much less exciting and

1091
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
Debates about the

1092
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,055
The ethical implications

1093
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,871
Possible future technology

1094
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
Pretending it's all like

1095
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:42,271
We worship the singularity

1096
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
Events of our time

1097
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,599
Has been a dude injecting him

1098
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,135
Himself with what he thinks is

1099
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Is a herp

1100
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,951
Osher

1101
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
On

1102
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Stage

1103
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:54,303
In front of everybody else at the transceiver

1104
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,887
Wait wait are you telling me that he had the Lord boxman's

1105
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,871
These guys who make themselves cyborgs by like half of that

1106
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,199
Implanting little thing

1107
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,599
Fingers in this guy is like

1108
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,511
I got herpes and he just shoved it right up his ass

1109
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Freddie Gray

1110
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,423
Deranged is the syringes in the Chica wasn't straight up there but you know

1111
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
You can take

1112
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
Basic license however you like it

1113
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
Whatever you need at this late hour

1114
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Let's

1115
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711
But many of them don't know

1116
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,503
Is it master eugenicist

1117
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,063
Transhumanism

1118
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,111
And the societies control

1119
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
Openly admit

1120
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
What's a new system is

1121
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
Progression to Absolute Terror

1122
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
Julian Huxley is

1123
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
Sometimes credited as having

1124
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,399
Bulshit

1125
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,959
Realistically

1126
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
Considered

1127
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,007
You could go back to any

1128
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
World story about the conquest

1129
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:15,199
Anytime

1130
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:20,063
Hunt for the Fountain of Youth

1131
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,879
These impulses that humans have

1132
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
What is deeply rooted

1133
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
External input

1134
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
Little Grantham longer Library

1135

Immortality

1136
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,119
Even Alex Jones his own product DNA Force

1137
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:38,239
Comes from that mentality it markets Itself by

1138
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
There's damage to the

1139
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:45,407
The telomeres of your DNA but legally can't will improve your body's longevity

1140
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:47,199
He even sells products

1141
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:49,759
Dr. Wallach

1142
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,575
Whose name evokes nothing is not the longevity

1143
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:54,367
And Young Jeezy

1144
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:58,719
Yeah that's true also that those are the only two things the second

1145
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,511
Absolutely an accident

1146
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:06,655
Julian Huxley did coin transhumanism the term if you ask some people who are wrong

1147
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,447
Article you wrote

1148
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,751
57

1149
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
But the truth

1150
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,175
19 years earlier

1151
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,575
None of these ideas about transhumanism new and Huxley was around it's just that he was a high-profile biology

1152
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:27,391
Fox Lake and a technology

1153
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,231
Technological advances were much greater in 1957

1154
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:35,071
40 or 19 20

1155
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Introduced

Proto transhumanists Ideas Book Guide Dallas

1157
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,447
Or science and the future

1158
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,287
See-through invention

1159
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
But

1160
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,895
We do not also evolve our ethics along the way

1161
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,687
Do all these ideas exist

1162
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
For f****** 30 years by the time album

1163
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,807
So what you're saying is

1164
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Nobody ain't never heard of Steampunk Buffet

1165
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Right

1166
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,415
That's what you just said

1167
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,183
Hyundai

1168
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:08,095
Definition for the transformative movement in general which means that all trance

1169
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:13,471
Do not agree with either

1170
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
You're not stuck with all of this

1171
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,759
A bun straight past those

1172
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,087
Minutes you're like okay

1173
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,903
Look we need to a hacker

1174
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:38,559
Need to change this entire Earth is destroying as this human body is not functional anymore

1175
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,095
What I need to do

1176
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,375
Mastiff

1177
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Need to find a way

1178
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
Augment my body so I can

1179
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:51,615
Are you telling me that I'm just going to get caught up with all this b******* with other people with magnets in my hands

1180
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,895
F*** that

1181
00:57:54,431 --> 00:58:00,575
I want to get into a fight I want to be a trinity 1 hour to put more magnets away

1182
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,023
The wrong Missy

1183
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,887
The bottom line is even though

1184
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,959
Two things out really boils down to is always

1185
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,495
Throughout their entire house

1186
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,639
Possible technology

1187
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
It's been an essential part of transhumanism

1188
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,991
And probably one of our that makes

1189
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,271
Exit the most boring

1190
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,023
Boats that technological advancement

1191
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,351
A live forever

1192
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
Most won't be able to

1193
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
Keep up with the new Master

1194
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
Prime for World governor

1195
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
It's now all about

1196
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
Google control

1197
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
Access to

1198
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,455
Life extension systems

1199
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:00,991

1200
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Dare

1201
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,319
Biological evolution

1202
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,367
Is too slow for the human species

1203
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Over the neck

1204
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,951
It's going to be left in the dust

1205
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:12,255
Okay

1206
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,279
That actually sounds

1207
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,399
I'd like to humble myself

1208
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
For you

1209
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,447
I've no idea

1210
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,727
This quote is real

1211
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:28,383
At this point in the documentary I've given up on trying to prove his clothes are all stove

1212
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:36,063
I don't give a fuk with Lakers last days is whatever

1213
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
We found dance break

1214
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:44,255
Ray Criswell

1215
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,703
Decades ago

1216
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,079
No longer be able to get jobs

1217
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,359
Sounds like

1218
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:10,623
Before we get to this thing about Mexican

1219
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,439
My workers have a Good Vibration

1220
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,511
Computer chip sausage

1221
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,935
Is that to make sure that access

1222
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,471
Sensitive information

1223
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,239
Contain

1224
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
Second they have nowhere else to put

1225
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:33,919
These goddamn microchip

1226
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,575
The largest issue with Mexican law enforcement at they face outside of the cartels

1227
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,599
Police corruption

1228
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,391
Use of RFID chips

1229
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,439
Complain to the police officers allows much greater

1230
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,463
Air control

1231
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
Restricted information

1232
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:51,839
Chips implanted in arms cannot be faked

1233
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,143
Unique RFID code for

1234
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Breech birth

1235
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,959
Allows a record of who is access

1236
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,239
What pieces of evidence

1237
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,031
Doctor stuff all that s***

1238
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,311
This could not be itchy

1239
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
Can you be using the device planted

1240
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,639
Standard ID card

1241
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,175
ID card could we

1242
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:06,943
Stolen

1243
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
The ID cards

1244
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,295
Corrupt officer

1245
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,879
Like that they're not giving them to rank

1246
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
Can file employees

1247
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,439
Federal top top

1248
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207
Traffic

1249
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,303
The others

1250
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,887
Didn't know you can't do that because they are so fragile

1251
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
These these things

1252
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,983
Take them out of someone's arm

1253
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,359
What if you can't walk into a government building

1254
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:36,639
With an arm

1255
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,431
I think someone to be like

1256
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,247
A guide to die

1257
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:47,135
Even in the most terrible parts of Mexico I think someone

1258
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,183
Someone be like what's up

1259
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,487
Alright

1260
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,047
Are you going to a bassinet

1261
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,655
Babushka

1262
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Alright

1263
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:10,431
Anybody order

1264
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Okay

1265
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,039
Get me into that evidence Locker

1266
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:21,439
That my work would it be strange for the Subway delivery guy to Michael wander around

1267
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,231
Weird

1268
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:29,631
8 hours documentary a little bit drunk

1269
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,679
Yeah you can probably Rippetoe

1270
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:36,799
Mexico City

1271
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,335
Ryobi ocean7

1272
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
I could do it

1273
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,175
To the other reason

1274
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
6 would be

1275
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:46,527
The other reason that they do this

1276
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
It's cuz there's a lot of

1277
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:53,951
In Mexico getting chip in order to

1278
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,767
Mexico Rex

1279
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,815
Incredibly high in terms of kidnapping

1280
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Statistics

1281
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:04,447
40% between 2000 for 2007 and Mexico according to official

1282
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
Statistics

1283
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
Mexico Rex

1284
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:11,359
Columbia is the worst countries for

1285
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:18,271
Interested in that I'm tripping for that

1286
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:21,599
Clear whether or not that

1287
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,391
For that but

1288
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,695
You understand

1289
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:30,047
So fragile where you going to put the

1290
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,631
And to this dumbass

1291
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
I can probably kidnapped

1292
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:35,935
Here's a dumb quote

1293
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,263
Digital reality

1294
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
Are suicidal nihilist

1295
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Suicide

1296
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,407
No there is no broker

1297
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:50,015
They would always prefer to go on willing

1298
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,039
They can

1299
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,767
So that was a quote from Arthur croker

1300
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
I looked at the citation that Alex gives

1301
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,447
He gives a citation

1302
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,519
Wired Magazine

1303
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,103
It's not it's not in there at all

1304
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,199
To a publication called

1305
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:19,967
2000

1306
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,503
What does a cyberpunk Maga

1307
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:28,671
Awesome story

1308
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
Well was it is it though

1309
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
Houses

1310
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,791
Play Kow.

1311
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:40,191
A little bit. I'm just saying Arthur Kroger because I read the way new

1312
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,495
Leftist article and Wired Magazine

1313
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,031
He's a hunter restaurant

1314
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,591
He speaks with these

1315
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,127
Flourishes of lichen

1316
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:53,247
Extremism

1317
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,271
Interims

1318
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,807
He's actually talking about

1319
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
He sometimes speaks

1320
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,599
Riddles

1321
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:03,999
If you read other other air other interviews

1322
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:09,631
You come to the conclusion that like I like what this guy is putting down but I don't believe

1323
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,983
If you

1324
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:16,287
So here's the quote

1325
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,847
This one about the suicidal nihilist

1326
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,151
Are these people at the top

1327
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,687
Of the digital reality

1328
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,247
I come from a Cisco cyberpunk

1329
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,807
It was run by a very serious group

1330
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Drug addict

1331
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
They start the magazine

1332
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,719
Then change the name to reality

1333
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,791
Thousand

1334
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
The 1989

1335
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:45,215
Why would that be the one you said along because reality hackers they found

1336
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,495
That they couldn't get distribution

1337
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,335
Because people thought that they were like cutting people up or do some sort of

1338
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,383
They're their images of covers

1339
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
And stuff was a little bit ago

1340
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:59,807
Stream and set like that to the name reality hackers ever thought it was kind of like they thought it was okay

1341
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,903
Gourmet magazine

1342
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,951
This guy

1343
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,487
Nom de plume

1344
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,791
Was are you serious

1345
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
Fun I was watching

1346
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,959
He was watching TV

1347
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,799
Save I didn't make that up

1348
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,639
So he came out he was watching TV news like everything is

1349
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,919
2000 Audis

1350
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
Got these weird

1351
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
The products are all 2000

1352
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,783
It's a queen

1353
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,319
The other person involved

1354
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
Another - 5.

1355
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,415
I wasn't there I didn't do that

1356
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,303
So she came up with this

1357
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
She's great I don't know

1358
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
House refuses to give interviews.

1359
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:52,799
She came up with Mando as the beginning to 2000

1360
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,639
Seems like it should be harder

1361
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,943
Shiplap

1362
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
She have gotten

1363
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,759
That was what was running the magazine

1364
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,391
So her inheritance was Mondo

1365
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
Exactly

1366
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,535
I appreciate that

1367
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,839
Regarding the nature all about

1368
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:21,471
An issue number 5 in 1992 Nagel editors

1369
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,799
Accidentally transpose the names of avant-garde musicians

1370
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,615
Glenn branca and Elliot sharp cover

1371
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
Rendering them Glenn Sharpe and Elliot Broncho

1372
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,015
Send sharpen Bronco for household name

1373
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
Pure readers notice

1374
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:40,415
But Mondo obviously owed an explanation

1375
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,743
Rather than backward

1376
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:48,095
Rather than apologize Mondo proclaimed the snafu intentional

1377
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:53,471
Greasy hands archive composed an essay about post-postmodern modernism

1378
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:58,335
And deliberate art damage or rather they scribbled notes on a napkin while I'm having drinks

1379
01:07:58,847 --> 01:08:04,991
The outline was passed around the concept ended up as a collaborative two-piece Manifesto

1380
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,551
Called what do you say after Popo

1381
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,879
Half the time we were trying to battle people into thinking we were deep

1382
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Says who

1383
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,535
Waffle wagon

1384
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
It was parrot

1385
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,935
Paradise Brown

1386
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,495
Okay we got these two names wrong

1387
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,823
Instead of saying we got these two names wrong

1388
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Let's

1389
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:35,199
Device around why

1390
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:37,503
What's the exact correct thing to do

1391
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:43,647
I'd love them all right Honda 2000 for twenty thousand more years

1392
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:50,047
Bucket higher s*** on designer drugs and like weird experimental chemical,

1393
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,327
Compounds and s*** like that

1394
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,095
They have

1395
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:58,495
No serious pretense

1396
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,311
Kickstarter and they coming back

1397
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:05,151
I think we got the

1398
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:11,807
Editorial policy to where it's at

1399
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:16,927
Like if you interview somebody you can fight him if you want

1400
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:23,327
If you don't like what they're saying

1401
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
You can argue with them

1402
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:28,703
No other Publications

1403
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:37,919
We pretended they were scored early in magazines would never come out

1404
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:44,319
Ford to put out that magazine so give me a large inheritance

1405
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,855
I will make you a way better

1406
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,159
So Armando party might

1407
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Is the quote from that article about the

1408
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:56,863
About time travel expert being interviewed

1409
01:09:57,375 --> 01:10:02,751
Others others experimenting with weird mental line simulation game

1410
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
Spiritual Whisperer

1411
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,103
Or Bart Nagel

1412
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,223
And future virtual reality theorist Brenda Laurel

1413
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
360 turn without falling down

1414
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,647
Japanese animation videos flickered on monitors

1415
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,671
Speakers performed

1416
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:21,439
Frottage

1417
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,487
Antique sofa

1418
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:27,839
Adiraj that's when you put your dick in it

1419
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,983
Journalist mgq might have been taking a piss on the front lawn

1420
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,567
One creature that would trap people for entire evening

1421
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,663
And conversations about Francis Bacon was actually William shakes

1422
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
I've heard those

1423
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,551
Before

1424
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:54,463
It's everyone's looking tired of their mind the editor of the magazine and some weird theorist

1425
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,047
Trying to spin around and make a 360 without falling down

1426
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,095
Derrick Derrick describing this

1427
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,119
This is f******

1428
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
This is so boring

1429
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,239
But

1430
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
Approved by

1431
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
So the guys behind Mondo we're really big on just making

1432
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:16,735
Shut up 1993 Bardenay Eagle rattle disappears with an n

1433
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:19,295
Tutorial inspired by artists Jeffrey Koons

1434
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,831
Theory of image appropriation

1435
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:26,463
Either steal it and manipulated wrote Nagel or use it blatantly under the fair-use.

1436
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,279
Nagel practice editorial preached

1437
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,815
With a cover of issue number 10

1438
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:35,935
In which he superimposed a photo against the background stolen from the cover of another magazine

1439
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,263
Niger was immediately Savaged in trade journals

1440
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:46,943
He retaliated with an editorial an issue number 11 which is where this Arthur Corker quote comes from

1441
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:50,271
About a new technology that works on

1442
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:55,647
Works on the DNA level 2 detector microscopic recognizable patterns and images

1443
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,695
He asserted the technology in

1444
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:03,327
Coated patterns that are invisible to the naked eye but detectable no matter how much an image was used

1445
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,863
He further claimed

1446
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,887
That in what

1447
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
Year hence

1448
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,703
All scanners and copy machines with

1449
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,983
Contain a built-in chips

1450
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:13,823
To protect these codes and notify and National computer image Bank

1451
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,127
Every duplication by modem

1452
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,943
The computer with an automatically debit your Visa at

1453
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,063
I tried to make it more and more absurd by saying these scanners would be hooked up

1454
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,671
Computer could actually detect if you were scanning some buns Style

1455
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,743
I'm in a lot of photographers were actually excited about this

1456
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:38,143
Richard Avedon already offered

1457
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,543
Come on they were already offering to donate their proceeds from the style set to a photo assistance group called

1458
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,103
Creative

1459
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,127
Dammit

You just made all that s*** off course he did

1461
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,271
Eric Ebron started writing the message

1462
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:58,367
And this guy Avedon wrote messages like

1463
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
You look like you was she was tricking people they were tricking everybody they were trolling like

1464
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559

Amazing I love

1466
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,375
The other thing

1467
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:12,447
I can't remember what the name of the band is and I feel really bad about this

1468
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,263

01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,903
Like a local punkish band or whatever

1475
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,207
They ripped off some of you to stuff

And without Edge

1493
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
The Edge knowing

01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:23,615
The guys from the band interview him

01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:30,271
About how they had stolen various elements of the videos that used on stage live performance

1496
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:35,391
Talking about

She refused to publish the article or said that we don't want to do this

1502
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,503
Right

1503
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:07,903
Definitely what he would quit over yes they're run

1504
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,975
Right

1505
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
That's delightful

1506
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:15,583
I love finding stuff like this that I had no idea existed

1507
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
There's like

1508
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,655
But I wish I was hip to that when I was younger

1509
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:22,751
No s*** every so much cooler now if I had grown up with that but

1510
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:24,031
I live in Missouri

1511
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,431
Sorry structure

1512
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Free Humanity

1513
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,015
Cannot afford to let psychopathic

1514
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
With delusions of grandeur

1515
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:42,975
Repeat the mistakes of their for mattress because it is highly probable this time they may destroy you

1516
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:49,375
Salinas shell in their mad rush for godhood

1517
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:55,775
In this film we have chronicled Overlord

1518
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,055
Is that

1519
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,639
Which already claimed the lives of more than 150 million

1520
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
In the 20th century

1521
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,343
I'm Invincible tyranny

1522
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
It will dwarf there

1523
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:18,047
They were Sovereign nations in Parma

1524
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Skippers final solution

1525
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,007
Once world government is in place

1526
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:27,775
No one

1527
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
Able to stop

1528
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
New World Order

1529
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:35,967
Global population

1530
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
Hundreds

1531
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
I get it

1532
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
Their Quest

1533
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
Production

1534
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,231
So there's a bunch of FEMA camps that's not

1535
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,279
There are FEMA camps

1536
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:54,143
Yes I know so the proponents of the people can't believe generally basic

1537
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
Concerns on house resolutions

1538
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,703
6:45

1539
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:59,007
Isabel about that by the homeless

1540
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,799
Establishing

1541
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,335
Center style population

1542
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,615
Provide humanitarian Aid

1543
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:12,319
If you want to speculate wildly and let paranoia run the actual text of the resolution

1544
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,599
Stated intent

1545
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
Benign

1546
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,951
And something that word

1547
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,975
Horrible

1548
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,999
Didn't

1549
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
Same dumbass Patriots

1550
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:26,655
Provide somewhere for us

1551
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,983
Also the only role that FEMA even hasn't all this

1552
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
The country is broken down into

1553
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Covers

1554
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,639
So there is no because

1555
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,687
Like why would you have a FEMA Center in every

1556
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
When there aren't really

1557
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,503
As many

1558
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,271
Like

1559
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,807
Emergency

1560
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,087
Risk

1561
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,391
It's not evenly distributed among states

1562
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,207
Earthquake

1563
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,279
There's no flood control.

1564
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:57,375
No it's not important. It's not important it's about

1565
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,167
It just at fault lines

1566
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,727
Coast have a very high

1567
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,031
We need to put all of our hurricane specialist

1568
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
In Idaho

1569
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,871
The only the only reality there is to it

1570
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Internment camps

1571
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:11,967
In America is that is incarcerated minorities

1572
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,271
Rent based on their ethnicity

1573
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,319
Japanese

1574
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:19,391
And World War II

1575
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,231
Tears

1576
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
The long walk

1577
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,047
There's a lot of info

1578
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,095
Remember no certainly not

1579
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:31,167
Beyond that there's only one in

1580
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:33,215
That's Rex 84 G

1581
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,007
Short for Readiness exercise

1582
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,031
Before

1583
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:39,103
The plan was put together by Reagan and Oliver North

1584
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:39,871
And then

1585
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Director John

1586
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,711
Trustworthy plan calls for pudding

1587
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
Chester Civil Right

1588
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,551
Union

1589
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,343
Supporters and minority immigrants

1590
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
Some camps because of

1591
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
The disruptive effect

1592
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
Their perceived

1593
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,695
Have on the right lane

1594
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
Political status quo

1595
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:56,767
Capillus

1596
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
The plan was never put into action

1597
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,863
The only example

1598
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
Outside of those

1599
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:02,911
F****** racist

1600
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
I just brought up

1601
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
Any president

1602
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,031
Has ever put together

1603
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:10,335
Pictures of an actual plan of putting

1604
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Dissenters in

1605
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
And

1606
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Keeping scores

1607
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:26,975
Somewhat I mean there are other minorities and immigrants involved but it's also about Union organizing it so it's all

1608
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,327
Activism

1609
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:36,191
If you get rid of all of those people

1610
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
What

1611
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,519
Are the people yet

1612
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,359
But I am

1613
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
Before

1614
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
One of the triggering event

1615
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,759
Who's going to be mad if we invade cell phone

1616
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:54,367
Like

1617
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,439
Until was literally directed at

1618
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,791
Liberals anti-war people always been annoying

1619
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,351
Well also

1620
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Yeah

1621
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,423
It's it's

1622
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
You know it's interesting that

1623
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,543
There's no documentation there's nothing

1624
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,080
In the world

1625
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,664
Liberals trying to create these

1626
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,528
When was America and unilaterally the Opera

1627
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,088
It seems that way

1628
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,672
But that means but that's what you get so much mileage out of crying the victim

1629
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Maybe we should

1630
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,512
We consider of rounding up all the white National

1631
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
I think you're starting to

1632
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:37,376
Probably a bad idea anyway

1633
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
Is it all messy

1634
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
These dark Builder

1635
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,288
String of man-made bio-weapon

1636
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,080
Each one

1637
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Worse than

1638
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
There's no Citation for this

1639
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
You decide what they're going to do that

1640
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,736
There's literally no reason to believe it

1641
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,320
Follow the same time expanding the police

1642
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,648
Extermination of the population

1643
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,232
Fighting invisible chair

1644
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
Chaos

1645
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,888
And the Georgia Guidestones and as a cold test

1646
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,448
The elite sacred mesh active Georgia

1647
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,984
Why

1648
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
Georgia

1649
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
How big is a class system

1650
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:22,432
Masterforce deliver slate

1651
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:26,016
While the elite enjoy the land of the Earth

1652
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:31,136
Evolve into superhumans

1653
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,976
Weird way to Andrews house

1654
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,072
Give it to the intermittent

1655
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,352
The New World Order

1656
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
And the agenda

1657
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,912
Of the Bilderberg

1658
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:50,592
Goddamn

1659
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,944
We should have done this into chunks

1660
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:57,760
Documentary is not good

1661
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:07,232
What is that

1662
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:13,632
What is the post-credits sequence is working or whatever

1663
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:18,496
Expose the globalist by traveling to disassemble turkey

1664
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,032
Psycho Bilderberg

1665
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:26,432
Dalton shall not break in

1666
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:32,832
Bagon music

1667
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:40,000
Call

1668
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,792
We were at the Ritz Carlton

1669
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,096
It looks like a typical

1670
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:48,704
Bilberry praderio they had the armed guards all around the place had with tunes of

1671
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
Formation Wayfair

1672
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,312
They also had

1673
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,872
Cops all the way around the building

1674
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,408
And they had all this

1675
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
Hi-Tech things baby

1676
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,224
Member can

1677
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,784
I hear whatever spoken Indian language

1678
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
Instantly translated

1679
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,368
Language

1680
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:13,024
What the f*** is he talkin about this he just read The Hitchhiker's Guide and thinks of Babel Fish is real

1681
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584
No it's not the battle fish is

1682
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,144
What you're saying then

1683
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,240
No I did a bunch of research on this cuz I was fast

1684
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:28,896
Possibly with the big things in their ears no cuz there's

1685
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:34,272
You know that translator

1686
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,064
Look at it

1687
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
This technology can never

1688
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:42,720
It was darker

1689
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
What we have in front of us

1690
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,096
Too many languages sound book

1691
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:48,864
Similar issue

1692
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
Just cognates

1693
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:54,752
That exists as false cognate words that sound very similar but aren't the same

1694
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,336
There are like bear bear and bear what you going to do with that

1695
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:01,152
Will you do that with a weird translator get contacts

1696
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:07,552
Closed now you need artificial intelligence

1697
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:12,160
So the other problem the other problem then it comes down to

1698
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,976
Idioms translate idioms

1699
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:21,376
Do you have like this week

1700
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,984
This CFR is going to have trouble with that I get you

1701
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,592
So I looked into this and it's really fascinating

1702
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
Because there's a couple of startups

1703
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,224
That exists out there that they're trying to make this acknowledge

1704
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:42,624
Did you real I'm sure none as a Babylon

1705
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
The one that I watched

1706
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:47,744
Video of actually don't have a name. They don't f****** deserve a plug

1707
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,584
Frankly I don't support what they do

1708
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,912
Technology

1709
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,936
It's a handheld device

1710
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:58,496
Until like in Japan

1711
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
You're like

1712
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:02,336
Where is a karaoke bar

1713
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:08,992
And then you hold it up to somebody else where is the karaoke bar in Japanese

1714
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:15,648
It's a whole video of Japanese people being freaked out.

1715
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
That's a little weird but here's the problem

1716
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
The video doesn't show any moment

1717
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:23,584
Sounds like

1718
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,120
Then responding

1719
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
All because it doesn't translate the other way

1720
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:36,640
Work right but it's just so you can be heard not

1721
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,712
Do you have to listen to their f****** Japanese bulshit

1722
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,296
It's such nonsense

1723
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:45,344
Disgraceful

1724
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,904
Pretend you're immersing into a world

1725
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:50,976
Bob disrespecting it

1726
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
I don't know I think it actually is

1727
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,328
Denigrating

1728
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,608
The idea of travel

1729
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:02,240
But also a lot of these businesses that are like. Just this one I found a bunch

1730
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,520
There's a bunch

1731
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,080
Apps like startups that are trying to

1732
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,640
Work this out

1733
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,688
A lot of them are crowdfunded

1734
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,456
And I

1735
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,736
We all know

1736
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,760
Most ideas

1737
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Crowdfunding

1738
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:18,880
Some of them are real

1739
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,976
Summer like here's an idea give me money and then you never get the product

1740
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,560
So there's a bunch of stuff like that but like sound too good to be true

1741
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:29,376
Anyway with Jim Tucker's describing doesn't exist

1742
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:31,168
He's making this up

1743
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
But

1744
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,848
It might have been the light

1745
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,432
So they cannot keep up with it

1746
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:56,000
Really great dane Ahmad

1747
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,536
I'm done with my notes

1748
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:03,168
Hilarious

1749
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,520
I hope so

1750
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,104
Recipe

1751
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:18,272
Rest in power

1752
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:21,600
I would have cut a lot of this

1753
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:36,960
Call me hear that f****** weird machine good old man

1754
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,496
Walking across the street Fort Lee

1755
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:41,312
Proving nothing Bilderberg meeting her this weekend

1756
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,360
New camera

1757
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:49,248
We had my two personal cops following me today

1758
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,952
Deleterious

1759
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,000
Those guys are up

1760
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,280
Go follow you

1761
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,888
There's a car for this out to the

1762
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448
Hotel

1763
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:15,872
So for it

1764
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:22,528
I would fall in Rochester

1765
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
John Elway

1766
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,936
Owner of Fiat

1767
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
A fellow Builder

1768
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,264
Thought they could take a stroll

1769
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
That Garfunkel

1770
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,344
This Bilderberg attendees sneered at our camera

1771
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,368
That's not a snake

1772
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,024
This car load of kingpins gave the media

1773
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,304
A murderous look

1774
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,840
And seemed shocked

1775
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:10,912
There's a wreck Harlow

1776
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:12,960

Anything more than two is a Carlo

1779
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:27,040
Yeah you got them guys they just drove away

1780
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,624
What a boring f****** n2007 the Bilderberg Group

1781

Receive the heaviest Global coverage

1782
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,048
Jim Tucker witness press conference is attended by hundreds of

1783
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
The members of the media

1784
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
The new generation of info

1785
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,448
Where are those at

1786
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,984
Attract

1787
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
No matter where they are

1788
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,056
There's more crazy

1789
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,592
Her explanation

1790
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,128

1792
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,840
At least he's a potential Fresno

1793
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,144
Even if they obscure Governor parking

1794
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,424
Bill Clinton

1795
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:20,800
Lost his virginity at the Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden Germany 1991

1796

1815
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:17,120

1816
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,656

Sit here and

1880
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,720

1881
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:32,000

And that is that

1911
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
It really amounted

1912
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:12,864
To nothing

1913
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,288
Like a diamond 9 and a half hours when this is over I guess

1914
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,312
Like I've nothing

1915

More Woods

Inexplicable documentary why it exists

Bananas

1921
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,048
Exist

1922
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:42,816
He's crazy

1923
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,912
Is this the way it does is even more insane

1924
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,936
Because it doesn't

1925
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,008
It doesn't have a through-line veritably

1926
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,800

Do f****** hour on the roads

1932
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:17,376
I'm sure he could

1933
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:24,032
But what's really interesting story that story has a start

1934
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,848
Have a narrative

1935
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:29,408
And if they don't build it then you get that.

1936
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:35,808
Like you start we're okay well we need this because of all the

1937
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,832

12

1939
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:46,304
Before you wanted all those roads to be there but now this

1940
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
Please try to open it

1941
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,896
Congratulations

1942
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:07,296
Edmond roads and then

Quotes

1944
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,280
By the way

1945
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,352
Cynthia Rick Perry

1946
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:26,752
Like I don't I don't want nothing there's nothing I mean the only point of it is

1947
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,288
Exist

1948
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:31,360
As a time capsule of what Alex Jones

1949
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,384
Put out as

1950
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,944
The foundation of his career in

1951
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,224
2007

1952
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,552
Canal 11 years later we can look back like you've betrayed

1953
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,856
Literally everything ever hear about

1954
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
You have no moral Center

1955
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,952
There's absolutely nothing

1956
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,976
That you don't contradict

1957
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,024
On a f****** daily basis

1958
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,096
Nothing is real even that

1959
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,120
Being sad

1960
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,400
I mean

1961
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,448
My big takeaway

1962
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,240
Is that like

1963
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,288
Brew doing the research

1964
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,824
Of course I expected

1965
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,104
Find stuff about life

1966
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,408
You know that the foster kids

1967
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:11,808
About xy&z different thing

1968
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,112
What I didn't expect when I couldn't

1969
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,648
Never have predicted

1970
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,184
When I started doing this

1971
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:17,952
This research

1972
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
Was that

1973
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
He wouldn't

1974
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,280
Cover his bases

1975
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:25,376
I never would have expected it would all be in Carta and

1976
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,168
Psych reference here

1977
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:31,264
Like I never thought that the bibliography with myself are

1978
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:33,568
15 * at least and I

1979
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,104
Still lose my s*** ever

1980
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,128
How do you say the word

1981
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,176
Encarta it

1982
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,480
Absolutely crazy to me

1983
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,784
This documentary

1984
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,856
Quotes

1985
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,880
It exists

1986
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,440
It's been viewed by millions of people

1987
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,512
I'm against that bunch of people believe what he

1988
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,280
He's saying

1989
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:56,096
And hardly ever check

1990
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,400
And look at the bibliography

1991
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,448
That's a problem

1992
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:06,848
That is not that is not an acceptable list because everyone who's watching

1993
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:09,152
Psych

1994
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:16,320
It's all just nonsense claims

1995
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,624
Alex Jones documentary

1996
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,672
I assume most of it

1997
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,744
You are a policy

1998
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,280
I would like to donate

1999
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:29,376
1000 million more dollars for us to do another

2000
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144

2003

Get me out of here

2007

I never I never

2008
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,624
And none of these

2009
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,744
Daniel estulin

2010
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,792
Book that he made about the Bilderberg Group

2011
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,072
Sites

2012
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,376
This guy who talks to aliens

2013
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:05,216
Earth Defense Force

2014
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,520
And he's taking his word about

2015
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,824
Whether or not print Barnard is a Nazi

2016
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,616
Also

2017
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,688
This guy writes a bunch of books about aliens

2018
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,736
That's the small-scale version

2019
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:17,760
Alex Jones

2020
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,040
Problem with source

2021
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,344
Like all of this is just things

2022
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,112
He's claiming

2023
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:23,648
All being assertive

2024
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,440
And it has no Foundation

2025
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,768
Wakes up from stuff that is

2026
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,536
About Lake

2027
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,560
Eugenics

2028
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
Being f***** up

2029
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,656
It is a mess

2030
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:37,216
That a lot of our history intersect with Nazi

2031
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
Like

2032
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,264
That stuff is

2033
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
True

2034
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
But no one

2035
01:43:41,056 --> 01:43:41,824
Hiding that

2036
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,104
It's uncomfortable to

2037
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,176
Talk about so maybe people don't bring it up all the time

2038
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:50,272
Sources exist where you can find all that information

2039
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:54,880
What I'm saying is f*** Alex Jones I mean like

2040
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,160
Legitimately

2041
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,560
I would say 100 hours

2042
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,840
Probably

2043
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
Researching

2044
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
In this documentary

2045
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,912
And now

2046
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:07,680
9

2047
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Plus

2048
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
Recording this

2049
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,008
Right

2050
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,056
So officially you have been paid

2051
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,104
91 cents on the dollar

2052
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:16,640
Lady that

2053
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,688
Cuz I'm low-balling and terms

2054
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,712
The research stuff

2055
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:24,832
And it's valuable to me because of all the sides

2056
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
Stuff I've learned

2057
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,904
I value that I've learned

2058
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,672
A lot of these

2059
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,720
Statistics about like foster children

2060
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:37,120
Kind nuvet in my head that hurts

2061
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:41,728
Get a better picture of it or you know what I do know whole lot about Serbia

2062
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,288
I didn't know a lot about the 1990s

2063
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,312
Serbia situation

2064
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:48,896
Really know about the beginning of World War

2065
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,688
Excuse to research that stuff

2066
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:55,040
Is really valuable to me I appreciate that and to Alex

2067
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,576
I appreciate you

2068
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,368
Opportunity

2069
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,928
To do that now is not the time to be magnanimous

2070
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Thought

2071
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,608
F*** you you lie about everything about 6 hours ago

2072
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,400
It's clearly intent

2073
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:13,216
There is no way that this is an

2074
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,752
There's no way that you can

2075
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,544
You are making a documentary

2076
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,104
Were you use a fake quote by Hitler

2077
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,456
Or use a fake quote by David Rockefeller there's no way it makes it too

2078
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,504
The Final Cut of your documentary

2079
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:27,296
Whitby citation

2080
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:29,088
Filter simulator

2081
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,904
There's no f****** way that passes muster

2082
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,768
Are you making a documentary unless you're like I know I can't prove this no one's going to check on

2083
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:43,424
The same way that Ron Paul there's no way that's right that research newsletters

2084
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:46,496
That's the point of a trying to get to

2085
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:52,896
Anyway this is tough to some up but there's a lot of feelings that I have

2086
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Have

2087
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:56,992
That

2088
01:45:57,504 --> 01:45:58,272
For me like

2089
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Really f******

2090
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,576
Hammered at home

2091
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,136
Just like just

2092
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,768
The conversation of isca

2093
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,304
Stupid or is he

2094
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
You doing this

2095
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:14,144
If you're stupid

2096
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:17,472
You can get away with putting this documentary up there

2097
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
You're dumb

2098
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,056
If you are putting

2099
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:21,824
Quotes

2100
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,872
On screen

2101
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,176
Hanging them as like

2102
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:28,480
This is a big f****** deal

2103
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:33,856
Knowing full well these were not anybody related to what's going on here

2104
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:39,488
Goes over from being your dumb to being this is on purpose

2105
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,560
There wasn't a f****** release date on this

2106
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:45,632
There wasn't a deadline this wasn't

2107
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:52,032
This wasn't like

2108
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:01,248
Talk about that this might have been part of one of his money bombs

2109
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,040
Like that there might have been

2110
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:07,136
Something where he actually did have some artificial pressure to put it out

2111
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:10,720
But that still artificial pressure still don't care Google

2112
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,792
Google all that could have been helpful

2113
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,584
Exist in 2007

2114
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,352
First

2115
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,656
To anybody

2116
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,192
Making a documentary

2117
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:23,008
For anybody can I give my advice first

2118
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:29,920
My Facebook

2119
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,736
A lot of people try it on this

2120
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,272
Not all of them did

2121
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,856
Whoever came up with

2122
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,672
Tried the rest of them fuksa.

2123
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:42,720
Anyway Jordan

2124
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:45,792

2125
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,864
Oh absolutely

2126
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,680
But more than anything else like

01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:54,752
Appreciate you so much for doing this

2128
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,544
I know I dragged you in

2129
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:03,456
This is the thing

2130
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,040
This is probably

2131
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,576
Like a

2132
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:10,624
It'll probably go down in history as a

2133
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,672
Classic example

2134
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
And I appreciate

2135
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:21,376
The ordering pizza being a friend

01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,688
Episode

2139
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:37,504
This episode continues cuz Jordan doesn't know how to edit

2140
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:41,088
Next episode just

2141
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,672
Repeating over

2142
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:51,072
For 2 hours

2143
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:58,752
He made up quotes about bilderberg's

2144
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:02,080
Next episode the only man who can

2145
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,360
Can replace Dan Friesen

2146
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,384
That's right

2147
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:08,736
In studio we have Alex Jones everybody

2148
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:11,552
I'm an idiot

2149
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,600
Great episode

2150
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:21,792
We've come to the end of nine hours of this b******* and

2151
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,328
For about nine and a half

2152
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:27,424
It only seems fair since you

2153
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:33,056
I think you took this the hardest

2154
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:33,824
Then

2155
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,616

Deprecate any further

2158
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:44,320
Around hours

2159
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,600
But I came out of it

2160
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:50,720
But that was that was a low point for me but the only person that I

2161
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
It's not me

2162
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
