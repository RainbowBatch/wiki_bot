1
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,832
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody would make knowledge write them down just a little bit about Alex Joe

5
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,120
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,168
Oh wait no

7
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
That's not always work

8
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,176
I guess it's kind of related to that but I was a joke

9
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,200
I guess

10
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,088
What do I break so I think is kind of like I'm starting to forgive myself for enjoying video games

11
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,208
Like we talked about some games were playing every now and again in these bright spots that

12
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
I'm started to recognize some of these like unexamined

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,632
Biases I have towards myself for liking video games okay

14
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,728
I would like growing up there was like my parents were very against

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,616
Video Get Lucky play half an hour

16
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,248
It's always been like something that you could be doing something better than that

17
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,320
And I think I have a little bit of self

18
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Appointed

19
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
Stigma about it I'm starting to feel a little bit less

20
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
That way

21
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:12,096
Part of that is just like I'm recognizing there a lot of really good that are a lot of fun and

22
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
I don't know it's it take more a little bit of that shame is good because I've always had that same experience that even if

23
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,104
If you classify it as like a complete Leisure activity you should be doing

24
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
Better Leisure Activia

25
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
You're playing a video game as a Leisure activity

26
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
What you should be doing

27
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Is going out to a park and throwing the ball around its like I get that I'd sometimes I do

28
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,720
The museum

29
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
I think it's good to retain a little bit of it last I defended you only

30
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
I'm finding a balance

31
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:57,408
There's a new Mogwai album about Dan and that is important

32
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,528
Don't be that out my permit

33
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:06,880
No it's not it's really interesting to me that there's a new album all the way in 2021

34
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,744
Because I think the first time I saw them live was in 2001

35
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
And they've been putting out music

36
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Sick since the late eighties

37
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
But it's Mogwai so it's not like

38
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:23,520
It's not like the Rolling Stones at those old bands of like 70 year olds who are still touring

39
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
Weird post-rock so

40
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Everybody who goes is like

41
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,152
I want to hear your new s***

42
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
Post-rock all sounds basically the same have an interesting confession tag I know nothing about

43
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:40,160
You don't know anything about Mogwai Mogwai is one of the most important first

44
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
Scottish band's there's ever been

45
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
Mogwai help

46
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,352
Create the entire genre of post-rock as we know it

47
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:54,752
This is a big blind spot for me clearly cuz you could have told me they were metal or Folk

48
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:01,152
God dammit

49
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Wonder of influencing other

50
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,296
It's only fair that I do not because I got a lot to

51
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,648
Through insurance

52
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047
Jordan 3 episode to go over I think there's a lot of twists

53
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:25,215
Cool boy but

54
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
The first

55
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,311
Hendersonville Nike walk

56
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,175
Kiwibank is about you and I'll probably walk

57
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
I'm a policy wonk

58
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
Enemies

59
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,975
Could you very much however you are also my enemy for Iams Bungalow to Orono

60
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,095
Next thank you to eviscerated by a Reptoid over Cadbury eggs

61
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Very much

62
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,191
Vision of all of our faith

63
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
I'm a policy out there actually it's two people

64
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
The technocrats so maybe they're both

65
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,575
Technocrat or technocrats

66
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
You decide

67
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,879
I'm a policy wonk

68
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,327
What's the business

69
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Money off that heroin

70
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,911
Why you poop so good

71
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,215
Freakishly large

72
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Thanks so much Madden been

73
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:40,223
Special occasion to celebrate today

74
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Yep

75
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
If mogwai's birthday

76
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,695
Birthday shout-out going out to Easter

77
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,327
Happy birthday a holiday by the name of Easter

78
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,631
The Sumerian god of

79
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:04,031
Nobody know but I am excited that Easter candy start show up

80
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
The Walgreens and what have you do appreciate everything out there

81
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,039
February 15th baby I like those

82
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:18,879
The eggs the that the hard-shelled eggs but many eggs

83
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
Easter I hope you enjoy Smith everybody's doing well

84
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,703
It's terrible but my partner is allergic to

85
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
Peanuts

86
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
And so

87
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
Hoard

88
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,431
Reese's peanut butter eggs and eat them like a squirrel before I get home

89
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,735
Mouthwash and brush my teeth but dance

90
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
They're worth it I'm going to get you some Reese's almonds

91
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
The butter age

92
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,927
My flights

93
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:57,023
We didn't have an episode on Friday and then the interest

94
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Full transparency

95
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Discuss what

96
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,423
Essentially that video of Alex saying that he wished he'd never met Trump

97
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,447
Threw me into a

98
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,079
Fleet tailspin but not for the reason that people who listen to our show or who don't listen to our show by thing

99
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,639
I was flooded my messages and comments

100
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
For people wanting our take on it so naturally

101
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
I sat down to digest this footage

102
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,831
In the name of being able to have a conversation that the audience can understand

103
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
Let's listen to that clip now all together

104
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Part of me

105
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Salvage

106
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
Never met

107
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Unlock

108
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:39,775
Previous

109
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
Those workout

110
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Time space

111
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,295
The 3rd

112
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
Is this is you guys actually

113
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:05,887
Mercedes

114
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
Truth

115
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Oceanaire

116
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
I'm so sick

117
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
Donald Trump

118
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
But I'm not doing this

119
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:36,863
People unfamiliar with Alex Jones or the right-wing media speaker this Probably sounds like a huge huge deal

120
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:41,727
Here's Alex on film saying he's sick of trump and wishes he'd never met Trump Rodger Stone

121
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,311
Listen to our show regularly this probably would less shocking

122
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
Though Alex is created

123
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,919
Personality cult around Trump that he's inexorably typed

124
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
To he also frequently lashes out at Trump in people interrupt orbit

125
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
When things don't go his way

126
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
There was a classic

127
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
Piece of his breakdown after Trump bombed

128
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
Syria in April

129
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
2018

130
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
Yeah then

131
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,391
Of course the old part where Alex yelled f*** Trump a bunch of

132
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,695
That day before he realized he was screaming a lot

133
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
No one will ever know about it

134
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
Betrayed his family and talk about how ashamed you was of trump in a supporting

135
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,559
So out of hand

136
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,095
Shroyer had to try to stop the

137
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,935
The show because Alex was swearing so much and they were out of delay

138
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
So they couldn't believe things

139
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
I see that

140
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,551
It's so f****** clear right now showing

141
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,599
That was a tough drunk Nitro rally

142
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,463
We did a whole episode about that night so if you want to hear about that detail with episode 1

143
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:43,071
But the thing is that might is not at all an isolated incident

144
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
Alex very regularly blows up

145
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
Trump and the reason is pretty album

146
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
Trump doesn't actually care about what Alex thinks but Alex's business model has relied on him claiming the Trump does

147
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
What trumps public actions contradict the version of reality that Alex is painted on his show the only response Alex can have

148
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
What is portrayed as butt

149
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
Betrayal

150
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,903
The alternative is to admit that you're either conned or that you were aware of the Trump associate you were helping

151
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
I'm calling your audience

152
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Neither

153
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Are acceptable for Alex

154
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
Does bran

155
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:14,303
Yeah they don't they don't come off in a

156
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,839
Positive light no matter how you

157
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:22,751
The same thing happened during Alex's March 2019 ask me anything stream that he did which happened after face

158
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Could Purge more count

159
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Did Alex and Infowars ran

160
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,431
And just after Rogan didn't episode with Jack Dorsey where Alex's Twitter ban was

161
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
I was really wrong about how Trump wasn't helping him get it back on social media

162
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,135
And he expressed that inaction on Trump's part as made him turn against

163
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
Trump has all the power in his hands

164
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,255
And he's a good thing

165
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
But the fact that he

166
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Doesn't

167
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
377

168
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Jose Sanchez.

169
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
The end of the day just have

170
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,191
Person

171
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
So he should be abandoned

172
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm unhappy about that cuz I've been persecuted

173
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
A Boy drum

174
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,431
I got is my ratable away

175
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,479
Cast

176
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,063
And it was a r i don't want updated probably cuz of them

177
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
They just run me off Trump's they just make me

178
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Cut against Trump

179
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,183
Trump

180
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
Maybe turn against Trump

181
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
So it doesn't matter

182
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
If Trump is right

183
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,399
If he's going against that way of turning us

184
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
Some of these clips

185
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,239
Might be a little obscure

186
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
No they haven't been

187
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
Seen by multitudes of people there can be argued that Alex said these things that unseen areas of the internet Worley weirdos like me looking

188
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
Unfortunately Alex's literally also said that he hates

189
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,807
Trump more than Hillary

190
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,111
When he was a guest on Joe Rogan show

191
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,159
I don't dislike Donald Trump

192
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
I hate Donald Trump

193
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,655
Because I got behind Hillary was bad

194
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
Because

195
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,527
Donald Trump

196
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
Your trunk

197
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
In a fight like this it's so dumb down

198
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:25,119
That then no matter what I do they take my radicalness

199
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
But it's like

200
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
My legs everyday

201
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,575
This is John from your own personal perspective and I appreciate

202
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
But he's not your daughter know how many people actually think you'd be said he's your identity

203
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,303
You might notice that in these lips

204
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,399
Is clearly intoxicated on air

205
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,823
That's something of a theme and it's something that seems also to be related to the clip that was released by hatewatch

206
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
The clip of Alex

207
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,015
Yeah and you can argue in vino veritas if you would like them not going to

208
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,159
Alex definitely seems Drunk In that clip and but the thing is this is not a behavior that

209
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
Exclusive 20

210
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,207
He's clearly f***** up

211
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,583
In late January 2019 Alex was getting deeply frustrated at being associated with Trump

212
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Partially because

213
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
Does fundraising for Rodger Stones legal defense

214
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Was cutting into his profit

215
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
Rodger

216
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,551
For his his his his his issues

217
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,623
When I get a job here which is great

218
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:57,023
This is just a split where we may not get the funds to find Infowars

219
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
Because the 24/7 Rodger Stone

220
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,519
We can win the battle

221
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Because of that

222
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
Infowars as a bill

223
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
At least 10 times Rodger Stones yes okay

224
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,463
Have 100

225
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
I have all the bills and all they

226
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Equipment

227
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Rodger

228
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Cost money

229
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,079
Playoffs

230
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,455
Alex is definitely more demonstrative and more

231
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
Gregarious I got f***** up you'll still Venture into Minneapolis

232
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
Like he did here

233
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,207
In this segment he was doing on his a big Marathon

234
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,487
EBay 2017

235
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
He said this

236
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Trump

237
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Is the

238
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,799
Johnson holster

239
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,127
Andre neocon Democrat

240
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,199
Trump is

241
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
The Johnson holster

242
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,551
Special complex

243
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,087
I neither just clips about like

244
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,439
Trump they're not even about the people associated with Trump that Alex has gone back

245
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
In 4th on

246
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,255
Heroes 2 villain

247
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
Wings Over and Over

248
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
The point of seeking to make ears that if you follow Alex

249
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,935
You know that him saying that he wishes he'd never met drunk while drunk

250
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Controlled setting where editing is possible

251
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
It's not a bomb

252
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,663
It's a good headline and it seems to have driven some traffic if my mentions or any gauge of that but I'm not sure it's helpful

253
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
And the reason for this is 3-prong

254
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,039
The first is the fact that this is not a comment that

255
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,879
It's necessarily groundbreaking Alex's said a lot of s*** about Trump on his own show

256
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
The second pieces that literally nobody who listen to Alex Jones we care about a 90-second clip being reported on by the Southern Poverty Law

257
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,167
Law Center's hate watch they always check the splc

258
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,567
To trust people I can personally respect the work that the sblc doesn't acknowledge that they are an important entity while at the same time

259
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:23,455
Absolute certainty that no one who believes right-wing propaganda will respect or accept a report

260
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
From the splc

261
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
A very beat up basic piece of right-wing ideology

262
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
She is that the splc is a

263
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,903
Communist globalist front organization

264
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,743
Meant to launder money and demonize Patriots who threatened the globalist established

265
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
Any report coming from that source is go

266
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,351
Going to be basically hot like I'm normal

267
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:42,399
People see a headline that comes from Glenn Beck

268
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Yeah I was going to say it's like you being like Russia's not doing anything evil today

269
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:56,479
Presumably the people that this clip in things like it would be helpful for people who suspected Alex may be a valid source of

270
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
Information

271
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,271
And it turns out those

272
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
People they will not be reached by this reporting at all

273
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,159
That's not to say that the sblc shooting to reporting like this

274
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,047
But the fact that they only they have access to the underlying material which will get into in a minute make

275
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,631
Little bit difficult to believe will help anybody that it could help

276
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:19,519
The people that this hatewatch article appeals to our people who already think or know that Alex is full of s***

277
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,335
The third prong is it this base

278
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,663
Basically just plays the same game that we've done so many times with Alex

279
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,431
The past

280
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,735
The response is predictable and honestly

281
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
It's one that Alex comes out winning

282
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,343
On the evening of March 2nd

283
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
When this article on hatewatch

284
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
Was released

285
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,439
Appeared on the War Room

286
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,207
Too disgusting

287
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,559
It was honestly so formulaic that I probably could have written his responsible

288
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
Before listening to this episode

289
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,679
So here at the beginning of this is Owen

290
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
Introducing this headline

291
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
And asking out

292
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Alex

293
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,127
This is just I just might as well bring this up to his

294
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,455
Kind of funny

295
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
No no that's at that's a different one this one just came out from the Southern Poverty hate Center chisme Southern Poverty Law Center

296
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
Ridiculous

297
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,511
Especially when I work here and I know the true story and then to just read their lies

298
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,863
Howard Jones on leaked video I wish I never met Trump

299
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:23,007
You can see they're calling at the Southern Poverty hate Center preemptively minimizing into writing the headline in the source

300
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
This isn't a big deal to Alex Rowan

301
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,711
The thing about there was that apparently Daily Mail article attributed words that an Alex

302
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
Impersonator said

303
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Do being from Alex himself

304
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,111
It's difficult to tell though because what's apparently parody is

305
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,927
Indistinguishable from things Alex would say himself

306
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,463
From the article

307
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,303
This is normalize Mass extermination to biotech on Humanity

308
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,911
Before the day of our Lord's birth in the name of the satanic pedophile globalist New World Order

309
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
They want Force to knock ulation of the gates vaccine which has the HIV delivery system Gene coding it has HIV

310
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
That's what happens when you defeat

311
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:00,895
Parody

312
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,175
Yeah when you

313
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,503
Finally won over at like SNL can't f***

314
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Touch

315
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:13,695
Have been said by a person doing an impression Metallica said all the time

316
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
Any episode transfer

317
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,263
First it gives him a chance to try and wage of publicity campaign where he's able to see if he can get some cheap attention by yelling about a more pop

318
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Popular broadcaster

319
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
In this case Howard Stern

320
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,151
We're mere days away from staring getting the Sneaky Snake

321
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,015
Second it did distract from the main point of that Daily Mail article which

322
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
Ex-wife house in a helicopter

323
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Which a terrorized their daughter

324
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Show me article

325
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:51,327
In the video exclusively obtained by dailymail.com the couple's twelve-year-old daughter is briefly seen waving before rushing over 2A

326
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Screaming

327
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
It's scary Mommy

328
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
.

329
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
We tried to stay out of Alex's personal life but this incident seems like Alex being a real

330
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Piece of s***

331
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:04,895
Sing on this detail about the stern character seems like a way to make this up the audio

332
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
It's not even care to look

333
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,687
This article

334
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,223
Kind of makes him look like a real piece

335
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,807
Yeah and that's also another thing that's beyond parody

336
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,623
No good or reasonable human

337
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,903
Being would f***

338
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,696
Fly By Their Own

339
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
Child with a helicopter

340
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,048
You've defeated me

341
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,584
That's ridiculous

342
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Yeah

343
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
So we now get to the formulaic

344
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
Exactly what you would have

345
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Alex

346
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
So they're saying that it's a leak

347
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Footage

348
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:38,176
From a documentary filmmaker that you paid

349
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:43,552
On his film even though that's not even actor I don't we didn't pay him to make that he did it on his own

350
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
Turns out those guys work for help. Hey

351
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:49,952
Volume up that whole group

352
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,560
They they came to me and they said we're making this documentary of Paul watch hollifield over here one day

353
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:59,168
They did the interview and they said what's your feelings on Trump and I said most Devil's Advocate it's in the film

354
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:01,472
The part of me hates my life

355
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,056
You know it's terrible I wish I would have met him but I'm still glad I did it

356
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,896
His overall endorsement able always do that you know they always get me on that

357
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:15,040
Here you see the reason why this minute or so clip is not really threatened

358
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,088
Name to Alex at least in the eyes of his Alyssa

359
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,136
It was taken out of context

360
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,000
Which is the standard excuse that everyone in the right-wing media knows damn well they can use to get out of almost

361
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:26,560
Any situation

362
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
It happens all the time because it's something that the audience has been trained to accept

363
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Particularly when the clip

364
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,496
It's sad to be out of sorts.

365
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,800
Sinfully maligned like the splc

366
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,104
The audience requires an answer for that clip

367
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
Because people are posting it around

368
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,456
Just delivered by Alex saying it's out of context

369
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
That's enough

370
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,856
The audience does not then become curious about the larger context is matter is just dead

371
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
Yep and you know what

372
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Alex is standing on

373
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:56,512
Slightly sturdier ground here than he normally is when he makes that claim

374
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:00,608
I went my re-watch the full documentary called you can't watch this

375
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
And the part that that clip is in

376
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Part of it is in the movie

377
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
Here is that

378
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Part of me

379
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,736
Salvage Farm

380
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,296
Wish I never

381
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,648
Fantastic business out of

382
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,280
But it's doing great business I hope your audience

383
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,096
I just want to finish by saying your reputations amazing

384
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:36,960
I will not let you down

385
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Into that

386
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,080
Vortex

387
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Yourself

388
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
Everything I did everything I was

389
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
I was trying to do

390
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,160
That point didn't matter how diverse it

391
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Better

392
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
Did that

393
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
It made from

394
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
They understand

395
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
Donald Trump

396
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
We've been merged together

397
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
End of this

398
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Obsessed weather

399
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:30,976
Target on my back

400
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Promote

401
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
America's resurgence

402
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
To promote

403
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Bootcamp

404
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,056
This was a real bad

405
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Crazy

406
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
I left it at the beginning and end of the show that that

407
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
That's where

408
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,928
If you listen to the clip that's included in the final product of the documentary

409
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,280
It's not really saying anything too different from what Alex is saying in the newly-released clip

410
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah I didn't know that that was in there and not happy about that

411
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,752
Particularly around how the identity that Alex enjoyed

412
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,544
Prior to being associated with Trump

413
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,592
I swallowed up by this new images

414
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,504
Make no mistake though he did create that image any profits offer

415
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,904
Because that does seem something like a very clear-eyed evaluation of how things have gone which makes me think he's been listening

416
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
I show too much

417
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,584
That fits in the documentary is somatically the same as

418
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:42,656
The only difference is that Alex seems to be

419
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,936
A little more mad

420
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
And he's having a little bit of an outburst someone shoved Isis up there

421
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:55,456
Dirty a****** I of course I don't care if you've already said enough

422
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,808
Tough to top that if I told you you should

423
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,880
F****** up the bass up your dirty ass

424
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
I don't think we would be

425
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,560
If you're on the lights

426
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,400
It's what's been said

427
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,800
So the thing that I find fascinating here is that the Clipper to the documentary is actually a clear articulation of Alex

428
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
The clip released by hate watches

429
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
Is interesting only because it appears to show a secret revelation

430
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
An emotional out

431
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:34,368
You can see emotional outbursts on Alex's show everyday

432
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:38,464
Secret Revolution ultimately here's one of the things that I'm really struggling with

433
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,000
As far as I can tell

434
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,864
It's someone who watched the documentary is watched Alex's show around the time that this

435
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Documentary was being filmed

436
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:50,496
I do think that the clip is taking Alex out of context

437
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,104
Alex was struggling with his identity at the time

438
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
According to hate watch this documentary was filming in January 2019

439
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,552
Which is exactly when Alex was spending a lot of time on are discussing his desire to

440
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,576
Get back to his roots

441
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,392
And not be so singularly associated with Trump

442
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:12,000
Here's a clip from the January 28th 2019 episode of the show

443
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,840
Where Alex discusses how he doesn't just want to talk about Trump and Rodger anymore

444
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
Audience

445
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Wanted to go back

446
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Back to his roots

447
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
I don't want to just cover Trump

448
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,776
Rodger Stone like Rodger

449
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,104
It's taking all the oxygen out of the room

450
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,664
Stuff going on around the world

451
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
Iran on the edge of Israel

452
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,016
What's happening in Venezuela

453
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:38,624
What's get ready for China collapse which I agree with

454
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,928
Elsa jumping on the bandwagon

455
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,232
Usher's Love the show

456
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,120
Secret society some and the globalist and

457
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,240
Weather modification because the last 3 years

458
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
It's an Ultra Ball the time

459
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,920
He'll still be alive

460
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,760
It's just I don't want to cover every facet of everything from Josh

461
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,320
Alex was feeling like hit his identity and Ben

462
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,856
Subsumed by the Trump

463
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,904
You clearly was greatly

464
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,072
Feeling some kind of backlash from the audience over there

465
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,864
They were expressing that they weren't

466
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
There was some

467
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
Whatever it was

468
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,752
Cuz maybe it's somebody who works it in for the maybe it was

469
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:31,360
An outpouring of feedback from the audience right we miss back when you were fun

470
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,224
This is Vegas boring in OneNote feel like this is such a

471
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Nothing

472
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,552
Simply because it's

473
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:42,112
Seems impossible to believe

474
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,904
Impossible for me to believe

475
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,952
Then any right-thinking person

476
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
Would look at the

477
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Grifters

478
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
Not think they all actually hate Donald Trump

479
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:54,400
Like in the primary

480
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
Hey Tim

481
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
Bill Hader

482
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
But it's just part of the

483
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,824
Game he won the game and now they have to lick his boots

484
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,152
Any reasonable person would be like

485
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:05,920
Donald Trump

486
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:10,784
Yeah I think I think anybody except the most ambitious grifter would have

487
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
Receive it like okay

488
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,392
The money is falling fast

489
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:19,232
Most ambitious grifter would have probably the best might have paid off

490
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:26,144
I'll probably not be alone don't know if anybody who boosting Rand Paul is

491
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,472
Making a lot of money

492
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:33,568
This was part of a larger. In time where Alex's

493
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,896
Really f****** tired of Rogers legal fun siphoning donation

494
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
Definitely this phase but he was in unilag

495
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:43,552
That that legal fees and

496
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
This disillusionment with trumpet wanting to be who used

497
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,904
Going on

498
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
In January 2019

499
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,096
And if you pay attention to Alex and you were listening to it you would know that this stem from Alex being mad at Trump

500
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
For not declaring a national emergency

501
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Close our Southern border

502
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
This was deep in the

503
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,056
Caravan propaganda cycle of 20/19 Owen Infowars world

504
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Trump not

505
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,224
Declaring an emergency and season complete power was essentially him allowing all Americans to be murdered by MS-13

506
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
Just hard to rationalize

507
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
So Alec

508
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,064
Turned on Trump for a little while

509
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,880
That was a really rough situation for Alex

510
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
Because he had all the

511
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,976
But guaranteed the Trump was about to declare an emergency

512
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Has he heard we can be heard here

513
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:29,120
Watertown to be alive my friend

514
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Privately

515
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,920
I remember that one I like private declaration

516
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
On their faces

517
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,760
It's as if they're being let up before 8

518
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
Firing squad

519
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
Or how about this clip

Declaration of emergency

How old is going to end

530
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,064
The globalist want to fight

531
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,864
Here in January 2019 the migrant Caravan fears were the biggest story in the right-wing media and Alex it essentially gone all

532
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,656
Clinton Trump declaring a national emergency

533
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,264
Read it a special evening stream to celebrate the Declaration that

534
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Didn't end up happening

535
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
That's f****** embarrassing

536
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:47,456
Understandably a little bit raw bout it after the fact

00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
Yale for his writings

541
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Smart guy

542
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
He concurs with what I've said

543
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
Essentially is no longer

544
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,712
He is advocated his responsibilities he shies away

545
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
Pettigrew people around him

546
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Are the helicopters

547
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
What you can do in a cloud

548
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
So this is one of the things that makes a clip like this really it's incredibly difficult to understand without a nuanced understanding about

549
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,280
What is propaganda

550
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
In the context of the things are set in

551
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,400
Alex angry sick of trump is attention-grabbing

552
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,240
What is completely in line with what he was saying on are around this time

553
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
And we were talking about back.

554
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Alex was

555
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,384
Sick of his identity being associated solely with Trump

556
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,176
Which expresses more coherently

557
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,736
In the tape that they actually use in the documentary

558
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,808
I went to said way worse things about Trump on his show

559
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,904
Like before decided to support him for president back in 2015

560
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,488
How to regularly talk about how Trump was a front man for the mob

561
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
You going you show it

562
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
University

563
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,424
Palisades houses 40 million 13

564
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
Is this Donald Trump

565
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,848
Just a front man

566
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
For some

567
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
And

568
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
They go in there

569
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
This is mind-blowing I don't know what to say anymore

570
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,536
And like he did this a lot

571
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
Donald Trump owns a bunch of casinos

572
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,424
Donald Trump's bunch of stuff he's basically the frontman

573
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,056
More

574
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,336
The last 30 years so

575
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:56,736
You can bet this is all this phone I have sources

576
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
Shop

577
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
John Trump

578
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:12,352
Haha

579
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,448
This is the reality of a clip like the one released by hatewatch

580
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Schroeder's clip

581
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,800
It's simultaneously in and out of

582
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Contacts

583
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
I do believe it captures a moment of frustration where Alex is pissed off about how pigeon-holed he's become as a trumpet cheerleader

584
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
But I don't

585
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,296
I think that the moment means anything outside of the

586
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,112
Exciting people who already don't like Trump or out

587
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:34,880
Yeah

588
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:40,000
For me this falls into about the same heading as that Bon Iver parody song that was made about Alex

589
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:44,352
It feels like an attack but in reality you just blaze directly into his hands

590
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Consider this

591
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
I hate Alex Jones

592
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,728
I don't know podcast about how full of

593
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
Shiki is 4 / 4

594
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
4 years

595
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:55,616
And when I heard him respond to this clip by saying that it's out of context

596
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
I don't think he's totally wrong

597
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,528
The heat watch article doesn't discuss the other version of this clip that appears in the documentary

598
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,344
Nor does it address what was going on in the world around

599
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,136
What time is the documentary was filmed

600
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,696
Could have contributed to what their readers were seeing

601
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,304
Perspective these are important aspects the understanding that clip because

602
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
Without knowing what was going on it

603
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,448
Really easy to see that clip and make up your own story in your mind about what Alex

604
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
Still when he says I'm so f****** sick of

605
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,288
Trump

606
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
You never met him you can

607
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
Can come up with your own explanation of what that means

608
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
And it's

609
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
Not

610
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,224
It's pretty clear you know what was going on

611
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,320
He means by that tweeted out immediately cuz I got all those

612
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:39,392
I got all those

613
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
Suggest an ad for Alex and the film

614
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
That's what it is

615
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
I know it's not

616
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,072
It's just because God dammit Dan

617
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,632
How many times are we going to do

618
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,936
Snap-on

619
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,496
That's why this episode is going to be a little bit

620
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Dunno different

621
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,800
Is because

622
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,592
The frustration of

623
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,688
Everybody wants us to cover these things that go viral

624
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
3 years ago

625
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:12,416
Is that like this is a little bit different than those other instances or because

626
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Caseware

627
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
I do believe that it's

628
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:16,512
In context

629
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:19,840
Inasmuch as it is a video that doesn't have like a bunch

630
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Quick Cuts

631
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,656
No it is Alex saying I'm f******

632
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,424
I'm sick and tired

633
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Trump gaffe

634
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,728
You know it is that

635
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,336
It is also divide of the surrounding context that could be accessed

636
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,432
I mean just by listening to his show

637
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,016
I mean there's a certain part of me that night that is not ansible

638
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Yeah just because

639
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Look

640
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,928
You shouldn't I mean it's not you shouldn't be paying attention to that world

641
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm not going to I'm not going to say that it's

642
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,608
It's hard to pay as much attention to it as we do

643
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
And that's something that you know we constantly has

644
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
To check ourselves on in terms of being like

645
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
How can you possibly not be aware of

646
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:05,408
Sweetly sensible thing to not be aware of what there's absolutely value intake

647
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
Something that otherwise people would

648
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,224
No

649
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
And bringing it out to them

650
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
I get tons of people who don't pay attention to Alex and just know of him I'm sure it's a very Valley

651
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,184
Valuable thing for them

652
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
You know also

653
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
He's full of s***

654
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,352
You know and if they didn't know that and now they do that's a

655
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,704
Positive this is where we get to why we didn't have an episode on Friday

656
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,544
When I was exploring some of these ideas and listening to this clapping

657
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
And what-have-you I realize the cover and Alex's response to it would be unsatisfied

658
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:43,296
I didn't want to do an episode where we look at this and then just say that Alex said that the clip was it that was released without a context in the

659
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,064
The best I can say

660
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Kind of

661
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,112
I felt like

662
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:51,232
Too close to defending Alex

663
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
I felt like the best thing I could do is try something

664
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,120
I've never tried before and that was make some inquiries

665
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:58,912
I said emails made

666
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Bunch of phone calls

667
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,776
I'm tried everything I could think of other than starting a social media pressure campaign

668
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
Because I'm opposed to those

669
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,664
But I was trying to get access to the raw footage of this clip that hatewatch it released

670
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,968
It came from sea with the surrounding

671
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Discussion was around that

672
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,368
What happened after Alex walked off camera as he does at the end of that clip

673
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,256
Did he immediately clarify himself or did he sit down and say stuff that made it clear that what he meant is that he f****

674
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,096
Can personally hates Donald Trump as a human and that he's connected to the Mob

675
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,192
I felt unable to wrestle with this clip fully without the surrounding context

676
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:32,960
Tumi

677
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:36,032
This was a headline being presented without a body of text

678
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,568
Yeah then we don't

679
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
World

680
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Headlines

681
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,456
Being their own

682
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,736
Story is not good

683
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
What's with Alex.

684
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:52,672
No one at the splc your hate watch return my calls or emails and my press request went unanswered

685
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,000
But they wouldn't suddenly drop everything for a podcast

686
00:38:56,256 --> 00:39:02,400
Smoke dude I am thinking I understand people are not everyone's aware of us personally or anything

687
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,240
I completely understand and I'm not sure about anybody

688
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,312
I just them saying this to say I tried

689
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,848
To get access to this

690
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
I don't know I take it a little personally

691
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:20,320
Can I junk a roll I do I'm taking a little bit personally I find it I just find it a little bit

692
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,672
That if you're reporting on Alex Jones you can't find

693
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:31,072
The only podcast about it that I put on all the effort

694
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
And then you get to be mad that it didn't work out

695
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,192
Okay

696
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,544
Okay are you going to play the victim for being a better person than me.

697
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,200
I did see however that the producer of the documentary that the clippings from who gave the footage

698
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Hatewatch

699
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,552
Replying to a tweet from one of our listeners that indicated that he would be willing to

700
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
To come on our show

701
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,624
Typically when things like this happen

702
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Ignore them

703
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:00,512
I don't have a lot of interest in doing an interview with someone who comes from the worlds that we cover since I've added

704
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Default position

705
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
Distrust and skepticism towards them

706
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
And I'm not particularly drawn toward making a show like we're b and a propagandist gallate each other until errantly

707
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,824
Don't think I can interview and because I'm famous for saying cut his dick off to Rochester

708
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,128
So true I would make things a little bit at

709
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,408
Cereal

710
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:19,712
Convinced that I should interview him and you were

711
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
Strongly opposed

712
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:27,136
Yeah so I figured a middle ground would be to reach out to him and see if he was open to letting us review the larger context of the clip that was

713
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Released

714
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,696
I made guarantees to everyone that I

715
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,512
I spoke to that I would respect the right of hate watches reporting

716
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,864
I wouldn't scoop them by releasing Clips they may or may not be working on for future story

717
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
The documentarian

718
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
Caitlin Robin Roberts

719
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,240
Said that he gave the footage hate watch

720
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,568
Discuss what it was like to work with Alex

721
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,872
I responded by asking if there wasn't

722
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
Exclusivity situation hate watch

723
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,968
At which point he stopped responding

724
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,296
It's entirely possible that he saw me at someone just out to get the

725
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,392
The footage to create clickbait and undermine whatever plans there may or may not be for release

726
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:04,768
Sure he doesn't know me at all and I can't begrudge someone being careful about who they would trust online

727
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
So this didn't seem too strange to

728
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:13,472
I think I moderated my tone but honestly I might have come off as a little thirsty for the footage maybe it's really hot

729
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,800
Hard to tell how your tone works you are a little thirsty for the foot

730
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,016
As Wednesday became Thursday I realize that we needed to record an episode

731
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:29,088
Set alarm the audience expected that we would be covering that clip

732
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
I hate watch released in there without the larger footage

733
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,208
I didn't have much to bring to the table

734
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:39,072
There's a larger context Alex is still an ass-whole he lies about everything but there's nuanced here that might have been

735
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,400
I didn't know what to do but

736
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
At that point

737
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
I still thought there was a chance

738
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,728
Did someone get back to me

739
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,872
Covid is a total pain in the ass so I can understand the bureaucracy the splc and hate watch being slow down a little bit

740
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,687
So maybe I hear back on Thursday or Friday

741
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,223
MSI decided to punch

742
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,271
To Monday to make the best episode we could

743
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
But that was the point

744
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
But here we are on Sunday and no one's

745
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,623
And there's not much

746
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,903
To say other than that

747
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,231
The splc is bad now.

748
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
If I didn't have the raw footage I felt like I was at a dead end

749
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,703
That said I'd already thought a lot about this clip and I had some things I wanted to say about it so we have to do this

750
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
Jeppesen

751
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,775
I decided to re-watch you can't watch

752
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
How

753
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,127
I could watch it

754
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,783
I wanted a job down some questions that I would like to ask Caitlin Robin

755
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
Robertson

756
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,391
To see where I would take a theoretical future interview

757
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,159
OverWatch

758
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
What's through that lens

759
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
A ton of question

760
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
Jim came to mine

761
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
Particularly about the state of mind one is in while creating

762
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,631
Clearly full of s*** propaganda documentaries that feature

763
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
Opinions of extreme

764
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,751
It's like Alex Jones Tommy Robinson Laura Loomer and Gavin McInnes

765
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,055
As well as I believe Wiley

766
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Coyote

767
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
I got into this idea

768
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,943
So early on Friday I said Kalin another message

769
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,247
Explaining the reasoning to my wanting raw footage

770
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Listen to better understand the context

771
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:08,415
I also said that if that wasn't possible I still might want to chat and then if he was interested

772
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,695
I could email over

773
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,743
Questions you could decide whether or not he wanted to

774
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
Participate

775
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:16,607
I'd absolutely no interest in blindsiding anybody and I felt like he could

776
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
See the question

777
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,167
The tone of what I was looking

778
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
Sing for

779
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,983
And decide whether or not he wanted to participate

780
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,847
I did not know about to be fair I'm just saying that might sound a little bit

781
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:32,223
Do you know if you're on if you're on a date and you don't get a response for a day and then you come back with

782
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:38,623
I might answer questions yeah it was definitely reason I didn't send another message after this one

783
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,791
I'm also not interested in harassing somebody and I felt like another unanswered message in this change would look good look

784
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,239
The guy who keeps sending messages

785
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,519
Yeah that could be dropped

786
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:59,615
It dawned on me that I knew very little about this guy Kaelyn Robertson

787
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,711
The right-wing media but he's a behind-the-scenes guy

788
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,759
And is only direct association with Alex

789
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,807
So I was in this film you can't watch this

790
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
Switch didn't impress me much

791
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,647
I didn't cause a big splash when it came out

792
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:16,255
The hay watch P says that Robertson has disavowed the far-right in

793
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
Controlled hatewatch

794
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:22,399
He's working to undo the damage he did while producing propaganda for extremists such as Jones

795
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,191
That's good

796
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
But words like quote

797
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Producing

798
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,799
Propaganda for extremists like Jones

799
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
All the kind of words that make me curious

800
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
What other sorts of extremist

801
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:37,503
Are we talkin about you you know I read that line in my immediate thought was

802
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,039
Tell me again

803
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,391
Exactly how he is disavowing and improving from there

804
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,207
Give me line by line

805
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
Do not tell me that

806
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
He told you

807
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
He was disavowing the far-right

808
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
And you took him at face value

809
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:58,495
I started poking around at this dude's fingerprints are on so many of the side characters we've discussed on the show

810
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
He used to work at Rebel media

811
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
He did extensive work with Tommy Robinson

812
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,967
He directed to flagrantly racist and intentionally manipulative documentaries with Lauren Southern

813
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
And perhaps most interesting

814
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,295
Langley he was the uncredited

815
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
But at very least a man and probably editor or director of Stefan molyneux film The Hundred Year March

816
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,023
Philosopher in Poland famous for his

817
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,423
Declaration of I am a white nationalist empirically

818
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,471
We covered that

819
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,543
Entire documentary divided its episode 285

820
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,311
Lore podcast

821
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
But not only does Robertson bows

822
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,455
This impressive list of right-wing should had credentials

823
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:44,831
He also went along on that trip that Lauren Southern and Stefan molyneux took to New Zealand in 20

824
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
18

825
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Spoke prior to their talk

826
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,231
After screaming screaming his very racist film farmland

827
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
Which argues that black South Africans are trying

828
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
Kill all the white Farmers there

829
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,631
Here's a little clip of him giving us

830
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,983
My name is Kailyn

831
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,799
With my colleague George Lounge on

832
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,407
Incredibly challenging Craigslist

833
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
But together

834
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
Highly emotive subject

835
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
Very very

836
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
In the right way

837
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
Are so powerful

838
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,327
Every child properly now

839
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,863
Case you're interested here's widths

840
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,167
Stephon was talkin about that evening

841
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Giordano's, Gaston

842
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
Appreciate being hairstyle

843
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
Pedicure

844
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:45,759
Now the beginning

845
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
So I thought

846
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
I've heard about the noble savage

847
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
Pull up

848
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
Data analyst find out so

849
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,935
We started researching into

850
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Average

851
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,871
My plane is going down sir

852
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
But it's important

853
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:20,063
It's important because classical

854
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
About

855
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,743
European

856
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,279
West Katella to the White Sox

857
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
And then does the Aborigines

858
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:32,607
Collision

859
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:36,959
11

860
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:42,335
Who invented a good way of Altar and civilization

861
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,431
Whitewashing

862
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,991
And another

863
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
And then like

864
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
Engine

865
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,647
Call Twisted lose that you

866
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,463
Cutting tool

867
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
Manipulator

868
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
Giant red Vending

869
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:10,751
Wow cool stuff. I want him to get Collision

870
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,287
The New Zealand and also that

871
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
Christchurch shooter donated money to

872
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,639
Stephane molyneux and was a big fan of Lauren Southern

873
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,455
Images Manifesto the great replacement which is he

874
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:24,575
Conspiracy about white genocide that Lauren Southern's movies are based on which were directed by Kaylin Roberts

875
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,927
So real quick if I played Caitlin speed

876
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,487
Good thing you told people that he disavowed that

877
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:34,559
He said that in that speech in New Zealand

878
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,375
That he was covering this very sensitive topic

879
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,911
Think about the South African farmers

880
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,471
It was crucial to tell their stories properly

881
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
What about that

882
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,847
In a very interesting review of Lauren Southern other film borderless

883
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,639
The YouTube commentator Jose

884
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Interesting problem about how Farmland told the stories of these farmers

885
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Here's a little clip

886
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,855
From Jose's video titled the many lies of border

887
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,463
Towards the end of the video I highlighted one of Lauren's major

888
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
Works and that's the movie

889
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:04,767
Farmland

890
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
A movie that advanced

891
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,607
Erases conspiracy theory that blocks

892
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,631
Africans were out

893
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
How to kill wife

894
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Farmers

895
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Fueled by

896
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Some sort of

897
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,751
Racial animosity that's

898
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
Chin. Bye-bye

899
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
South African

900
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Petitions

901
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,151
In that movie a woman named Janine ihunt Phelps

902
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:26,015
Had the gruesome details of her father's murderer used to it that said racist conspiracy theory

903
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,575
I mentioned that I didn't believe Janine was a willing

904
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:30,879
Participant in this evidence by the selecter

905
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,903
Evangeline ever entered

906
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,463
Interview of May 2019

907
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
I can tell told

908
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
Ariel Levy

909
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,583
Writing for the New Yorker that she had been interviewed under a false

910
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:43,167
I felt exploited

911
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:48,031
Another farmer phone me to say he's got this Canadian chicky doing a documentary about the drought

912
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
Can you bring her to me

913
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,127
Hence I was in my farm boots

914
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:52,895
My shorts

915
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
To go and show them the effect

916
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
Of the trout

917
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
On the farm

918
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,015
I mourn sat down and said

919
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,551
Tell me about your dad

920
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Completely caught

921
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,903
This is a shocking revelation

922
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,719
Because it's not something that can possibly happen by ax

923
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,815
It's the result of a conscious decision to mislead interview subject

924
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,631
An exploit what they tell you by taking it out of context

925
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:15,679
The further the conclusion you want you're probably

926
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
Ganda to arrive at

927
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
The behavior precludes good-faith

928
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,311
There's just no way around. That's not possible

929
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:27,199
As it turns out this is not the only way in which farm lands the documentary directed by Caitlin Robertson

930
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
Fail to tailed woman story properly

931
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,551
In reality her father was killed

932
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
And that is a tragic

933
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:35,135
But the film fails to explain the details of the

934
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:37,183
The crime because they want to use it as a prop

935
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,023
To make the argument that white farmers are being targeted for genocide by black South

936
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
Her father was killed by a guy who'd been working on his farm

937
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
5 days prior this man hit

938
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:49,215
Stabbed his girlfriend who was a person of color to death

939
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,751
And was chased by police

940
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
But not apprehended

941
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:56,639
He went to the woman's Father's Farm killed him and robbed his house and was subsequently arrested

942
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
He's now serving a 30-year set

943
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Denton jail

944
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,783
This is a case of a double-murder and it's sad and an awful crime

945
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
But it's not

946
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,391
Lack of racial hate towards White Farmers which is what kaylyn's filmed

947
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
Portrays it at

948
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:13,279
This isn't telling the story properly it's creating a fake version of a South African woman

949
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Paying to exploit

950
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,095
The further a racist Mario

951
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
And then

952
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
What's further gaslighting an audience of New Zealand well-doing audience warm-up for a guy who decided to be a white supremacist because less of the

953
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,335
Food is dumbass

954
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
He's look I get it but

955
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,455
He told the splc that he disavowed that and he gave them some

956
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Footage of Alex that everybody's already seen before

957
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,575
So he's repented

958
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,903
I'm struggling I'm just whatever really struggling

959
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:44,511
Over the course of the weekend I watched and read everything that was available to be found

960
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
Created about or created by Kaylin robber

961
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,655
Because this picture was just giving me trouble I'm

962
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
I was confused it was

963
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,495
Accidental going down this road but I'm not

964
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
I was interested

965
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
And I was confused

966
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:57,567
Wow

967
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,359
You know what and I look

968
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,663
This is by no means retaliation

969
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,991
I know because we've talked about this every step of the way

970
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
Should have given us that f***

971
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:11,647
No I understand I understand

972
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:17,535
I think it's funny you think that but we talked about this

973
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Extensively

974
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Believe me

975
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
That is not your motivation whatsoever

976
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,471
The more I watched his work the more I didn't like him at all

977
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,031
But the more I watched his interviews

978
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,055
Borat kind of

979
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:29,823
I like them

980
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,223
You going to mentally Charming person and that Charisma probably played no small part in his ability to rise to such a position of prominence

981
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
On these right-wing

982
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
Appearance

983
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Is so critical

984
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
As well as getting them to

985
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Perhaps

986
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
I mean you know like

987
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
Louis Theroux isn't

988
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:47,999
Incredibly Charming person that's part of why is documentaries

989
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:51,839
End up with people saying stuff

990
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
I don't know I I feel like

991
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
EZPawn

992
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:59,007
Interesting and New Yorker would have written

993
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,823
In a glowing profile.

994
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
I would say so

995
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,735
Yeah I mean I'm not immune to it

996
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:15,135
Like watching TV Guide

997
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,719
It's so intriguing is that going on here yeah

998
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:19,999
So

999
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:26,143
Here we are in the present-day and Robertson has disavowed the errors of his ways from a few years ago

1000
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:31,519
He's trying to undo the damage he's done commands that I do I want to be very clear about that

1001
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:38,431
I was curious about the stories of his path to Redemption so I decided to dig a little bit deeper and watch some of the more recent interviews

1002
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,735
That were available out there to try and get a sense of

1003
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
One of the things that I

1004
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,855
Love the most about our podcast and unfortunately

1005
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,927
Maybe tainted now is that episode about Jessica shop

1006
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:55,071
The crystal child school not be as much of a

1007
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,119
Wonderful success stories

1008
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,447
God dammit always looking for something like that.

1009
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,983
For something uplifting it cuz

1010
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
Is it it's so much better than Alex's dumbass

1011
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,847
I know and I think we is that

1012
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,663
That's a great example because I

1013
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,943
Thought about that one a lot

1014
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,783
My exuberance towards Escape was

1015
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
Undeniable

1016
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
But

1017
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,415
The more I've thought about that

1018
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,183
The more Act

1019
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Cannot take

1020
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
People

1021
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,279
At their word

1022
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,839
When they just say that they are

1023
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Disavowal

1024
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,655
And the reason that we

1025
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:31,423
Do

1026
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,703
The reason that we always

1027
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,239
It's because we want

1028
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
You believe that

1029
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,799
Yellow heart

1030
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:39,359
I want to believe this guy but

1031
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,127
The reason that I'm

1032
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
Against

1033
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,431
Believing

1034
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,711
That this guy is

1035
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
But that's about it

1036
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:46,271
Is because I know I want to

1037
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,599
Cuz I know that part that provides hope for me for my f******

1038
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,415
Family that provides hope for me for so many other

1039
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:59,071
Books you can come back and so I am not going to trust anybody and that also is what

1040
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Makes like

1041
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
I'm struggling

1042
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,399
With the idea that

1043
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:05,215
It feels like we might be attacking him or something

1044
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
Because I don't want

1045
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,591
Attack the idea that it's possible for your family or for people around you

1046
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
I'm just

1047
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:19,039
Curious and I want to deal with reality on realities term

1048
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,063
That I talked of course

1049
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,343
Everything I say is

1050
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,367
Sounds like

1051
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
Is that

1052
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
He is learned

1053
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
Where are you

1054
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
He's earned where we got

1055
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,191
And if you want to go somewhere else you have to earn it

1056
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
And those

1057
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:43,359
Maybe they don't have to equal but I'll tell you that given a few Clips to the splc is not for earning your way

1058
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
Way out of being a

1059
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,407
Shitbag

1060
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
That you were right

1061
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
A couple of important points

1062
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
It's one that's not frosted

1063
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
And

1064
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,111
But you can have your feeling and you're entitled to your feelings

1065
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
You're not the judges of

1066
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
This person absolutely not

1067
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,023
We cannot possibly know

1068
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
What he's done

1069
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Privately

1070
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,679
He doesn't owe anybody like us

1071
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,703
An apology

1072
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,519
He has made amends with folks

1073
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,847
Behind-the-scenes privately and I think that maybe even more appropriate

1074
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,663
Then anybody. No one's actually what he should be

1075
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,223
Yeah absolutely can't judge

1076
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
Whether or not that's the

1077
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
McKay's

1078
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
And I'm not sitting here saying he has a

1079
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,879
I'm saying I'm struggling with this

1080
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,207
Because I believe wholeheartedly in

1081
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,255
I believe wholeheartedly

1082
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,047
People can make it out

1083
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:34,815
And

1084
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,863
Often times their stories on the other end

1085
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,143
Can be very

1086
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,727
Uplifting and helpful for people

1087
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,519
Yeah I also don't

1088
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,311
Don't think it's appropriate

1089
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Pretend

1090
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
But this history isn't what it is

1091
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
Exactly like

1092
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,991
Did Redemption needs to take stock of the

1093
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,783
The professional career that

1094
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
Baguette the Redemption

1095
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,439
100% And I was not convinced of that until I was watching this

1096
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
As I was looking

1097
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
The story of

1098
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,839
You know the uplifting this

1099
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
This doesn't make sense

1100
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,679
There's something that doesn't match up

1101
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:17,567
The first thing that stuck out to me was an interview that Robertson did with a Muslim activists in the UK named Ali dawah

1102
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:21,407
Ali and Tommy's crew had a really high profile running

1103
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,711
Mean in the past back in May of 2018

1104
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,527
Surrounding a rally the Tommy with the wrong called Freedom Day

1105
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:31,135
The event was supposed to be a free-speech rally so Allie requested to speak

1106
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
At the rally

1107
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:35,999
Why wouldn't a free-speech rally you I want to have everybody have speed

1108
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,559
Initially he was told he couldn't

1109
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,375
But ultimately he wasn't allowed to when he was rapping

1110
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
Threatened and attacked by Tommy's fans at the event

1111
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
This interaction between

1112
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,007
Miley and Kaitlynn

1113
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,543
When in September 2019

1114
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:51,103
It's actually really fascinating for a number of reasons

1115
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,943
The first is just a simple fact that these two people who are on opposite

1116
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
What size of things a little over a year prior

1117
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
We're now able to

1118
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
Polite conversation

1119
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,647
The other reason is that halfway through their interview gets interrupted by an

1120
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,999
An old British islamophobia spouts a bunch of anti-muslim talking points at Ally

1121
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,559
For no other reason than because he looks like a Muslim

1122
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
Do you know

1123
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,375
Get sidetracked and derailed by the

1124
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
The consequences of kailyn's

1125
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
Prior action

1126
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:22,591
It's almost as if this interview was metaphorically Express into the damage that Caitlin didn't is past lives on no matter what he does

1127
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
And beyond that

1128
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
ATM gets in the way of and will be a

1129
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,223
Constant problem even when he's trying to do good

1130
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,295
I see presumably is by having this chat with Ally

1131
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,599
It's remarkable how this turn of events

1132
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
Captures a reality

1133
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
And a metal real

1134
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
And both

1135
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,231
Involve the person in Body by Ali

1136
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:44,095
Patiently trying to deal with the aftermath of what this white nationalist propaganda has done to

1137
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,679
The reason I find this interview the most interesting however is

1138
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,727
Because of one detail that Kailyn gives

1139
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
While discussing that Freedom Day March

1140
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,311
I was all about fries

1141
00:58:54,335 --> 00:59:00,479
I remember when you were invited when you made the offer we were in a room with domain

1142
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:06,879
Hotel room

1143
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:13,279
Lucy was like he might be

1144
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
And it wasn't

1145
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,887
You arrive

1146
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:24,287
. the head of the DFA lay with a Leo B B far-right group football

1147
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,175
Text if you let him onstage will throw this age-old

1148
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:50,655
I'm here

1149
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,823
Pokemon

1150
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,175
And you said just a minute and he said yes

1151
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,479
And that's only realize

1152
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,759
That moment

1153
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
But he didn't give up

1154
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,903
No but we were quite convinced like I

1155
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,463
You

1156
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,071
We are like a cool penticostale - there's a lot of far-right idiot that we don't want

1157
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,631
But we genuinely believe that f*** you

1158
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:26,495
F*** you was the moment that was the moment

1159
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,823
I have no idea what was said when Kaelyn's might cut out their butt

1160
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,407
The gist of that story is that when Tommy was okay with the idea

1161
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,247
Free speech of

1162
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,271
Because he was Muslim

1163
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,111
He made Kaelyn wake up and realize the Tommy didn't care about free speech at all

1164
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:47,743
The conversation goes on to be about Hitomi uses Free Speech rhetoric as a mask to hide his real agenda

1165
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:51,327
Which is racism generally an anti-islam vegetation

1166
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,143
Specifically there's no way for him to have known

1167
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,959
Before that point that the far-right did that

1168
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:58,751
It's not possible

1169
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:03,615
The claim that he's making I actually kind of believe in the reason I do

1170
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:06,943
Is it in July 2020

1171
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,991
Easter video to the byline time

1172
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:12,831
Which captures Tommy Robinson essentially saying exactly this

1173
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Back in 28

1174
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Repeat song

1175
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:30,495
Is it awesome

1176
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,575
Imperfect

1177
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:52,511
It's interesting cuz that clip is from 2018 and it seems to be Tommy discussing the idea of doing the Free Speech rally

1178
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,607
Which would be really just to trick large numbers of people to come out who wouldn't show up

1179
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,399
If you're honest by granting Muslim intense

1180
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,727
That Freedom Day event

1181
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,031
Allegedly Free Speech event that year

1182
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:09,663
And he did spend some of 2018 in jail so it's pretty likely that this clip of Tommy

1183
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
Free speech is a mask

1184
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Might have come from

1185
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,319
Before the Freedom Day I got probably say

1186
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
I have a hunch

1187
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
Could

1188
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,135
Be there

1189
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,535
Either way I find it super hard to believe that anyone working with these people wouldn't understand that Dynamic and I think it's super embarrassing

1190
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
Tommy got caught on tape explaining

1191
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,399
The most obvious game his friends play

1192
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,423
Very sad

1193
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
Yeah

1194
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,215
The point here

1195
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,799
Whether or not this tape was from before or after the Freedom Day event

1196
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:40,127
That Day in 2018 is supposed to be the day that Caitlin

1197
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Realize

1198
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,175
The Tommy Robinson use the

1199
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,735
The facade of free speech is a way to cover his racism

1200
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
And trick people into getting involved with

1201
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
I was just so loved

1202
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,087
Tarsus moment

1203
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,135
That rally took place on May 6th

1204
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
2018

1205
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,487
So it's safe to assume that anything that took place after that point

1206
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
Was done with the full awareness

1207
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,351
The whole Free Speech argument from the right-wing media figures is not

1208
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,399
Well then I assume he quit at that point right

1209
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
Has a problem

1210
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
This what you can watch

1211
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
Kaelyn interviews Alex Jones about how he was

1212
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,687
Kicked off all those social media entities were

1213
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,223
What happened in early August

1214
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,039
2018 after the Freedom Day rally

1215
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:23,135
This interview is being recorded in January 2019 even later than

1216
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,719
To reflect on how baby Tommy Robinson isn't the

1217
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:32,351
The only person who uses Free Speech complaints to Mastiff

1218
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:38,751
To make matters worse Tommy Robinson himself as one of the subjects of this documentary and the entire point of it

1219
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,311
If you couldn't tell from the title is it these people who

1220
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,151
Just alternative

1221
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
Only being called racist

1222
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:49,759
The entire concept of this documentary is something that

1223
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:54,879
Based on Cleveland own timeline you should have completely understood was just a way of masking racism

1224
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
Appealing

1225
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
To free speech

1226
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Bulshit

1227
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,743
In January 2019

1228
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,791
At the same time he was making this documentary

1229
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,095
Dude was interviewed by Sky News

1230
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,631
It is interview he tells

1231
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
Story about a short film

1232
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,191
We made about Muslims

1233
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,471
Extremist College

1234
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
The film premiered didn't end up making

1235
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
The client is screening

1236
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,871
To carefully to this interview

1237
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
You might notice Kaelyn using

1238
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,759
Free Speech argument to justify people's racism you think so

1239
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:26,111
Well I made a like I think was a 9-minute film just about a

1240
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,927
It wasn't an entirely but there was like a bunch of Mustangs

1241
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:29,951
Extremist Rebel looking up

1242
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,975
I'm down white Tahoe

1243
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,047
Ivanovich of interviewing a another day we want to talk very much

1244
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
Cameras

1245
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,887
And then I should have one of my lectures and they're like oh this is

1246
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
In the screen ink

1247
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:40,703
I'll be official

1248
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,823
Like I'll be official screening of older short film to the end of the year and I was like oh that's pretty strange to do anything much of it

1249
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:48,639
But then when I started Googling about universe

1250
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,735
Teapot for me things on living. Showing all the old

1251
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,551
Different ideas

1252
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
Contrasting what

1253
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,879
Qdoba

1254
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
They said

1255
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,695
I'm using word inflammatory that eight

1256
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,975
Could be perceived

1257
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,255
I think they

1258
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,815
Wasn't for like a super Insidious way I think they would

1259
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Just trying to be polite

1260
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,631
Translate anyone outside a lot of dick

1261
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,399
People and bring that

1262
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,679
Kind of argument into the

1263
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,239
Do you know I wasn't

1264
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,287
Until I started researching University

1265
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
But yeah that was

1266
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
That was sort of

1267
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
The first time I reckon

1268
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:21,407
But I was going on

1269
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,199
Is it fair for me

1270
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Enjoying

1271
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Adults between

1272
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
And that film

1273
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
And then

1274
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
Get your lace up

1275
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
With Tommy Robinson

1276
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
Informative video

1277
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,415
Yeah well this is why I said at the last race

1278
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Relation as well

1279
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:36,767
If you would only show something maybe we have some

1280
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,815
Difficult conversations and actually not

1281
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Silence freedom

1282
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,607
Silence

1283
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,399
Content then people might not start Quest

1284
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:46,239
Start dedicating the light switch or or getting involved in activism

1285
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
Invited like that

1286
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:51,359
That wouldn't be the case because it wouldn't be there wouldn't be silenced around it wouldn't be these issues

1287
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,151
Sounds like you just about it to me

1288
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
This isn't a

1289
01:05:54,431 --> 01:06:00,319
Appeal to the idea that the left being censorious and limiting free speech of people like Tommy Robinson read racist

1290
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,367
Is what causes people to become races

1291
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:07,999
These people aren't actually even because normal society won't let them at the

1292
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,791
Conversations that they want to have

1293
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:16,191
You know those difficult conversations like the ones is Buddy Stefan molyneux wants to have about phrenology nothing

1294
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
Love more than a

1295
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,567
Pressing people for hundreds of years and then blaming them for making me feel bad

1296
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,639
That was in 20 miles are in January 2019

1297
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,943
Anime 2019

1298
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,527
Human appeared as a guest on RT to promote his documentary

1299
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
If you can't run

1300
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,111
And he discussed with the film covers

1301
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,391
Once again

1302
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,975
After Yorkie should have realized this was no good

1303
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:42,303
Sure he relies on white washing his subjects behaviors

1304
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
By appealing to free speech

1305
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,935
The project looks into how social media is being used as a

1306
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,983
Tool to exclude certain voices

1307
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,287
Focuses on the online war with

1308
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,311
Comic conservative

1309
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,639
And the implications this removal of content house for the freedom of

1310
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,407
Speech

1311
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,687
The director says he hopes

1312
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,759
The film would uncover how serious and widespread

1313
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:02,783
It's become

1314
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,575
And the danger it poses to our culture

1315
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
The film follows

1316
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,439
5 controversial figures who have been victims of social media

1317
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207

Tommy Robinson

1320
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,303
Who founded the far-right English

01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
Facebook accused Robinson

1323
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,167
Promoting hate against the Muslim Community

1324
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
Also featured is Alex

Infowars website

Permanently banned from Twitter Jones is said to have promoted

1328
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
Discriminatory Behavior

1329
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,407
And spread

1330
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175

No he did

1332

Not to discuss the documentary and the issue it touches upon we're joined Now by Kaylin Robertson and executive producer

1333

You're both very welcome to the program Caitlin if we could start with you social media platforms

1337
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,519
Are public forums do not think it's a fair argument to respect the diversity of users

1338
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,823
And not to actively provoke or offend them

1339
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,199
We have all this documentary explores his increasing powers of social media have in

1340
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:08,831
Changing the Overton window and influencing what people cannot watch online with consumers

1341
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:15,231
In in changing elections and this is why it's so important to people argue all well you know their private companies I can do what they want

1342

Directions to my Publishers and they actually have a duty to actually

1343
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
Whole free speech

1344
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:26,495
As one of their core values especially given how important social media is an Honor Society

1345
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,335
Looks like someone's using Free Speech arguments in order to elevate the

1346
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,127
Complaints of Laura Loomer

Century

1350
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:42,879
This is like a year after the Freedom Day rally what do you

1351
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,951
Yeah but you can possibly you can hear in his voice

1352
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
That he recognizes that what

1353
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,279
He's doing is wrong old man

1354
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,559
Killing them on the inside

1355
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,839
This is a man

1356
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:54,911
Crying out for help then please someone

1357
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
Stop me from doing this

1358
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
It seems like

1359
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:03,359
Even though you'd known for at least a year that this was a specifically a tactic that one of his

Text Amie Roberts

1361
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,967
Used to subtly promote racist ideas

1362
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:14,367
Caitlin was still willing to employ the same tactic to subtly promote his film full of bigots to an unsuspecting population

1363
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Strange

1364
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,719
I was sitting with this I was really like this

1365
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,535
What's going on I was wondering why I was even doing

1366
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,095
Yeah yeah

1367
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:27,423
And I want to jump back here real quick cuz I

1368
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,215
Looking for something interesting that I noticed

1369
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,543
In that interview that he did in January 2019 with Sky News

1370
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,359
Illuminating to me cuz

1371
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,151
Here he is discussing

1372
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
I know this is going to

1373
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:40,223
I think this is going to be worse than it is

1374
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,271
But here

1375
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,855
Here's Caitlin saying some things that he thought about the Civil Rights

1376
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,415
Sarah goodnight love with Alexa

With that with the Civil Rights Movement with the rights for women with the right spaghetti

1379
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
If it's groundbreaking

1380
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
That's what made us

Vice news

1382
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:59,423
Great

1383
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,983
Of course everyone told me that night seems they were the ones who

1384

Progressive pairing

1385
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,847
But it wasn't until I actually saw what was going on until I actually started

1386
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,895
Sing the homophobia from

1387
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:12,223
The people that they were already friends with

1388
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,503
But I thought

1389
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
If losing it

1390
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
Stop that I don't know if everybody could be a little bit better

1391
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,119
I do better but I think that if you wanted to compare

1392
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,447
Let's not pretend that there aren't

1393
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,799
Really critical point

1394
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:40,383
To distinguish Caitlin from the rest of the extreme right-wing that he was hanging around

1395
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
His right-wing existence is not philosophical

1396
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,295
It's not rooted in the same Traditions as extreme right-wing Pierce

Is one of the greatest existential threats that the West has ever seen

1401
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,023
If Kailyn was rooted in the morning

French School of the right-wing

1403
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:03,935
He would do things like integration voting rights and lgbtq protections as things or push bike

In order to divide and conquer Society

1406
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,847
He doesn't seem to me from looking through the available information that I can

1407
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
Can find that there's a lot of depth

1408
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,431
To kailyn's right-wing views

1409
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,711
In many ways

1410
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
It seems

1411
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Aesthetic

01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015

Like this clip from July 2017 Oso mad

1417
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,071
But there was a new emoji that got relieved

1418
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
Someone wearing a hijab

1419
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,703
The original ID according to the website was I have an emoji with a dog

1420
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,983
Purple headscarf

1421
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,775
But fearing that was a little bit

1422
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:42,335
To crazy they decided to honor more neutral

1423
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,639
Phone color one which I think is a lot more

1424
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,943
In the change.org

1425
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:49,503
The group asked her they were going to make progress

1426
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,319
If they don't include everyone in their path for

1428
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,951
How on Earth are we supposed to achieve world peace

1429
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,487
Without the right emoji

1430
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
And I don't know about you

1431
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,327
But I'm so proud

1432
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
To see the tech industry

1433
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,375
Making such

1434
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,399
Giant leap

1435
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
For Humanity

1436
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,983
And I tell you I can't wait

1437
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,775
Pontiac GM emojis

1438
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
Oh

1439
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,823
Wow

1440
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,407
Oh wow wow it's like a he's like a

1441
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,967
Paul Watson out there

1442
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
I'm convincingly argues with

1443
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,391
The britisher at war with Islam after the suicide bombing in Manchester in 2017

1444
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,439
Just again this this doesn't feel convincing

1445
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,255
And once again it proved so we

1446
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,047
Currently

1447
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,327
Right now at this

1448
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,679
Very place in time of the 23rd of May 2017

1449
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,703
War

1450
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
On the left

1451
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:46,591
Seems to think that they still dominate them then now except for this entire purse

1452
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Perspective

1453
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:50,431
Katy Perry only hours ago saying that we need to

1454
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Ignore what's going on

1455
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
Keep the borders open and stop

1456
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Hate we've had

1457
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,087
Hundreds of political figures on

1458
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:59,647
Pretty much every side of the political Spectrum up

1459
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,439
And down the country explain

1460
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,207
All of us

1461
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,231
Elektra

1462
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,023
About how we must

1463
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,303
Come together

1464
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,583
How we must Unite

1465
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
And how we must

1466
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119
Not

1467
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
Hate anybody

1468
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
Choose

1469
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,471
But we are coming together

1470
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,519
We're coming together

1471
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,543
As British

1472
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Just people

1473
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
An islamist

1474
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:21,663
I'll coming together as themselves and we are

1475
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,479
Becoming even more of a Target and it's a total

1476
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:28,575
Waste of time we are lying to ourselves if we think that having some sort of

1477
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
Vigil

1478
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Posting

1479
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:34,463
Notes all over City Center saying that we will not

1480
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,255
Kecoughtan lighting candles

1481
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,279
We'll make any

1482
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
Difference

1483
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,423
The only differences between WWII the last time this country looks

1484
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,703
At War as we

1485
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
Arno

1486
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
What's that at least then we could name

1487
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,823
The anime at least then we actually

1488
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Buck

1489
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
I know we don't do it

1490
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:53,919
Even slightly

1491
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,711
Something like that

1492
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
Just seems like an act

1493
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:01,343
Videos and complaining about people cutting loose at Pride

1494
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:03,391
Is a video game complaining about Starbucks

1495
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:05,695
Exchanging our logo in Saudi Arabia

1496
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,231
Feel like it has anything

1497
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,535
10 going on like it feels like a pea

1498
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:11,583
PR person doing the right wing

1499
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,607
Piece of propaganda

1500
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,655
Because that's what it is

1501
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:18,751
He went discuss the beginnings of his career in that Sky news interview for

1502
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
2019

1503
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,567
No like my career was always in Mach

1504
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,847
Cotillion on politics

1505
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,919
Lots of the pr and things like that at University and

1506
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,455
After I graduated you my partner

1507
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
Baby saying I was broke

1508
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
MPR Farms

1509
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,063
And that's where everything was ready focused

1510
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,855
Obviously how I transition

1511
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,135
From

1512
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,415
Traditional established

1513
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,439
I'm sexist

1514
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,463
Into what we doing now

1515
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
So taking all of the

1516
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,047
But stop at a party

1517
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,375
More assertive friends alternative

1518
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:46,655
Subject

1519
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:51,519
This isn't a person is motivated by the same ideologies that many of the people we talk

1520
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
About our

1521
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,823
The Infowars universe

1522
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,639
Particularly in the pre trapera but still to this day

1523
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:01,247
Is based on the Bedrock of ideas disseminated by the John Birch Society and their Associated figure

1524
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,599
It's almost entirely emerging of Cold War anti-communism

1525
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,623
Run amok

1526
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:09,695
And extreme white identity change religious beliefs

1527
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:12,767
That's what you find behind many of Alex's guests

1528
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
And in his own intellectual tradition

1529
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,447
This is the same and intellectual tradition that popularize conspiracies about the globalist

1530
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,751
Switzer morphed into the deep state

1531
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,543
Conspiracies in the past few years

1532
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,359
The cool that Caitlin is swimming in with

1533
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:30,175
Build by anti-communist conspiracy theories

1534
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,735
But I don't get the sense that he knows how the plumbing work

1535
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,527
He knows marketing

1536
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,807
That was his job

1537
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
And he's good at it

1538
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,391
I would say like that alternative

1539
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
So covering the

1540
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Stories

1541
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,231
Allura traditional media established

1542
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:43,999
Immediately

1543
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
Want to talk about or

1544
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,607
Sun covering the other side of the conversation

1545
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,399
Play Life

1546
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,751
I'm bringing production value that as well and legitimizing is argument

1547
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,519
So they're not like

1548
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,543
Fringe Salon

1549
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:59,871
Things on there on the corners of the internet I'm bringing bringing up

1550
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,711
In 2019 while on Sky News prior to being on art

1551
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,527
Tea to promote his free-speech documentary full of racist

1552
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,599
Caitlin fully expresses an awareness that is roll

1553
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,671
Is to take Fringe things make it look presentable

1554
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,231
So the people might get tricked into thinking that their names

1555
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,791
What this one

1556
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
This raises is

1557
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
The question

1558
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Of like

1559
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,655
It doesn't mean it was

1560
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,215
Does it mean to disavow a right-wing ideology

1561
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,007
See if you never f****** believed it in

1562
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:32,895
In the first place if your ideology was simplistic and not really based in the same things that are motivating

1563
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
This

1564
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,479
Wide swath of right-wing

1565
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
Ideology

1566
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:41,087
30 speed back to the militia movement back

1567
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:47,487
What is disobey a z disavowing f****** opportunistic bulshit

1568
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:50,559
Is he disavowing the f****** deceptive editing

1569
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
If you disavow

1570
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,679
Surprise interviews like I want to know what that is

1571
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,215
I think that's one of the things

1572
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
That I'm kind of

1573
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:00,031
Confused by

1574
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:01,311
And I'm interested in

1575
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:05,151
And these are the sorts of questions that were coming up as I as I was

1576
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,991
Taking in a lot of this content

1577
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:12,319
I don't guess it's racism I guess

1578
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,623
Okay fine

1579
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,903
You're a Merc

1580
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
For Nazi

1581
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,975
You're not a Nazi yourself

1582
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:24,095
Yeah I don't think I care about the distinction between those two all too much

1583
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:29,727
Do you know what I'm saying it's not it's not necessarily A

1584
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,567
It's not a disavowing of right-wing

1585
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:38,431
Ideas although there are certainly a lot of racist problems

1586
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,711
I don't get the Sun

1587
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,271
There was anything other than

1588
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,087
Like

1589
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:51,487
Yeah I I found a guy answered an ad

1590
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:57,887
Like make these PR puppies and I was like I'm good at that and then six years later it turned out being a Nazi

1591
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,215
Is wrong it turns out there is a wall

1592
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:06,847
Yeah I don't think I'm going to be able to work at CNN is a line producer I've got this on my bag

1593
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:12,479
The thing the thing that I run into that I think is really difficult is that like I do believe

1594
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:16,319
He probably ended up in a position that was different than where he wanted to be

1595
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,647
I do believe that there is entirely a possibility that like

1596
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,463
Some of that radicalization did happen

1597
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,999
Total eclipse from everything

1598
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
I can tell

1599
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,655
It's not the story of somebody who got sucked into YouTube algorithm

1600
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,983
Yeah I got into right-wing ideology or something like that

1601
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,031
It's a somebody who sought out

1602
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:40,639
Working with Tommy Robinson and rebel media in order to produce

1603
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,663
Racist

1604
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,991
Content that looked better than what was being created at the time

1605
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,063
Yeah Market in efficient

1606
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:49,087
Yeah yeah

1607
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
Yeah and

1608
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:53,439
Which is also incredibly fun

1609
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,487
Locked up

1610
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:59,583
That's not Beyond Redemption 2

1611
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
Different

1612
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,167
It feels different than the

1613
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,191
Story

1614
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,751
We're being told that you like them the story

1615
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:09,055
That you get from reading that hatewatch article

1616
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,127
But it's not it's not

1617
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:14,687
To be a person who's Beyond

1618
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,247
Care it's not or not

1619
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,783
It's not Beyond respect

1620
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:25,183
Like I'm going to look a little bit this person for an oil

1621
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,487
Sure can redeem

1622
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
You know

1623
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,303
Loyal company

1624
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,583
He's destroying the world your work

1625
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
Essentially evil organization

1626
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,215
But that's different

1627
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
It's different

1628
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,823
It really is different from being part on parcel of

1629
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:44,639
People who are there to inspire vial

1630
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
That's what

1631
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,503
Cuz that's ultimately the reality of it

1632
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,575
I get that maybe he wasn't a believer in the.

1633
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Deepest deep end

1634
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:56,159
He is still producing content

1635
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,951
That is only design

1636
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
To drum up

1637
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Violets

1638
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,071
Did I mean anything new that

1639
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,119
Hey here's what else you knew

1640
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
He knew

1641
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,167
Vitale

1642
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,727
Would get murdered good yeah

1643
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:13,824
Right so he knows that violence is absolutely on the table

1644
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Andy's

1645
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Probably

1646
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,408
He probably knows

1647
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
Dory should

1648
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,736
Or you would have to be incredibly stupid

1649
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,760
Not to know

1650
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:27,136
That that is the f****** the result of what they do is that group

1651
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
People texting Tommy Robinson saying will

1652
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Who killed that guy

1653
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
Yeah that's the result

1654
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
Apart

1655
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,584
It's the face of it it's the idea

1656
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:44,288
Production of this documentary about Free Speech being infringed to these

1657
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
For people who are

1658
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,872
Sweet bigots sure like that would

1659
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
Going on

1660
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,432
After

1661
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
He had

1662
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
The Freedom Day

1663
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
Experience

1664
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:59,648
Top It's just tough for me to swallow

1665
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,000
I'm not I'm not trying to be an empathic and I'm not trying to sit on the guy

1666
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,280
And I hope

1667
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
Just don't know man

1668
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,376
I just don't know

1669
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
No I mean

1670
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,472
We talked about this in part of why I was so vehemently against

1671
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,008
Interviewing of Zen

1672
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,800
I don't know if I'll bore you with this

1673
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,824
One more time but

1674
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,872
Whenever

1675
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
My family left

1676
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,408
The Cult

1677
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:24,736
Before they could be accepted I think this is an important

1678
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:28,832
Perspective before they could be accepted back into their family and it took awhile

1679
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,112
It took a while

1680
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,648
They had to send

1681
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,440
Actual letters of apology

1682
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:40,096
Single spaced that actually enumerated we understand where we went wrong and here is what

1683
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,376
We are going to do

1684
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:42,144
About the

1685
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,424
To improve

1686
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,728
This is a genuine apology

1687
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,008
Did you because it's about

1688
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,056
Knowing how to correct

1689
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
The mistake instead of just saying

1690
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,640
I'm sorry for the bad things

1691
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,664
Things that happened

1692
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,200
And that's what I don't

1693
01:21:55,456 --> 01:22:01,600
I think that needs to be made because that's about personal life and I don't

1694
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,928
Entirely in terms of professional life

1695
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:09,792
Because I'm not interested in Caitlin's personal life I'm not interested in anything about that

1696
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,816
I'm very willing

1697
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,352
Going to believe it is a good person

1698
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,144
And that he's had a change of heart

1699
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,192
I'm concerned about

1700
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
Product

1701
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
Concern about the

1702
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,520
The effects

1703
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Do work

1704
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
Like

1705
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,712
To making things right

1706
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,504
Somebody who

1707
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,552
Had his hands in

1708
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
And produce

1709
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:38,976
Slash directed documentaries for Lauren Southern Avenue

1710
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,256
Few years

1711
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,792
It's a path

1712
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,352
It's not that

1713
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:46,144
The public

1714
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
Has been hurt

1715
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,704
Buy them a lot

1716
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,752
I do think that the

1717
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,848
Things that you can see online things that he said

1718
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:56,128
They do give me any

1719
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
Vacation Inn

1720
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,200
Suggestion

1721
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
I don't have any reason to

1722
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,808
Necessarily distrust it that he wants

1723
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,136
To make that thing I hope he does I would say that

1724
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,928
The questions that I've

1725
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
I've been raised

1726
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
With through this

1727
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Is

1728
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
Okay

1729
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,304
So he's

1730
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,352
Part of his Redemption

1731
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,632
To campaign is

1732
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,912
Gotcha

1733
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Eclipse

1734
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,752
Half of which were already in the f****** documentary

1735
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,800
That show Alex Jones

1736
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
Represents himself

1737
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,640
Differently in public than he does in private

1738
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,944
Right and what you have just played for me

1739
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Is it clip

1740
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,992
Abyss guy

1741
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,528
Representing himself

1742
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,808
Differently in public

1743
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,368
In the interview where he says

1744
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:41,696
Here's what I believe in this is the moment it happened to me

1745
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,256
And then a clip from a year later talking

1746
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
Sing about his f****** documentary

1747
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,840
More so to me

1748
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
Well those are different

1749
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,424
They are the same

1750
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,984
They also don't Point me towards

1751
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,800
Believing that a

1752
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,336
Guy who's very good at marketing

1753
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,128
Is not rebranding

1754
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,152
Edison said

1755
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:01,920
Contrite

1756
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
And changing

1757
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
It's it's hard

1758
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
It's tough

1759
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,112
Because I don't want to live in that place of Suspicion

1760
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:11,392
It doesn't make me

1761
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,184
Feel good I'm not like hey

1762
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
You know what is great

1763
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,512
Thinking of worst of people

1764
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:20,608
That's not true but at the same time we can't live in this space

1765
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:21,632
Otherwise

1766
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,656
It's going to happen

1767
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,704
Again and again and again

1768
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:25,472
Always does

1769
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,544
Are we get to why I I told you this

1770
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,104
Call Ciara and I

1771
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:34,688
Again I think this is one of the most difficult and complicated episodes

1772
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,224
I've had to prepare

1773
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,504
For two main reasons

1774
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,296
The first is that I had a

1775
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:44,160
Constantly check in on myself and make sure that I was not doing this motivated out of spite

1776
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:49,536
I don't feel bitter about people not replying to my messages but you never know how much

1777
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,072
Might be below the surface

1778
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,096
There was this

1779
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:55,680
Emotionally interesting ride that I was on ideal

1780
01:24:55,936 --> 01:25:01,056
No trying to Branch out and do something like requesting raw video

1781
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,152
Blew up in my face there's a lot of processing going on

1782
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
It's kind of funny

1783
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:09,760
To be around you with that emotional rollercoaster

1784
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,296
Because we don't talk like

1785
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:15,392
The entire way through so I'm getting little chunks in Black

1786
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,696
Oh you're on the down way if I could definitely kiss

1787
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,768
This text is definitely not to go

1788
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:29,984
Interpretation of the snapshot

1789
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:34,592
The second reason why this was so difficult

1790
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,664
Caitlin is sincere and that he's trained

1791
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:42,272
He co-founded a new organization that's quotes designed to show people radicalized

1792
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
The far-right movement

1793
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Is that there is a path out

1794
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:50,208
That is an important goal and people knowing that there's life after whatever thing they've fallen into his critic

1795
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,512
I'm personally

1796
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
Absolutely this is for real that I don't want to be a part of impeding Kaelyn from being able to live

1797
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,936
Good healthy life

1798
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,984
They can be an example to others that they

1799
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
They can do that too

1800
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:08,128
I'm not interested in being a dick about someone who's trying to make their way out of being in the right wing

1801
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,176
That does not benefit me at all

1802
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,456
And it's not interesting

1803
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:14,272
I don't like the idea of people

1804
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,320
Shooting on somebody by default

1805
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,112
Sure I don't like that

1806
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,136
The point that

1807
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,416
Hi Isaac

1808
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
Think about

1809
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,720
Is

1810
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
Regardless of whether or not

1811
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,560
He specifically is on the right

1812
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
And I

1813
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,400
Just like you I hope

1814
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
I hope he is

1815
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:34,496
This story is still instruct

1816
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,032
Yeah because

1817
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
Sure

1818
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,080
He's on the path

1819
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:42,176
There are still plenty of people who have taken advantage of this

1820
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,992
Exact type of situation

1821
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,016
Just saying

1822
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:53,184
Ultimately also I think it's important to remember that in the big picture it doesn't matter whether or not we believe

1823
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,256
Doesn't owe me or you anything

1824
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:01,376
Any apologies that he needs to make or probably to other people and they could have already happened and we don't know

1825
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
That's totally cool that's their business

1826
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
I'm not interested in it

1827
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:08,288
This show is largely created by me taking an Alex Jones

1828
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,568
The content finding things

1829
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
Stick out is interesting in

1830
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,640
And see where curiosity takes me

1831
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:19,296
In this case there was a high-profile viral video of Alex in the exploration of the context of it and where it came from

1832
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:23,392
Let me to learn a bunch of stuff about a guy was apparently turned over a new Leaf

1833
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,720
The way I went through this was largely

1834
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,536
What I would do if this was

1835
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,120
That Leo zagami clipped or something

1836
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,192
Except I will admit I pulled a few punches because

1837
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,984
Some of it is like well this is

1838
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Probably should

1839
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,312
Yeah and also he didn't claim to be Jesus

1840
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:47,712
No and I'm not I'm not here to I'm here

1841
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:52,832
911 if you want to get back in my good graces buddy there's a very simple way

1842
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,624
Redemption

1843
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
Wholeheartedly

1844
01:27:55,904 --> 01:28:01,024
Someone very important to me got sucked down a right-wing media hole and managed to find their way out and I know that I

1845
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,304
I would have hated them

1846
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,352
Back when they were in that place for sure

1847
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,632
I respect an elder

1848
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,424
Define people's right to change

1849
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,984
I think there needs to be really serious examination

1850
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
Professional careers

1851
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,312
But people who are claiming to have change

1852
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,848
Because to not do so

1853
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,128
Is dangerous

1854
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Professional

1855
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,736
Recent history is full of people who tried to make dishonest Rebrand

1856
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:26,624
I'm sure Samantha Bee isn't happy she played along with Glenn Beck b******* about how he was sorry about all that

1857
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,672
Back on it

1858
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,696
What is the price

1859
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:35,840
In May 2019 the daily. Published an article about how denoted white nationalist creepa Baked Alaska quote

1860
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,864
Is a recovery

1861
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,400
Troll

1862
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:42,752
This article quotes him as saying quote I was brainwashed I felt like I was part of a cult

1863
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,592
Flash forward to the present in the last we heard of him was when he was arrested

1864
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,408
For being part of the January 6th storming of the US Capitol

1865
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,944
Yeah but that was it

1866
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,968
Side of a cult

1867
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,576
People like Mike cernovich of me more pivots than I can count and there's many more people like this

1868
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,904
My my kind of just on how I

1869
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
Because I've thought about it a lot

1870
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
Since we've been talking

1871
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,232
Think about this whole thing

1872
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,280
And part I think

1873
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,352
Part of the simple things that I kind of want

1874
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,120
Dislike

1875
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:09,888
Okay

1876
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
You don't get to be in Pub

1877
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,008
One thing that I've noticed so off

1878
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,032
Is that

1879
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,056
It's just

1880
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:17,824
I'm just going to

1881
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,592
Change job

1882
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
It's not like

1883
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
I'm going to do anything to

1884
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,968
I'm just going to get a

1885
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
Yeah and I don't I don't approve

1886
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:30,624
It is it is just a shifting over of

1887
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
Like

1888
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,232
I'm going to now do stuff that isn't hateful

1889
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,792
I'll make slick content to make sure people

1890
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:40,096
Not like stuff that like I used to do

1891
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,936
They don't need to go to a judge to say give me 100 hours of community service

1892
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:50,336
News organizations that should say we're not going to put you on TV until you do 100 hours that you do like

1893
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,360
Along those lines of like

1894
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,384
Get your

1895
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,408
F****** hands dirty

1896
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:55,456
Really I struggle with

1897
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,736
Again to it like

1898
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:00,064
When you have stories of people who have been sucked

1899
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,344
Down rabbit holes

1900
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,392
Of information like

1901
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,416
YouTube

1902
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,720
Radicalization in and what have you

1903
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:09,024
I feel like their stories are value

1904
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,328
And I don't think Caitlin stories on value

1905
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,144
I think their stories are really useful because

1906
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,192
People in their position

1907
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:18,496
Can hear them and relate to things

1908
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,520
That they're talk

1909
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
Usher Yeah

1910
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,360
Humans experience is pretty f****** unique

1911
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:27,712
And I'm not sure his testimony is going to be persuasive to other right-wing propaganda

1912
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,504
Take that lucky

1913
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,040
Think you can get out

1914
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:33,600
You can follow my lead and get out

1915
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:37,440
They're going to look at him the same way Alex is audience looks at the Southern Poverty Law

1916
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,744
It's not going to be persuasive

1917
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:44,608
To other folks who are creating and disseminating this propaganda

1918
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
It is going to benefit

1919
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,216
Rehabbing His image

1920
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,240
Will

1921
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:54,080
And again I hate coming off

1922
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,360
The way that I sound

1923
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,944
Cuz I do sound like I'm beating the s*** out of a dead horse right now

1924
01:30:59,456 --> 01:30:59,968
I'm just

1925
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
You know

1926
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,784
We're just not

1927
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,064
Far away

1928
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
From the

1929
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:11,232
Storming of the f****** Capital it's supposed to be like oh he's disavowed the right and Eyecare

1930
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
Great

1931
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,328
You know yeah

1932
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
Yeah it's all I'm so that the alarms

1933
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,168
No I know it's tough

1934
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,216
It's complicated

1935
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:28,640
I mean I don't think the rehab in your image is wrong if your you know if your rehab is apps

1936
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,712
I think that people deserve chances and

1937
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,992
I just

1938
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,016
Like

1939
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,296
He's doing this

1940
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,832
Organization

1941
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,904
That supposed to help people get out of right-wing stuff

1942
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,208
If the idea

1943
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,232
Is 2

1944
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,000
Pele

1945
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,792
2 people who are

1946
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,352
Sucked into these these web

1947
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,632
These right-wing

1948
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,680
Information spaces

1949
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,472
I don't think

1950
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,496
Vicky is going

1951
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:59,360
To be a very easy or upside I don't think he's going to be a very hard target

1952
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:06,016
For the right-wing propaganda not into second Galaxy

1953
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,624
You can again you can play clips of

1954
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,928
Him doing the things that he's

1955
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:17,280
You know it if it blaming Aries exploiting Alex for doing

1956
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,632
Cuz that's what he's doing he's explaining Alexander splc

1957
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
At the same time

1958
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,216
And they're obviously exploiting his b*******

1959
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:27,520
And the only people who benefit from this

1960
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,568
Are the three parties involved

1961
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:33,920
Well the issue that I have is

1962
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
I guess you could

1963
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,480
Describe it is exploiting

1964
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,248
But I don't

1965
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,784
Know if its intention

1966
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,832
I could see I could

1967
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,368
Scenario wherein

1968
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:44,416
He thinks that this is going

1969
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:48,768
Going to make a difference this video of Alex of course

1970
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,400
Hey this'll show Alex is full of s***

1971
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:57,728
Impossible I see it is being fairly unlikely

1972
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Super unlike

1973
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:04,384
Would demonstrate a uncharacteristic Neva tape on both of their parts

1974
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
So

1975
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:15,136
Did the rest of the reporting in that hatewatch article that this clip was released in this initial clip

1976
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,440
It's not stuff from the video

1977
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:20,256
That's just things like Kaelyn telling them

1978
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:22,816
Now like that Alex brags about selling dick pills

1979
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,608
Audience was gullible

1980
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,144
Paul George W

1981
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,680
$16,000 a month

1982
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:28,960
All these things are

1983
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:29,728
Interesting

1984
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:34,080
But you know how much Jerome corsi got paper money

1985
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:38,176
What $15,000

1986
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,712
Problem is I can't

1987
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,736
Accept the

1988
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:44,576
Substantiated word of someone like this just because they're telling me something I want

1989
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,880
Totally that's not fair

1990
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,672
Also something that

1991
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,464
You should deduce

1992
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:53,536
It is far more likely that he is

1993
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,072
Making fun of people for buying

1994
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:55,840
Dick pills

1995
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,864
Behind their back

1996
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Then otherwise

1997
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Yeah

1998
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
But I mean

1999
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,240
Sure like the entire

2000
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,824
The entire supplement intra-industry is laughing at us behind their back

2001
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
I feel like a lot of them are

2002
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,688
I think that

2003
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:15,040
There's a problem with stuff like that it's definitely something that I've realized

2004
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:16,832
Over the course of doing this show

2005
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,624
Is that

2006
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,184
That is something that everybody who

2007
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:23,232
Isn't on the inside a suit

2008
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:25,280
Yeah and everybody who's inside

2009
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,304
Won't be convinced

2010
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,584
But that's the case

2011
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,936
Particularly based on the hearsay of somebody being quoted by the Southern Poverty Law

2012
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Totally

2013
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,472
It's just

2014
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,264
Well I mean you'd have to change your in

2015
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:38,080
Entire worldview because some guy who you

2016
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:38,848
No it's

2017
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,384
Headed to the splc

2018
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,176
Told you that Alex thought

2019
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,224
Buying dick pills made you a joke

2020
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,016
You know and it's like one

2021
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,040
These are dick pills

2022
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,832
I'm not even going to admit that I buy these

2023
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:54,720
I am not going to believe that I've been conned out of having good boners

2024
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
Never

2025
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:00,096
At the end of this will become too

2026
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
Is

2027
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,656
Yeah we have

2028
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:06,496
A situation where it's essentially another

2029
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,520
Instant

2030
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
Of

2031
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,568
Don't media

2032
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
Bungling

2033
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:15,200
How you report on Alex yeah I think that maybe

2034
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,760
You could look at this and think it was a slam dunk by

2035
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:24,416
You know if you just had a little bit of context to what was going on in Alex's life at that time

2036
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
Entirely differently

2037
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,720
Then how it's

2038
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:28,256
Supposed to be presented

2039
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:32,608
Hello after that I just don't know man I don't know how I feel

2040
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
I don't

2041
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:37,216
You finished recording over at the end of this and I don't know how I feel

2042
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,008
I don't know if I feel shity

2043
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:45,664
About like looking at these things I don't know if it is worth anyone's time

2044
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,432
Would be like

2045
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:48,480
Hey here is somebody who's

2046
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,784
Embarking on a Redemption Arc

2047
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,552
And

2048
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,088
I think that's

2049
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:53,856
Cool

2050
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:57,696
I think it's possible but I also think we need to wrestle the fact

2051
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,232
That this isn't somebody

2052
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,000
Who

2053
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
I just

2054
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072
Came off the YouTube

2055
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,400
Somebody who went to New Zealand

2056
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,704
F****** Stefan molyneux

2057
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,264
Winter Poland with Stefan molyneux

2058
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,312
It's a serious like this is

2059
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,616
This is somebody captured the shot

2060
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,664
Of Stefan molyneux

2061
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,736
Proudly declaring himself a white Nasheed

2062
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:22,272
And when he clicked

2063
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,808
Cut he was like

2064
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:24,832
That was great

2065
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,624
Now let me editor

2066
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,904
Yeah exactly

2067
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,928
I'm going to watch

2068
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:31,488
Hours of him saying that he's a white

2069
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,536
Let me edit this together in a way that makes

2070
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,608
Kids

2071
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,144
How are you this

2072
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:44,800
Who click on this video will see it and think like all you know what he does make a great case for why Poland is a great country

2073
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:46,848
Maybe it's because everyone exact

2074
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
Tumi

2075
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,736
The reason that I

2076
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:55,296
Like play any of the clips that I played

2077
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,576
Are any of the stuff

2078
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,112
Is not to beat up on this

2079
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,904
Because I really don't want to

2080
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,232
I play it to illustrate

2081
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,536
As far as I can

2082
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
Until

2083
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,632
Everything that I look at and I can see

2084
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,728
It's the mark of a willing

2085
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,288
And excited participants in this.

2086
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:17,568
It's

2087
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,152
I think that there's a victimhood that inherently comes along with right-wing

2088
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:24,736
Spears I think that the lot of the time they abused each other

2089
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:28,064
In ways that are sometimes subtle and sometimes pretty over

2090
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
And I do think

2091
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,624
There's probably

2092
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
Fair amount of that

2093
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:38,304
And I feel bad that he had to be involved in any of that stuff I don't think that anybody is not a victim to some

2094
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,608
In these

2095
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,168
Machines in the same way that we talked about like

2096
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,960
No Alex

2097
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:49,056
Fire is Millie Weaver for shadowgate

2098
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:50,848
You're dependable and Kuna

2099
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:57,248
Is inherited a fight with Stevie peas so your by David Knight

2100
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,320
Decade in your f****** gone I don't care

2101
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,648
That is

2102
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,952
Like an inherent piece of this information

2103
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:09,280
In the world and it is an intrinsically abusive place to be

2104
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,840
I'm not minimizing that I'm not sounding like

2105
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:13,632
He doesn't have a fair point that like

2106
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,704
I was probably some mistreatment along the way and that sucker chair

2107
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:18,240
That's sad

2108
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
From the second

2109
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,312
He is involved

2110
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,360
In right-wing media

2111
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
A treble

2112
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,152
Then

2113
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,688
With Tommy Robinson

2114
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,736
It's not

2115
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,760
Somebody

2116
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,040
Who is not

2117
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,576
Like

2118
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,648
Driving his own trip message board

2119
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,720
He's filming their f****** documentary

2120
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:39,744
You know

2121
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,584
I don't

2122
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,120
I don't have any place to judge

2123
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,656
By no means

2124
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,448
But one thing I did

2125
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:50,240
I think when I read that article was like

2126
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,776
Oh man

2127
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:55,616
I thought the splc would be better than this

2128
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,152
I really did

2129
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,944
If I saw that in like

2130
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,248
The times or something like that

2131
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,528
Of course you guys are all s*******

2132
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,344
But it's the splc hate watch

2133
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,136
They're good at this

2134
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,928
I was

2135
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:11,232
Man I was like God damn you guys are

2136
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,256
You know what

2137
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
I thought the left

2138
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
Lost

2139
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,608
A little bit

2140
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,656
I don't know

2141
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,936
Anyway

2142
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,216
Let's end this

2143
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
Apologies if

2144
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Hey buddy thought this

2145
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,080
Episode is pointless

2146
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,872
I doubt they'd

2147
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,408
But really bad

2148
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:38,368
We are going to bed Jordan Wilson

2149
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,392
Wait we're on Facebook

2150
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,672
Did I say

2151
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:42,208
No you said we're on Twitter

2152
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:48,608
Nowhere on Facebook

2153
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:54,496
Absent minded

2154
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:02,688
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work
