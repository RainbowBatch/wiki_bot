1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge fight

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
Stripe.com

4
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex

5
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,888
What up what up

6
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
What

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Panicking over

8
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,056
Vape fever

9
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Is going

10
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Vulture

11
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
I'm old enough now

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
35

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,416
I'm old enough and has a career as someone who smokes

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,768
Long enough

15
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:41,376
There's kind of a little bit of a panic of some kind that we're marketing things to children

16
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
And then you restrict everybody's access

17
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Stephan stop

18
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,264
I will call at 9

19
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,056
Twenty years or so

20
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
Cigarette

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
And Campbell came out with a line

22
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,456
Cigarettes that would come in at 10

23
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
And they were like there was a vanilla flavor it wasn't cool

24
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,184
Really awesome cool wallpapers

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,024
About that manded up having

26
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,168
Lingered for a long time

27
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,008
You can't sell menthol cigarettes 100 feet from a school in Chicago

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,568
Rules about like

29
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
These appeal to Children therefore gone

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,432
Now we're just going through with the Next Generation

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,200
Technology

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
I understand like I don't know

33
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
Vape cartridge

34
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
I'm not proud of that but I do

35
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888
I bought the sour gummy worm flavor from UPS to vape shop

36
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,496
I have to try them I love the novelty I like I like the weirdness of it

37
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
I don't

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Government overreach

39
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,712
But I do also understand that there are problems that are possibly

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
About Vapes

41
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
That's a weed

42
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
Just didn't have enough time to really understand

43
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
Some of the

44
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Dangerous

45
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
About the

46
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:12,768
And if you do things are motivated along those lines

47
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
I was wondering

48
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,616
I'm not thrilled at the I also just miss those camels

49
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
Logo soccer picks

50
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,992
Everybody is pointed that out but never not hilarious

51
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,576
Walmart

52
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
I'll take two packs

53
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,768
Feelings about slavery

54
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,536
Tobacco products

55
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
And then Oliveto

56
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:51,168
Alright

57
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
And highly anticipated and anxiety-provoking

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Episode of The Alex Jones Show

59
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
We'll be going over

60
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,528
Today where is the Boston Marathon

61
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
Athens

62
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
Real-time

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
I sincerely think

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,232
That this is one of the Grim look

65
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
Better man

66
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:23,423
Off to a good start well

67
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,007
Very fine

68
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:32,639
That's one of the things I think is really the most difficult and most rewarding of

69
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
This podcast

70
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,223
And that is the whenever there's something like this

71
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,503
Tragedy

72
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,039
Newsbreak

73
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
You really get to

74
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
See how Alex Benson

75
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,623
Wheels in real time

76
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,695
How the

77
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
The

78
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
The ball moves forward

79
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,583
I think is really revealing

80
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,631
I meant also I lost

81
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
Overstock

82
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,423
For someone that I breathe

83
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,967
Leo zagami does not show up

84
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,295
That would be wild

85
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,671
Alex doesn't know him very strange

86
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,631
Disgusted

87
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:29,471
And up and made this anxiety-provoking episode possible

88
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
So first of all thank you

89
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287

Let's just take it so much

93
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
Journal policy

94
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,391
I worked at movie theater with me

95
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,463
Deanna made him Furious

96
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Was dusting

97
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,535
I hope that this person is

98
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
Is not living in this

99
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,887
Call Drogo

100
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,959

Lenoir

104
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,247
Bank of America

105
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
And emerald

106
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,071
Thank you see you both you are

107
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Fun pimps

108
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
Is freakishly large

109
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
Admiral Cavendish

110
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Absolutely

111
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,559
Sports

112
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,959
I'm not sure what it would be but whatever the case

113
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
Would you like to

114
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
We would appreciate it

115
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,687
Only have a tiny little speech

116
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Restarting on April 15th

117
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
And on April 15th

118
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,135
249 Eastern Time

119
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:25,695
A bomb detonated near the finish line of the Boston Marathon

120
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,303
14 seconds later a second bomb Place 210 yd

121
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
Three people were killed

122
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
264 were wounded 14

123
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
I required a

124
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,311
The high number of injuries was the result of the homemade bomb impact

125
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,591
With nails and ball bearings

126
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,895
About to be shrapnel to hit as many people as Pop

127
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,711
The bomb cells were very rudimentary

128
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,783
Authorities to believe that this could easily be the work of amateur

129
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,415
Their basic construction of the bombs is just a pressure cooker pressure cooker filled with gunpowder

130
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,439
A little wiring

131
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
The Trap

132
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,023
Gunpowder came from fireworks that were purchased

133
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
Emptied into the pressure

134
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:03,839
Just chilling

135
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
To think about

136
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
A person with really terrible intention

137
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,935
Do so much damage

138
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
Easy to get material

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
If they're so motivated

140
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
And drawn that direction

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
When this all happened I was working a terrible temp

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
A job at an insurance

143
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
Company that I do business

144
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
For it was just

145
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Very weird

146
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Circumstance

147
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
They had very little work for me to do so a lot of my time was spent

148
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,391
Conspiracy

149
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Towards pass the time

150
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
I remember April 15th 2013

151
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Very clearly

152
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,791
And I remember how everyone

153
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,839
Conspiracy world was following Alex Jones

154
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935
So many of the narratives that I heard listening back to these episodes

155
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,471
We're taking it concrete

156
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Exact

157
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
On the sites that I would kill him

158
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,079
I went posters on those sites

159
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
But being pushed to provide a source

160
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,175
It was very regularly Infowars

161
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:57,087
I struggled with how to present this episode since everyone listening knows how this plays out at least

162
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Or at least they know the basic

163
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,695
Our episode today is going to cover it

164
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,231
Exclusively April 15th

165
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
And I kind of feel like if I lay out everything that happens

166
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Whitby

167
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
The aftermath

168
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
And how

169
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,727
Little too deep

170
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,055
Construction talk about when the later events come around cover

171
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Future episodes

172
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:22,431
So I apologize for all that stuff

173
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,199
Unfolds

174
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:27,807
For now by the time Alex goes off are on the episode on April

175
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
No one knows any

176
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
Sing about who did the bombing

177
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:34,975
No one knows what their motivations could have been or if they were even working with a terror

178
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Here's all the information that it come out by the sea

179
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
Within minutes it was clear this was not an act

180
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:44,703
Since there were two explosions a ways apart from each other

181
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
And video footage showed explosion

182
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
Inconsistent with a gas

183
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
Explosion

184
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Something along those lines

185
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
It was clear very quickly

186
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:58,271
Initially a whole lot of media coverage was about how about people who saved each other's lives

187
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
In the absence of any concrete things to report

188
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Most important story to tell

189
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:04,671
Reassuring

190
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
People were embodying that Mister Rogers

191
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
Spirit of looking for the helpers

192
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:13,887
Obama's press conference beard highlighting bright parts of humanity

193
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,911
Come out in the tragedy

194
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,263
The people selflessly helping each other the runners continuing to run to the hospital

195
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,031
How to donate blood

196
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,079
Inspiring a unifying image

197
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:25,919
Just like we got to tell people something

198
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,735
This is something that I was really doesn't talk about at all

199
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Over the course of

200
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
Insincerely the human aspect of this both

201
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,135
That's inspirational

202
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
That's tragic

203
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,999
Cialis being all that interested in any of

204
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Call distance

205
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,959
Act of Terror but wasn't necessarily calling it strongly a terrorist

206
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:53,055
I'm Andy kind of caused a little bit of weird

207
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,335
Conversations around

208
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,199
Which I will touch on a little bit

209
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,575
The FBI was quoted by the BBC is calling it a potential terrorist investigation

210
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,671
Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis held a press conference

211
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
No specific

212
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Intelligence that something like

213
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
This would happen

214
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
I ended

215
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:18,143
The country but Boston particular was in a very f*****-up place

216
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
Something that helps

217
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Positive connotation

218
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Marathon

219
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
Have been turned into

220
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Terrifying

221
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,871
Marathons with the sort of thing that you associate with being the culmination of hard work

222
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Dedication

223
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
With family in French

224
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,455
You want to make it there

225
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
Steps to get across

226
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,503
Finish Line

227
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,575
The bombers are taking this Association

228
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,111
Replace them with blood trails

229
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Missing limbs

230
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
She's very hard to deal with

231
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
As a country

232
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Hey even if you're watching it on

233
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,279
Even if you're away from it

234
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Particularly for

235
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
For the people immediately

236
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
What happened but everybody

237
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,727
His is real

238
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
To an extent

239
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,079
And on top of that the culprits were still on the loose

240
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
And there wasn't a lot of clues about who dumb

241
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,967
Boston was on high alert with heightened enforcement levels on the

242
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
No one knew if this person or persons

243
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
We're going to strike

244
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
Again no one knew what to

245
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
No one knew anything

246
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
Except

247
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
And that it wasn't

248
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
This is an incredibly

249
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,255
Situation

250
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,047
That's one of elevated anxiety

251
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,351
Any information

252
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
Patient to help them make

253
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,143
Expensive

254
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,983
It's the kind of situation where someone like Alex Jones is at his most

255
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,335
Because new no one knew what the story was it what it happened

256
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,895
The story all his own

257
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
And no one can really prove that he was wrong

258
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,295
It was a very definition of that metaphor I always use about Alex needing to

259
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
He needs to act while the concrete is

260
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Is wet

261
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,719
Until that concrete dries you can easily put his initials in there forever

262
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:47,999
But if you wait too long

263
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,767
You going to need a jack

264
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Impression

265
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,375
I try to approach this show our podcast

266
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
Proposition

267
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,727
Elevate myself above stuff

268
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Not let myself get too mad

269
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
But I can't tell your Pretend We're going to go over here today

270
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Infuriating

271
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,247
One my family lived in Boston and Cambridge from just after I was born until I was six

272
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Searzall

273
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
And while I don't remember much of that time

274
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
Nor can I really

275
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Claim any credit

276
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Vegas OCH

277
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
It's still a part of my life

278
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,607
I've always held a real fondness for Boston and I was a huge fan of Mighty Mighty Bosstones growing up

279
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Little to do with my

280
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,935
I'm not trying to personalize this to

281
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,823
What makes me angry is if you pay attention to Alex

282
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,639
You can very clearly see that what he's doing

283
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Is intense

284
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
We often discuss the

285
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
The stupid versus evil quad

286
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Squarely on the

287
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,463
I hope by the time we reach the end you'll see what I'm saying

288
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Decision in order to maximize his out

289
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
This episode will take a straight through to

290
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
And like I said by that point the world really doesn't know that

291
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
We're pull two days away from the FBI releasing photos

292
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
3 days away for

293
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
From an arrest

294
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
But those are all things will cover on a few

295
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Future episode

296
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
At this point we know that the bombs were pressure cookers

297
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
You know it wasn't attack

298
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
And that's about it

299
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
At least

300
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
As Alex's show begins on the 15th

301
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
The attack has

302
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,767
He has no idea what's going to happen by the end of the time he's on air

303
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
And that's We Begin Today's Show

304
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
Very familiarly

305
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
In the sense that the show

306
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,191
Holding pattern

307
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,007
And we hear the familiar things that we've heard

308
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:37,055
Over the past couple weeks

309
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
But knowing what we know

310
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
And knowing how is Joe

311
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
Before it goes off air is going to have this

312
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Giant purple throne

313
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,319
Very surreal

314
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
You're the completely normal

315
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,647
Thing

316
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,415
The beginning

317
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,463
And so that's where we'll end up jumping it

318
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
I feel like I should pull curtains

319
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Spaghetti

320
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,031
I'm sorry that's a bit I had

321
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,151
I don't mean to be I just felt they needed

322
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Be more of a Visa

323
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
The best 10

324
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Then normal

325
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,343
Cuz I'm a little bit away from the

326
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Listening

327
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
These episodes with far more of a strong

328
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,951
Feeling of like

329
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
He's doing this on purpose

330
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
I can see the crack

331
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,815
Then I in other times

332
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:31,583
The past

333
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,143
Smaller-scale things it's obvious

334
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,471
He's doing that on purpose

335
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,263
But in this case it was

336
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,287
Pretty over

337
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Actual

338
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,663
World-shaking

339
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
Pried open

340
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
The artifice

341
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,367
Personality

342
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,207
It would be very difficult to concretely

343
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
As much in the moment

344
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
If you're listening

345
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,863
Much more difficult to see

346
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
The ways the manipulation

347
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Being done but now

348
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,727
Later looking back

349
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,799
It's pretty f****** clear to me

350
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,615
I'll present

351
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,919
Eclipse that we have

352
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
I hope they can

353
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Conclusion is a

354
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,951
Almost precisely this moment

355
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
I need a strong

356
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,607
We start on the 15th

357
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
Has a narrative

358
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
To begin the

359
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,151
6.91% to $1,300

360
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:59,391
6.9

361
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,511
Worst

362
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,375
So he's leaving the show

363
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
It's not real real

364
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
6.9%

365
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:20,639
Do you need to lose before it's a problem

366
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Gold price

367
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
PriceRite

368
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,367
It should be pointed out he's indicated by the same guy who owns Vitus resources and gold sales company

369
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
So anytime he has a narrative

370
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
It surrounds gold

371
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Like wow I don't know why I don't know about you man

372
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
The first thing that I hear is

373
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,703
Him being so don't worry about it

374
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Because the ice

375
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
The Next Step

376
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
I actually actually think that

377
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,991
Conspiracy behind globalist

378
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,015
Idea what you do

379
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,727
They just want to be able to drive it down to

380
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,799
Embrace

381
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
In April 2013 gold prices

382
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
Plummeted

383
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:29,247
Percent drop from here

384
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
Percent drop

385
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
This absolutely feeds into Alex

386
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
Does paranoia

387
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
27

388
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
Adjusting about this drop

389
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Open price is

390
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,863
It's one of those Universal features of Alex

391
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
His worldview

392
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,471
Hi there this is this happen to it

393
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,591
The globalist are so overpowered they have complete control over all commodity prices

394
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Push them up or down

395
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,455
They're suppressing the price of gold

396
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,527
Alex Witt

397
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:08,927
Stop suppressing

398
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
But they're not just depressing

399
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,375
And the price is the price at all

400
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Like the earlier one

401
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Except for bigger

402
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,775
Right

403
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:31,199
Global it right there in bed with the Federal Reserve

404
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:37,599
Whatever

405
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,791
Berryville

406
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,703
I'm not sure they are

407
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
I don't know if fiscal prudence

408
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,431
The old adage

409
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,927
I just think it's absurd to think like

410
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
Little bit lower in

411
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
Globalist

412
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
At any time

413
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Whenever they want it

414
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,375
But

415
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
They're mostly worried about

416
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,031
Inconveniencing a lot of people

417
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,335
Selective

418
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:38,015
But very encumbered by whatever restrictions I decide to put the on them at make it

419
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Convenient for my Naruto

420
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,831
He's a big restriction

421
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
I think that will always come

422
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
They have to make you agree

423
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
They can do whatever they want

424
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,911
To say yesterday like vampires

425
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:05,407
Consult more grounded data sources like the international business

426
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,943
Clear what's going on

427
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
Post-mortems that were done after the fact

428
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
2014

429
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:14,623
The first variable is it gold mining companies were having a particularly bad year

430
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Around it which is an indicator to investors to be worried

431
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
These companies took out expenditures and law

432
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Coming through

433
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,704
The picture looked a lot like a lot of these companies

434
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Provide a lot of

435
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:32,032
Playa gold were in trouble

436
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Stream

437
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,104
The second Factor was automated commodity

438
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
He's Trading

439
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:39,200
Algorithm

440
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,296
But they also set them up with very similar or the same buy and sell point

441
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,392
So when the market bearded One Direction you had a number of groups are following the

442
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Same pattern

443
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
This wouldn't have

444
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
That too much

445
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,000
Price of gold

446
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,072
If you're just one or two entities automatically buying and selling

447
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,376
But as Commodities analysis

448
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
Jeffrey Christian told the international business

449
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:02,240
Quotes it was more than 1,000

450
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Steve's trading in

451
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032

Beer impact

454
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
You see this in a lot of Commodities Market

455
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Probably something

456
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Sucking regulates

457
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Super heavily

458
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,344
I'm well-versed enough and markets

459
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,464
To know if it's a good idea for us to say like

460
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Navigation to that

461
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,768
But we should also

462
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Let's get this.

463
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Control Michael Lewis

464
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
Wrote a book about

465
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:32,960
Automation

466
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
And how

467
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
People

468
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,264
Like the larger

Set up their servers

470
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Closest park

471
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:39,872
Because

472
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Fukkit

Automated

477
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,088
Stop mean

478
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
Means that you win

479
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
11 trillion

480
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
More than

481
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
You're making

482
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
10 billion

483
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,560
You know whatever

484
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Yeah

485
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
No it should absolutely be again

486
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
100% because you sat like

487
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,240
All the sudden there's just

488
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
Splash

489
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Crisis bed last

490
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
20 minutes in people lose and a lot of it

491
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,128
Could be

492
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:14,688
Accidental are based on

493
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
Computer whatever

494
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:23,392
Random Twitter content

495
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
August 9th

496
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,744
It's alright it's

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,280
A computer s*** that ends up effect

498
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
Real world stops away

499
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,984
I'm saying maybe

500
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
There's a barista

501
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Situation in 2013

502
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:48,992
Honestly I think about this escalating

503
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
He's been putting out

504
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
I mostly didn't

505
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Consider it because he hasn't talked about it much

506
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,880
Until this episode

507
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,720
The price of gold dropping is a huge part of this financial collapse

508
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:01,024
So it would make sense

509
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
Whether or not

510
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
I feel like this is the background

511
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
4

512
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
At least these April episodes

513
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Other ghosts

514
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,312
Just

515
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
The dropout

516
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,968
Gold price but maybe he thought it'll course correct

517
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
About it

518
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,392
Kind of gets distracted by something a little later this episode it doesn't it doesn't Factor too much into

519
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
The coverage of the bombing

520
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
But I wanted to bring this up here make a point out of it because I have a corporated

521
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Forward

522
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Because it does not stop

523
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,240
But a particularly bad

524
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,544
And it does make sense

525
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
From

526
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:51,456
All of his hustle narrator

527
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,480
And to make sense of that would be

528
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,248
Fear Factor

529
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,016
Ann Arbor

530
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,720
So the financial side of things

531
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,488
There's the

532
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,888
Are all of the same like they're going to take the kids to Global is to trying to get the veterans all this

533
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
He's yelling any reaches a despondent

534
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
And he starts talking about how he doesn't know what to

535
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
To do

536
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
How's my daughter supposed to protect yourself against

537
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,872
The globalist

538
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,152
And I honestly think

539
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
This is one of the more likely response

540
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Possible things

541
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,880
Because

542
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,920
Very smart person

543
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,520
California

544
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:28,480
Water

545
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Going to head out

546
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
Tasty Licks

547
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
Set

548
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
Man on the street prank videos

549
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Huh

550
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,360
It's $0.08

551
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,664
That's what that's based on first

552
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,432
Servall

553
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,064
And second of all I just really think they like the escalation in his rhetoric that we've seen over the past couple weeks

554
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
The showare

555
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
It's really

556
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
Very seriously getting to the

557
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:09,184
The point of like we are fuc

558
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
We got it like

559
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,560
Going to destroy it immediately and all that stuff

560
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:17,376
When Alex has moments where

561
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,960
He's getting really emotional and saying I don't know what to do

562
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
You are

563
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Derelict in your duties

564
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,872
Is you have riled your audio audience up into a frenzy and you were saying

565
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
Look I know I'm the captain but I don't have through this website

566
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Which leaves the audience

567
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,296
I got some ideas

568
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
The ship is going down you're on top of it

569
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,840
It's even worse that cuz I was like

570
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,168
I am a boat expert I know everything about boats

571
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,944
Most brilliant mind against the globalist

572
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,528
Doesn't know what to do maybe some of my ideas would be good

573
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,344
Freeze them up to not really

574
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,624
Alex Azar

575
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Along the lines

576
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
This is a nympho

577
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,048
When you have him admit like I don't know what to do

578
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
Tid of like I trust your own it

579
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:27,776
If you're going to act like

580
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
You give you like

581
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,896
I do like finding out more

582
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Unique physiology

583
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
In that

584
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,808
My mom is very even though she's intelligent

585
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,600
Where you're like you're taking the whole

586
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,672
Fruit of the knowledge of Good and Evil tree a little too literally

587
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:47,232
I think knowing something

588
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
Apparently mean that you lose it

589
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,120
Interesting possibility I read it more along the lines of

590
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Innocent as naivete

591
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
Assertive

592
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
Of the

593
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
And is that clip

594
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,456
You know

595
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,064
The world hasn't changed yet so Alex

596
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Where he can make

597
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,136
About pop culture

598
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,160
Like

599
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
Children listening to on their iPads

600
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:06,080
Shut up

601
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,152
You leave her alone

602
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:14,784
Iowa remember there being some kind of Satan

603
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,624
David Young videos can I watch

604
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,256
How to kill themselves

605
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:29,120
I started watching some more Kesha videos I might talk about your love is my drug

606
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:31,680
What you talk about some of these real uplifting

607
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
Great job pop songs

608
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,616
Auto recent episode we heard Alex talking about how he stayed up

609
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:46,272
Late night when they play the job

610
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,184
Led Zeppelin

611
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,232
Yeah

612
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,936
Call you're doing

613
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
Grumpy old assholes

614
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Music

615
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Yeah

616
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,944
That's all

617
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:20,832
So in the next clip Alex's

618
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
Street reports

619
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,512
Interesting videos

620
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
Discussing

621
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,144
Plans of video of a man on the street

622
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
And I think he's going about it wrong

623
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
California

624
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,736
In distress

625
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,168
We're going to

626
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,720
He guarantees because he's going to edit it

627
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:37,376
McHugh's music all right here's the piece of propaganda put together without on the street

628
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,384
Yeah

629
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
Okay I guarantee

630
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:55,040
That I can craft a narrative that I will

631
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,600
Universal agreement

632
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Dude that is not how this works that's not you can't

633
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,976
You can't allow yourself to

634
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:08,096
That's reporting

635
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,680
I think the fat Clippers trivia

636
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,704
Anyways

637
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
But I think it's important

638
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,032
Because what we're about to witness

639
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,824
With his coverage of the bombing

640
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,224
Very clearly marked be crated amazing perception

641
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,320
Here we go out as well

642
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
When you see the way the

643
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:30,624
Minecraft

644
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
A narrative out of this bombing

645
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:38,816
See before the bombing even happened he was talking about doing a very similar thing around another topic

646
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,352
It's an MO

647
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
So Alex another another little lie

648
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Bee in his bonnet

649
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,728
Is

650
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Easy

651
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Complaining

652
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,336
About the house normalization

653
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Immediately

654
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,456
Resolve the complaints about the

655
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
TV shows like

656
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
We hate Paul Revere that never came out bacon Patriots look bad on

657
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Making

658
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
TSA look

659
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,256
Good in commercial

660
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:19,520
You probably already

661
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:35,136
That's the point of the Pillsbury Doughboy

662
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
Do you know what is catchphrases it's not words it's him giggling because somebody do

663
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,656
Most ridiculous things possibly

664
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,240
The Geico

665
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,104
Cuz you know they had that other people

666
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
Cialix

667
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:03,040
I love you I love how weeks

668
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,160
Kind of gazing

669
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,720
Cigarettes

670
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,816
It's almost paradise

671
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,096
The satire to it

672
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:20,960
You remember that

673
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
What's better than this is not the

674
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,872
The Pillsbury Doughboy

675
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,920
What the implications

676
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
The TSA

677
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,064
That is what they are underlying joke

678
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,088
Conversive

679
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
But Alex

680
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
Maybe the issue isn't

681
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:47,840
Next Clippers very interesting probably important for a hook for

682
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,376
And that is that

683
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,704
Tower before the Boston bombing happen

684
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,264
Alex expresses his position

685
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,312
On Sandy Hook Visa V actor

686
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
Thank God this is

687
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:25,984
So it's really interesting about this is Alex keep saying

688
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,568
Kind of different

689
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:36,736
I don't give a f*** if you think some real kids died if he thinks it's some people there were actor

690
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,600
Because he could believe that

691
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:46,976
Robbie Parker is an actor

692
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,024
Are are actors that are

693
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Sue again or whatever

694
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
I'm still think so

695
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,936
Picking and choosing who he wants to

696
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Using one person

697
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,544
Who's

698
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Child

699
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
In that shooting up

700
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,128
Is

701
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:09,504
Everyone

702
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,296
The same game

703
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:15,136
And he's he's passed away

704
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
He has crossed the line into a cure territory

705
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,792
He's being on specific about it

706
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,888
These people like Robbie Parker acting like actors

707
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,680
The conclusion that you have to be

708
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
He thinks

709
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,544
At least some people are lying about their family

710
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
And that's f***** up

711
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Are or I suppose Ferrari

712
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,504
If you want to make that argument as though it's a real thing

713
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Then you have to go line by

714
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,088
Yeah

715
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,744
You can't have a responsibility everybody because you get to choose in the moment

716
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
Well

717
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,376
This is the one who's an actor and then you look at you look at

718
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
The next one you like

719
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
They're real kids

720
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:03,008
What you're doing is a half-assed everybody

721
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
Yeah and giving your audience

722
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,592
Permission to decide for themselves

723
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,616
To watch.

724
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,176
Exactly it's really

725
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
Narratives of really ramped up over there

726
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
This leads

727
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,816
Alex to like really get mad

728
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
About how like Glenn Beck is

729
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,960
He starts screaming about how his job isn't

730
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,008
Fun because all this stuff is real

731
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
You know like all this stuff is real

732
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Hotel with his

733
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,152
And so like

734
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
Start screaming about that and he says

735
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
Something that you will later consider

736
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,784
A remarkable

737
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:11,104
Aurora

738
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,592
Obvious

739
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,432
Colorado

740
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:54,880
Screaming about therapy.

741
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
On the day that there is a bombing

742
00:39:57,696 --> 00:40:01,280
He will be like I said earlier in the show

743
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,376
Regularly

744
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,680
You know that you can't talk about

745
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,288
.

746
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,104
Matter when you look it up

747
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
There's about

748
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
To be something

749
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
Feature of his broadcast Style

750
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,552
That's all I don't ascribe

751
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:24,320
Too much meaning

752
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
It does

753
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:28,928
Jesus dad

754
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Nobody

755
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Happy about this

756
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
Except Alex is going to be very happy

757
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
He is going to

758
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:43,008
Gleeful that people I'm not sure

759
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
Knox

760
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Experience like a human

761
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
Richard Belzer

762
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:01,952
Yeah Richard Belzer

763
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
I do like

764
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,376
Well it's kind of like when you put your seatbelt on a plane

765
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:12,192
Here we go

766
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,600
Was Christopher Walken

767
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,160
It's just down right next to the shards

768
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:38,560
Recipes chicken recipe

769
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,376
Christopher Walken in no time for Alex

770
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,680
Completely

771
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:49,312
Richard Belzer is on to promote a book that he's written about the JFK assassination

772
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
And of course.

773
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,503
Earlier in the episode lost

774
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:03,903
Respect for somebody past relationship

775
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:09,791
Get real high

776
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:16,191
Ice-T

777
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
You kidding me

778
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,239
Baseball bats

779
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
Amazing

780
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,103
When I was younger

781
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,383
I don't know

782
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
I'm being good

783
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,735
But I had a real fondness for my like the idea

784
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Is character John bunch

785
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:34,111
Travels between like homicide

786
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
He connects all these shows into a

787
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:39,231
I like that and I wasn't positive Association

788
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,703
Call John

789
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,727
But you like him

790
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
Amman

791
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,103
You listen to him talk to Alex and realized

792
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Open to in a long time

793
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,855
I must say that your

794
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,159
Programming your documentaries

795
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,183
Your news

796
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,791
In my research

797
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
Appreciate it.

798
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
I want you to always

799
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,447
My friend cuz work

800
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,775
How do you say we're treading in Dangerous Waters now.

801
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:26,847
I heard that and I was like Richard Belzer

802
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Stupid

803
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,151
I was like

804
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:34,527
He's abusing Alex's resources for his research and no

805
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:38,879
Ono Ono

806
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,415
Bad bad news

807
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:44,255
That isn't a belted never gotten the

808
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
Do you think he would be the

809
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:54,239
Conservative comedian prototype

810
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,567
All that conservative

811
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
I don't know

812
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,919
He's a conspiracy theorist

813
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,319
It just like all those other comedian conservative guys

814
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Say one thing

815
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
And then people be

816
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:16,255
It's really hard to cook that

817
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:18,303
Especially given the way conservatism

818
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Is changed

819
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,119
Those times

820
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:25,983
Like with the hypnosis comedy

821
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:32,895
Work I see some stuff that I didn't I didn't think somebody was terrible.

822
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,687
I honestly don't have any memory of it

823
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
One way or another

824
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,759
But

825
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,831
I think he's just as a low standard of

826
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:46,719
Evidence for things

827
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,607
Wahlburgers

828
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
Truth

829
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,543
Alex doesn't make things up

830
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
That's pretty crazy

831
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,967
Bowser's on here lauding Alec

832
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:14,623
You're one of the truth-teller is that use your stuff

833
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,671
Just kisses ass

834
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
He means at 4

835
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,279
Which is more troubling

836
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,399
Opposite

837
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
Exactly

838
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:34,335
Elevate

839
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
What's my favorite book

840
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Is the

841
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:41,503
Listening to people explained

842
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:44,831
I love

843
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Ice-T explaining things

844
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,671
To anyone else

845
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
Law and Order

846
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
I'm so

847
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,279
Richard Belzer

848
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
You know he has his whole career behind them

849
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,607
Conspiracy thinking

850
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Aliens

851
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
What have you and

852
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,447
Start talking about the

853
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,215
The bank

854
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
Got weird

855
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,055
But

856
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,335
I have an alternate exit

857
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,871
Donation for everything

858
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
He's trying to

859
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
To cause panic

860
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,967
You're getting to the bank

861
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
You know

862
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
The current

863
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,607
Going to places

864
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
Oh my God

865
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:36,543
Are we just having too old

866
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,103
The batteries in your mouse

867
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
Cassius doing all this

868
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
I don't know

869
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,415
Your mouse needs a new battery

870
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:56,511
No it's the same

871
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,375
It's the back I started talk about the bank and I was still on Law & Order special Victims

872
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:07,775
Look if you want to if you want to put them down

873
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,127
Like my Advocate stopped working at now we're talkin about the banks

874
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,919
No you can't

875
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
Magic

876
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
I'm not sure if you said

877
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,671
He probably does know probably

878
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,655
Generally speaking really bad sign

879
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Yeah but I don't know what

880
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Takes about JF

881
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:40,799
Like maybe he's difference

882
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:41,567
Stop

883
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,151
Howard hunt

884
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,455
And I was like oh no

885
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Richard Belzer stupid

886
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:06,143
What's a jury trial

887
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
That's very super

888
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
That is very

889
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
So first things first the spotlight is the publication

890
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Liberty Lobby

891
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,967
Alex's Chief Bilderberg

892
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
It's a trash publication

893
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
As for this lawsuit

894
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,135
Richard Belzer's playing fast and loose

895
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
The details

896
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:33,279
Spotlighted just published a Howard hunted been in Dallas on the day of the JFK assassination

897
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,583
Gaza

898
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,887
DC at the time you decided to sue them for libel

899
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,703
The question of his involvement in the assassination

900
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,007
Was it matter that wasn't germane to the case

901
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,823
And in no way was decided by this case

902
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
At all

903
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,407
The first lawsuit over this one

904
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,967
And he was awarded $650,000 a day

905
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,295
Verdict is overturned

906
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
Incomplete instruction

907
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,599
On how to give their verdict

908
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:02,975
In 1983 the case was retried

909
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,047
But it's important to consider what winning this case

910
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:09,375
Perhaps more importantly what winning this case

911
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,399
Doesn't mean

912
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:13,983
Bible doesn't mean that the thing that you wrote is

913
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
True

914
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:19,871
We just say that this trial doesn't even establish in court that hunt was in fact in Dallas

915
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
Witness

916
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,199
Necessary for this

917
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,063
I'm not liable is it Spotlight had to have reason to believe this was true at the

918
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Set timer publication

919
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,903
Which is what the jury decided was the case

920
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:36,255
A lot of this is probably based on the Liberty Lobby building up a good case that doesn't

921
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,095
But they weren't just making it up

922
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
That's not the hardest thing

923
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
To show in court

924
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,239
Which is why it's important

925
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
For these Bible laws

926
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Pretty

927
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Lenient

928
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Towards the media

929
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,687
Because otherwise you can mail them for things

930
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
Good faith errors

931
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Is that got made

932
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,551
Does that the bells are doesn't understand

933
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,159
Flag

934
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
He's putting forth

935
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
All other information to put haunted

936
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:10,815
In Dallas

937
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
The campaign

938
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,375
Or the alleged deathbed confession

939
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Hunt made to

940
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
Two of his son

941
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,959
Although it's important to point out that

942
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:20,031
Widow and their other children

943
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,567
And if the Suns coach talked

944
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
Say what they wanted so they could prop it up

945
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Yes so

946
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,735
Well what it wanted what is he going to be pissed

947
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:34,623
Evil probably but I don't know I don't I don't care

948
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:41,023
We can't have today turn into a rock shoes

949
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,327
People Finder

950
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,887
Is the

951
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,799
Everybody already thought you probably killed

952
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
So

953
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,919
I all this is to say that Richard Belzer thinks that Zach court case

954
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Determined

955
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:04,575
The E Howard hunt was involved in the assassination which means to me that he doesn't understand

956
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,135
He's talking about and he wrote a book about that

957
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:08,927
That's bad

958
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Bedding

959
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:11,999
In like

960
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,023
Civil court

961
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:18,911
They proved

962
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,215
Call Jeff

963
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,263
All of this starts to make sense

964
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,847
Bowser starts talking about

965
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,151
Fired him down the road in life that he's on

966
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,991
You and I both were inspired by this book

967
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,135
Across the dollar

968
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,471
So he's inspired by

969
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
David Simon

970
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Argument

971
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,039
Target baby

972
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:11,903
OK Google

973
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:26,495
Problematic

974
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,311
Source for them to share

975
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Get the f*** out of here

976
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,943
249

977
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:40,063
Iams Alex's to overdrive cuz Belzer's are they having a great time

978
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,415
Let's do a fourth our plant

979
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,351
He doesn't know about it for about 20

980
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,191
He doesn't get the news immediately

981
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,519
308

982
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
Somewhere in that range

983
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,895
He comes on air at this is it immediate reaction

984
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:12,319
Well it's terrible news related

985
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:18,719
Explosion at the Boston Marathon the punch up

986
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
208 Central

987
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,399
Boston Marathon 308mx Eastern Time

988
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:33,055
Explosion style man

989
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,039
Horrible

990
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,831
His first instinct

991
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:49,183
Not even knowing any information about

992
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,511
Bleak lotion or something like that

993
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,119
His first instinct is to Guess Who they'll blame

994
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,959
He thinks they're going to blame our arawn

995
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
The Patriots

996
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
Veteran

997
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
Two of those

998
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
Are based on

999
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
He's big narrative

1000
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,663
They're going to

1001
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,687
This

1002
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,967
Explosion happens

1003
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
His first instinct

1004
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,039
I wonder if he'll blame it on us

1005
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,319
That's not good

1006
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
That

1007
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,647
When I think of

1008
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
As of tragedy

1009
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
My first

1010
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:22,975
Thought

1011
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:23,999
Sympathy

1012
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
The Patriots

1013
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
To Mike Epps

1014
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,191
It's my first. I don't think I don't think this is a trap

1015
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
Help the victims are okay

1016
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,287
My first thought is the real victims are white p

1017
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
That's the truth

1018
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,919
You know they're going to demonize people with guns because

1019
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:45,759
Anyways

1020
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,807
No anything

1021
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
About what time

1022
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:55,487
Haven't watched the news posted on Drudge Report

1023
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Anywhere else

1024
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,607
And so they start talking about the dynamic

1025
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
Better going on

1026
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,703
A one thing that's really important

1027
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,263
Very quickly

1028
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,383
That veterans and right-wingers are going to be

1029
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,455
You mentioned before about

1030
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,807
Is the very

1031
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
Official reaction

1032
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:25,183
Show me

1033
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,583
Yeah

1034
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,423
I'm working with veterans

1035
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Special Victims Unit

1036
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,847
Units

1037
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:44,895
About who had

1038
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,855
Because he was having flashbacks

1039
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,903
And helped us

1040
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:05,631
Story

1041
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:10,239
Veterans looked at

1042
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,591
Narratives that he's been building up for weeks in months

1043
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,151
They're going to blame the veteran

1044
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,479
Which is good because they don't know that

1045
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,063
It pointing the finger at anybody

1046
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,671
Are constructing this

1047
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,999
That's important

1048
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
Here's what I think

1049
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,959
Right now listening to Bells I think

1050
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:41,727
He is

1051
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
Incredibly

1052
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,383
The line that buddy glasses

1053
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,663
From Friday

1054
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:52,991
Just that

1055
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
Wee-wee overburdened with an

1056
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Can a good actor travels

1057
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,927
You know what I'm saying interesting doesn't have much going on in the education

1058
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:12,703
It's a mess it's that there's not much going on in the in the storage

1059
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:16,287
Listen to this long time

1060
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:20,895
I'm about this episode and I thought it was

1061
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,735
And for the longest time I just had this idea in my mind

1062
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,807
He's riding

1063
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,367
Active

1064
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,135
Participant

1065
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,183
He is he is helping Alex

1066
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
Threadless

1067
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,751
So Alex is still kind of hoping that it's an

1068
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,799
In the immediate

1069
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,079
Just learning

1070
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:50,847
Think about this

1071
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
Stage

1072
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
After explosion

1073
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,463
I hope not

1074
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
But I am

1075
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:11,583
Even if

1076
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,631
They will use it because

1077
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,679
Everyone's focused on now

1078
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:22,847
People can be controlled when they're all on the same emotion at the same time

1079
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:29,247
So now it doesn't even matter

1080
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,319
Al-Qaeda it doesn't matter

1081
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,623
Still an attack on the veterans

1082
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
This is a narrative

1083
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
You can see it very clearly

1084
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:41,023
How much is it is like

1085
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
Knowing what they plan to do in the neck

1086
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:50,751
Next few days and how much of it is just like this

1087
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Wonder what

1088
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,127
You doing if he was at home buying

1089
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,807
Or creating a narrative

1090
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,415
Reacting to Something in real time with a

1091
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
Alex Jones already

1092
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,535
Influencing you be someone who you kind of admire

1093
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,351
Is going to be

1094
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,375
Or I imagine

1095
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,679
It's going to be like I'm going to follow the leader

1096
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
And the leader is saying

1097
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
This is a false flag

1098
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,823
I can tell you're like yeah

1099
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,943
No I mean within minutes

1100
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,319
And how much is that

1101
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,159
You don't have any

1102
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
Wow I think someone forced because they go to

1103
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:48,863
Jana and they start looking to it Alex

1104
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,727
Reality

1105
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,991
Underway right now

1106
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,807
To protect an event

1107
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,879
That is over

1108
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
That's so they can

1109
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:30,079
Alex

1110
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,407
Attack already formation.

1111
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
He doesn't have

1112
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:37,503
Cuz he has kept up with the story as

1113
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
Evolved over the half-hour that in

1114
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:46,463
Busy right now

1115
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
And 45 seconds later

1116
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
He goes back to sleep

1117
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,631
It's clear why they're reporting it as an attack

1118
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:12,831
This is information that's already

1119
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:19,231
Alex

1120
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
Didn't have some

1121
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,607
Reason to be looking at the situation

1122
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,935
Within a minute he's like

1123
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,471
Need to calm down

1124
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,543
That's really the bottom line

1125
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,383
When you look at a lot of this stuff when there's crisis reporting on Alex's show

1126
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,943
He needs to

1127
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
If you need to check out

1128
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,039
They are not doing good job

1129
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
He's

1130
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,695
F****** Christ

1131
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
Crisis report

1132
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
In a way that

1133
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,327
When you're so unfiltered as

1134
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,095
As AJ

1135
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:58,911
Reacts

1136
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Certainty

1137
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:05,055
That level of crisis

1138
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Is almost

1139
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
Possible for

1140
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:09,919
He can't wait

1141
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,687
For a second to the

1142
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Oh we're going to wait

1143
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
He has to react

1144
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,695
Is validation of the brand

1145
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,999
Is today right

1146
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,303
For twenty years and know their game plan

1147
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,839
So you need to have like

1148
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
The answers

1149
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,679
And that's a problem

1150
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,471
I'm soaked

1151
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,287
What they do for most of the rest of the show

1152
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,335
On the 15th here

1153
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
Is

1154
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,199
Correct

1155
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:46,783
Guessing around who did it

1156
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,151
The government will

1157
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,223
Create a narrative

1158
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,159
Will be a fabrication to shape our thought

1159
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,463
Military

1160
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,863
Facebook

1161
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
What they were

1162
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:49,503
The Arkham

1163
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,935
Is going to be

1164
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
You know

1165
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,855
I'm really proud of them for moving

1166
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,439
So quickly I'm really proud of them

1167
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,975
Making it way past that

1168
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
Stage of a yeah

1169
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,703
Holy s*** f******

1170
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
Sociopath

1171
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:44,287
It really is

1172
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,335
You can hear already that this is fake

1173
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
Yeah

1174
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,663
Minute

1175
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,991
You're in overdrive on air

1176
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:04,767
Absolutely nobody know episode

1177
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,351
Azrael

1178
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:11,167
Paper rose

1179
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:14,495
Delete my might give us

1180
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:24,735
What you're saying doesn't have to be on here but Alex recognizes the lack of information

1181
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,855
So he what he does in the middle of the 4th hour he announces

1182
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
We're going

1183
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,415
6 hours today

1184
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,975
Takes off

1185
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,023
A little while

1186
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
Jakari Jackson and David night host

1187
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
A h

1188
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:46,239
The next like 3 hours but taking calls and stuff like that

1189
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
We will listen to a little bit of

1190
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,311
But not from

1191
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
From this

1192
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,151
Because I can't find that audio

1193
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,687
And I feel like

1194
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:57,503
Whatever they might have come up with

1195
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,039
If it's something that sticks

1196
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
Alex we'll talk about that

1197
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,135
So we will get all of that

1198
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,439
That coverage as it were

1199
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,279
Extremely

1200
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:13,631
Very fast

1201
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423
Him doing it it's like okay

1202
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:21,823
You know a couple of minutes into the fourth hour of your show this tragedy happen

1203
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,431
But halfway through the hour drive we're going six hours today

1204
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,735
It's very fast decision

1205
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
It's based on the lack of

1206
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
The ability to

1207
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,343
Have the concrete

1208
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
Make your Market

1209
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,903
Which is why it is

1210
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Which is why

1211
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
He has to be

1212
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:46,143
Call Moline

1213
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,447
I definitely feel like a vaction

1214
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,751
Indicate a certain amount of that

1215
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,031
Gleeful whenever he's out

1216
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:55,615
Like I said the only real substance

1217
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
What's going on between

1218
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,431
Bowser and Alex

1219
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,479
Is that they're just sort of gas

1220
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
Who's going to be

1221
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,783
Tourette's

1222
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:04,575
I don't feel this very productive

1223
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,023
Well menu

1224
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
Their needs

1225
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:19,423
I pray that they

1226
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,215
What menu

1227
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,495
I don't know is it

1228
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:30,687
Demonizing of the Patriots that happened in the last

1229
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,991
Forever I don't know

1230
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,039
The new enemy is

1231
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,087
The Patriots

1232
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,135
We've never had to worry about

1233
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,511
Well I mean

1234
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:48,351
Hey earlier the f*** you

1235
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
Perry the actor

1236
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,055
Advance of the Superbowl

1237
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,871
Don't know my conference okay it's okay

1238
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:00,895
It's okay

1239
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,479
Alright American League versus The National

1240
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
Father

1241
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
I don't love it

1242
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:15,999
Today's the demonization of these truth-tellers Patriots all this stuff that's going on

1243
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:18,047
Richard Belzer

1244
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Interesting

1245
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
Considering what shows

1246
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:29,311
He said that

1247
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
People's brains

1248
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,447
Children

1249
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:58,751
So it's real funny

1250
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:04,639
Complaining about the very future

1251
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,663
Washington d.c.

1252
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,991
Bureau chief Jerome corsi was

1253
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,039
Very beautiful

1254
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,463
Just know where you are know what the hell you're talkin to have done

1255
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,767
Corsi's and associate

1256
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:25,887
He's working for WorldNetDaily at the time but he's been on the show a bunch of the two

1257
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:29,215
But he's considered an expert in s*** that's so funny

1258
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:34,335
Did you can complain about the demonization of John Kerry

1259
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
Show up

1260
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:41,503
I'll be like hey you never make things

1261
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,391
This guy I love

1262
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,183
Incredible

1263
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
Completely unrelated

1264
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:59,167
Venice

1265
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
Yeah

1266
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,823
Building up this

1267
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
Insinuation

1268
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:12,479
And a lot of it has been steering towards probably going to be

1269
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
Especially Alex

1270
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,063
Steering towards it's going to be the new enemies

1271
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,111
There's a whole lot

1272
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:19,903
Then

1273
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:20,927
It made sense

1274
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
Alex realizes

1275
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,999
One way that he can bat

1276
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,423
They're all entering

1277
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:35,519
Omigod omigod

1278
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,079
Realized

1279
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,735
Oh my gosh

1280
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:57,279
I was right

1281
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
Isaac Beckley

1282
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,375
Bullied

1283
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:07,775
On this episode of information

1284
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,799
Patriots Meredith

1285
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:13,919
It's Crystal Clear how excited he is Patriots Day in Massachusetts

1286
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,759
Patriot's Day was not celebrated nationally on April 9th

1287
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,039
It used to be

1288
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:23,647
On April 9th third Monday of April

1289
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,975
And the Boston Marathon has always been on that day

1290
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,767
They're basically the same thing

1291
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
Exhausted especially

1292
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:34,143
More importantly though there are a lot of other things that could have been

1293
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,191
If This Were Somehow Patriot related

1294
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,007
You know there's a lot of reenactments there's these

1295
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,543
Are the Red Sox playing at home

1296
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,615
Is opening day

1297
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,151
Every year or most

1298
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,455
Visit a tenuous connection

1299
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,735
But it's

1300
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,759
Super important to Alex

1301
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:52,831
Because he's engaging in a behavior known as motivated reasoning

1302
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,647
Alex has a predetermined conclusion

1303
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,927
To arrive at

1304
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
Namely that the globalists are blaming this bombing on the page

1305
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,559
He needs to get there because Vermont

1306
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,607
He's been warning of a big attack coming back

1307
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,727
He knows he's probably not going to get a better chance

1308
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
To validate his narratives and rhetoric

1309
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,311
And the process make a bunch of money

1310
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,151
Get work at get to work at crafting this and make it

1311
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,455
The behaviorist

1312
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,503
Alex is exactly what you'd expect from

1313
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
From someone who is not

1314
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
Didn't reality

1315
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,111
But interested solely in manufacturing upper

1316
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:26,879
Perception

1317
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,695
It's been consistent since the news of the bombing broke out

1318
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:33,023
It's all been an attack on media coverage but it's not intact

1319
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
It's based on

1320
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
Instinct

1321
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:43,007
You have Alex sitting on CNN for assuming it was an attack when they only did that because video they knew about the Alex

1322
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,567
He doesn't have any information

1323
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,639
About the attack itself North

1324
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,199
Goddamn bunch

1325
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
Rainbow

1326
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,015
Think of the globalist going to blame

1327
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,319
Alex doesn't want to guess who they're going to blame

1328
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
He wants to establish

1329
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,671
First of all B erroneously

1330
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
And secondly that no matter who asked

1331
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,487
Actually gets Blaine

1332
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:04,511
Is all about

1333
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,559
Getting it is dumb f*** gun buddy

1334
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,655
I didn't know exactly what I would find looking at this episode

1335
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:15,007
And on one level none of this is surprising but on another level

1336
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:16,799
This is making me a lot more angry

1337
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,567
Then I expected

1338
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,639
Add straws to find a way to make

1339
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
His tragedy about himself

1340
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,711
And it shows worldview

1341
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,015
People are f****** bleeding on the street

1342
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,319
Other people putting themselves in danger

1343
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,343
To help their fellow citizens

1344
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,927
People are scared some people don't know where their loved ones are

1345
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,463
This is a disgrace

1346
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,023
And it's willful

1347
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
It's an affront

1348
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
Payment people

1349
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:43,935
Boston we're going through exact time he's on are spreading

1350
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,471
This is a perfect

1351
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
Encapsulation of Alex Jones

1352
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,543
Brainstorming

1353
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
To spin a tragedy in

1354
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
Profitable for him

1355
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,639
While the victims of the tragedy blue

1356
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,175
F*** him

1357
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
Nonsense

1358
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,783
They'll be more Ranch

1359
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,367
I really really dis

1360
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,903
Respected

1361
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,231
It's such a next-level version of what he does

1362
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:11,583
Like you do at the realities that are other people are existing in

1363
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,631
And the way he's behaving are just

1364
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
So

1365
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,167
Out of style

1366
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,751
It's awful

1367
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Do you would like

1368
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
And lack of air

1369
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
Is

1370
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
Besides

1371
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
The size of the United

1372
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
If you are living

1373
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,047
Belgium

1374
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
And a bombing half

1375
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,119
That's a

1376
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,423
And so you don't treat it as though

1377
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:49,215
This is an attack on belgians also

1378
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
Right

1379
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
In the same way

1380
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,335
Belgium is a lot closer to France

1381
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
Functionally

1382
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,455
I do think that Alex

1383
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,735
Believe she lives

1384
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,015
Country obviously

1385
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,087
In his mind the only

1386
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:10,719
And it's a state or a country

1387
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
Understand

1388
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Behaviorism

1389
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,071
If you're just like if

1390
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,351
CNN is reporting

1391
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,239
If belgians were reporting this way about it

1392
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:28,639
In France I would still think it was pretty rough

1393
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Interview at without

1394
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:31,455
Like all these people are f******

1395
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,575
I don't know if you can

1396
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,367
So Alex need more information

1397
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,463
Going along and there isn't much

1398
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
Is unknown

1399
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,535
But one way here

1400
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:48,863
Sizing get around that is put out a call for people

1401
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Call Lynn

1402
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Anime what he's doing is just ask

1403
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,583
He Intel

1404
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,631
What are you going to get for your callers that is

1405
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,935
He Intel

1406
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
The idea that you

1407
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,751
Just crowdsource narrative

1408
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,151
Transparent

1409
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:33,919
Bulshit

1410
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,527
Well I don't have time right now.

1411
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,063
You guys give me a bunch of ideas

1412
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,135
Adultery pick some to put into the narrative later it's

1413
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,927
I know it's like a contest

1414
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
I don't trust

1415
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:52,351
To buy employees to read the news and synthesizes warm April

1416
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
Alright

1417
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:59,519
Give me some give me some wild ship wouldn't have debated

1418
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,543
Responsibility

1419
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
Crazy

1420
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,991
That I want to really nail down

1421
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Down and talk about

1422
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,783
Because I think that they

1423
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,551
Kind of

1424
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,391
He's trying to do

1425
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,671
April 15th

1426
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,463
In the again

1427
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,743
Within

1428
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,815
1:20 hour after news broke

1429
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:41,503
We are

1430
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:48,671
There is no

1431
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,231
Olivia Ron part out of it

1432
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
For now

1433
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:58,143
Right here by the most dangerous possible for Alex

1434
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
To frame a conditional

1435
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Call statement

1436
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,495
If they blame libertarian Patriot group

1437
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,567
Big trouble and they're moving ahead with it

1438
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,639
Alex's injecting a classic if then state

1439
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:12,735
As reality

1440
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:16,063
So if you see blaming Patriot libertarian

1441
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:22,463
Didn't necessarily follow and there will be bombing all over the plate and the March 10th

1442
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:23,487
Camps is Eminem

1443
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:26,559
This is a purely logical statement that you put in for

1444
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:30,399
The problem with this when you frame an argument this way

1445
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:33,983
You need to be pretty careful about how you present what the media is

1446
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,031
With this if then argument

1447
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:45,247
You're actually arguing that the globalist are about to Ron Paul and nobody

1448
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:49,087
It just necessarily follows from the if then argue

1449
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,647
You can't get around that based on

1450
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,951
How words work

1451
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:56,767
Formal logic

1452
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,047
Cannot lie

1453
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:58,815
The falsity

1454
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,399
If you have a valid argument and the premises are conclusion

1455
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,423
You cannot be false

1456
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,983
The actual form of the argument that Alex

1457
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Who's making is this

1458
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
Premise one

1459
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
If the media blames the Patriots

1460
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,359
Then they're moving ahead with it

1461
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
Rabbit stew

1462
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,175
The media is blaming

1463
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:16,991
Conclusion therefore they are moving ahead

1464
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,575
In this clip we're seeing the first premise

1465
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,599
Introduce

1466
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,135
Which is why this is stupid

1467
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:28,511
Alex still needs premise to in order to have this construction of an argument work

1468
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,791
And if we

1469
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,607
Manipulating things in order to establish premise

1470
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,399
That's immediately

1471
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,727
Then what you really seeing as him lying and manipulating to jump

1472
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
Notify the conclusion

1473
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:42,079
That they're moving ahead with it and there's going to be

1474
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,895
Is it pretty basic deception stuff

1475
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,175
And Alex does variations

1476
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
Kind of thing all the time

1477
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
How do you spell like pointing this one I was particularly important

1478
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
Very glaring

1479
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,367
I will get through some more of this stuff you'll see why this is very

1480
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,135
Important

1481
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
He needs

1482
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
Primus 22b

1483
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
Be established

1484
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:58,975
Doesn't work

1485
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,023
He no longer has a good argument

1486
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,351
If the media isn't blaming

1487
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,655
He needs that to be there in order to

1488
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
Justified

1489
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
Facilitate

1490
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
Baker's archery

1491
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
Look

1492
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,799
Extreme

1493
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
Right

1494
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
So I would like to

1495
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:20,736
Hotlogic work

1496
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,296
I would love to I would love to see Alex

1497
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
X1 trying fumble through

1498
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
Explained

1499
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:32,000
Exactly

1500
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,816
It is the argument

1501
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,120
Look at it

1502
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:37,888
Very like

1503
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,472
Absolutely

1504
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,520
Because

1505
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
We'll see

1506
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
I assure you

1507
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,640
I'm so in the next clip Alex

1508
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,552
And then he says which is code for

1509
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:57,088
Man I hope

1510
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,240
In trouble

1511
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:26,016
With my famous 1776

1512
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:32,160
Man I am amazed at how quickly these guys move on from grief

1513
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:39,072
Anthony real personal concern about hypothetical yet

1514
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,608
It sucks

1515
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,632
Gross

1516
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,448
He's working on Primus

1517
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,080
But he's trying to make

1518
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,896
It makes it so much clearer these actions are in

1519
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
Service

1520
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,480
Propping up the flimsy part of his argument

1521
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,016
In order to make it all look real

1522
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,552
8

1523
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:03,392
Questions

1524
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,416
In the area

1525
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
And this pisses off Bowser

1526
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:20,288
Exactly

1527
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,360
?

1528
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,304
Yeah I got to go to Drudge

1529
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:47,936
Clips

1530
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:52,288
As if to imply that he's asking about their right-wing groups

1531
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,432
Special

1532
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
Patriot's Day events going on in

1533
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:13,280
YouTube

1534
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
425

1535
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,736
This is about the holiday

1536
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,088
Are there are going on

1537
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
Yeah

1538
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,136
Is Patriots Day

1539
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,416
Yeah there's a lot of traffic

1540
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,952
I think that means it the right way

1541
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:47,840
This is already the crafting of perceptions based on

1542
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,656
Hinging on this word right

1543
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,384
To make the argument work

1544
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
Let me know

1545
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,296
It's it's really easy for him to use this one because he wasn't

1546
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,856
He's not burdened with that ability to under

1547
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,624
Understand words

1548
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:16,256
I think that this is one of the cases of

1549
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:18,304
You don't know any

1550
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:21,120
I think this is one of the cases of evil being map

1551
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:24,448
I think that he knows exactly what he's

1552
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:29,568
He wants to spread bore suspicion

1553
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,360
Around the idea that the bombing was

1554
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,384
Was planned by some

1555
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
Nefarious globalist

1556
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:49,280
Richard this is looking worse by the minute

1557
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:50,816
Devon Google guys

1558
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,656
Important to remember

1559
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,192
Marathon running is a big

1560
01:24:56,448 --> 01:25:00,288
Sports marathon is one of the biggest annual marathons in the world

1561
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:03,616
Someone off of insipid way bigger in terms of number of runners

1562
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,408
But the Boston Marathon is huge

1563
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:07,968
C97

1564
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,784
Making it to the world's oldest annual Marathon

1565
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:14,368
Like the marathon got brought back to the Olympics in 1890

1566
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,464
The next year after that Boston Marathon started it's been going ever since

1567
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,792
It's a huge deal in the international running community

1568
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,608
Coming from all over to take part in this event

1569
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,192
The second winner ever in 1898 with a Canadian

1570
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:33,312
In 1907 a Canadian member of the First Nations named Thomas Longboat won the race

1571
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,360
He has a very rich history

1572
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,920
It was mostly Americans in Canadian

1573
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,200
Until the late forties

1574
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,760
And then you see the list come to life winners from

1575
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,832
From South Korea Japan Guatemala

1576
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,136
5-minute recent years a lot of Canyon

1577
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,208
Only one American won the marathon between night

1578
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
46 +

1579
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,840
The only American to win that time

1580
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,144
Kelly which happened to be the same thing

1581
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,216
Spelling is elastomeric

1582
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
1845

1583
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,264
And those dude

1584
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
Work-related

1585
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:10,944
The race has a crazy history full of weird trivia

1586
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,760
They let women start running

1587
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,528
Guess what Jordan

1588
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,136
For six years at that point

1589
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:25,536
Remember that

1590
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,304
47

1591
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,840
The Scottish guy who

1592
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:30,144
Who single-handedly try to keep women out of

1593
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,960
The marathon

1594
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,056
There's a wheelchair Division and record holders everything

1595
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
When you see that line of flags

1596
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,200
Finish Line of the Boston Marathon

1597
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
Or anything like that

1598
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:48,832
It's a recognition that this thing that could just be people running along with

1599
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
Is so much more than

1600
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,672
It's a celebration that crosses cultures and

1601
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,464
Community brings people together

1602
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,768
According to the Boston marathon's official

1603
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:57,536
Facebook page

1604
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,304
Quote

1605
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,168
Each year about 100 nations are represented by runners in the Boston Marathon and their Flags

1606
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,216
Stretch of Boylston

1607
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,520
It has nothing to do with the UN

1608
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,080
Rather it's to honor and celebrate each of the runners

1609
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
Takes part in the race

1610
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,480
How to take a physical representation of cross cultural celebration in togetherness

1611
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:21,856
He's using it to create suspicion around the bombing by just making s*** up to attach it to one of his big bad guy

1612
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
You went

1613
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,904
This is shameful s***

1614
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,976
I really do get down to the bottom of it

1615
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:30,304
Is it use any kind of mulch Multicultural Unity

1616
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,584
As a um plot

1617
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,632
And I think there's a name for that

1618
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,424
You know it is almost like

1619
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,960
He is taking

1620
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,776
Let's call it the Boston

1621
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:46,688
How much is a cross cultural event celebrating how regardless of where you're from

1622
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,224
We all care and we are all humans

1623
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,504
Then we are all empathetic

1624
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,296
And he's turning that into something

1625
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
Evil

1626
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,720
Which browser is not in favor of

1627
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,512
Yeah

1628
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:04,096
Alex that has another revelation

1629
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:06,912
That's how he realizes he can use to make this

1630
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,936
Look like they're blame

1631
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,968
It's always

1632
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
What

1633
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
That's nonsense

1634
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:29,696
Also they took him like half an hour to realize it's text day

1635
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,488
Weird

1636
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
He's got a

1637
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,376
Probably

1638
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,960
Like I mentioned earlier in this episode

1639
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:47,360
Talked about how they're going to bomb in Blaine bus earlier the episode so he looks like crawfish

1640
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,456
And the whole crew

1641
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:54,016
That's the thing he says everyday

1642
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
Coincidentally a tragedy

1643
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
East Rock

1644
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:14,496
Shot heard round the world

1645
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,656
So he's a psychic who predicted everything

1646
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,424
And

1647
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,960
How long how long

1648
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,664
This is towards the end of the 4th hour

1649
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
Because the thing

1650
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,712
I

1651
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,248
Here is a genuine

1652
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
Enterprise

1653
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,808
Self for being correct

1654
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,344
Which suggests

1655
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,880
He doesn't even think about it

1656
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,952
Things are going to blow its autopilot

1657
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,560
Like they're all going

1658
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,888
And they have to tell him remember you predict

1659
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:17,472
Yeah

1660
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:22,080
Yeah elective memory on the part of his

1661
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,152
Forget about it every time you said that

1662
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:31,808
Disorder if you make

1663
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,624
Should all the time everyday

1664
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,160
The financial collapse is coming

1665
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,976
1008 2009 crisis-hit

1666
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,768
You look like a genius

1667
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
The time

1668
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,144
I just

1669
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,448
You know if you want to play this game

Information during the break

1674
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,408
From Rob do

1675
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,200
And it's at his brother

1676
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Oh God no

1677
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:08,416
Well there's a misunderstanding between the two of them

1678
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,464
Alex really overinflate

1679
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,680
What happened

1680
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:32,480
Running the race today

1681
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:44,000
Starmie

1682
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,776
So pretty

1683
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:57,824
Stupid misunderstanding

1684
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,104
That's one more example of

1685
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,736
Sure

1686
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
Should have

1687
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,296
Knothead Rob on a bike

1688
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,064
When I've dropped

1689
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Disinformation

1690
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:15,232
I think I could have spun this a little better

1691
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:20,352
By willingly and very intentionally misunderstanding running

1692
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,632
He's running

1693
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,656
The right yeah

1694
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,192
He's not running the ring

1695
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
He's running

1696
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:29,824
The Rex is that robbed his brother was there with the army

1697
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,360
And he was

1698
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:35,456
And at some point along the Route

1699
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,480
Came to him

1700
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:38,784
Signs of dehydration

1701
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,832
And he was made to

1702
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
Leave the race

1703
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:46,720
Army army ranks

1704
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:51,072
A high-level Military Intelligence guy

1705
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:57,472
That's exactly what was going on

1706
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:03,872
It is being put forth here first of all

1707
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:09,248
Who's directors dad is in the FBI is brother-in-law

1708
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:16,160
That's the sort of thing that really makes cancer

1709
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:22,304
You can only say not I not I not there's a good guys in the Spy

1710
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,608
Before people decide you work for the man

1711
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,632
Well he probably

1712
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:32,032
Personally I don't really believe these credentials or at least I think they're intentionally

1713
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:33,312
Proximity to legitimate in

1714
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
How much does it all the time

1715
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,640
Why believe Steve

1716
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,920
Mechanics take resume

1717
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,224
Call Christopher monckton Lord

1718
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,344
It's all just what works best for the brand

1719
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,368
And the brand is

1720
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
Deception

1721
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:54,048
I'm inclined to believe considering the robin Alex offer no evidence to the contrary

1722
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,328
They have signs of dehydration

1723
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,120
Allow me to lay out my Kik

1724
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,216
Lyrics

1725
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:06,848
April 15th 2013 was a fairly cool a day in Boston

1726
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:13,248
What temperature is around 48° good person

1727
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
Finishing a marathon

1728
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:20,416
Pretty high for the Boston Marathon

1729
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
2018

1730
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
However

1731
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,512
If you have over 20,000 and

1732
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,072
1000 people

1733
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,120
Who for one reason or another don't pass

1734
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
Past the finish line

1735
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,936
Are pretty good number those people

1736
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,496
You kind of have to assume didn't finish because of medical reasons

1737
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:37,824
It seems unlikely that they would train go through the steps

1738
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:44,224
Qualified plan had registered for the marathon forgotten about

1739
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:50,624
It's Not Butter

1740
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,928
Work

1741
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,720
It's something that takes

1742
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
A lot

1743
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:58,816
To get to the starting line the most people

1744
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,608
Look that's why 95%

1745
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,168
You're not having anybody who's like

1746
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:09,056
How to lurk I'm just going to go run the marathon today I woke up a little bit late

1747
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:13,920
It's not uncommon for people to be unable to finish the race

1748
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:16,736
Actually died

1749
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,504
Before

1750
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,064
One thing that makes the dehydration or exhaust

1751
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Exhaustion

1752
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,624
Story

1753
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,928
Is it a pretty common for enlisted person

1754
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,464
To sign up for this Marathon

1755
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,280
Honor of their fallen Brothers in the service

1756
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:33,120
They do the symbolically by participating in what's known as the

1757
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:38,496
Shuffle Rock which involves military backpack

1758
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
That weighs about 40 lb

1759
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:45,920
That a variable could make it far more likely that someone would have a difficult time finishing the full Marathon

1760
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:50,528
Brother-in-law was doing toughrock

1761
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:55,136
But there's definitely

1762
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
The marathon

1763
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:00,512
It's literally impossible for me to figure out if any any concrete information exists on that

1764
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:04,864
Could be robbed sister's husband

1765
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,936
But whatever isn't even his last name

1766
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,728
I've no way of tracking down any

1767
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
Information

1768
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,520
And they don't offer at

1769
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
Because of course they do

1770
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,104
All this is to say if there's possible explanations

1771
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,128
For him being advised

1772
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,920
The marathon that have nothing

1773
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,736
To do with conspiratorial paranoia

1774
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,528
Well I looked into a little bit and

1775
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
I believe his name

1776
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
Private

1777
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:29,952
So that doesn't that's dead Rick

1778
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,536
The best thing I can say is for this is that information

1779
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,304
Doesn't prove

1780
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:37,632
The worst I can say is the dues allowing Alex

1781
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,192
To use his brother-in-law's medical situation

1782
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,728
To be used as part of his attempt

1783
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,288
Capitalize on the death of

1784
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,056
3 people

1785
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,592
Injuries of 250

1786
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,360
Tupac's others

1787
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,152
Which I find to be an immoral act

1788
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:52,736
Yeah he should have gone from dude

1789
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
I agree

1790
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:57,856
Let's see if Richard Belzer has a different take

1791
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
Operation

1792
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,624
So

1793
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,928
Counter Theory

1794
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:36,000
He was dehydrated okay well you could believe

1795
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,048
Because

1796
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,072
He said it

1797
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:39,840
Right

1798
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
You know what year

1799
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
That's not even

1800
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,216
It obvious

1801
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
God.

1802
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,872
Yeah

1803
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,200
I don't even care

1804
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
Do even

1805
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:02,624
Has a brother-in-law that someone was going to have something sore

1806
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,048
I thought you were

1807
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,584
On the road

1808
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:19,264
The Alex is overdrive fourth hour

1809
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,288
Coming

1810
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,312
Do more

1811
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,336
In order to

1812
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:26,176
Laura-leigh

1813
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,224
SOB jump back keep the fires

1814
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,248
Stoked

1815
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:35,392
And we see that Alex has decided to make this a regular thing

1816
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:54,848
Future rapper

1817
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:57,152
24-hour straight or longer

1818
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Nope

1819
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:00,480
Still not true in 2019

1820
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:05,856
Long time

1821
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:09,184
Striking while the Iron's hot

1822
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,768
Here's the thing out of it

1823
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:16,096
There's not a lot of information coming out

1824
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
For speculate

1825
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,656
People are in the right headspace

1826
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:22,496
Conjecture and b******* in order to satisfy

1827
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,264
4 something

1828
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,800
And I'm going to fill it

1829
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,824
Yeah if there's a

1830
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,872
Someday everybody wants some

1831
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,200
Nature abhors I abhor Alex

1832
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,528
So there's no information

1833
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,832
The 15th

1834
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,928
Come out about the bomb being a pressure cooker

1835
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,000
Those little bits of information

1836
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
Have

1837
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,584
Come out reporting

1838
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,376
I went back to the room was looking

1839
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,936
Through like articles posted in that day

1840
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,472
And a lot of it is just a very

1841
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
Standard

1842
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Little bit of

1843
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,032
Information

1844
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,360
We're not yet

1845
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:02,688
Noah Wyle

1846
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
Put out by

1847
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,528
Everybody the internet

1848
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,832
There's a lot of feelings

1849
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,856
In the course of this

1850
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,880
It's not just

1851
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,512
Everybody else

1852
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,816
To let people off the hook at other places

1853
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:21,632
I have some critic critique

1854
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,824
And if

1855
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,384
So

1856
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:36,480
Talk about how you know I've been saying cuz it can be a false flag forever

1857
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:37,760
Great

1858
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,296
How many complaints about OB

1859
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Obama's speech

1860
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:47,232
False flag

1861
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,536
What

1862
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:52,864
Sure

1863
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,424
Narrative they're going to carry out

1864
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:58,240
Whether it's

1865
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,800
What's your very rare

1866
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,360
Deter attacks are rare.

1867
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:09,504
In the malls

1868
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:14,368
Ratcheting up of the overall

1869
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,672
Martial law

1870
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:26,144
I want to press conference

1871
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,192
Really ugly

1872
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:32,800
Black and white speckled

1873
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:34,848
Paramount during press conference

1874
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,640
I looked at that

1875
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,408
So bad

1876
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,432
Oh yeah

1877
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:42,528
The first thing that came to mind

1878
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,600
What what does a fear monger

1879
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:49,696
It was about the people who helped each other like

1880
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,512
That speech was about the runners going to give blood

1881
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:57,120
It was about people taking off their clothes to make tourniquets for other people like

1882
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:03,008
Fix not fear-mongering right it's almost it's almost like

1883
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,056
Took one of Obama's strength

1884
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,104
Empathy and orator

1885
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,920
And attacked it and tried to make him look weak

1886
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:14,528
Almost

1887
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:19,648
I always love it when he gets into the like

1888
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,208
Real I hate the belt

1889
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:28,352
That's just

1890
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,520
Rock the Bells

1891
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
I love you I love you and Alex metric

1892
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,664
Specific numbers

1893
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,712
And so he gives birth

1894
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,016
But this was real

1895
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:52,160
Screenshot of 100

1896
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,232
What are out of 100

1897
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:00,352
But this is real

1898
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,728
Alex has had time to gather resources

1899
01:43:05,984 --> 01:43:07,776
Figure out a way to

1900
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,056
Defense

1901
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
4

1902
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
Krampus 2

1903
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:13,920
That they're blaming coming for you

1904
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,200
And here's how he

1905
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:19,552
Stepped out on that road will be going on throughout this

1906
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:32,608
Where are they

1907
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,312
So this is such a classic Alex

1908
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,592
You have tons of evidence

1909
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:47,712
Already bore you with proving his case

1910
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:53,344
This person should be strong indication that he does not have a ton of Eva

1911
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,440
Manufacturing

1912
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,208
Perception

1913
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:03,072
He's clearly distorted wolf blitzer's words in the closing segment of the April 15th

1914
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
Episodes

1915
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
That's one instant

1916
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,376
Something he thinks

1917
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:11,776
Is proof of blaming right-wingers with Bob and it's b*******

1918
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:15,104
The bombings could be related

1919
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:20,480
Axelrod's comments were regarding the fact that Obama didn't immediately call this an act

1920
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
Actor terrorism

1921
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784
Explaining that quote

1922
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,832
The word is taking on a different meaning since

1923
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
911

1924
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,392
He went on to say quote

1925
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:30,720
You use those words and it means something very specific in people's mind

1926
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:36,096
And I'm sure what he was what was going through the mind of the present it is well we don't really know who did this

1927
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,120
It was

1928
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:40,960
Someone who is pro you know you just don't know

1929
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:44,032
And I think his attitude is let's not put any

1930
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,056
Inference

1931
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,616
Let's just

1932
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
To get the people

1933
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,152
Responsible

1934
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,432
And that is why

1935
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,456
Everybody

1936
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:53,248
Hahaha

1937
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:56,576
It's

1938
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,208
It's really tough to parse exactly what Axelrod was saying

1939
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:08,864
A possible reading of it is that Axelrod fix that Obama B

1940
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:11,168
But another reading of it is that Axelrod

1941
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
Dim stuff just

1942
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:17,056
Another reading is the fact that it was texted was just

1943
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:20,640
Example Axelrod came up with to express their a ton of motive

1944
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:24,480
They could be behind the bombings and no one really knew what the situation

1945
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:28,064
I'm inclined to are towards that last one

1946
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,368
Also says quote

1947
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:34,720
Inference

1948
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,512
Literally

1949
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,304
I'd like that's almost

1950
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,840
Worst example of

1951
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
Example

1952
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,496
Well we don't know who did it

1953
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
Cuz everybody lose their

1954
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,592
Maybe like this is a terrible

1955
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,896
He has to give like an explanation for why

1956
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
We're not

1957
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,200
Come out and say

1958
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,504
I'll call you

1959
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,272
Yeah yeah

1960
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,576
To say it could be

1961
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
It could be

1962
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,136
Islamic

1963
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:08,768
The first one

1964
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,864
In a defense

1965
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,912
Of what

1966
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:19,520
The explanation of it is there a lot of votives

1967
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:22,080
The first easiest one that people could under

1968
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,360
Is

1969
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,664
Wow is also text

1970
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:30,016
Which by implication consider that a terrorist

1971
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:31,808
Probably

1972
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:36,672
Motivation

1973
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
And anyway

1974
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,280
On a scale of total b*******

1975
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,328
2 they're blaming

1976
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,120
A1 or A2

1977
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:48,960
It's easy to see how it could be spun to say if they're pointing the finger at xprotect

1978
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,008
But it's entirely unconvincing

1979
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,544
And only work

1980
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
If you take it

1981
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,080
Completely out of

1982
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,640
So

1983
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,456
Alex is convinced this is a false flag

1984
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:00,736
He's very thorough

1985
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,504
Nevada

1986
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,600
Through this entire episode which is

1987
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,904
He believed that media

1988
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,440
Like Media Matters

1989
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,464
Mediaite

1990
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,424
Him right person go to blame right-wingers

1991
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:24,032
Is there a saint

1992
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Right

1993
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,592
Tangled web

1994
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,152
When first we set up to tell the truth

1995
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,968
So here's Eclipse Artisan body

1996
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:39,136
You are busy analyzing

1997
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:46,816
We playing Doctor Who

1998
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,376
That was very predictable

1999
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:01,152
Media Matters

2000
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,968
4

2001
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:27,008
Because you're

2002
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:35,712
Gotcha everything posted letters from the time of the bombing to the point

2003
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,272
M340i

2004
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
About

2005
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:41,088
On the morning of the 16th Matt Gertz

2006
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:45,696
Published an article titled reactions to the Boston Bomber

2007
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,744
The 1st century was Alex

2008
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,792
With a screenshot

2009
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,936
That killed Boston Marathon

2010
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:59,008
Aztec Falls

2011
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,592
Hashtag

2012
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:05,152
The rest of the list of people

2013
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:06,944
I hate I hate living

2014
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:12,064
Free solitaire

2015
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,136
I love love love indoor plumbing

2016
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:16,416
But I want to go back

2017
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,184
Tuba for all

2018
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,280
I just I'm not for there was a bad Road

2019
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:25,888
The rest of that list is just people like Laura Ingraham and Pat Robertson

2020
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,704
Is there's nothing about criticizing Alex

2021
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,752
For saying that they were going to blame the Patriots

2022
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:34,848
There's another

2023
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
His enabler

2024
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,920
But this to doesn't seem to be critiquing

2025
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,736
A saying that the globalist going to blame the Patriots for the bombing

2026
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:45,344
It just seems to be people rightfully and rightly responding with disgust

2027
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:49,696
Quickly Alex

2028
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,768
That article probably had him more worried though

2029
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,328
Since it was discussing the people who validate alley

2030
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,376
Consistently wrong

2031
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,400
Great

2032
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:05,056
Specifically

2033
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:09,920
And all the other supposedly credible mainstream people who unwittingly Elevate Alex

2034
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:11,712
If I rally

2035
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,992
I would probably see that

2036
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,272
As an attack but it

2037
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:16,320
It still doesn't fit with what Alex is describing

2038
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:18,368
I really can't find any evidence

2039
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,904
Media Matters was condemned

2040
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,464
For saying they were going to blame the Patriots

2041
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:27,072
I think they're just kind of offended that he called it a false flag within minutes with no information

2042
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:33,984
Kind of wrote an article like that but if you actually read it if more just an article that's like look at this ass

2043
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:37,312
Kind of the point of that article

2044
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
White House front group

2045
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:41,920
Still employed

2046
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,992
Wesley Glen

2047
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:51,392
Perpetrators

2048
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:54,464
Turn out to be Muslim just like it's possible

2049
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:58,560
Extremist right or right wing

2050
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,864
Or busam fearing Anders Breivik

2051
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:04,448
Or lone individuals driven by a political mental illness

2052
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:10,592
Do you even calls out a few Democrats on Twitter who made suggestions along with calling out islamophobe

2053
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,872
The thing about being Muslim

2054
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,176
His take on it was pretty even-handed

2055
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,200
No way suggest

2056
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,224
But it was a right winger

2057
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:23,136
Hijack on The Young Turks conversation on a different reaction depending on who the bomber

2058
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,072
Conversations priest

2059
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:31,840
But it's

2060
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:35,168
Not at all

2061
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,704
Hypothetical

2062
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:42,336
Looking over the mainstream reporting in the immediate aftermath

2063
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:44,896
I didn't really see a lot of people blaming right wing

2064
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,920
Extremists at all

2065
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,504
There's some suggestion

2066
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,064
Based on the timing and amateurish nature of the bomb

2067
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:56,416
But all those suggestions were accompanied by disclaimers that we have no idea behind

2068
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
Too early to say

2069
01:51:58,464 --> 01:52:01,024
Alex's rhetoric does not seem to match up with them

2070
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,328
Which to me is an indication that

2071
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,352
Like I keep bringing up

2072
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,632
He's trying to build

2073
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,656
Promise to

2074
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,424
Of his

2075
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:13,568
In service of the globalist about to bring this whole thing down Panic everybody

2076
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:17,408
Primus too so even if the media doesn't do what he's

2077
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,688
Predicted they will

2078
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:22,272
He's going to go out of his way to make it look

2079
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
On a very basic level

2080
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:26,624
This is purely designed to cause panic and fear

2081
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,672
I put his audience Apocalypto

2082
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,440
Estate

2083
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464
It's disgusting

2084
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,768
Respond to a legitimate tragedy

2085
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:34,304
Because it's

2086
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:38,144
Fantasy him use this like

2087
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,912
These

2088
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,448
These Outlets

2089
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:42,240
Are responding to what I did

2090
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,008
Like humans

2091
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,056
Might saying this guy's a f****** a******

2092
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:47,616
And then they blame

2093
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:48,384
Patriots

2094
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:52,992
Adding that wrinkle into it sort of invalidate other people

2095
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Correct credit

2096
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:54,784
View

2097
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:55,808
Even worse

2098
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,112
All this is just a psychodrama

2099
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,392
Forcing on his audio

2100
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:00,928
And

2101
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,536
Kind of weird me out of

2102
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:18,336
Which

2103
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,872
The whole point of

2104
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,432
Victor make people afraid

2105
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,224
So why are you

2106
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,808
Saying that you're condemning them

2107
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
And

2108
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:34,208
Estranged

2109
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:35,744
Almost

2110
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:38,304
Relationship

2111
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,352
Supposed to

2112
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:43,936
It's weird how that works really Alex

2113
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,240
To himself

2114
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:48,800
He thinks that all he's doing is like ask

2115
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,872
Question trying to get to the bottom

2116
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:56,736
But you can see that's not the case

2117
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:03,904
You can see in this next clip that what he's doing is using all the narratives that he had built up over the past couple months

2118
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,184
And applying them

2119
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,208
To the current situation

2120
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:31,040
We warned you before

2121
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,760
Lexington Concord Boston

2122
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:24,288
Stewart Rhodes is Charmed in leader of The Oath Keepers

2123
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:30,688
Who does Alex go to immediately

2124
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,968
Kumite bomb something

2125
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,552
Consider him an expert

2126
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:43,744
What you see there is a fine-tuning of the old narratives that Alex have been building now that the payoff his come

2127
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:48,608
He chisels them down instead of Chicago in order to

2128
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,144
If they are

2129
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,424
Staying

2130
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:54,752
Veterans

2131
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:58,592
You take whatever it is is functional out of the myth

2132
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,408
And the narratives that you've bailed and apply them

2133
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,432
The present situation

2134
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,480
I pretend all the other s*** never happen

2135
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,296
I really

2136
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:11,392
Having a

2137
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:13,440
Who after the boss

2138
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,792
Was it one of you guys

2139
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:20,608
Out of the few of them

2140
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:22,400
How Wild is

2141
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,680
Is that yeah

2142
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:24,704
Crazy to have

2143
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,728
Have a bunch of known

2144
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:26,752
First group

2145
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:27,520
Like

2146
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,456
Second degree

2147
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:38,784
Just threw Larry Pratt of America alone

2148
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,088
Contact

2149
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:45,440
Yeah it was pretty weird

2150
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:48,000
You don't need the Kevin Bacon game now

2151
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,024
No it's

2152
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,560
It's a very short

2153
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,328
Yeah

2154
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:56,960
So I have this clip it just kind of off-base a little bit and I like it's kind of not really related to

2155
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:00,288
The primary stuff that's going on

2156
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,848
Is it something that Alex does not believe

2157
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:04,128
Just

2158
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,152
2 years later

2159
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
And

2160
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:24,096
So Alex believes

2161
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,168
Aggressively

2162
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:32,288
2015

2163
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,056
A very strange

2164
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,104
Is he talking about like evidence

2165
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,992
I think he didn't know

2166
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:45,856
Part of a drill is correct about some

2167
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:46,880
In 2013

2168
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:49,184
We find out in 2015 he changed

2169
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,720
Everything

2170
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:54,560
Part of the argument

2171
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,584
Everything is

2172
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:00,192
There's always a drill that covers up the actual false black

2173
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:03,520
Everything is vory talked about that turns the Sandy Hook

2174
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:07,104
It's Universal ride is rhetoric

2175
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,688
If there was a drill

2176
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:11,712
At the Boston

2177
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,480
Oh no

2178
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,272
Now what came out

2179
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:22,464
What's her freaking out

2180
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,768
Discover.com

2181
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:58,816
Manheim

2182
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,728
Alright whatever you have doesn't

2183
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:08,288
Little bit later on

2184
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,080
Before I discuss it I'll let

2185
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,104
Latest

2186
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:13,408
Let's go further

2187
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:30,304
Finish Line

2188
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:38,752
It's just a training exercise

2189
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:48,224
How much is the alternative

2190
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,528
Prisonplanet.com

2191
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:55,136
Remember this being parody

2192
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,416
Very heavily

2193
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,464
Right after

2194
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,304
Turned it into a

2195
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:04,608
The perception that there were an ounce

2196
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:07,168
Like just before the explosion

2197
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:09,472
In the aftermath of this

2198
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:10,240
Is a drill

2199
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,080
And that's sort of the way Alex's

2200
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:14,848
Presenting

2201
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:20,224
I like I said whenever he wants to portray something as a false flag the only arrow in his quiver he chooses

2202
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,784
Feels like unassailable

2203
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:26,368
Is the argue there was a drill going on at the same time as the event

2204
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:28,672
Meant to provide cover for the actual attack

2205
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:32,000
If you look throughout his career it's almost Universal

2206
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,280
Part of almost every

2207
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,048
Conspiracies

2208
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:34,816
Never promoted

2209
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,656
It seems a little weird

2210
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:41,216
Because there was a

2211
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:43,776
Describes

2212
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:49,408
In this case he's taking a local Boston news article about a runner saying that they were bomb-sniffing dogs at the race

2213
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,200
This is meaningless evidence

2214
02:00:51,456 --> 02:00:55,296
Pictures of people on roofs in hoodie

2215
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:56,832
None of that proves a damn thing

2216
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:58,112
It's just titillating

2217
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,672
I consulted some running forum

2218
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:04,000
To see what kind of chatter there was there in the aftermath of the bombing

2219
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,816
I found a lot of accounts of people who claim to have been there

2220
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:11,168
Just post on message boards but they do seem pretty

2221
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:12,960
With

2222
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:16,032
What the situation is they were told not to Pepe's dogs

2223
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:18,336
And the dogs that there were there

2224
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,104
For training /

2225
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:21,408
The dogs are being trained

2226
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:23,712
Weird but that's only because

2227
02:01:23,968 --> 02:01:24,480
There was a bombing

2228
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:28,832
If it hadn't happened you just look at that and I guess that makes sense

2229
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:32,672
Get the dogs acclimated to a setting where there's a lot of Buffalo

2230
02:01:32,928 --> 02:01:34,464
Tons of people around and tons

2231
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:35,744
Mustafa could distract them

2232
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:41,632
That seems like a tough environment to artificially create honestly I don't think there's any reason to assume

2233
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:44,448
That the dogs were there for bomb-sniffing training purpose

2234
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:45,728
More freaky

2235
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:46,752
Krowd

2236
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,520
Position purpose

2237
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,592
I don't understand all the ins and outs of training

2238
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,896
Dogs but I can imagine how this might

2239
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:56,992
Pretty universally this was the position of people on running forum

2240
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,368
It was an announcement not to pet the dog

2241
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,416
Be calm around the dog

2242
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:06,208
Don't startle the dogs

2243
02:02:06,464 --> 02:02:07,232
It wasn't

2244
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,792
Cromwell there's a bomb going off

2245
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:12,096
Even after surviving the bomb

2246
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:14,400
These people are reporting

2247
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:15,936
Weird

2248
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:17,728
And I-10

2249
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:23,872
I mean

2250
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:32,064
There it is it there were announcement

2251
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,088
Especially

2252
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:37,952
Okay

2253
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:41,024
Before we break down even a little bit more about this

2254
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:42,816
I want to talk about why this is stupid on it

2255
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:45,120
I was just trying to argue

2256
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:46,912
The bombing was a drill that went like

2257
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,936
And he's arguing

2258
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:50,752
Piece of evidence from the speakers

2259
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:52,544
How to stay calm it was just a drill

2260
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:56,896
The person making the announcement was involved in the drill

2261
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:59,456
Knew or believed it to be a drought

2262
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:01,504
Is there actually running a drill

2263
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,784
They would be doing so

2264
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,576
2 gauge police preparedness

2265
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,904
Headed towards accurately gauge

2266
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:11,232
It's important that people act

2267
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,536
If it was 100%

2268
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:16,864
If someone were to convince everyone to stay calm

2269
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:20,192
As it would completely alter the crowd's reaction to what was happening

2270
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,216
I guess

2271
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,752
I could be a good girl if you're trying to

2272
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:26,848
Police response to a group of people who don't believe in attack is actually happening

2273
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:31,968
But I feel like that's an area isn't very useful to prepare for the real world

2274
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,528
But now it is becoming more and more you

2275
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,600
Are not going to bail

2276
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,136
Freight

2277
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:45,024
Got on a PA system and told people not to panic is actually incredibly strong evidence

2278
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:47,072
Thought that this was a real bombing

2279
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,096
If it did happen

2280
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:48,864
Which I don't think

2281
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:51,680
It could have been misguided advice

2282
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:53,984
Expected well-meaning person

2283
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,520
Trying to help in crisis

2284
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:59,872
Orderly

2285
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:05,504
Triple everybody there's a lot of us right

2286
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,856
The reality of someone saying that I would interpret that as

2287
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,648
Evidence of reality

2288
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,952
And I don't think that's actually what happened

2289
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:16,000
I think it's a misrepresentation of

2290
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:17,024
This article

2291
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:22,144
He would still be hard to explain if this someone did make that announcement

2292
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,984
I don't think I need to explain.

2293
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:33,664
If you read the actual Post in the local 15 news out of Boston University of mobile coach Ali

2294
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:34,432
Stevenson

2295
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:37,248
And he says that there were announcements at this is a training exercise

2296
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,552
However there's literally no indication

2297
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,832
From the text or anything

2298
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,624
These announcements

2299
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,416
After the bombs went off or

2300
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,952
Just before or anything

2301
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:49,536
If you read his words and compare them to other accounts of people who were there

2302
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:51,072
He's just describing the announcer

2303
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,352
Not to pet the dog

2304
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,120
Animorphs

2305
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,424
Suspicious way than other people might have chosen to

2306
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:59,008
There was something like 20,000 people running in that Marathon

2307
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:04,640
And all the claims about announcement there was a drill

2308
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:06,176
Conspiratorial interpretation

2309
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,992
Comments of this one guy alley Steve

2310
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:11,552
It's very hard to take this too serious

2311
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:14,368
When there's tons of videos people captured on their phone

2312
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:16,672
This announcement doesn't show up in any of them

2313
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:21,024
When they're literally 10,000

2314
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,352
This up other than wanted like don't startle the dog

2315
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:29,728
I'm not even saying that I'm sure that Stephenson's making anything up

2316
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:33,568
You know there's a really good chance that people were told to be calm around the dog

2317
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:35,104
I hate comments could make sense

2318
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,176
In the context of Runners being told not to bother these dogs

2319
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:40,992
Acclimated to height

2320
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,784
Stress lots of people environment

2321
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:47,136
He might have been factually right but spoken in such a way the conspiracy idiots

2322
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:47,904
Decided to read

2323
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,928
Exactly what they want

2324
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,208
To hear from his words

2325
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:54,048
As I look at the information available it's really hard not to reach that conclusion

2326
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:57,888
This guy spoken precisely about being informed there's a dog training X

2327
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:00,448
Exercise going on and to remain calm around the dog

2328
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,752
And Alexandra silk of taking that is proof

2329
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,776
Set the whole thing

2330
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,592
That's my assessment I feel like

2331
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,872
What this boils down to

2332
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:09,920
Now in future episode

2333
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:10,688
There's a

2334
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,712
Big wrinkle

2335
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,736
About drills

2336
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,016
But that will have to wait

2337
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,552
There

2338
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:17,344
Alex

2339
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,392
Alex will find a piece of information

2340
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:22,720
I don't know this to be the case from listening to his episodes

2341
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:26,048
I remember that he finds a piece of information

2342
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:28,352
That proves to him.

2343
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,656
And it's far far more complicated

2344
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,680
I will get to that

2345
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,520
Sorry

2346
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:37,056
Do you like Fox

2347
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:41,920
Programming

2348
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,200
Okay

2349
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,736
Seasons 9 through

2350
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,272
Arrow season 2

2351
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,136
Fantastic

2352
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,168
In advance

2353
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,960
The Boston bombing with

2354
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:09,824
Plan because they showed

2355
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,640
I want a I want a

2356
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,408
Get a drill

2357
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:17,248
You wait until

2358
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:05,376
That was

2359
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:07,424
That's a weird

2360
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:11,264
That's a laugh that somebody who actually caused the bombing

2361
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:17,920
Talk about the bombing the day after it happened last like that

2362
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:26,112
There's literally no context Family Guy

2363
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:28,672
Affable behavior and I described that as Monster

2364
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:33,280
I want to talk about an episode of Family Guy that have been released on March 7th

2365
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:37,120
India episode

2366
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:41,728
Peter is a skydiving accident meets a guy named food in the hospital

2367
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:42,752
Southpoint

2368
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:45,312
Peter Griffin is not a tea party guy

2369
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:50,176
Episode that aired on May 13th 2012

2370
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:50,944
Peter

2371
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:55,296
Where the whole joke is it Peter joint

2372
02:08:55,808 --> 02:09:00,672
Episode was

2373
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,696
Corporate interest

2374
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:05,536
Computer learns that and reinstall the government

2375
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,328
He's not a party guy

2376
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:09,376
Character

2377
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,192
Sure

2378
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:18,592
How do I invest in the episode Alex become friends

2379
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:20,640
Which leads Peter to convert to Islam

2380
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:28,576
Broke into a plan to blow the Quahog bridge but

2381
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:33,696
But as the episode

2382
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:36,256
Clam doesn't get his table ready

2383
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:37,280
Which it seems weird

2384
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:41,632
But the phone is rigged and causes the bridge to blow up

2385
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:48,544
I'm not a Family Guy

2386
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,848
Message

2387
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:55,712
So I'm going to leave that alone how shity

2388
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:59,040
Rear weird muddiness

2389
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064
Some of the messages

2390
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:02,368
What is the claim that Alex's

2391
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:06,208
He's saying that this episode predicted the Boston Bomber

2392
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:09,024
Use the cell phone to blow up bombs

2393
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,304
The finish line of the race

2394
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:12,096
And that is absolutely not

2395
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:12,864
True

2396
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,656
The cell phone is linked to bombs at

2397
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:15,680
The Quahog Bridge

2398
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:22,080
What Alex is doing is combine the end of the episode with a cuddle

2399
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,616
From the beginning of the end

2400
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,920
When Peter is skydiving

2401
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:30,784
He says I haven't felt a rush like this since I won that Marathon

2402
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:35,136
And it cuts to him driving through a crowd of people in the Boston Marathon

2403
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:45,632
Put someone edited together the clip of the episode

2404
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,912
And the cell phone gag

2405
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,448
From the end of the episode

2406
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:52,544
To make it look like Pew cell phone trigger bombs to attack the Boston Marathon

2407
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:55,104
It may have been created in-house

2408
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:55,872
Might have been

2409
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:56,896
Might not

2410
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:58,944
But even if it wasn't Infowars

2411
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,736
The first Outlet to widely circulated

2412
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,016
Anythink

2413
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,576
Completeness of misinterpretation

2414
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,856
And misrepresentation

2415
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,672
The only reason someone would push something like this

2416
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,952
Is it they're desperate

2417
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
Counter reality

2418
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,512
To the one the rest of the world is

2419
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,280
Experiencing

2420
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:15,584
He's an abusive active media and now it should be

2421
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:16,864
Found

2422
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,936
Yeah it is

2423
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,216
Very clear

2424
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,008
The the misrepresentation

2425
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,056
It's clear the intention of it

2426
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:29,408
Yeah probably

2427
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:35,552
Travel f*** with people

2428
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:38,112
And gave it to

2429
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:39,648
Yeah when it

2430
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:40,672
Alex

2431
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:41,696
Occam's razor

2432
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,232
Technological

2433
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:45,024
Better to err on the side of Ali

2434
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:46,816
Alex

2435
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:48,608
Also another important

2436
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,632
Even if

2437
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:52,704
Complete misrepresentation about this Family Guy episode with

2438
02:11:53,216 --> 02:11:56,288
He still at this point has literally no idea how the bombs were detonated

2439
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:59,616
The initial theories were that it was they were on a timer

2440
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:05,760
Used for

2441
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,064
It's really important to look

2442
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:08,832
Stop like this

2443
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:13,952
Because absolutely was a false flag

2444
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:16,768
And the defense has given up his theories are really weak

2445
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,304
If you look at them you find

2446
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:20,608
Misrepresentation

2447
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:22,400
Misrepresentation

2448
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:27,520
The conclusion that it was a false flag which Alex's

2449
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,544
Decided already

2450
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:31,616
When you have to resort to that kind of approach to make your

2451
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,456
At sign

2452
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,736
Yeah

2453
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:45,952
You know

2454
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,536
I have anything on the 15th

2455
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:50,560
Never he got the new

2456
02:12:52,608 --> 02:12:53,120
And everybody's

2457
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:54,656
Tell him that

2458
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:56,960
Said that there was

2459
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:57,984
An explosion

2460
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:00,032
Oh my God

2461
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:01,056
I halfway think

2462
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,360
Coverage that

2463
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:07,968
Infowars

2464
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:13,088
I think it's possible but I also think that he didn't expect they wouldn't catch the people

2465
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:18,208
I don't get any expectation

2466
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:20,256
Stretch it out over a day

2467
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,024
Like this

2468
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:26,912
Lost without a map

2469
02:13:28,448 --> 02:13:29,728
But I think

2470
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,776
A clear sauce bike maybe even a rap

2471
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:33,568
Within 24 hours

2472
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:37,408
Have a secondary

2473
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:39,968
He's the best yeah

2474
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:41,248
An image

2475
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:43,296
They are telling you

2476
02:13:43,552 --> 02:13:44,320
And then

2477
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:45,088
You can twist it to

2478
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,416
Yeah instead he just has to be like

2479
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:49,440
Create

2480
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:51,232
This is a drill

2481
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:52,256
Misrepresentation

2482
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:53,280
This article

2483
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:58,912
Yesterday it was a false flag before completely

2484
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:00,960
Manipulative I edited clip

2485
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,496
Crazy

2486
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,312
Continue with the

2487
02:14:07,104 --> 02:14:08,384
The cement can't be wet

2488
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,688
Isn't somebody else can

2489
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:15,552
Yeah.

2490
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:16,832
Such a

2491
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
Between

2492
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,904
When an event happened

2493
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,440
Actual information

2494
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:24,000
Yeah because the longer it goes

2495
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:30,400
The more

2496
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,168
You need to work

2497
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:33,216
To drive a concrete

2498
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:35,776
I think that's kind of what

2499
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,080
Was like trying to solidify this

2500
02:14:38,336 --> 02:14:40,128
Argument

2501
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,200
Trying

2502
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:43,968
Dryad

2503
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:44,736
Right

2504
02:14:44,992 --> 02:14:45,504
Ticketworks

2505
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Piece of advice

2506
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:51,648
Based on the fictional reality

2507
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:53,952
You should never

2508
02:14:54,208 --> 02:14:54,720
Be involved

2509
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:56,256
At all

2510
02:14:56,512 --> 02:15:01,376
Drill drills

2511
02:15:05,472 --> 02:15:11,616
Drive to Evergreen

2512
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,040
The mall

2513
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,936
Michelle

2514
02:15:39,264 --> 02:15:43,104
I didn't tell talking about the movie that I use of the reference to talk about

2515
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,432
Which is poorly

2516
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:48,224
Slapstick Manor

2517
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:48,992
Shop

2518
02:15:49,504 --> 02:15:52,320
Alex

2519
02:15:52,576 --> 02:15:53,344
Something

2520
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,136
Not good

2521
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:56,416
For his present day

2522
02:15:56,672 --> 02:15:57,184
Lawsuit

2523
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:57,952
In Sandy Hook

2524
02:16:07,168 --> 02:16:09,728
National news

2525
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:15,360
Boston Marathon bombing

2526
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:19,712
There was a drill

2527
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:23,040
And the police know there wasn't a drill

2528
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:27,648
So Alex has ownership of Danville

2529
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,928
Present

2530
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:35,584
He is trying to distance himself

2531
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:40,960
There's a lot of videos of embarrassing people

2532
02:16:41,472 --> 02:16:47,616
He was an employee

2533
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:51,456
You know we kind stuff unfortunately later in the episode

2534
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,960
Are just phenomenal

2535
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:18,336
So you make the clear that he hired that don't

2536
02:17:23,968 --> 02:17:27,808
Valley Stevenson

2537
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:29,088
The short for Alice

2538
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,904
Talking about

2539
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,440
This the situation

2540
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,464
Allicattt

2541
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:35,488
Baton of spin

2542
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,256
And then

2543
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:38,816
Learn a little bit about

2544
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:40,352
What

2545
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:48,032
Drudgereport.com

2546
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:12,608
Starline this morning

2547
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:22,592
He has no reason to assume that people on roofs are bombs daughter

2548
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:24,384
Ostracism conjecture

2549
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:28,480
So that means that

2550
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:41,280
Sprouts

2551
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:50,240
No kidding

2552
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,528
Salute in Tampa.

2553
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:04,832
That is so brave

2554
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,112
Yeah

2555
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:09,696
So f****** Brazen in frustrating that I that like

2556
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:11,232
Weird

2557
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:12,768
We're doing journalism

2558
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,608
Who is

2559
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:17,888
Are not true

2560
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:18,656
And that

2561
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:25,824
So you got a day off

2562
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:27,360
Big holiday

2563
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:30,176
Guess what you have access to buildings rooftop

2564
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:32,480
And you're near the front of the

2565
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,760
Boston Marathon

2566
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:34,528
The start of the boss

2567
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:38,624
Would you and I say go up there have a couple beer

2568
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,392
Beers and watch it

2569
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:41,440
Are you asking

2570
02:19:46,048 --> 02:19:50,912
Also even the idea there were authorities up there

2571
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:55,520
It doesn't it doesn't ring

2572
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:56,544
Necessarily

2573
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:59,616
And a lot of the stuff that like Stevens

2574
02:19:59,872 --> 02:20:03,712
Like if you just listen to it through the prism of there was a dog trainer

2575
02:20:04,224 --> 02:20:07,040
Exercise where would the places that

2576
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:08,832
At the beginning

2577
02:20:09,088 --> 02:20:10,880
Tons of people are

2578
02:20:11,392 --> 02:20:14,720
Mile 12

2579
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:25,728
Real Journal

2580
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:32,384
The first question

2581
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:42,880
Was there going

2582
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:52,864
He was about to have a heart attack

2583
02:20:56,192 --> 02:21:00,800
Of course

2584
02:21:01,056 --> 02:21:03,616
There were no police dogs

2585
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,664
Everything's fine

2586
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:12,320
So I really interesting how excited particularly considering

2587
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,368
In the present day

2588
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:15,904
Dude

2589
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:18,464
And I wanted to like

2590
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:19,744
I went back and I watch

2591
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,632
Deposition video in prep for this episode cuz I remember that comes up in

2592
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,400
The questioning

2593
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:27,424
About that

2594
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:29,472
It's at that day

2595
02:21:29,728 --> 02:21:31,264
I think I noticed something really

2596
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:38,432
The opposing counsel shows Alex a picture of a down day and Alex's first responses to get a huge smile across

2597
02:21:38,688 --> 02:21:39,456
To space in last

2598
02:21:39,968 --> 02:21:42,272
He very quickly realizes that this is a strange

2599
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:44,064
Respond

2600
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,088
Composure really fast

2601
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:49,184
10 seconds where Alex is looking at this picture

2602
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:51,744
There's a

2603
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:54,816
A feeling of wistfulness for the days gone by

2604
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:56,608
Buckets

2605
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,632
Cast descendants

2606
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:59,424
Pro wrestler to go yell at people

2607
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:00,192
Disrupt event

2608
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:06,592
I might be reading more into that that I need to or is appropriate his big laugh and smile quickly received

2609
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:09,664
Realizes

2610
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:10,432
Newtown

2611
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:12,224
I could pretty evocative image

2612
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:22,976
It's particularly in the context of him congratulating but beyond this episode for harassing

2613
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,000
Boston

2614
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:25,536
This image is really

2615
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:27,584
It has a meaning to me

2616
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,888
Whether or not I can prove

2617
02:22:30,144 --> 02:22:31,680
My reading of it is accurate

2618
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:34,240
Well badani was in Boston

2619
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:37,824
Doing all the report

2620
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:43,456
Infowars microphone that use for his reports

2621
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:45,760
Which I can't zoom in on enough

2622
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:48,320
Confirm movie got that the rental War

2623
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:50,624
He's there an official capacity

2624
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:53,440
Not just as some guy who's videos Alex cover

2625
02:22:54,464 --> 02:23:00,096
Big narrative on this episode

2626
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:02,400
Is that the media and the establishment couldn't handle

2627
02:23:03,936 --> 02:23:04,960
Describe it like he was asked

2628
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:06,240
He was literally just

2629
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:12,640
Yelled right

2630
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:19,296
Brought up false Flags

2631
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:20,320
They couldn't handle it

2632
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:21,344
No I think it's

2633
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:29,280
Articles about Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick

2634
02:23:30,048 --> 02:23:32,864
But none of them say the conference ended abruptly after his quest

2635
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:37,984
I told video of it and he asked his rambling is this a false

2636
02:23:38,496 --> 02:23:41,312
And Patrick just replies quote no next question

2637
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,104
The next question that's asked

2638
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:45,152
Isn't the question to Patrick answer

2639
02:23:45,408 --> 02:23:47,712
It's about whether or not they're specifically their self

2640
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,760
After the question is asked

2641
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:53,088
Patrick steps aside and let the police represent

2642
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:54,112
How to feel the question

2643
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,928
If you edit the footage just right though

2644
02:23:57,184 --> 02:24:00,768
It kind of looks like Patrick is leaving the press conference after pedati asks

2645
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:01,536
Question

2646
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:03,072
And that's absolute ball

2647
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:10,496
Also it's kind of surreal because as badanti is prattling on the camera pans across the stage and Elizabeth Warren

2648
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:13,824
I m course he was

2649
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:22,528
The real now that she's running for president

2650
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:26,112
I strongly suspect that this whole thing is about trying to create the perception that

2651
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:28,928
The powers-that-be are afraid of the words false flag.

2652
02:24:29,184 --> 02:24:29,696
Ordered

2653
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:34,048
It's saying them in the president presents is the equivalent telling a judge do bouquet

2654
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:36,864
It's purely an attempt to convince his audience

2655
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:38,400
All these people

2656
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:40,192
Hi and that thing is the truth

2657
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:40,960
But Alex is

2658
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:41,728
Disseminating

2659
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:45,056
Alex wouldn't do stuff like this if you were making a real argue

2660
02:24:45,312 --> 02:24:46,080
Is it

2661
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:48,384
This is manipulation to trick his audience

2662
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:50,688
Accepting a fraudulent version of reality

2663
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:53,760
It's intense

2664
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,808
Cuz that press conference

2665
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,832
Jeopardy question

2666
02:24:57,344 --> 02:25:00,160
You just stepped aside to allow the police commissioner

2667
02:25:00,416 --> 02:25:00,928
Varieties

2668
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,464
The governor ran away

2669
02:25:06,816 --> 02:25:08,096
Couldn't handle

2670
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:11,424
The fuckening

2671
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:17,824
If it'll be closer to real but he does

2672
02:25:18,080 --> 02:25:19,104
Is it makes a fault

2673
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:20,896
False version of it

2674
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:22,688
Africa dandi broadcast

2675
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:26,784
Alex

2676
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,856
Episode I'm going to play something for a little bit

2677
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:33,952
Really drive home is

2678
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:34,976
Being repaired

2679
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:36,256
Cuz it's intentional

2680
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:38,304
Like constantly reinforced

2681
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,840
Sing the same talking points

2682
02:25:41,376 --> 02:25:41,888
Your head

2683
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:44,704
And Family Guy apparently is a big piece of heaven

2684
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:51,360
The family

2685
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,896
First

2686
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,280
About multiple things about this

2687
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:11,584
In order to make

2688
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:14,656
He has to be Peter Griffin has to be a tea party guy

2689
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:22,336
Islamic record

2690
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:24,896
About the character

2691
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:26,432
He has this

2692
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:30,016
F****** crazily edited video in order to prove his

2693
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,552
The bombing was

2694
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:33,088
In the

2695
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:33,856
Before it

2696
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:36,160
Layers of manipulation

2697
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:39,488
It is

2698
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:40,256
Always watching

2699
02:26:40,768 --> 02:26:41,280
How many time

2700
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:42,304
Can be wrong

2701
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,096
You know

2702
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:46,144
Usually people need a lot more words

2703
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:46,912
To be wrong about

2704
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:50,752
Four or five

2705
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:55,616
Send Alex is everything wrong

2706
02:26:55,872 --> 02:26:59,712
Yeah you got it you got to give it up

2707
02:27:02,528 --> 02:27:04,064
Roads of The Oath Keepers on

2708
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:07,648
Alex

2709
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:10,208
Alex talks about humble lions

2710
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:19,936
Enforcement and military organization

2711
02:27:20,192 --> 02:27:22,496
Constitution

2712
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:28,896
To how incredibly evil

2713
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:32,480
Go to no evidence

2714
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:35,040
Also spoiler alert storage never shows up on the

2715
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:45,792
Need I remind Fairfield Cleveland housekeeper who was arrested in April 2010

2716
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:52,448
Charles Dyer

2717
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:56,288
7 year old to be in possession of a f******

2718
02:27:56,800 --> 02:28:02,944
Plenty of evidence of The Oath Keepers RI

2719
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:08,576
These actions of these couple people

2720
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:12,416
Ethan demonstrative of everybody era group

2721
02:28:12,672 --> 02:28:15,232
But there

2722
02:28:16,256 --> 02:28:18,304
Or actually doing something horrible s***

2723
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:19,072
And Alex

2724
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:22,144
Turn the Blind Eye to that

2725
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:24,960
Blown

2726
02:28:29,056 --> 02:28:30,080
To demonize the Oak

2727
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:31,360
Because

2728
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:36,480
I'm sure Alex would say that if

2729
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:42,624
Earlier in the episode he said you know the media is also it's the right-wingers

2730
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:46,464
Tea party libertarian

2731
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,256
You seen all the clips

2732
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:53,888
And he starts laying out a couple of specific

2733
02:28:54,656 --> 02:28:56,960
How well

2734
02:28:57,216 --> 02:28:59,008
He is doing reinforcing

2735
02:28:59,264 --> 02:29:00,032
Premise 2

2736
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:01,056
That the media

2737
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:02,592
He's blaming the right winger

2738
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:03,872
Hays first one

2739
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,152
I regret to inform you

2740
02:29:18,976 --> 02:29:25,120
So the eye is referring to hear in interviews

2741
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:27,424
Riptide security analyst Peter Bergen

2742
02:29:27,936 --> 02:29:28,960
Allow me to read to you

2743
02:29:29,216 --> 02:29:31,520
You from Medi article that Alex has rapper

2744
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:32,544
Quote

2745
02:29:32,800 --> 02:29:38,944
CNN National Security analyst Peter Bergen told host Jake Tapper on Monday that the explosions in Boston

2746
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:40,224
Work of al-Qaeda terrorist

2747
02:29:40,480 --> 02:29:42,784
As much as they could

2748
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:43,552
Extremist

2749
02:29:44,320 --> 02:29:46,112
Right-wing extremist

2750
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:48,928
Either of those sorts of terrorism

2751
02:29:49,184 --> 02:29:50,464
War possibilities

2752
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:52,512
And the situation is still unfolding

2753
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:54,048
Legitimately

2754
02:29:55,328 --> 02:30:01,472
Bergen said that hydrogen peroxide hydrogen peroxide

2755
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:02,240
Behind the attack

2756
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:08,128
However if there was another explosive you that may signal signal right-wing terrorist

2757
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:11,712
The number of failed bombing attempt by Al-Qaeda Burger

2758
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:14,272
Caution other extremist

2759
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:18,624
Right-wing groups trying to attack for instance Martin Luther King

2760
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:20,672
Parade in Oregon in 2010

2761
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:25,536
He said that he thinks that hydrogen peroxide bomb was more likely

2762
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:29,376
Who's here

2763
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:31,680
Are likely more likely Bhai

2764
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:36,544
This article CNN analyst

2765
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:39,104
Based on what he believes

2766
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:44,224
He believes that for it actors are more likely

2767
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:46,528
I don't know

2768
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:48,064
You just had that I

2769
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:55,232
Aren't they both right wing

2770
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:59,840
Exit

2771
02:31:00,096 --> 02:31:06,240
The government has set up would be considered a liberal safe-haven

2772
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:11,360
Different I know they mean different things but for the same thing

2773
02:31:11,616 --> 02:31:14,176
Bayou Vista

2774
02:31:18,016 --> 02:31:23,136
Article that Alex is talking about there which is presenting is the media

2775
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:23,904
The Tea Party

2776
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:29,024
Conclusion that foreign-based Terror groups are more likely behind the attack than right wing

2777
02:31:29,792 --> 02:31:31,328
His Source literally and Coke

2778
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:33,888
Wheatley contradicted Meredith but it doesn't matter

2779
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,168
Bergen in

2780
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:39,520
Stability that Alex's militia weirdo bodies

2781
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:42,848
And any insinuation that right-wing terrorism exist

2782
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:49,248
Is really just a plot to demonize a good guy picture

2783
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:50,272
He's blaming the boss

2784
02:31:50,528 --> 02:31:51,296
Boston bombing

2785
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:53,600
Doing terrorism

2786
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:54,880
Mentioning that right

2787
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:55,648
Doing terrorism

2788
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:58,464
Yeah

2789
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:02,304
Well you think maybe for this one but he's setting you up

2790
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,840
To say that the

2791
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:05,376
That

2792
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:11,776
Yeah it makes me kind of think that there's a possibility that Alex himself believes that right-wing terrorist

2793
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:12,544
Might be behind

2794
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,360
Yeah

2795
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:18,176
Part of his motivation B be pre-emptive damaged

2796
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:24,576
Control if the pot like if they do arrest so I don't know part of it

2797
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:30,976
Center group or militia extremist group

2798
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:32,512
Self-involved

2799
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:33,792
Just went on his own

2800
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:34,560
Like

2801
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:35,584
This

2802
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:37,632
It has a real utility

2803
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:40,704
In terms of preemptive control

2804
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:43,520
He was not involved

2805
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:45,312
I think they're blue

2806
02:32:46,592 --> 02:32:48,384
You get the sense when you start to look at the

2807
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,408
These things you see like

2808
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:52,480
Don't don't say what you say or say

2809
02:32:53,248 --> 02:32:54,272
Why are you doing that

2810
02:32:54,784 --> 02:32:56,320
And I can't really tell you the why

2811
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:57,600
I have some thoughts

2812
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:00,416
Preemptive damage control is a possibility

2813
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:04,512
Financial motivation is certainly a possibility

2814
02:33:05,280 --> 02:33:06,048
Just making

2815
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,072
Himself

2816
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:11,936
Right

2817
02:33:12,192 --> 02:33:13,728
Yeah

2818
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:15,264
There's a number of possibilities

2819
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,800
Without knowing

2820
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:18,592
His own

2821
02:33:18,848 --> 02:33:19,360
Brain

2822
02:33:19,616 --> 02:33:20,896
I couldn't tell you but

2823
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:23,200
It really does feel like there's there's at least

2824
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,480
There's a nonzero

2825
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:26,016
Probably thing

2826
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:28,320
It could be a right

2827
02:33:31,904 --> 02:33:34,720
Thinks it might have been a good idea

2828
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:36,512
Commit a terrorist Act

2829
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:43,168
Well we're going to hear a later a clip of Alex and what kind of terrorist attack a right-winger should commit

2830
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:45,216
Pretty f*****-up

2831
02:33:47,520 --> 02:33:48,544
2

2832
02:33:57,504 --> 02:34:02,624
So this article in the independence just explain your eyes on Twitter

2833
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:06,720
That the bombing was either Islamic or right-wing terrorism

2834
02:34:07,232 --> 02:34:10,048
It doesn't say that it's either it's really just what you might call it

2835
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:16,704
One of the two groups

2836
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:24,128
On the right-wing side they point out that it was the anniversary of the Waco standoff as well as Patriots Day and text

2837
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:26,176
On the Islamic side

2838
02:34:26,432 --> 02:34:30,016
They also point out that it's be 65th anniversary independent Israel

2839
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:31,808
Also hold

2840
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:33,344
The groups all over the

2841
02:34:34,368 --> 02:34:39,744
Honestly a fair reading of this article would lead you to think that they were making the point that Islamic terror is more likely

2842
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:44,608
The part about the possibility of information

2843
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:45,632
It's just a list

2844
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:46,400
The fact

2845
02:34:46,912 --> 02:34:47,936
Like this date means there

2846
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:52,288
Where is the part of the possibility

2847
02:34:52,544 --> 02:34:53,568
Includes an interview with

2848
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:54,592
Professor of security

2849
02:34:54,848 --> 02:34:56,128
Studies from King's College

2850
02:34:56,384 --> 02:34:57,152
And references

2851
02:34:57,408 --> 02:35:00,992
Someone in the Boston Globe

2852
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:03,296
There's a before wait behind the section

2853
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:05,856
Then the right-wing possibility

2854
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:10,720
Alex I sound like a broken record but this article is not blaming

2855
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,744
Extremists at all

2856
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,560
But again to Alex anyone pointing out that right-wing

2857
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:15,328
Extremist groups

2858
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:16,096
Exist

2859
02:35:16,352 --> 02:35:16,864
That

2860
02:35:18,912 --> 02:35:19,936
That's basically all I can say

2861
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,704
Going on here

2862
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,496
So I got another article

2863
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:38,112
So is

2864
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:39,136
Article

2865
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:41,696
This is close to fair is Alex's

2866
02:35:46,048 --> 02:35:50,144
Headlines quotes FBI following up on a variety of leads to Boston

2867
02:35:50,400 --> 02:35:52,192
Embalming

2868
02:35:52,960 --> 02:35:56,800
They reference a counterterrorism expert Richard Barrett

2869
02:35:57,056 --> 02:35:59,616
Who says that quote the incident had hints of a right-wing

2870
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:05,504
It was too early to say who was the blame for the marathon

2871
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:10,112
The article isn't about who did the attack really

2872
02:36:10,624 --> 02:36:11,904
If I had the FBI's getting

2873
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:13,440
Epson working through that

2874
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:15,232
Inasmuch as the article does

2875
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:18,304
Contain an expert

2876
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,840
Suspected could be right wing

2877
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:21,120
Extremist sign

2878
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:24,448
Conspiracy Patriots

2879
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:28,544
On a bunch of s*** he's a lying about in an article in the Irish Examiner

2880
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:29,568
He's more than welcome

2881
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:31,104
Come to but I will say this is

2882
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:32,384
Thin f****** broth

2883
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:34,944
The problem

2884
02:36:35,456 --> 02:36:36,224
I have with it

2885
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:36,992
The most

2886
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:38,016
Is that

2887
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:39,552
Every expert

2888
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:41,600
Everybody every reporter

2889
02:36:42,112 --> 02:36:43,392
That went for a

2890
02:36:43,648 --> 02:36:44,160
Quote

2891
02:36:44,416 --> 02:36:45,184
Every one of them

2892
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:46,720
Is looking for you too

2893
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,792
Every single one of them wants you

2894
02:36:50,048 --> 02:36:51,072
Doesn't matter if you have proof

2895
02:36:51,328 --> 02:36:57,472
Doesn't matter they want that for the article cuz you need it cuz it's

2896
02:36:57,728 --> 02:36:59,520
Article still don't know what's going on

2897
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:01,312
You want an article that says this

2898
02:37:03,104 --> 02:37:07,712
And then whenever they tell you well it could be this or could be that then you say whatever

2899
02:37:08,992 --> 02:37:09,760
Sensitive information

2900
02:37:10,016 --> 02:37:10,528
For too long

2901
02:37:10,784 --> 02:37:12,576
Even professionals will resort to pack

2902
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,112
Caution

2903
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:14,880
Of course

2904
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:15,648
I think it's

2905
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:21,536
I better write the same Story 3 days in a row

2906
02:37:22,816 --> 02:37:25,632
Diminishing returns

2907
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:28,448
So Alex has some more bad news.

2908
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:38,432
Breitbart

2909
02:37:38,944 --> 02:37:40,992
Call

2910
02:37:41,504 --> 02:37:42,016
Breitbart

2911
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,064
All of that is

2912
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:45,088
The same thing

2913
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:47,392
Outfront media article

2914
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:50,976
Where the guy the guy said

2915
02:37:51,232 --> 02:37:53,280
Peroxide

2916
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:55,328
Foreign terror is more likely

2917
02:37:55,584 --> 02:37:57,120
Cz's that three times

2918
02:37:57,632 --> 02:37:58,400
In this list

2919
02:37:58,912 --> 02:37:59,680
Articles

2920
02:37:59,936 --> 02:38:04,288
They all are about the same interview with Jake Tapper on CNN

2921
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,616
Is that we create the illusion of there being tons

2922
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:10,944
Of people saying the Patriots are to blame

2923
02:38:11,456 --> 02:38:11,968
3

2924
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:15,040
Or the same source

2925
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:18,880
The right way

2926
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:21,696
Powerful

2927
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:23,232
They're so good

2928
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,024
Creative

2929
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:30,656
Monolithic Unstoppable force of reinforcement

2930
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:32,704
Just because they can always create that

2931
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:35,776
Said something one time

2932
02:38:36,544 --> 02:38:37,312
Townhall

2933
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:38,080
F******

2934
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:40,384
Fox News

2935
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,176
Breitbart

2936
02:38:42,688 --> 02:38:46,528
Name it they'll all write a story about it and then do all reference how

2937
02:38:46,784 --> 02:38:50,624
Must be a bunch of different things

2938
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:52,160
Brilliant

2939
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:56,000
You got to give it up

2940
02:38:57,792 --> 02:39:00,352
And all of this is to reinforce premise

2941
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:01,632
In the Arctic

2942
02:39:01,888 --> 02:39:03,168
That's all this is

2943
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:06,752
And I know that I probably sound like I'm making too big of a point

2944
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:08,288
Of the construction

2945
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:12,128
But it's how Alex in the immediate minutes

2946
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:15,968
And maybe like half hour afternoon

2947
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:18,016
Almost as if

2948
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:19,808
Next

2949
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:22,624
After he's already done this

2950
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:23,648
Manipulative

2951
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:26,208
Disingenuous work to establish premise

2952
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,768
I promise to

2953
02:39:29,024 --> 02:39:30,048
You trying to like

2954
02:39:30,304 --> 02:39:31,584
Reframe the argument

2955
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:34,400
Now that he had the second promise with him

2956
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:47,968
This is the whole

2957
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:55,904
It's over

2958
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:59,488
Total communist takeover

2959
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,536
So now you see how this works

2960
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:04,864
He's now he feels like he's established that premise

2961
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:08,192
Now it's about

2962
02:40:08,448 --> 02:40:10,496
If they blame the Patriots

2963
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:12,032
Which he feels like he's established

2964
02:40:12,288 --> 02:40:15,104
Is is is there

2965
02:40:15,360 --> 02:40:16,640
If they do that

2966
02:40:18,688 --> 02:40:20,736
We don't we allow it to happen

2967
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:23,552
Then it's all over

2968
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:25,344
So now you shifted thing

2969
02:40:25,600 --> 02:40:29,696
You created the presentation that your first argument was right

2970
02:40:29,952 --> 02:40:30,464
Now we fight

2971
02:40:31,744 --> 02:40:32,512
That's how this works

2972
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:35,840
Yeah

2973
02:40:36,352 --> 02:40:38,912
Well the other thing though is he added another caveat

2974
02:40:39,424 --> 02:40:41,984
The Republicans have to also apologize

2975
02:40:45,312 --> 02:40:45,824
Tubi

2976
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:48,128
Illuminating

2977
02:40:48,384 --> 02:40:48,896
He doesn't

2978
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:54,016
And if that in and of course

2979
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:55,040
The solution that we're going

2980
02:40:55,296 --> 02:41:00,672
Going for a don't apologize to White terrorism ever

2981
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:03,232
He doesn't actually want a civil war

2982
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:05,536
So every time

2983
02:41:05,792 --> 02:41:06,304
He believes

2984
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,328
He's proven an argument

2985
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,376
You going to have to add another little caviar

2986
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:16,032
So people don't actually follow through with the whole Civil War indicate exactly what

2987
02:41:17,568 --> 02:41:20,640
Narrative or this argument from

2988
02:41:20,896 --> 02:41:23,200
But its original form to now including

2989
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:29,600
The right-wing and the GOP not apologizing for the party

2990
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:31,904
I want

2991
02:41:32,160 --> 02:41:36,768
My weirdo extremist friends to be worth

2992
02:41:37,024 --> 02:41:41,376
I want them to be accepted if they are not accepted and they allow this

2993
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:45,472
Demonization that I'm imagining is happening right now

2994
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,496
Zayn

2995
02:41:46,752 --> 02:41:47,520
It's all over

2996
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:48,800
I mean

2997
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:55,456
So similar to the way political

2998
02:41:55,712 --> 02:41:56,480
Don't give an inch

2999
02:41:56,736 --> 02:41:57,504
Don't give an inch

3000
02:41:58,016 --> 02:41:58,528
Not one

3001
02:41:58,784 --> 02:41:59,296
Single

3002
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:02,880
Yeah but I mean

3003
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:04,928
The point being that

3004
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:05,952
No.

3005
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:06,720
Geopier

3006
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:07,744
Not one

3007
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,048
Can come out and say that a white person is

3008
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:10,816
You capable of

3009
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:12,352
Noah

3010
02:42:13,120 --> 02:42:13,632
Not one

3011
02:42:14,400 --> 02:42:15,936
The garden 2013 probably

3012
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:17,984
But not forever

3013
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:24,896
His new

3014
02:42:25,152 --> 02:42:27,712
Mr. Blaming the right-wingers

3015
02:42:28,992 --> 02:42:30,016
Does

3016
02:42:30,272 --> 02:42:30,784
It does track

3017
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:34,368
Can you see that in the way the theater this is sort of shifting

3018
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:35,392
Right

3019
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:38,464
Alex

3020
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:43,072
Warriors response

3021
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:43,840
The Boston Bomber

3022
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:50,752
You wanted critical info

3023
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:52,288
The first bit of that

3024
02:42:58,176 --> 02:42:59,968
Go ahead

3025
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:03,808
Hey Alex, you know I was just sitting here in a buddy of mine

3026
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:10,208
He is a federal job and he told me

3027
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:12,512
He comes over here

3028
02:43:12,768 --> 02:43:15,584
Can we talk about the bombing and what not and then he tells me

3029
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:20,704
Okay there's reasons I can't give you but I feel bad if I didn't give you a warning

3030
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:23,520
Buy as much ammo as you can

3031
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:32,992
Is not he will not give me any critical information as to why

3032
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,296
He just told me

3033
02:43:35,808 --> 02:43:39,136
Why is much animal you can double it I don't care if you have

3034
02:43:39,648 --> 02:43:44,000
2 if you have 21 shotguns or whatever you double that by the end of the month

3035
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:55,264
That's exactly what he said

3036
02:43:56,544 --> 02:43:58,848
Boston he said no they declared a state of emergency

3037
02:43:59,104 --> 02:43:59,872
Different

3038
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:05,504
You know I heard different things and he said all I'm going to tell you at all I'm authorized to tell you

3039
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,296
It's the same thing I've been telling you

3040
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:12,928
Buy more ammo Alex has been saying on his show for a really long

3041
02:44:15,488 --> 02:44:20,608
Say that has a friend who heard from somebody else

3042
02:44:21,120 --> 02:44:22,144
Is repeating third hand

3043
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:24,192
Information and no matter what

3044
02:44:24,448 --> 02:44:24,960
He said

3045
02:44:25,472 --> 02:44:26,752
There's no use

3046
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:27,776
For this being

3047
02:44:28,032 --> 02:44:34,176
On the show there's no use as credible information

3048
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:38,528
Stash weapons

3049
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:41,856
Like when is the message is coming from

3050
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:43,904
This lack of credibility

3051
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,696
All you're doing is scary

3052
02:44:46,208 --> 02:44:47,744
All you're doing is

3053
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,072
Creating a perception that inevitably really soon

3054
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:52,352
With the government

3055
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:56,704
The Pentagon is the

3056
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:03,104
The root against

3057
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,176
Buckingham

3058
02:45:08,224 --> 02:45:08,736
Just be like the price

3059
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:12,832
Gold going down about 7

3060
02:45:13,088 --> 02:45:13,600
Percent

3061
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:15,904
How you figure Emma's going to go up

3062
02:45:18,208 --> 02:45:24,352
I feel like I should be presented slightly differently

3063
02:45:24,608 --> 02:45:26,912
The most generous

3064
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:28,704
OneSource

3065
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:31,776
Another source

3066
02:45:32,032 --> 02:45:32,544
Who I think

3067
02:45:32,800 --> 02:45:33,312
Mike is crazy

3068
02:45:37,408 --> 02:45:39,968
Martial arts

3069
02:45:40,480 --> 02:45:42,784
Sure

3070
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:44,320
Video

3071
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:48,928
I should be really clear this caller identified himself as a Marine

3072
02:45:49,184 --> 02:45:51,488
High-level information

3073
02:45:53,536 --> 02:45:57,888
Eat you presenting this as like actual In-N-Out

3074
02:45:58,400 --> 02:45:59,936
It's not

3075
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,775
2 seconds before the plan

3076
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:10,943
The lady with the black shirt black shorts

3077
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:15,295
She's the last one to cross the finish line before the bomb goes off

3078
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:20,159
First letters are 1979

3079
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:23,743
Important

3080
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:26,559
Every historical.

3081
02:46:28,863 --> 02:46:31,167
Started in January

3082
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:33,215
December

3083
02:46:36,543 --> 02:46:38,591
Prime minister in 79

3084
02:46:39,871 --> 02:46:40,895
Elrond

3085
02:46:42,943 --> 02:46:46,015
The hostages in 1979

3086
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:47,551
Also

3087
02:46:48,063 --> 02:46:51,135
You do have a 1979

3088
02:46:54,207 --> 02:46:54,719
Alright

3089
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:57,279
Excuse me

3090
02:46:59,071 --> 02:47:03,423
Second shift the f***

3091
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:16,223
Well no it's not even tell it to do

3092
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:21,087
Free

3093
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:25,183
Why not. 97-93

3094
02:47:25,439 --> 02:47:29,023
Globalist to finally going to

3095
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:32,607
The flight number of the globalist

3096
02:47:37,727 --> 02:47:43,871
As important as 1970s

3097
02:47:44,127 --> 02:47:48,735
Hostage crisis

3098
02:47:48,991 --> 02:47:55,135
Great look sharp

3099
02:47:55,391 --> 02:48:00,767
Turn on the man in 1979 okay

3100
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:07,167
How about the Happy Meal

3101
02:48:13,823 --> 02:48:19,967
Specifically arriving in Boston

3102
02:48:20,223 --> 02:48:24,063
Joseph

3103
02:48:24,831 --> 02:48:25,599
This show sucks

3104
02:48:26,879 --> 02:48:29,183
This is a stupid fat p****

3105
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:37,119
The commercial inside I want to let you and you thought that meant

3106
02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:41,471
He goes back years how this goes

3107
02:48:41,727 --> 02:48:42,495
When you get the facts

3108
02:48:46,591 --> 02:48:48,383
Is this something you speculate on

3109
02:48:56,063 --> 02:48:59,135
Marine Corps

3110
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:03,999
Domestic

3111
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:05,535
International

3112
02:49:08,351 --> 02:49:09,119
That was

3113
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:23,455
I'll send you email

3114
02:49:24,223 --> 02:49:25,759
But I can't talk more

3115
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:33,183
Good question

3116
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:47,775
Goodway

3117
02:49:48,543 --> 02:49:51,615
Price of oil

3118
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,175
I'm also

3119
02:49:55,455 --> 02:49:56,991
Embassy

3120
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:14,655
Credible

3121
02:50:14,911 --> 02:50:16,703
Edible

3122
02:50:16,959 --> 02:50:19,775
Incredible

3123
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:21,311
Is incredible

3124
02:50:28,991 --> 02:50:31,807
This is actually like a really good Gamble

3125
02:50:32,063 --> 02:50:32,575
If you're someone who's

3126
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:38,207
That is that there will be another event within a couple days because you've got to assume

3127
02:50:38,463 --> 02:50:41,023
It's now the next day

3128
02:50:43,839 --> 02:50:47,935
It was part of a terrorist organization

3129
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:49,983
There'll be another bomb

3130
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:53,055
That could be what you're referring to

3131
02:50:53,311 --> 02:50:56,639
And

3132
02:50:56,895 --> 02:50:57,663
That could

3133
02:50:57,919 --> 02:51:00,223
Pretty f****** scary for a little bit

3134
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:06,623
Nonsense he's talking about it's a really good within a couple days

3135
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:07,647
There'll be another event

3136
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:08,927
Makes total sense

3137
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:10,463
Doesn't prove any kind of

3138
02:51:10,719 --> 02:51:11,487
Intel

3139
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:13,535
Credible

3140
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:17,375
Immediately Alex gets on the phone with Joel skousen

3141
02:51:17,631 --> 02:51:18,655
Who also sounds credible

3142
02:51:18,911 --> 02:51:19,423
Sure

3143
02:51:19,679 --> 02:51:25,823
Skousen comes in and he is like I love that last caller and I don't think he knows what he's talking about

3144
02:51:27,615 --> 02:51:32,735
Information slowdown I've literally wrote that.

3145
02:51:36,575 --> 02:51:40,415
Sounds like that's not the kind of expected years

3146
02:51:40,671 --> 02:51:46,559
Immediately turns

3147
02:51:55,775 --> 02:51:58,335
Insulted him Alex

3148
02:51:58,591 --> 02:51:59,103
Cheese crisps

3149
02:52:02,431 --> 02:52:02,943
Immediately

3150
02:52:03,455 --> 02:52:06,271
Joel skousen

3151
02:52:08,575 --> 02:52:14,207
It has all the Hallmarks of a government operation

3152
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:17,279
First and foremost one is they always pick high-profile then

3153
02:52:17,535 --> 02:52:18,559
Good. Good and out

3154
02:52:18,815 --> 02:52:22,399
Has all the Hallmarks of a things

3155
02:52:22,655 --> 02:52:25,727
Inventing which means I get to tell you what all the Hallmarks of that

3156
02:52:35,455 --> 02:52:36,735
Alyx belt

3157
02:52:37,247 --> 02:52:38,527
Recipes interviews playlist

3158
02:52:39,807 --> 02:52:42,111
False flag doesn't have dementia

3159
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:49,279
Yeah

3160
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:55,679
You could almost make a pretty cogent argument people

3161
02:52:55,935 --> 02:52:56,703
Constantly calling

3162
02:52:56,959 --> 02:52:59,775
False Flags only allows the government

3163
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:10,527
What's up everything is right

3164
02:53:18,463 --> 02:53:19,487
If I was

3165
02:53:19,743 --> 02:53:22,047
Like this would be a great time for Iran

3166
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:23,583
Because

3167
02:53:24,095 --> 02:53:25,887
Everything

3168
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:30,239
What Iran.

3169
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:34,847
I can get away with it because

3170
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:35,615
Is your giant

3171
02:53:37,151 --> 02:53:42,783
So Alex is talking about this being a false flag it is

3172
02:53:43,039 --> 02:53:44,831
I need a false flag

3173
02:53:45,087 --> 02:53:46,367
To be human sacrifices

3174
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:51,743
You have yours

3175
02:53:51,999 --> 02:53:52,767
She was false flag

3176
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:54,559
Alex discipline

3177
02:53:56,863 --> 02:53:57,375
Disgusting

3178
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:31,935
Go fuc yourself

3179
02:54:34,495 --> 02:54:37,311
Like he's not just making up some abstract possibility

3180
02:54:37,823 --> 02:54:38,847
He's imagining

3181
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:42,175
Kid who specifically

3182
02:54:42,431 --> 02:54:42,943
Did die

3183
02:54:43,199 --> 02:54:43,967
In this bombing

3184
02:54:44,479 --> 02:54:45,503
To sit on a duffel bag

3185
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:47,295
In order to kill them

3186
02:54:47,551 --> 02:54:48,063
A publicity

3187
02:54:54,207 --> 02:54:54,719
That's f******

3188
02:54:54,975 --> 02:54:56,511
Insanely disrespectful

3189
02:54:56,767 --> 02:54:58,047
Hi to parents

3190
02:54:58,303 --> 02:54:59,583
To the child too

3191
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:00,351
Everyone

3192
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:01,887
This is disgusting

3193
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:05,471
This is not how

3194
02:55:05,727 --> 02:55:07,775
Like this isn't asking questions

3195
02:55:08,287 --> 02:55:09,311
This isn't journalism

3196
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:11,103
This isn't exposing truth

3197
02:55:11,615 --> 02:55:13,407
This is all just a monsterous person

3198
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:14,943
Hurting people

3199
02:55:15,455 --> 02:55:16,735
It goes no there's no value

3200
02:55:18,271 --> 02:55:20,063
Disgusting

3201
02:55:20,319 --> 02:55:21,087
Concrete

3202
02:55:21,343 --> 02:55:24,159
I guess widest infuriates me more than

3203
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:24,927
I expect

3204
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:27,743
Good to hear s*** like that and that's not the only time

3205
02:55:27,999 --> 02:55:29,023
He uses this flight of fancy

3206
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:30,815
He gets into it a couple more time

3207
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:32,095
I get the garage

3208
02:55:34,399 --> 02:55:36,447
Cast

3209
02:55:38,751 --> 02:55:39,263
Real winner

3210
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:41,055
Doug

3211
02:55:41,311 --> 02:55:43,359
From the report

3212
02:55:43,615 --> 02:55:46,431
Refer to him as heck.

3213
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:53,855
Poorly rated YouTube show

3214
02:55:54,111 --> 02:55:57,439
Or he pretends to know things that often interviews Coach Dave daubenmire

3215
02:55:57,695 --> 02:56:03,071
Doing good

3216
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:04,607
Even after she

3217
02:56:04,863 --> 02:56:08,191
Shut yourself to Twitter's

3218
02:56:08,447 --> 02:56:12,543
Pac-Man on

3219
02:56:13,311 --> 02:56:14,079
He's given for him

3220
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:16,127
Are we getting

3221
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:18,687
Somebody who should also be ashamed of themselves

3222
02:56:18,943 --> 02:56:20,479
Enabling Alex's.

3223
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:24,319
Work

3224
02:56:27,903 --> 02:56:30,207
I'll be on for the full show

3225
02:56:30,463 --> 02:56:30,975
Alex

3226
02:56:31,231 --> 02:56:32,767
The day after the Boston bombing

3227
02:56:33,023 --> 02:56:35,327
Horrible

3228
02:56:35,839 --> 02:56:38,399
Coast to Coast AM on for the entire show

3229
02:56:38,911 --> 02:56:39,679
George Noory

3230
02:56:39,935 --> 02:56:41,983
Everyone who works at Coast to Coast AM

3231
02:56:42,495 --> 02:56:43,263
Apologize

3232
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:46,079
Go f*** yourself and apologize

3233
02:56:46,591 --> 02:56:47,615
You're complicit in there

3234
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:50,431
No I don't think I would either

3235
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:56,831
No

3236
02:56:57,087 --> 02:57:02,719
I saw a ghost then maybe they'll read listen I love you guys I love everything that you do

3237
02:57:02,975 --> 02:57:04,255
Apologize

3238
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:05,535
For this ghost

3239
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:11,423
Write this is one of the reasons and one of the things about like that show is

3240
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:13,727
So fun and fanciful the fall of it

3241
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:16,799
Paranormal talk

3242
02:57:17,055 --> 02:57:17,823
A dangerous

3243
02:57:18,079 --> 02:57:19,359
Place it also occupies

3244
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:20,639
And it's by

3245
02:57:20,895 --> 02:57:24,223
Mainstreaming platforming by helping disseminate

3246
02:57:24,479 --> 02:57:27,807
The messages of someone like Alex Jones the day after

3247
02:57:28,063 --> 02:57:30,879
Rhetoric is

3248
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:32,671
Counterfeit all of it as lotion

3249
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:33,439
Who are prime

3250
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:35,231
Any Main

3251
02:57:40,607 --> 02:57:41,119
His most

3252
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:42,911
Compelling evidence

3253
02:57:43,167 --> 02:57:43,679
2

3254
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:50,335
I want

3255
02:57:51,103 --> 02:57:52,127
Like he does Cox

3256
02:57:52,639 --> 02:57:53,151
Evoke

3257
02:57:54,431 --> 02:57:57,759
Like 277 bombing in Oklahoma City

3258
02:57:58,015 --> 02:57:59,039
Aurora shooting

3259
02:57:59,295 --> 02:58:00,575
What is evidence

3260
02:58:00,831 --> 02:58:03,647
Quotes

3261
02:58:03,903 --> 02:58:05,183
Good things

3262
02:58:07,231 --> 02:58:08,767
The past or it would require

3263
02:58:09,023 --> 02:58:10,559
Way too much time to get into

3264
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:12,351
But I discount a lot of that

3265
02:58:12,607 --> 02:58:13,119
Cuz I think that

3266
02:58:13,375 --> 02:58:15,167
The forest for the trees

3267
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:18,495
But I know that if Alex were listen to this

3268
02:58:18,751 --> 02:58:23,359
You be like bulshit

3269
02:58:23,615 --> 02:58:24,895
Here's my response back

3270
02:58:25,919 --> 02:58:26,431
Go fuc yourself

3271
02:58:26,943 --> 02:58:27,455
Sure

3272
02:58:28,479 --> 02:58:31,039
Even if you worked

3273
02:58:31,295 --> 02:58:32,319
The present Doug Hagmann

3274
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:34,111
His most compelling argument

3275
02:58:34,367 --> 02:58:34,879
Expected to be

3276
02:58:35,135 --> 02:58:36,415
His most compelling

3277
02:58:37,183 --> 02:58:37,951
And this is what you got

3278
02:58:38,719 --> 02:58:44,095
Director

3279
02:58:45,375 --> 02:58:49,215
Kakashi argues with his dad

3280
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:53,567
Marathon

3281
02:59:04,831 --> 02:59:07,391
Coming up to the Finish Line right before all this happen

3282
02:59:07,903 --> 02:59:09,695
What's his most devastating evidence is

3283
02:59:09,951 --> 02:59:12,255
Hearsay about Rob Deuce brother-in-law that he's

3284
02:59:12,511 --> 02:59:13,023
Clearly

3285
02:59:13,535 --> 02:59:17,119
Start of writing his own little embellishments on it

3286
02:59:18,399 --> 02:59:24,031
Every confirmed in any way that the brother said that he wasn't experiencing any symptoms

3287
02:59:24,287 --> 02:59:24,799
These nuts

3288
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:29,151
He's taken down

3289
02:59:29,663 --> 02:59:35,807
Such horseshit nothing you have nothing

3290
02:59:36,063 --> 02:59:37,855
On the show

3291
02:59:39,647 --> 02:59:40,927
Steve doesn't help

3292
02:59:41,183 --> 02:59:45,279
No cuz you just get your whatever the f*** you want

3293
02:59:45,791 --> 02:59:51,935
You're devastated and I assume that have robbed you had been able to get ahold of his brother and there were more details

3294
02:59:52,191 --> 02:59:57,823
Call Allison.

3295
02:59:58,079 --> 03:00:02,431
Alex would have even more details

3296
03:00:03,711 --> 03:00:04,479
Just now like

3297
03:00:04,991 --> 03:00:09,087
Did I you know he wasn't always a horse

3298
03:00:10,623 --> 03:00:11,135
To be so many

3299
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:12,671
So many times where I robbed

3300
03:00:12,927 --> 03:00:13,439
Brother-in-law

3301
03:00:15,487 --> 03:00:16,255
Evil look

3302
03:00:16,511 --> 03:00:17,023
I get it

3303
03:00:18,559 --> 03:00:19,071
Keep my name

3304
03:00:20,351 --> 03:00:20,863
I don't want

3305
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:22,143
Any part of this

3306
03:00:22,911 --> 03:00:23,679
Like that

3307
03:00:23,935 --> 03:00:24,703
That would suck

3308
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:27,263
So bad

3309
03:00:27,519 --> 03:00:28,287
Sisters

3310
03:00:28,799 --> 03:00:31,615
Husband is

3311
03:00:31,871 --> 03:00:37,247
Also brings up that used to be in a band with the guy who flew his plane

3312
03:00:37,759 --> 03:00:43,903
To the IRS building in Austin

3313
03:00:46,207 --> 03:00:47,743
True

3314
03:00:48,767 --> 03:00:53,375
So Doug heckmann said something that I think

3315
03:00:53,631 --> 03:00:54,143
From this episode

3316
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:56,191
I think it's this mentality

3317
03:00:56,447 --> 03:00:56,959
Doug Hagmann

3318
03:00:57,471 --> 03:00:57,983
Expressing

3319
03:00:58,239 --> 03:00:58,751
I think it's

3320
03:00:59,775 --> 03:01:00,543
Bulshit

3321
03:01:01,567 --> 03:01:04,127
You know it with all of the accusation

3322
03:01:04,383 --> 03:01:07,711
I'm saying well you can't really say this is my fault

3323
03:01:08,223 --> 03:01:10,015
Flag attack or you can't really

3324
03:01:10,271 --> 03:01:11,807
Concluded

3325
03:01:12,063 --> 03:01:13,855
While that might be a true statement

3326
03:01:14,367 --> 03:01:14,879
Today

3327
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:15,647
What

3328
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:17,695
You know our Are We Wrong

3329
03:01:19,743 --> 03:01:22,047
Or little gun-shy about

3330
03:01:22,303 --> 03:01:24,863
About what we're seeing here with respect to to this incident

3331
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:31,519
I wish I had like a air horn to yourself

3332
03:01:31,775 --> 03:01:33,823
Can loser cop-out I've ever heard in my life

3333
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:34,847
What am I

3334
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:41,503
Is shark

3335
03:01:41,759 --> 03:01:44,831
We built up a world Youth Day

3336
03:01:45,087 --> 03:01:48,927
That's all.

3337
03:01:49,439 --> 03:01:50,719
Disqualified

3338
03:01:51,999 --> 03:01:55,839
Yeah you know why

3339
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:58,911
It did because this is presented as a new show

3340
03:01:59,167 --> 03:02:03,007
High-level sources

3341
03:02:03,519 --> 03:02:06,079
These two are sitting on this show different

3342
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:11,199
Like

3343
03:02:11,455 --> 03:02:12,735
It's just one man's opinion

3344
03:02:12,991 --> 03:02:14,527
We do not present it that way

3345
03:02:14,783 --> 03:02:18,623
When they spread their s*** they have an expectation that Their audience

3346
03:02:18,879 --> 03:02:21,951
Responsibility

3347
03:02:22,207 --> 03:02:27,839
Was the government of the government

3348
03:02:29,887 --> 03:02:31,679
Like when you're someone like me

3349
03:02:31,935 --> 03:02:33,471
And you listen to hours and hours of

3350
03:02:33,727 --> 03:02:37,055
There's a lot of really maddening things to get Express

3351
03:02:37,311 --> 03:02:39,359
And this is right up there in the upper echelon

3352
03:02:40,383 --> 03:02:41,151
Doug Hagmann

3353
03:02:41,407 --> 03:02:44,735
Runs a website called Northeast intelligence Network

3354
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:47,807
It's not the whisper Network

3355
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:49,599
It's an intelligence Network

3356
03:02:49,855 --> 03:02:52,671
Reflecting the b******* notion that he's working off intelligence

3357
03:02:53,183 --> 03:02:54,975
I'll probably overly pissed off about this

3358
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:55,743
But it's just such a

3359
03:02:55,999 --> 03:03:00,351
Clear moment

3360
03:03:02,399 --> 03:03:02,911
Yes

3361
03:03:03,167 --> 03:03:06,495
These people are right to criticize us for saying that it's a false flag

3362
03:03:06,751 --> 03:03:07,775
We do not know that

3363
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:15,967
That were ejected and see how many people

3364
03:03:16,991 --> 03:03:17,759
The other direction

3365
03:03:19,551 --> 03:03:20,831
They're they're criticizing

3366
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:24,671
The right to be

3367
03:03:25,439 --> 03:03:26,207
Because we

3368
03:03:26,463 --> 03:03:28,511
Look you may be right that were wrong

3369
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:30,047
But you shouldn't say that we were

3370
03:03:30,303 --> 03:03:31,327
Thinking bad about

3371
03:03:31,583 --> 03:03:36,191
According to the

3372
03:03:36,447 --> 03:03:39,007
That don't make any sense I can't because it hurts our feelings

3373
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:51,295
So I think he's got his comeuppance already

3374
03:03:52,319 --> 03:03:56,415
I told you earlier that Alex would say what sort of Terror

3375
03:03:56,671 --> 03:03:58,463
Attack

3376
03:03:58,719 --> 03:03:59,999
Tea Party

3377
03:04:00,511 --> 03:04:01,535
And listen to this f****** clip

3378
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:02,815
And consider

3379
03:04:03,583 --> 03:04:05,119
This is the day after the boss

3380
03:04:06,143 --> 03:04:07,423
Listen to the way Alex is

3381
03:04:08,959 --> 03:04:15,103
There's no real

3382
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:21,503
What the f***

3383
03:04:21,759 --> 03:04:22,783
Building

3384
03:04:23,551 --> 03:04:25,343
Oh boy

3385
03:04:25,599 --> 03:04:31,743
I think I think a very ungenerous but not totally unreasonable reading

3386
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:33,023
Is

3387
03:04:33,279 --> 03:04:39,423
I wish they are we going

3388
03:04:40,703 --> 03:04:42,495
Crafts Direct

3389
03:04:42,751 --> 03:04:48,895
Your listeners to go put a bomb at the US

3390
03:04:49,151 --> 03:04:49,919
Love you at your ad

3391
03:04:50,175 --> 03:04:56,319
True right-winger for whether or not

3392
03:04:56,575 --> 03:04:57,087
You're a true right

3393
03:04:58,111 --> 03:04:58,623
Jesus

3394
03:05:01,439 --> 03:05:02,207
I think that bad

3395
03:05:02,975 --> 03:05:07,071
We don't often see eye-to-eye

3396
03:05:07,327 --> 03:05:09,887
I'm with you on that

3397
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:15,775
High-level sources

3398
03:05:16,031 --> 03:05:17,055
And tells the people

3399
03:05:18,591 --> 03:05:20,383
Again based on my source I think it most

3400
03:05:20,639 --> 03:05:22,943
Important

3401
03:05:23,711 --> 03:05:25,503
Today for today's broadcast is

3402
03:05:26,015 --> 03:05:27,039
Expectmore

3403
03:05:27,551 --> 03:05:29,855
And look at these as diverse

3404
03:05:30,623 --> 03:05:32,671
And that's that's pretty frightening

3405
03:05:32,927 --> 03:05:33,439
As far as I'm

3406
03:05:41,887 --> 03:05:44,959
What should you be looking out for if that's diverting you from what

3407
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:51,615
Why are you talking to you I get to pretend

3408
03:05:51,871 --> 03:05:52,639
High-level source

3409
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:55,455
Game for everyone to play cuz there's

3410
03:06:00,831 --> 03:06:06,975
Like seriously crazy

3411
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:10,047
Student clinic

3412
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:12,095
Stop doing this to people

3413
03:06:12,607 --> 03:06:13,631
Hurting people

3414
03:06:13,887 --> 03:06:15,423
No s*** you're killing people

3415
03:06:15,679 --> 03:06:19,263
Alex

3416
03:06:19,775 --> 03:06:20,799
But if they're terrorists

3417
03:06:21,311 --> 03:06:21,823
They have to be mad

3418
03:06:32,063 --> 03:06:34,623
It's almost as if the facts don't matter

3419
03:06:34,879 --> 03:06:36,671
It's almost like the facts don't matter

3420
03:06:40,767 --> 03:06:45,375
Maybe the terrorists came from Mexico and they covered up

3421
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:52,543
Exactly like the facts don't matter based on

3422
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:54,335
Everything we've heard in the last

3423
03:06:54,591 --> 03:06:58,175
About 3 hours of the shout

3424
03:06:58,943 --> 03:07:03,295
I told you earlier that skousen said that Alex's caller sounds like someone make

3425
03:07:03,551 --> 03:07:05,599
Wingstop in Alice

3426
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:13,791
Idea that there's misinformation

3427
03:07:14,047 --> 03:07:15,071
Being spread online

3428
03:07:15,583 --> 03:07:17,119
Because that's the only place

3429
03:07:17,375 --> 03:07:18,399
That a lot of

3430
03:07:18,911 --> 03:07:21,983
Stuff is getting serious

3431
03:07:22,495 --> 03:07:23,263
So I think

3432
03:07:23,775 --> 03:07:24,543
If I had to guess

3433
03:07:25,055 --> 03:07:26,847
I would say that this is an attempt for Alex

3434
03:07:27,103 --> 03:07:27,615
The claim

3435
03:07:27,871 --> 03:07:28,895
Authority in that space

3436
03:07:29,407 --> 03:07:32,479
By critiquing some of the theories that he hasn't

3437
03:07:32,991 --> 03:07:36,063
He will be able to elevate his own theories above the muck

3438
03:07:36,575 --> 03:07:42,207
I think that there's some

3439
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:43,487
But either way

3440
03:07:43,743 --> 03:07:45,279
You choose to post on Reddit

3441
03:07:45,535 --> 03:07:47,071
But he's decided as a troll Pub

3442
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:49,631
Is amazed

3443
03:07:52,703 --> 03:07:55,775
Addressing the information I never seen

3444
03:08:02,175 --> 03:08:03,199
I've never seen

3445
03:08:10,111 --> 03:08:11,903
And now he gets to reading the article

3446
03:08:12,415 --> 03:08:13,695
And listen to what

3447
03:08:13,951 --> 03:08:16,255
Happens to him as he reads this up

3448
03:08:19,071 --> 03:08:21,375
20

3449
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:50,303
He's fat he starts agreeing

3450
03:08:50,559 --> 03:08:55,935
He starts with the troll post

3451
03:08:56,191 --> 03:09:02,335
Is already indicating of like this is a sort of

3452
03:09:04,895 --> 03:09:06,175
It's insane

3453
03:09:09,759 --> 03:09:10,271
You can't

3454
03:09:10,783 --> 03:09:11,551
It parody

3455
03:09:11,807 --> 03:09:15,135
It's him looking into a f****** beer and being like look at this

3456
03:09:19,743 --> 03:09:20,255
Jesus

3457
03:09:20,511 --> 03:09:21,279
So Alex

3458
03:09:21,535 --> 03:09:23,839
At the end this is the last clip of Alec

3459
03:09:25,375 --> 03:09:28,191
If you leave a half hour early. Three and a half hours

3460
03:09:31,519 --> 03:09:34,591
McAdoo take over for the next hours

3461
03:09:35,359 --> 03:09:35,871
Show

3462
03:09:36,127 --> 03:09:39,455
But this last clip is Alex

3463
03:09:39,711 --> 03:09:42,015
Indicating that he doesn't like that

3464
03:09:42,527 --> 03:09:46,623
People are saying that the right-wing or Islamic terrorism

3465
03:09:46,879 --> 03:09:51,231
Those are brought up as possible

3466
03:09:51,999 --> 03:09:54,047
But but other people also like

3467
03:09:54,303 --> 03:09:55,839
There have been a lot of indicate like

3468
03:09:56,095 --> 03:10:02,239
Immediately after the bombing of Saudi national was reported to have been arrested

3469
03:10:02,495 --> 03:10:06,591
Like he was cleared he wasn't at all

3470
03:10:06,847 --> 03:10:10,687
Being covered

3471
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:12,991
Alex

3472
03:10:13,247 --> 03:10:15,295
Clearly chosen to only hear

3473
03:10:15,551 --> 03:10:21,183
From sources that are saying it's the right-wing or right-wing extremists or Islamic terrorists

3474
03:10:21,695 --> 03:10:23,231
He is ignoring

3475
03:10:23,487 --> 03:10:24,511
Call other

3476
03:10:27,071 --> 03:10:28,351
You kind of pissed off

3477
03:10:30,655 --> 03:10:31,167
Intertops

3478
03:10:32,191 --> 03:10:38,335
And and they're already

3479
03:10:48,831 --> 03:10:50,111
Well I mean

3480
03:10:52,671 --> 03:10:54,463
He's talking about the literal

3481
03:10:54,719 --> 03:10:55,487
Which email

3482
03:10:58,303 --> 03:10:59,071
A possible that there's an

3483
03:10:59,327 --> 03:10:59,839
Eco-terrorists

3484
03:11:09,823 --> 03:11:10,847
She was always property

3485
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:17,247
There's some copycat attacks groups that they'd kill her people but the right way

3486
03:11:17,503 --> 03:11:18,527
You know they're pretty consistent

3487
03:11:19,039 --> 03:11:21,599
And going ahead blaming the weathermen for those

3488
03:11:22,111 --> 03:11:23,135
Leaving that aside

3489
03:11:23,391 --> 03:11:27,231
Even if the Boston bombing was anywhere near the mo of the weathermen

3490
03:11:27,487 --> 03:11:30,815
At the time of the group for a full 30s

3491
03:11:33,631 --> 03:11:35,167
3 years old

3492
03:11:35,423 --> 03:11:37,727
How old is Bill Ayers

3493
03:11:37,983 --> 03:11:38,751
2013

3494
03:11:39,007 --> 03:11:39,775
Early

3495
03:11:41,311 --> 03:11:43,871
This would be like if there was a bombing today

3496
03:11:44,383 --> 03:11:46,687
And you wonder why the media isn't blaming the police

3497
03:11:47,455 --> 03:11:48,223
And I don't

3498
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:49,759
I mean the band The Police

3499
03:11:50,015 --> 03:11:52,831
We broke up in 1984

3500
03:11:55,135 --> 03:11:56,159
And

3501
03:11:56,671 --> 03:12:01,279
There's nothing like a good hi-hats

3502
03:12:01,535 --> 03:12:02,303
Sure

3503
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:03,839
Crazy

3504
03:12:07,423 --> 03:12:07,935
That's sad

3505
03:12:14,079 --> 03:12:15,871
We are all like old dogs like

3506
03:12:16,127 --> 03:12:20,735
Tim Allen and last ride or whatever

3507
03:12:21,503 --> 03:12:22,015
Ridiculous

3508
03:12:26,623 --> 03:12:29,695
Because I want to demonstrate to you that every wanted info

3509
03:12:31,231 --> 03:12:31,743
Everyone

3510
03:12:34,047 --> 03:12:35,839
If you are there and you're witnessing

3511
03:12:36,095 --> 03:12:37,631
This clear misrepresentation

3512
03:12:37,887 --> 03:12:38,399
What's going on

3513
03:12:38,655 --> 03:12:40,447
Aldi's

3514
03:12:40,703 --> 03:12:43,263
And you're allowing this to happen you don't walk out

3515
03:12:43,775 --> 03:12:44,287
I don't give a fuk

3516
03:12:46,335 --> 03:12:47,615
No they were just following orders

3517
03:12:47,871 --> 03:12:54,015
That difference is always historically been and I do not let Lee Ann McAdoo

3518
03:12:54,271 --> 03:12:54,783
Off the hook

3519
03:12:55,295 --> 03:12:55,807
That much

3520
03:12:56,319 --> 03:13:01,695
But she just started eclipse

3521
03:13:02,207 --> 03:13:03,999
Looking for enough maybe she comes in like

3522
03:13:04,255 --> 03:13:05,279
Half an hour later

3523
03:13:05,791 --> 03:13:07,583
Butcher

3524
03:13:08,095 --> 03:13:09,119
Are very clearly

3525
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:09,887
Conspirators

3526
03:13:10,143 --> 03:13:11,423
They are on board with this

3527
03:13:11,935 --> 03:13:13,727
They're spreading the same s*** as Alex

3528
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:15,263
They are just as guilty

3529
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:18,335
Here's a clip of Jakari Jackson talking about

3530
03:13:21,151 --> 03:13:24,991
Episode of Family Guy

3531
03:13:38,047 --> 03:13:38,815
Cowboys

3532
03:13:44,703 --> 03:13:50,079
Is a participant in the Boston Marathon

3533
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:53,151
In the marathon

3534
03:13:55,711 --> 03:13:57,503
Boston Marathon winner

3535
03:13:58,015 --> 03:13:59,295
How did you do it

3536
03:14:02,623 --> 03:14:03,391
Tampons Boston

3537
03:14:03,903 --> 03:14:04,671
Dial Grand

3538
03:14:10,815 --> 03:14:16,959
Well that heavily edited completely change all of the context

3539
03:14:17,727 --> 03:14:19,519
Jakari Jackson

3540
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:21,567
He presents himself as a newsman

3541
03:14:21,823 --> 03:14:25,151
It didn't even consult the episode 20 minutes

3542
03:14:25,407 --> 03:14:27,199
To watch the episode itself

3543
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:30,527
To see if you're spreading misinformation

3544
03:14:30,783 --> 03:14:33,599
Is Takeoff

3545
03:14:33,855 --> 03:14:35,135
And repeat it as gospel

3546
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:38,463
You have every reason to either know that your s***

3547
03:14:38,719 --> 03:14:39,487
Hate your job

3548
03:14:39,743 --> 03:14:42,303
You're lying intentionally to push

3549
03:14:42,559 --> 03:14:43,071
A narrative

3550
03:14:43,327 --> 03:14:43,839
And go

3551
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:44,607
Fuc yourself

3552
03:14:45,119 --> 03:14:48,191
Well I would like to add a third

3553
03:14:49,471 --> 03:14:50,239
What's the weather

3554
03:14:51,775 --> 03:14:52,543
Interested

3555
03:14:53,567 --> 03:14:55,615
So your night time again there

3556
03:14:55,871 --> 03:14:57,919
Here's where he gets his go fuc yourself

3557
03:14:58,175 --> 03:14:58,687
The day

3558
03:14:58,943 --> 03:15:02,527
They talked about Urban Cowboy he gets aligned and I

3559
03:15:02,783 --> 03:15:03,807
Episode with

3560
03:15:04,063 --> 03:15:05,087
Islamic terrorist

3561
03:15:06,623 --> 03:15:09,183
Okay so that

3562
03:15:11,999 --> 03:15:16,607
Did you want because

3563
03:15:17,631 --> 03:15:19,679
Their talking points

3564
03:15:20,191 --> 03:15:24,799
It's very clear because one of them is a guy

3565
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:26,335
So you see that

3566
03:15:26,591 --> 03:15:29,151
To see the Repertory see these people who are

3567
03:15:29,407 --> 03:15:31,199
They are doing

3568
03:15:31,711 --> 03:15:32,735
They're doing

3569
03:15:34,015 --> 03:15:36,319
The day after a national trauma

3570
03:15:36,831 --> 03:15:38,111
You see these guys

3571
03:15:38,367 --> 03:15:39,647
And they're f****** in line

3572
03:15:40,159 --> 03:15:40,671
And spreading

3573
03:15:41,183 --> 03:15:42,463
Dangerous propaganda

3574
03:15:43,231 --> 03:15:45,535
And for that there is no coming back

3575
03:15:45,791 --> 03:15:47,583
Cross the Rubicon

3576
03:15:47,839 --> 03:15:49,119
As it were

3577
03:15:54,495 --> 03:15:56,031
Quickly as we did Even though this is

3578
03:15:56,287 --> 03:15:56,799
Long

3579
03:15:57,055 --> 03:16:03,199
Watch now?

3580
03:16:03,455 --> 03:16:05,247
Three and a half hours

3581
03:16:05,759 --> 03:16:11,903
Yeah it's up but it's dense there's a lot of material and you see what Alex is doing when you take a second

3582
03:16:12,927 --> 03:16:13,439
Deconstructed

3583
03:16:13,695 --> 03:16:14,207
Can you take a second

3584
03:16:14,463 --> 03:16:14,975
MC like

3585
03:16:15,231 --> 03:16:18,303
Okay this works.

3586
03:16:18,559 --> 03:16:20,095
He misrepresenting that at Allstate Center

3587
03:16:20,351 --> 03:16:21,119
To the same pattern

3588
03:16:22,911 --> 03:16:23,935
And then once established

3589
03:16:24,191 --> 03:16:24,959
Bjarki

3590
03:16:25,727 --> 03:16:26,239
Tubi

3591
03:16:27,007 --> 03:16:28,287
If the GOP

3592
03:16:28,799 --> 03:16:30,847
I turned it back on my extremist friend

3593
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:32,639
Civil War

3594
03:16:35,711 --> 03:16:39,039
The political radicalization in

3595
03:16:39,295 --> 03:16:39,807
Stream

3596
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:44,159
The bottom

3597
03:16:44,415 --> 03:16:45,695
Yeah of his agenda

3598
03:16:45,951 --> 03:16:46,463
Enough motivation

3599
03:16:47,487 --> 03:16:49,791
Beyond Richard Belzer go f*** himself

3600
03:16:55,167 --> 03:16:55,935
Jhacari

3601
03:16:56,191 --> 03:16:56,959
Sure night

3602
03:16:57,215 --> 03:16:58,495
Everyone Infowars

3603
03:16:59,263 --> 03:17:00,543
I mean to allow this s***

3604
03:17:01,055 --> 03:17:02,079
Don't

3605
03:17:02,335 --> 03:17:02,847
Wake up

3606
03:17:05,407 --> 03:17:06,943
Can you imagine being a new high

3607
03:17:08,735 --> 03:17:09,247
The day like that

3608
03:17:09,503 --> 03:17:10,527
Like how long has she been

3609
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:14,623
Like a couple days prior

3610
03:17:15,135 --> 03:17:17,695
It seems like she's new

3611
03:17:17,951 --> 03:17:19,231
If that's your f******

3612
03:17:21,023 --> 03:17:21,535
It's like

3613
03:17:23,071 --> 03:17:26,399
I don't know what I'm going to do

3614
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:34,335
There's no way that this is worth

3615
03:17:34,591 --> 03:17:36,127
0 weather

3616
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:38,687
Remember episodes

3617
03:17:38,943 --> 03:17:39,711
Afterlife

3618
03:17:39,967 --> 03:17:40,735
Traumatic events

3619
03:17:41,247 --> 03:17:46,367
What day would do is take calls from people to talk about their feelings about

3620
03:17:46,623 --> 03:17:48,159
You know what people have experienced

3621
03:17:48,415 --> 03:17:50,207
Yeah that's because there's a

3622
03:17:50,463 --> 03:17:51,743
There's a natural health

3623
03:17:51,999 --> 03:17:55,071
People heal heavy breathing process

3624
03:17:57,887 --> 03:17:58,655
Kind of I think

3625
03:17:59,167 --> 03:18:00,703
Well I have some other issues with

3626
03:18:01,215 --> 03:18:02,751
Certainly Adam carolla's late-career

3627
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:05,311
And maybe in hindsight some of that

3628
03:18:05,567 --> 03:18:06,847
Earlier party

3629
03:18:07,103 --> 03:18:09,151
I think that's such a good model

3630
03:18:09,407 --> 03:18:10,175
For how to be

3631
03:18:10,431 --> 03:18:11,455
Africa

3632
03:18:13,247 --> 03:18:14,783
Stewards of the public Airwaves

3633
03:18:16,063 --> 03:18:17,855
You know that you have a responsibility

3634
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:18,623
When you have

3635
03:18:19,391 --> 03:18:25,023
An audience and your daily live radio show you can't take the day off

3636
03:18:25,279 --> 03:18:26,815
Come in and do something

3637
03:18:27,327 --> 03:18:29,375
You have to care and nurture

3638
03:18:29,887 --> 03:18:30,399
People

3639
03:18:30,655 --> 03:18:31,679
Because if you don't

3640
03:18:32,191 --> 03:18:33,471
You're disrupting a prop

3641
03:18:34,239 --> 03:18:36,799
At Alex's deeply disrupting the process here

3642
03:18:37,055 --> 03:18:40,383
And the only motivations can be nefariously political

3643
03:18:40,639 --> 03:18:42,687
Or nefariously personal

3644
03:18:42,943 --> 03:18:44,223
And I don't

3645
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:45,503
Respect either of those

3646
03:18:46,015 --> 03:18:49,087
I honestly think like a bunch of episodes

3647
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:50,111
Re-upping

3648
03:18:52,671 --> 03:18:54,975
I'm falling to a low of like these

3649
03:18:55,743 --> 03:18:57,535
These episodes of come up with

3650
03:18:57,791 --> 03:19:03,679
Trying to get people to move to West Virginia convention 05

3651
03:19:03,935 --> 03:19:07,519
Greenland

3652
03:19:08,031 --> 03:19:10,591
Lose track of like the villain aspect of it

3653
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:13,407
Episode episode

3654
03:19:13,919 --> 03:19:17,503
This that there's a number of them along the way but they really

3655
03:19:17,759 --> 03:19:19,039
Reinforce to me like

3656
03:19:19,295 --> 03:19:20,319
There's intent

3657
03:19:21,087 --> 03:19:22,367
There is absolute

3658
03:19:22,623 --> 03:19:23,391
Queer

3659
03:19:24,671 --> 03:19:25,439
It's not an accident

3660
03:19:25,695 --> 03:19:27,231
He's not stupid what he's doing

3661
03:19:27,487 --> 03:19:29,279
Some of the stuff being done

3662
03:19:31,839 --> 03:19:32,863
But he's not just

3663
03:19:33,119 --> 03:19:35,679
Mr. Magoo fumbling around propaganda

3664
03:19:36,191 --> 03:19:37,471
This is direct

3665
03:19:39,263 --> 03:19:41,311
NYC

3666
03:19:41,567 --> 03:19:42,079
Do what I mean

3667
03:19:42,335 --> 03:19:42,847
There's a direct

3668
03:19:43,359 --> 03:19:44,639
He is he's a cop

3669
03:19:45,407 --> 03:19:45,919
Actor

3670
03:19:46,943 --> 03:19:47,711
And if

3671
03:19:47,967 --> 03:19:48,479
Sucks

3672
03:19:50,015 --> 03:19:50,527
It's not like a

3673
03:19:50,783 --> 03:19:51,807
Head of HR

3674
03:19:52,063 --> 03:19:53,343
Story is this

3675
03:19:53,855 --> 03:19:54,367
He's the guy who

3676
03:19:59,487 --> 03:19:59,999
And

3677
03:20:01,535 --> 03:20:02,303
I hate this already

3678
03:20:03,071 --> 03:20:04,095
And I really dread

3679
03:20:05,631 --> 03:20:06,399
The next like

3680
03:20:07,423 --> 03:20:09,471
Please show because this doesn't resolve

3681
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:10,751
Well

3682
03:20:12,799 --> 03:20:14,847
A lot of stuff does

3683
03:20:15,103 --> 03:20:15,871
Does

3684
03:20:16,127 --> 03:20:17,151
Towards

3685
03:20:18,175 --> 03:20:21,247
Yep now I'm having to have a man

3686
03:20:22,015 --> 03:20:22,783
For the suspects

3687
03:20:25,087 --> 03:20:28,671
Is the sort of thing that it's Alex's perceptions of martial law

3688
03:20:29,183 --> 03:20:30,463
But at the same time

3689
03:20:30,975 --> 03:20:32,255
What else are you going to do

3690
03:20:33,023 --> 03:20:34,047
Like you did

3691
03:20:34,303 --> 03:20:35,839
The police are put into

3692
03:20:36,095 --> 03:20:39,935
An impossible situation but the Optics of it work really well for Alex

3693
03:20:40,959 --> 03:20:45,055
I just don't I don't look forward to it but we will get through it as

3694
03:20:45,567 --> 03:20:46,079
Pruitt

3695
03:20:46,591 --> 03:20:47,615

3696
03:20:47,871 --> 03:20:49,151

03:21:22,175 --> 03:21:25,759
Alex
