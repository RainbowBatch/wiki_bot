00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:20,736
Jones did you come prepared with the question this time

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
Wondering where we are at

4
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
Insurance

5
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
About the Carolina Reaper puree

6
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,656
My parents

7
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
In a little Christmas package they sent over the

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
Yellowbird sauces from

9
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
Austin company

10
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,872
Most of them are trash

11
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:55,808
It's too hot but it's pretty bad

12
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,112
Joseph Arthur

13
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
I think we could have gotten

14
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,840
Honestly I think

15
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
Adventurism

16
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,032
Beginning of April

17
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,360
And getting a new apartment one of the things I'm going to focus on there

18
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Is building a little garden

19
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Inside my apartment

20
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
Grow some peppers

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,016
Make my own

22
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
Kind of hot sauce

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
See if I can figure that out

24
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:38,816
I added stuff like like grow from

25
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,144
Explorer that and then also

26
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
I don't know what that is

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
August

28
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,800
People outside of Chicago

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,688
How do you describe it sort of a relishing kind of thing

30
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Is a condiment like oil

31
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
Celery carrots cauliflower

32
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,952
Nearest exit

33
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
It's too busy

34
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
But you could narrow it down to like two

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
A really good

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,824
Explore those things once I get into a new apartment

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
That'll be fun

38
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,744

In the group

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
Show sketch

43
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:03,552
About car wash I did I did

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,392
And I want to be very clear about that because I

45
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
Constantly question myself about like

46
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,000
Am I remembering that sketch

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,584
February

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
I have to second-guess my memories

49
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,776
Categorical certainty absolutely

50
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:30,176
Not just a misremembering of that mystery show sketch it really really terrifies me

51
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,832
Remember the feeling of being in that car wash

52
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:40,928
You are adult the writers from Missouri

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,304
He wasn't from Missouri I wasn't really sure that sketch

54
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
That they've done that before

55
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,400
I worked at that car wash

56
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm pretty sure that was in the 90s

57
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,896
DIA to do the I don't know if he was that hip I just want to make sure that

58
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,664
People understand

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,736
That really happened

60
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
I don't care anymore

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832

I don't want it I don't care about the prison

94
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,647
Ever since Alex's

95
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Cards about

96
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
The idea of trump

97
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
So you can just act like

It doesn't charm

102
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,847
Whenever I listen to the shows like what what do you think you say

103

What do you think his angle on it is already know

105
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:51,391

106
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
Radio host

You're being going you know exactly what he's had about it

116
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
When we go back to like 2009 we're seeing him support Somali pirates that's true

117
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,287
What's the address

118
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335

Expecting to find X and Y

120

Will you look in the present day

121
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
Exactly what you expect

122
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
Define novelty

123
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
Ctuit

124
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
I'm not saying we should recuse ourselves from

125
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
You know paying attention

126
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183

He just is awful I can

128
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
It's an awful boring

129
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Formulaic

130
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,327
Neo-fascist show

131
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
That's all it is

132
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
And it sucks

133
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,679
It seems like

134
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Episode

135
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
About the present day we should have

136
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,311
Each episode

137
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:20,479
Here's what Alex said for this production meeting on here while everyone

138
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:26,111
Still have to listen to all of it in order to get those many glimpses which is

139
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
Incredibly on satisfying for me cuz now the request of our show and more of his

140
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,583
The ratio ends up becoming more work for me for Less

141
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
Of this

142
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,935

143
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:45,311

But there's a couple things that happened along the way over the course of the

146
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247

151
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,047
Interesting conversation

152
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
Conversation

153
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,631

154
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935

00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
That's fair

195
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Master P

196
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
Master P probably worse

197
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,735
Just give that rhymes with Soldier way2go

198
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
Alright

199
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,599
Yeah

200
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,207
Talks about how he

201
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Deal with the

202
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Can't do it

203
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
I just telling you right now ladies and gentlemen

204
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
Civil War

205
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,807
Running around bullying and threatening

206
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
Because

207
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,927
Always talks about the global

208
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,071
Make a deal with the Devil

209
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:23,679
Really counter to pretty much everything about all the time

210
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,751
The idea that he can't make a deal with the Devil

211
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
Will be important later

212
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,871
Is a little bit of a setup

213
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:38,015
Punchline coming later

214
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
In order to

215
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
Do well

216
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
No it's it's something else entirely breakdown

217
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
It came out about Cohen

218
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,791
Payments

219
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:50,815
Two people

220
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:55,935
16 election

221
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
It made it reflect or appear

222
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,799
That more people believe the Trump won the debates

223
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:01,567
And they did

224
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
That is

225
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,919
It may have been

226
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,199
Raped by

227
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,735
This outfit is

228
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
The Drudge poll

229
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Of trump

230
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,159
Performance

231
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
And it's like the story I believe

232
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Alright

233
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,375
Whatever we'll see how this shakes out how about that

234
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
Everytime I saw that one like

235
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:36,127
You know who else can influence

236
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,687
A bunch of dudes just clicking a bunch of times it's

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
But yeah

238
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,063
I don't think it's fine but I also think it's like what let's do

239
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
Let's see what more there is here

240
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
At this point

241
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,463
You are the Q and I have enough

242
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,487
To go on

243
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,071
To have a real Firm Stance

244
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,119
Cuz he's predictable and defense

245
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,423
Right I think my biggest problem with it

246
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
I want my villains

247
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,239
To be super

248
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
I don't want them to be pathetic

249
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
Losers

250
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Do you know what I mean

251
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,199
I do know what you mean you're not going to get what you want

252
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
Big fans of Alex Jones

253
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
I know it's a reference for license.

254
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
He's doing is he's doing an imagined

255
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Dialogue

256
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,711
Between Trump

257
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
Chicken neck

258
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
What are the reason

259
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
I think the biggest reason I'm

260
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,159
Including this clip in our in our little brief glimpse

261
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
Of January 2nd

262
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,487
Demonstrate

263
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Submental

264
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,303
Problems

265
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
On Alex

266
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
They're not uncommon or unfamiliar to us

267
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,727
But I think they're more important today than they have

268
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:24,927
This is not our business

269
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,887
Action Mitchell

270
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,615
What

271
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Never heard of

272
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Chicken craft

273
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,631
Just I mean

274
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
He is expressing

275
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
Huge but just nonsensical

276
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Two-sided

277
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
The socratic debate

278
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
What's going on inside his head

279
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:52,991
None of it's based in reality reality

280
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,271
And all it does is

281
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,551
Freedomtoons

282
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
Weird I'm the only person who's a real man anymore I don't I don't know it's just

283
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,303
If there's something going on in his brain

284
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:07,839
Both

285
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,935
Parts of transfer policy

286
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,543
And blaming

287
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
Other people

288
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,359
Foreign policy

289
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,199
And also blaming it off at me. This is what happens when you don't know anything

290
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,575
And this is what happened

291
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,671
You have a super predictable editorial position

292
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:39,583
But he doesn't have any new watch doesn't he has no George Soros might put it reflexive

293
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
Respond defensively

294
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,775
Attack whoever is not on board

295
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,335
And it's pathetic and boring

296
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,383
But I also I also

297
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
I think there's more going on

298
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,455
Because if he's

299
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Specifically talking about

300
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Not supporting our allies

301
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,231
Trump's unilaterally and also reverse decision to pull troops out of

302
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,303
Siri

303
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
Absolutely abandoning our allies

304
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
So he's against

305
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
The foreign policy of the people that

306
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Supposedly

307
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,359
Puppet Master

308
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,431
All the counts everybody

309
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
We're done and said

310
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,855
Okay I guess and then six months later like 2 months later very quietly

311
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
Yeah

312
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,047
Alex's version on that is that I can put his foot down and then the meddling globalist

313
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:47,423
Just didn't listen to that effect

314
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,447
Do you want

315
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,567
We know from listening to as much Alex Jones as I have

316
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,663
I'm telling you about it childhood

317
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,199
Fraught with

318
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Nonsense

319
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Fictitious

320
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,903
Clearly

321
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,951
Fight the things that we know that

322
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,767
To be very consistent are

323
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
You know had some feelings of alienation

324
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
And at the same time

325
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Discovered none dare call it

326
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
Conspiracy

327
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,215
The book by Gary Alan when he

328
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:21,983
He was 12

329
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
Except the course of his life he saw through

330
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
The you call it

331
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,383
The conservative

332
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:34,783
The Communist Menace Among Us the conspiracy of the elite which was that

333
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,807
Manhattan

334
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
It conspiracy on the shelves

335
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
His parents were mostly cups

336
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
John versus

337
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
His childhood very consist

338
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
Discovered

339
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,375
Depending on the time

340
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
Cities told the story

341
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,727
Very consistent

342
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,567
I have heard other accounts

343
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
I found it in high school

344
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
He says 10 or 12

345
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
On a very regular basis

346
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
Which makes this next clip

347
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
Incredibly impossible for me to believe

348
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:15,487
Intimately obsessed with abusing children and chilling

349
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
Compare

350
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,839
I agree

351
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
I am not in their system

352
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,751
Almost

353
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,823
When I was about

354
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
I was a

355
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Okay

356
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Okay

357
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:47,999
And I wasn't killing people or dogs or anything that kind of sounds like

358
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
Okay

359
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:56,447
What is the country where I grew up I've seen the Dark Side of the Moon

360
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,007
And

361
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:04,127
I pulled out

362
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,407
12

363
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
$15

364
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
I was definitely there

365
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
Boy it's a hell of a drug

366
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,720
Contact

367
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,536
I got partially seduced but never gave over all the way

368
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,072
What

369
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:26,656
So far from the satanism

370
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
So far away from these people

371
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
Super far

372
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,104
In the spiritual

373
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
But all the crap in the rituals.

374
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,048
Aleister Crowley went

375
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
513

376
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,448
I think

377
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,520
I think it's his first of all potion

378
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:09,152
Doing is just trying to give himself another piece of the you like hero's journey

379
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
Yeah

380
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,504
The sort of moment of doubt in

381
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,064
Seduction by Darkside and stuff like that

382
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,696
No rights

383
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,232
A 12

384
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,000
Crowley

385
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:28,096
Probably f****** talking about

386
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,888
Crowley was a f*****-up dude

387
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,936
I'm sure Alex

388
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,800
The Crowley traveled the world from like the late 1800s early 1900s

389
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:40,640
Scared to venture far from the Western Shores

390
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
He attempted to climb K2

391
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,968
Never been scaled at that point

392
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
He took a spiritual Quest To The Logical extreme

393
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
Traveling to Japan

394
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
Sri Lanka India

395
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,880
Egypt to seek out instruction and knowledge

396
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,976
You can say the Crowley was bad dude and I'm not going to argue with that point

397
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Pretty much at all or much

398
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,608
But you can't live a life of curiosity and exploration

399
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Strictly opposed to

400
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,264
Alex read none dare call it conspiracy when he was 12 and it blew his mind ever since

401
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
What are

402
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:13,152
Whenever he's gone to visit another country he's only been to verify the pre-existing beliefs

403
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
He brought with him

404
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:18,784
He's a pathetic example of a mind made up in childhood which Crowley was the opposite of

405
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:23,392
I don't believe Alex a story about being a Satanist from the age of 12 to 15

406
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
I think that's just him expressing

407
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,976
Deep guilt about forcing women to get aboard

408
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:31,072
But assuming he's not lying and he Siva Crowley scene

409
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:34,144
Let's guess what Alex was up to back when he was 12

410
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,168
Sex Magic

411
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
He would almost certainly have been into sadomasochism those that was pretty prevalent in curly sex life

412
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:47,968
Most definitely would have been on the receiving end of sex with men since they sex intercourse with a large party higher levels of

413
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,992
Crowley Sex Magic

414
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,552
And he was famously bisexual

415
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,112
It was noted as the passive partner in those encounters

416
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,512
He may or may not have been eating cakes which would make the menstrual blood or semen

417
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,352
I don't think Alex has any idea who else to Crowley was or what he stood for

418
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:10,752
He just knows that he's a good account name to drop I was going to say

419
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,152
Like I was for Crowley's just

420
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:22,016
He was incredibly f***** up

421
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,552
Really f***** up stuff

422
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,832
But I also

423
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:33,280
What do you eat with El Ron Hubbard

424
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,472
The red lady

425
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,664
He is somehow to me

426
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:51,968
Strictly opposed

427
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
Crowley in that

428
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
He was he was just like

429
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,832
Sex is crazy let's do all of it

430
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,928
Like Aleister Crowley

431
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:07,328
You don't know that I don't know.

432
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:11,680
Nothing is more sex magic than shoving something down your pee hole

433
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,520
I'll let you have that I'm not going to I'm not going to push back

434
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,056
But

435
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:18,592
Harry Potter

436
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,968
What I Hear here is Alex desperately trying to give himself some sort of like

437
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Appeal to

438
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
To expertise and knowledge about these

439
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,112
That's what it's what all these assholes

440
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,488
Everybody who has The Stolen Valor or stolen

441
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,072
People on Project Camelot pretending they were CIA agent

442
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:43,680
Captain Mark Richards

443
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
Piece of their past

444
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:49,056
Employ in order to give themselves ownership of and

445
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:54,432
Like there's knowledge that they have that you can't possibly have and so you should just listen to them

446
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,480
It's a manipulative tricks

447
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Furthermore

448
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
Here's a question

449
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,088
For his

450
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,160
It's so so if he's in those

451
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,720
Richard he's not doing the ritual

452
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,256
He's going to do that means

453
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
He's just doing the Satanist

454
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:13,888
12

455
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,080
Number 2 for 3 years

456
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,104
I don't know

457
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Once you're in your head

458
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
For three years in your formative years

459
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
What kind of cookie even

460
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,424
He doesn't even know about the problem

461
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Something like that

462
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,752
Reacting to that emotionally

463
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:57,152
That's not good at art

464
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:06,112
On the 17th there's not much else I want to talk about except for this next clip

465
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:06,880
Where Alex

466
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
As hell

467
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
I think it's only important

468
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:12,512
Because we just had the news come out about this

469
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Supreme Court DACA

470
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,864
Fry's

471
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
Think that we are

472
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,960
We're entering a dangerous time

473
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
Uno's

474
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:28,896
Going to go with we're entering a dangerous. Of the

475
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
The exclusion and

476
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,016
Erasure of trans people from Publix

477
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Visibility

478
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Knowledge

479
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
You know what I mean

480
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Awareness

481
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
Place in society

482
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
And so I think it's important to see

483
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
Be the kind of rhetoric that Alex is putting out into the world

484
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
About these sorts of

485
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,656
Issues on January 17th

486
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
Smart

487
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,760
We need to get a full shampoo

488
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
And says you are going to

489
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Schmear

490
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,480
And the nurse

491
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
No it's okay

492
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,928
Hospital

493
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,768
You know what

494
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
The dog

495
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,424
You know what

496
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,312
Maybe I was wrong

497
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
That sounds like something that he

498
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,968
I mean this is

499
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:11,808
It is his way of

500
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Trying to

501
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
You think he's doing is taking extreme

502
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
Isn't doing a reductio ad absurdum

503
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,560
Same logic

504
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Absurd extreme

505
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
It's not

506
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,448
That story that he's telling about this nurse who got fired

507
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,288
From the UK hospital

508
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,504
Like you probably reference from 2017

509
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,784
Requested female nurse

510
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,112
It was a woman nurse showed up in the exam room

511
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,696
No it was fired over it

512
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
The patient after work

513
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
I don't know if that's even

514
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,608
Appropriate

515
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
Beware the story stop

516
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:03,776
It's also possible that he's referencing a sensationalized story out of the Sun

517
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
The Tabloid

518
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,944
About how Public Health guidelines were reflecting

519
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,760
Screenings that were appropriate for their.

520
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:19,904
So if the story was about anything real it was about the bureaucracy of the health administration

521
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
Not other entrants

522
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,512
It wasn't about trans pap smears as a

523
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,352
It was about routine reminders that are sent out to everyone

524
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,656
Bot invite them to take care of their health care

525
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,448
There's nothing malicious or weird

526
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,728
In that story at all

527
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:39,616
Do I can find no evidence that this is a real story I can find other stories that Alex doesn't want to talk about

528
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:44,224
There's a case in 2015

529
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,808
Went to e.r. where the staff

530
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
Because the lights

531
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,624
Instead he was carrying wasn't.

532
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,392
Up-to-date

533
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,768
Quote they came up and she's like that's a girl that's really a girl

534
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,608
It wasn't business-like at all I was a spectacle I was a freak Show at the Cirque

535
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
It was definitely to draw attention to

536
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:05,472
To the fact that my outward appearance didn't match my identification

537
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,824
Ethan Cicero who author study on trans experience at hospital

538
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,896
Expressed this experience is all too common

539
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
And in fact is a threat

540
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Same quote

541
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:21,856
From a safety standpoint I don't know many people who would want to be in that position and stay in that environment

542
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,696
People without receiving care

543
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:32,608
National Center for gender equality found that 19% of those surveyed had been denied Medical Care

544
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,168
Because they were trans or gender-nonconforming

545
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,008
And a 28% of reported postponed

546
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Do discrimination

547
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,848
The story-telling is not true

548
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:46,688
What that story reinforces is a status quo that is killing

549
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,224
And I mean that literally

550
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
In May 2015

551
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,368
Fourteen-year-old Kyler Prescott committed suicide after hospital employees

552
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
And staff would not stop calling him a girl

553
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,536
Tyler was at Rainbow Children's Hospital in San Diego

554
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,816
Depression

555
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
It was on a suicide watch to begin with

556
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
But according to his mother

557
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,240
The staff refusing to stop misgendering them called the downward spiral

558
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,288
Quote they were making him worse

559
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
They were completely traumatizing

560
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
The staff knew the situation

561
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
And one employee even said quote

562
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,992
Honey I would call you he but you're such a pretty girl

563
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
That kind of why I don't care

564
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,160
About stories like The Wanderers one from July 28th

565
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:31,488
What is contract terminated at UK hospital because he's

566
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
We refuse to accept

567
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,304
The hospital policy for burns

568
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
People by their preferred pronoun

569
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:39,424
He can claim all he wants that it's irrelevant to his ability to treat a patient

570
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,984
But tons of anecdotal stories

571
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,592
And actual Studies have been done that clearly show that this is not the case

572
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,872
And the keys wrong

573
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
Also that story about David Mack arrest

574
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,272
Cannot possibly be what Alex is referencing all the details are completely different

575
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,832
So that doesn't even track with his

576
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,880
Almost certainly made up story

577
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,976
So I just might my point here is that with Alex's doing

578
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
When is

579
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Ever

580
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:13,984
Issue is always

581
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Is the reverse

582
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,520
The reality

583
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
Do you want some man going into the women's bathroom

584
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Little girl might be

585
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,736
Well

586
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:31,136
10 is infinitely more likely to be abused when going into the men's bathroom

587
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,952
Correct

588
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
Was it is always

589
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
The reason

590
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
For this

591
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
Protection is sexual abuse

592
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Ward train

593
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
The reason for these protection

594
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
They're always

595
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Because so much abuse

596
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,056
Abuse is living

597
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,080
Ward's

598
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,152
People and they try and turn it into somehow there

599
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,272
They're firing people for not wanting to continue to abuse people

600
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,624
Like what the story that I can find it even

601
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,904
Comes close to Tracy

602
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,512
Track of

603
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
A trans woman nurse

604
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
To feel

605
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,656
Bad about that

606
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,704
Because the woman was uncomfortable with her

607
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,008
I don't know

608
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,104
Victim-blaming behavior and that's that's what you

609
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,640
Expect

610
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,736
It's not like hey look at Alex

611
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,064
Taking the weird turn it's right on course

612
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
Just

613
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,112
It needs to be

614
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,392
Be pointed out

615
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
As

616
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,744
That what Alex is doing is reinforcing the world

617
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
View that

618
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Is one of

619
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
Did not get a pass for that

620
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
And we won clip

621
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:58,688
It doesn't let Alex off the hook for anything but I legitimately might

622
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Serve as

623
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Application that we

624
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
We can't

625
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
Talk about Alex in the same way in the

626
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,392
I think he said something that reveals

627
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:15,840
Stroke on air right now and it's close to that Bible

628
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
We see clear evidence of

629
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,680
Like real substantial

630
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Mantle

631
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:29,152
I go to 62% oxygen always have

632
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,248
Text Becky

633
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,552
Most people die at 60% oxygen

634
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,472
What's the weather

635
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
So that's extreme

636
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,824
Wow so you got some serious app

637
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,920
Big deal

638
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,456
Incredibly serious

639
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:10,112
He doesn't want to do DMT with Joe Rogan

640
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
Is beyond what's treatable with normal procedures

641
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,488
And you have to sleep sitting up

642
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
All that is really sad

643
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:23,168
Somebody who suffered with Sleep Disorders earlier in my life I'd never wish that kind of thing on anyone

644
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,984
At the same time it really starts to clear up some Quest

645
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,520
About why Alex is the way he is

646
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,616
According to a 2016 study from the UCLA School of Nursing

647
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:36,736
People who suffer from sleep apnea show significant changes in their levels of two important brain chemical

648
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,344
The first is Gaba or gamma amnio of butyric acid

649
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:48,256
Studies show that people with sleep apnea showed significant decreases of Gaba which is involved

650
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
From higher brain region

651
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,632
Regulate emotions and physical functions

652
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,680
Such as blood pressure and perspiration

653
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:59,264
UCLA describe Gabba is a chemical messenger that exist

654
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Keeping people calm

655
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,080
Functioning like a break

656
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,456
People with severe sleep apnea like Alex is describing has significantly lower levels of

657
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,248
Simultaneously

658
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,136
The study found that while Gaba levels are low levels of glutamine or significantly elevated inpatient

659
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:15,904
Sleep apnea

660
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,952
Glutamine is the opposite of Gaba

661
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,488
And works as an accelerator

662
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
Glutamine levels are high

663
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,840
The brain is working in a state of stress

664
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
And consequently doesn't function

665
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
As efficient

666
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,728
Paul Macy the lead researcher of the study said quote

667
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,056
It's rare to have this size of difference and biological measures

668
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,920
We expected an increase in glutamine because of the chemical that causes damage

669
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,248
And we've already seen brain damage from sleep apnea

670
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:44,064
What we were surprised to see was the dropping Gabba

671
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
That made us realize that there must

672
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,416
To be a reorganization of how the brain is working

673
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,512
If Alex suffers from sleep apnea so severe that

674
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
CPAP machine

675
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
About it

676
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,352
It's a very serious condition

677
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:00,192
And you expect to see wildly out of balance levels of Gaba and glutamine

678
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
A company that

679
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
And you know why

680
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
That's very

681
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
Clearly explains his behavior

682
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
He doesn't explain his bigotry

683
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,712
Out-of-control Behavior

684
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,064
It could all be the Public Presentation of brain damage she suffered because of his sleep apnea

685
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
Obviously this doesn't let him off the hook for anyting

686
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,928
Since we can see this terrible beliefs

687
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,488
Real stupid

688
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
Behavior

689
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:28,864
But if this sleep apnea developed over the past few years it would definitely explain the

690
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Flagrant inability

691
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
He has to control his emotions

692
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:37,568
And his out-of-control Outburst on the show we're like

693
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
It was legitimately could be

694
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,688
Result of brain damage caused by his severe sleep apnea

695
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,480
I don't know how I feel about that

696
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,016
But there is some good news

697
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
They've also found in these studies

698
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,488
Studies strong indications that the brain damage caused by these out of whack

699
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Chemical level

700
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,792
Camp

701
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,608
So it's actually start taking this seriously

702
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
We get that surgery the doctors

703
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Recommended in

704
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,448
Going on the right path

705
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
He could be back to being a run-of-the-mill interesting racist

706
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,056
In no time

707
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,408
It's possible I mean a lot of this

708
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
It gives you a window into like okay

709
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:20,064
That doesn't sound like when he just make stuff up

710
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Pissed off to have to

711
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
We talkin about it.

712
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,976
It gives you a window and that window is

713
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
He probably has diminished brain functioning and

714
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,352
Wheatley

715
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,680
Way out of normal range chemical levels

716
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
For these

717
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,776
Sort of restricting and accelerating

718
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
Yeah

719
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:42,336
It explains so much

720
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,128
Yeah it's too much like

721
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,152
He's on

722
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:49,504
Adrenaline all the time like every single moment of his life

723
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,808
His brain is stressed out

724
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Exist

725
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
You can't excuse

726
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
But it is

727
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,888
It is one of those things where like if you've ever had anybody in a traumatic

728
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,656
Car accident

729
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
Personality

730
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Suddenly

731
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
88

732
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,824
Really rare

733
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
Completely

734
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Like 180

735
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
And who they are right it's almost always in

736
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,456
Acceleration

737
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,224
Expansion

738
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,504
Of those terrible character

739
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:22,784
They already

740
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Inhibiting

741
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,512
He's always one of the fascist but now you really want that

742
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:39,680
Yeah maybe on something because of what we do you know parsing out the clues that he provides

743
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
Getting context for the things you say baby's brain chemical imbalance

744
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:49,408
He doesn't have those governors yet restrictive

745
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,968
Regulation of emotions

746
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,992
Some stuff like that

747
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
So maybe he tips

748
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
And more because of it

749
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,136
Analysis how often

750
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Drops

751
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,792
The quiet part loud in the past 3 years is compared to

752
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Yeah it does

753
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:12,960
I don't know I feel very weird about that because I don't know where that puts Alex on my feeling

754
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
About this present day

755
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
But I feel very conflicted about it

756
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
Like if if what he's saying is true

757
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,176
Balance does exist

758
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
And his behavior does

759
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Match

760
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:25,760
With what studies

761
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Shoshone to behavior someone

762
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,344
Who had brain damage from

763
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,648
Severe sleep apnea

764
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,696
Yeah I don't know how I feel about that

765
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:40,864
I don't know I don't have an answer I'm just conflicted

766
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,168
He saying is true it sounds

767
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,264
It's right

768
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
He's over exaggerating it but this is like a

769
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,967
I need to get through this obvious fact and we just need to move on and we don't need to worry about it but I don't I don't know why Alex

770
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,247
I about something

771
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
It's not in his character

772
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
Dale sings

773
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,415
Enhances

774
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Important

775
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Citicards

776
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,535
Play

777
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
Fuel made up

778
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,095
And the reason that I

779
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Get more seriously

780
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:14,655
Because what

781
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
His behavior matches

782
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
The outcome

783
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,519
That would be

784
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,543
The results

785
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,359
The most

786
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
Compelling piece of evidence

787
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,479
Right again like I said I don't know

788
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:35,135
Based on his face and how many fights are apparently

789
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,439
Like all of this stuff

790
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,719
Is 8

791
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:44,095
Probably right

792
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Right

793
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
The only thing about it is

794
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,959
So much of what we talked about regarding

795
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
Could be attributed

796
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:57,151
Any number of drugs

797
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:59,455
Conflicted

798
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
So for now my editorial position

799
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:05,087
He was f***** up is f***** up

800
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,367
We're not sure why

801
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
We're not sure why

802
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,255
I'm going to I'm going to call myself out on it a little bit

803
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
We talked about him in the future

804
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
Then we might be horrible

805
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,287
But until further confirmation comes

806
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,335
I think

807
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
View the father

808
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,895
She has kids

809
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,479
He needs to take care of that so like my feeling on it is

810
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,551
As entertaining as his outbursts are

811
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
I think

812
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
The greater good is for

813
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:40,671
Listen to the doctors

814
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Get that neck surgery

815
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
You have millions of dollars

816
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
You have good health care

817
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
You can do that

818
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,655
Don't keep sleeping sitting up I don't know I don't know what the Infowars

819
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Insurance package

820
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,263
I'm telling you I don't think he threw Alex

821
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,567
I don't know. He has a dream self

822
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
Anyway

823
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
I don't know man

824
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,455
Real serious curveball for me

825
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,991
Yeah that stuff

826
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,807
To the 23rd

827
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
Where will spend

828
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:09,599
The bar time

829
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
For today going through

830
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,183
How Alex enjoyed Wednesday

831
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
Start Spotify

832
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,071
About how

833
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
Declaring emergency

834
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
Didn't happen

835
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
We went over on pants episode

836
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
But I hate

837
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,799
How could you not have been wrong about flowing

838
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,151
Because of the shutdown

839
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:38,783
Declared a national emergency

840
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
No

841
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,583
How predictions wet

842
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
We told you but

843
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,335
Convoluted nonsensical idea

844
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,711
I told you a sunspot was going to destroy New York City on January 12th

845
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:12,319
Vincent just backed off

846
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
Troy New York

847
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:17,439
Bright

848
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
Prediction

849
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
But

850
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,495
You come down

851
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:34,079
Alex discusses

852
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Trend

853
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,383
This seems to keep happen

854
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:43,039
The seems to keep well

855
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
President

856
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,815
He can use the military funding to do it

857
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
I told you that

858
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:28,863
Situation

859
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:35,007
We will because

860
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:40,895
You mean your immediate response was right maybe Trump is backing off at the last minute or maybe

861
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,687
He's a f****** con man

862
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,247
Who's bluffing with all this stuff

863
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Maybe

864
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Everything you want him to

865
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,975
Is such a tremendously bad idea

866
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,047
Even if

867
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,071
To the point where he's like

868
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,863
This is

869
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Not

870
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,191
At Altru anybody make me look like

871
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:10,591
F****** a b**** I don't want to do

872
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,919
Information

873
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,271
Downey Police Department of Maricopa County

874
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,343
We went over is complete the whole story

875
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:27,743
Absolute nonsense imagine the idea of trump coming out with

876
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,767
The public

877
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:32,095
Can you imagine if more people than just us

878
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:38,495
Talked about the dentist Montgomery

879
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:45,663
It would be able be opening Pandora's Box never wanted to

880
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
That should give some in

881
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,479
Indication that the story

882
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,527
Doesn't have as much legs out

883
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,367
To contextualize it all he wants as like

884
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,671
Trump keeps backing off

885
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
But that's not what's going on

886
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
ABC's

887
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,815
Lying to the public and then not

888
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
Not

889
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,375
Falling through because he knows it

890
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:10,239
The klusterfuk

891
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Is because

892
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Of course he feels like

893
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
Betrayed by the

894
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Publicly

895
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Right

896
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
But

897
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,527
He does the same thing on account of he knows

898
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
He's lying as well

899
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:28,159
So he knows

900
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
He's going to be

901
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
Roundly

902
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
The president

903
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:36,095
The f****** present of the United States

904
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:38,143
Everyone's

905
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:41,471
Not just

906
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:45,055
Do any of that ship without

907
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:51,711
Definitely essential features in there

908
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
Modus operandi

909
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
Is that they don't follow through

910
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,111
Because like

911
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:02,207
What is like a consonant

912
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:08,607
Classically is out of town by the time it comes time to do whatever

913
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:12,959
I turns out you can just

914
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
Move on

915
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
The new cycle in Tucson

916
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Something else or

917
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,871
That's true

918
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,407
Yeah it distance

919
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,711
Be spiritual version of leaving town

920
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,015
That's what Alex is describing when he says Trump

921
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
Follow through

922
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
The same thing

923
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Is it that when Alex tries to prove anything

924
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:36,511
He's leaving town or episode

925
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,303
Proving white Wiz

926
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
That Trump should have

927
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,863
Declared a national emergency

928
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:44,959
First I'm going to spend the two hours of course bitching about why everybody makes

929
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Feel bad all

930
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:50,847
The tighter the last 2 hours

931
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
Someone else

932
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,319
Some headlines

933
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,623
Caller

934
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,999
15 minutes

935
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:15,679
Organic a proven episode that he has moved the goalposts

936
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,519
Pretended to prove other things

937
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:25,919
Revealed

938
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:33,087
So that's going to work better than a hot dog

939
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:41,791
I think we would have a better chance hot dog is what I call

940
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,607
Map

941
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,887
A lot of narrative

942
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Perpetuating

943
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,447
Present-day artists

944
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,983
Predictable

945
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,567
And here is Alex talking about the kids

946
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
Bob from Covington

947
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,431
Stockbridge

948
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:09,183
Where it's like are they bad or are they good

949
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,279
Fairview bastila whitewash

950
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:24,543
You white piece of crap

951
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
20 minutes

952
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,319
The poor wonderful

953
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,879
Lambo Vietnam Commando

954
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
Elder

955
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
Wampum

956
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,727
That's not good

957
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,031
Avengers

958
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
It's real bad

959
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:03,199
I don't know why you were acting in a very racially insensitive racist

960
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:09,855
Undercut

961
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:15,999
Are you picking on these races kids doing races I'm doing racist

962
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:25,471
What are you doing is he's trying to pull this weird sleight-of-hand trick

963
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,287
The Native American guy with the

964
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
The word yelling stuff at

965
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,431
This entire story

966
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:40,063
End cuz it guess what what whatever you thought

967
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,695
Is pretty much right

968
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,511
Seeing the details watching all the

969
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:52,607
If your takeaway is that those kids

970
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:57,727
And particularly the one who was just sort of smugly standing in front of

971
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,799
That the dude is that they were at

972
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Like really

973
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,151
Inappropriately

974
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:08,479
You're right in terms of like the kids

975
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,503
From Covington

976
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
Text that were there

977
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,719
But you came in with the drum

978
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,255
It's trying to Defuse The Situation

979
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
And then those kids started antagonizing

980
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,679
You actually watch the videos you can tell that the black Israelites were actually

981
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
Calm down by

982
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
And do you throw kids in the

983
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,895
Have you were not they've been beginning

984
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
Antagonizing

985
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:41,247
I would hate to be in the picture that is

986
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,271
So

987
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,575
Closely related to

988
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,367
What was the name of

989
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
Of the first

990
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
Blackstone

991
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:57,119
Screaming at her like

992
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,447
Yeah

993
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:04,287
To be that it is it is the sort of thing where the Optics of it are

994
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Really

995
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:09,663
Resonant

996
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,479
Captures

997
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,807
I don't know

998
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
The kids

999
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,183
Mixing it up and arguing with

1000
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
She's black is Ray

1001
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,071
If you want to point the finger at somebody pointed at them

1002
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:30,911
You know you could have but instead Alex

1003
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,703
His take on it is

1004
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:39,103
That this Native American is cheap swamp

1005
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,223
To go to college campuses and get upset

1006
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,527
About people dressing up like Native Americans

1007
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,575
He has his whole like

1008
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,111
A strange

1009
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,439
I mean I understand that over doesn't pay that

1010
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,999
I'm just saying

1011
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:00,351
Convoluted narrative about

1012
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
Behind it

1013
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,055
I suppose my biggest frustration

1014
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
And the reason that I did

1015
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
Pay attention

1016
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
Because

1017
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,199
There are already so many

1018
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,783
There are so many of these pictures

1019
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:26,463
Ferguson is like any number of these pictures if you want to find them you can see a picture that gives you a perfect and

1020
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Capsulation

1021
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,511
Of white race

1022
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,327
I don't like these stories because

1023
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Clearly we have not been able

1024
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
The focus on

1025
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Any one of these

1026
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
For a long enough.

1027
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
To do anything

1028
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:44,127
So is operative

1029
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
Frustrating because it's

1030
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Like f****** guys

1031
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,735
We got to pick one and then never

1032
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Ever

1033
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:57,183
No no no no no

1034
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,743
That's why they've done

1035
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:02,047
Cuz I have one thing to say

1036
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,655
Right

1037
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,679
Focus of Messi

1038
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:10,751
Whether or not what they saying is true or not

1039
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
One so much

1040
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,127
Let's talk about how those kids

1041
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Are awesome

1042
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:24,319
The places where Maca is cool are better

1043
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,159
Explains what he means by better

1044
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
You know what

1045
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,079
No

1046
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:48,895
Are we still

1047
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
I don't want that

1048
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:56,831
Square all day

1049
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,159
Is it

1050
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,463
Drug addict

1051
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:04,511
Weirdo

1052
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,607
Pretty good

1053
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
More

1054
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:16,031
You're drunk on air all the time

1055
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,055
This is nonsense

1056
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,335
Drink on the job

1057
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,895
Call Mandy real Square Alex

1058
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:25,759
Like if what he saying

1059
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:32,159
That's where people are working 12 to 14 hours a day

1060
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:42,399
That's what I work on this remember the beat

1061
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:47,519
Pictures of the future from like the 1940s and 50s number one was always like

1062
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:51,103
And because of automation only work 3 hours

1063
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:51,871
Where's the date

1064
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:56,735
Standard of a good place is you're overworked

1065
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,319
No not good

1066
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:05,951
He says Old Glory flying at the Statehouse he means the Confederate flag

1067
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:13,119
I would say no I do not think that makes for a good place

1068
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,703
Courthouse

1069
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:18,239
Head covered in Bible

1070
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:28,479
Yeah

1071
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,015
A place where you work 40

1072
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,087
That's the real

1073
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,391
Trying to be like

1074
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,439
Farmer

1075
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:43,071
Maybe maybe

1076
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:49,727
Farmer Farmer might be what

1077
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
You go home

1078
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
For 2 hours

1079
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,103
Sleep for 8 hours

1080
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
To that that is entirely possible

1081
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,527
But what he doesn't fail to recognize it

1082
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:08,927
Working 14 hours a day

1083
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:18,399
Uber drivers in jail in Confederate flag-waving

1084
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,263
People working 12 hours today

1085
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:28,383
Alex's

1086
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,199
Fear about this Caravan 3.0

1087
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
Because we need it again

1088
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:39,135
The right needs

1089
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:42,463
Season 2 of

1090
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,279
They needed again I'm not sure why

1091
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
The government shutdown

1092
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Make sure that

1093
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
Democrats somehow look bad I don't know

1094
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,727
Cuz there's not another election

1095
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
I'm coming up for another year

1096
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,127
Shutdown negotiations

1097
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:06,527
Because the

1098
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,343
Is the Democrats don't want the wall

1099
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,671
A build-up fear of what the wall

1100
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,839
Disappointed

1101
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:21,887
For the same way

1102
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,191
But Alex's

1103
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,775
Mexico is going to let

1104
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
People through

1105
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,359
He says

1106
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
Trump should do something

1107
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,175
Very scary

1108
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
Everyone

1109
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
Be terrified by

1110
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,551
Understand

1111
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,111
Associated Press

1112
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,231
Mexico

1113
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,791
2 degrees

1114
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,727
We will allow full-on invasion

1115
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,823
Now you know what the regular response is a dash

1116
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:10,271
Sure

1117
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,087
Start a war

1118
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:16,415
Let them know that we're not going to have Mexico

1119
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
Running a territorial war against the holy s*** out of the truck

1120
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:28,703
And take the capital so fast

1121
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:32,799
What points great we've been doing in ground Wars

1122
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,783
You take Mexico City

1123
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
I don't know install a government you like

1124
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,279
That's what happened

1125
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:55,583
And installing government

1126
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:02,239
Overthrowing governments right right right right

1127
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
Broken clock is right

1128
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Global

1129
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:09,663
Yeah yeah

1130
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:12,991
It just wouldn't hear stuff like that

1131
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,527
And that is like

1132
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
Back to me

1133
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:17,599
Did you

1134
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:22,719
Sleep apnea

1135
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,279
E-40 war on Mexico

1136
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,839
Troops to Mexico City

1137
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,887
But that's only because

1138
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
What

1139
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:36,287
How far out a line is this with everything he's reported to believe

1140
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,823
Well

1141
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,663
He hates regime-change

1142
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,599
Afraid of these immigrants and refugees

1143
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,903
Asylum

1144
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,975
When they make it to our party so fucken afraid of that

1145
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,767
And what's behind it

1146
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
I think if you really break it down

1147
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
Is the idea that

1148
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
He's afraid of demographic shift

1149
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,447
Is afraid of the idea that white people

1150
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,727
The power

1151
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:11,359
It's so fun how much right-wing rhetoric

1152
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,175
Relies on Mexico

1153
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,711
You know it's like

1154
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:20,319
Hey we're going to accomplish something is like Mexico

1155
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:27,231
Right

1156
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,071
Forest

1157
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,375
If that's

1158
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,423
Control of it

1159
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,471
Do all of our work for us

1160
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:41,823
Everybody knows that kind of flippant

1161
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,871
Partially

1162
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:44,639
Because he has such

1163
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,431
Like fantasies about the sound

1164
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,015
I think there's a pretty decent chance

1165
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,111
What underlies his disrespect of Mexican sovereignty

1166
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
He's just kind of like

1167
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:59,487
Play I live in Mexico

1168
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,255
Might as well

1169
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
But in the

1170
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,607
Text Alex

1171
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Expresses

1172
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,447
Ask about Trump

1173
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,727
Tom and

1174
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,519
The closest get to criticism

1175
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,335
Because the Trump isn't doing a good enough job

1176
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
It turns

1177
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,407
The protecting Americans

1178
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:28,927
Yats

1179
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,023
Jerks

1180
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831

It it that is not a good visit

1186
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,647
Uninhabitable

1187
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
You should buy

1188
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:41,375
It is right here

1189
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:44,959
Is actively working against like

1190
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:51,359
Hey guys what you're seeing for me right now is I'm out of it I'm out of it because I took this product

1191
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:55,711
Which is the new products available on the store.

1192
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
This is bad

1193
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
Hilarious

1194
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,599
Yeah it's very buddy

1195
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,207
If it works sketch it would be brilliant

1196
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
Food Bistro

1197
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
Infowars store

1198
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,847
I didn't

1199
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:29,503
Which is also attributable to what he said

1200
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:35,903
Not be able to sleep

1201
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,231
Product

1202
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:43,583
By saying how tough they are to deal with

1203
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,631
I don't understand this world

1204
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Breezy

1205
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
Banana

1206
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
Yeah it's pretty nuts

1207
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
Is there

1208
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:02,271
Regardless

1209
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
Costs that are going on

1210
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Not just Financial cost

1211
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Button terms

1212
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,135
Programs that are being

1213
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:15,071
You can read about where people are having to sneak into

1214
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,631
Cultures alive

1215
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:19,423
Research they're doing

1216
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
And stuff like that

1217
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,775
Like massive Fallout

1218
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
That we won't understand

1219
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,407
And that was the last time we had

1220
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,223
Even shorter government shutdown

1221
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,015
We didn't understand

1222
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,807
The damage that was being done

1223
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,087
As it was happening

1224
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,415
We do understand right now

1225
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:42,975
The people who are being affected by it not being

1226
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Paid and stuff like that

1227
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:46,047
We understand that

1228
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
Yep it's it's heroine

1229
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:50,399
About like all the stuff that we're going to discover that we

1230
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
You just didn't realize

1231
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,703
Got f***** up

1232
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
In the in the process

1233
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
And what's

1234
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,775
Super important

1235
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,335
To remember is that as much as this is

1236
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,871
Is Trump being a giant baby

1237
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
Every Republican

1238
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,711
In elected office

1239
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,759
Save-A-Lot

1240
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Maybe a few

1241
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
Is a giant

1242
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
Trump is an idiot

1243
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:14,207
Trump doesn't know Trump is trying to win a fight

1244
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:17,535
Trump is not aware of how real things work he's a

1245
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
The f****** moron

1246
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:21,119
Problem

1247
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,959
Put a ton of members in the Senate and the house

1248
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
No.

1249
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
F****** well the damage that they're doing

1250
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
And they're doing it out of

1251
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Cowardice

1252
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,687
Two twins get f***** over

1253
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
Because they don't want

1254
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
Get

1255
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,623
Blowback I don't want to look like they're breaking ranks

1256
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
And then

1257
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Exactly

1258
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,511
Because all of these people are

1259
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
Cowards probably

1260
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,703
You still giving him a little bit

1261
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,519
We're on or on getting sick of this guy watch

1262
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:03,615
ZR2 this time Alex follows up

1263
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,687
Bikes at expressing a plan that he has

1264
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
ProTech

1265
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,039
People need to call the White House

1266
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,903
Could they take the form letter

1267
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:25,119
White House peaceful March

1268
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:29,727
President declared emergency

1269
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,775
He was but he backed off

1270
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,335
How crazy is it

1271
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,127
Alex f****** Jones

1272
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:42,527
Three talking about going across the country

1273
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,807
Peaceful march by the way

1274
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,903
Where he tries to encourage the president to express

1275
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,207
Executive powers

1276
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,743
How quick like

1277
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:58,655
Not a few years ago whether it was Obama or bushes term

1278
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,495
He would have done the exact same thing or maybe pretended he was going to

1279
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,783
He would have said he was going to go and protest Bush or Obama

1280
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,183
He's not doing nothing I need

1281
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,463
I need

1282
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,743
Create this Authority

1283
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
Once he does

1284
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:26,815
I-10

1285
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,095
Via media figure

1286
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:29,631
Yeah pretty much

1287
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:35,775
I am going to go to the

1288
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,823
And have a peaceful protest

1289
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,151
Declare himself King

1290
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,687
I'm destroyed

1291
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:45,247
So I can get back on Twitter

1292
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Eunos

1293
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,951
He believes that

1294
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,231
Trump

1295
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,023
Executive powers

1296
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,303
Will allow him to

1297
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:00,607
To create this sort of world that

1298
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:02,143
Which

1299
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
We understand

1300
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
Engaged

1301
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
What does rhetoric over

1302
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,519
Is a white

1303
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,311
Authoritarian

1304
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,895
Do you think there is also a bit of a

1305
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,223
Obviously in the world we live in now

1306
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:16,991
He can't

1307
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
Really be

1308
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
Successful

1309
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,063
So

1310
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:22,111
Install Jose

1311
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
I guess dictators

1312
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:26,207
I think about this question

1313
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:31,327
Then Trump is thinking well of course I'm going to keep Fox & Friends

1314
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,543
It's got to go

1315
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:45,407
Talking Friends

1316
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,943
Alex as his

1317
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:53,087
I think you can install Alex in a media operation

1318
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:56,927
His brand of

1319
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:57,951
Media

1320
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,999
Much more protected

1321
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
Words

1322
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:06,911
We heard him talk about it about how Obama put in all these executive orders that he can't name

1323
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,959
Doesn't specify

1324
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:12,031
And one of them is this vague idea of

1325
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,335
Controller

1326
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
What

1327
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,383
If the government

1328
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:18,687
Has the authority

1329
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
Authority

1330
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,223
To take over the

1331
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
Comedian sound like

1332
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,807
Alert system

1333
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:30,207
But he believes

1334
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,023
Is it just a warning

1335
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,631
Tornado watch

1336
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Get to your basement

1337
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:45,055
Hawaii

1338
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:51,199
Apologies holy work

1339
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:57,087
I think that there is

1340
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,879
He has this misguided

1341
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:01,439
That should

1342
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,231
These

1343
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Give powers

1344
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,535
Alex

1345
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
To have

1346
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:11,167
He would be able to then overturn all of the things that are keeping Alex down

1347
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,983
Trump can get an executive order to put them back on

1348
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,543
Right right because he believes that those things

1349
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
Things that are keeping

1350
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,103
Social media platform

1351
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,407
Parts of government

1352
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
Coordination

1353
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:28,063
Government not his treasured

1354
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
National

1355
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:31,135
So it's all based on

1356
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
A misunderstanding

1357
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
Of what's Happening

1358
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
Is willful

1359
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
But also

1360
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Sophia lucky

1361
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:43,935
I don't know

1362
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,495
I just want him to take over

1363
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
Sarah Huckabee

1364
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,799
His life would be so much

1365
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,615
Booth that be crazy

1366
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,407
Anymore you might as well put Alex

1367
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,967
F*** yeah everybody would have a great time

1368
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,015
And make it make Alex feel so good

1369
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
Give me a much-needed win

1370
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,111
Second source of income

1371
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,159
To get that neck surgery

1372
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,975
Which I bring back up because

1373
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
I think this next quote

1374
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,095
The demonstration on January 23rd of

1375
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Exactly

1376
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
Is glutamine

1377
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:19,775
Excessiveness overabundance of this

1378
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,335
Stress hormone

1379
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,127
Deficiency

1380
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
I believe

1381
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,967
Frank

1382
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Full demonstration

1383
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,551
This is why it makes me uncomfortable

1384
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
I still like to laugh about him

1385
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,623
But this is why it's

1386
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
Kind of a comfort

1387
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,719
$9,000 cars

1388
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,999
You talk about Maxine Waters

1389
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,911
Husband

1390
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
I don't like losing

1391
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,967
How much do

1392
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,239
That's a really bad at

1393
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:25,823
I mean that's not even it

1394
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:31,199
Hahaha

1395
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,991
Hahaha

1396
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,527
Either that or he just

1397
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,551
Did a lot of Coke

1398
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,535
People save that shitt

1399
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,071
Yeah or or

1400
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
Could make someone laugh

1401
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:59,103
That is right on the line of fake

1402
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:05,503
Psychotic

1403
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:10,879
And almost Primal level of like

1404
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,695
If you hear somebody make that noise

1405
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,767
Yeah I'm going to Play It Again Play it again

1406
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,143

That's f****** good Joker

1408
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,407
Yeah

1409
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,111
Listen I think that there is an element of its fake and there's also a part of it

1410
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:47,487
Define the line there

1411
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,559
Flies like someone who

1412
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
Yeah

1413
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
You hate yet

1414
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:57,727
You hate to see this

1415
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
Yeah

1416
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
Scary

1417
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,663
Doing that as an actor

1418
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,807
You heard that he's going to call

1419
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:18,207
Bring that energy

1420
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,583
Yeah

1421
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,703
Terrifying

1422
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
Yeah yeah I'm uncomfortable with all of that

1423
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,919
Sew-ins next clip Alex

1424
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
Business

01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:49,439
Chief wampum

1426
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:51,743
It's not good

1427
01:17:55,583 --> 01:18:01,727
I want to get into a New Mexico called the Covington element

1428
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,711
Shingle Christianity

1429
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
Crap

1430
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:15,807
Why

1431
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:26,047
Demonic snake absolute bottom-of-the-barrel Democrat bill

1432
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,583
Garbage

1433
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,167
That's terrible

1434
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,191
That is just terrible

1435
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Terrible

1436
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,287
I think

1437
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,311
Keys

1438
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,103
Really channeling

1439
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,639
Andrew Jackson trying

1440
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Finish the Native America

1441
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:45,247
Do you know

1442
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,271
The like

1443
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,575
Cuz it's legitimately like

1444
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
They did

1445
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
On purpose

1446
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,791
3

1447
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,607
That was their main reason for

1448
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,167
Destroying that

1449
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
And he looked

1450
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
So

1451
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:11,359
And his interviews that happened afterwards he wasn't even mad at those

1452
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,127
Just kids

1453
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,175
But you didn't demonize them

1454
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,039
Snake which is why UK

1455
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
Can't demonized

1456
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:27,743
That's one of the rules of hell did you looks like a demonic make which is also

1457
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
You know

1458
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:33,375
Between the ages of 12 and 15

1459
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,311
I don't know whenever you say somebody looks like

1460
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,079
Demonic

1461
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:42,847
Whatever

1462
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,639
That's usually you're trying to

1463
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:45,919
Use code

1464
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,455
I always

1465
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,503
Get the sense that whatever

1466
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,783
You're relating someone's

1467
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,551
Appearance 2

1468
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
Demonic nest

1469
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,159
You're generally I mean you're talking about their physical characteristic

1470
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,439
And

1471
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:03,327
It's 8 to talk to wiggle away from that cuz I see that guy and I don't think he looks like a demonic snake

1472
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,351
He looks pretty nice

1473
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,679
Looks like a guy

1474
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,703
Nice about it

1475
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
Is that

1476
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
Normally

1477
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,311
He uses demonic

1478
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
To refer to

1479
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,664
That's true

1480
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,272
You know like you can call built up

1481
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
Situation

1482
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
Using that

1483
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
Trigger

1484
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
You felt up to

1485
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
Reply to this guy

1486
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,512
So it's not better

1487
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:39,168
He's in a bummer of a place even

1488
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,984
For him because when he would really love

1489
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,032
Is to go after the black Israel

1490
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,616
I don't think you understand that part of the story

1491
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:55,808
If I was giving if we were doing

1492
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,672
R manga

1493
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,488
Nationalist

1494
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,512
They're black

1495
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,816
Melissa

1496
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,216
Picture was the the black

1497
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
Israelites

1498
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
And the white

1499
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,312
Assholes

1500
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,592
Of course

1501
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
It's right to go out

1502
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
After them

1503
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
Long series of reasons

1504
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,480
Parentheses

1505
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,248
Mainly because

1506
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,040
But because

1507
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,344
Pictures of

1508
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,880
In Vietnam war vet

1509
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:36,512
Soros operative

1510
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,048
This is bad even for

1511
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,352
I think that's one of the reasons

1512
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:45,216
Scope of the situation go after the black Israelites

1513
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,496
Is that

1514
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,544
Like anybody who knows anything

1515
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
Knows that

1516
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
They

1517
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,640
Thrive on antagonist

1518
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,224
Is there a hangout Insidious

1519
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
East Coast

1520
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,808
People on street corners

1521
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,440
Hope it's a notary

1522
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,536
I can't provide if you want to learn a little bit more about them

1523
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Go for it

1524
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,864
But also there's a good

1525
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,912
Where you at

1526
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:15,680
The black National

1527
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:20,032
What's that

1528
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:26,688
You get a little bit of an insight into how they operate

1529
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:31,808
Be here in Chicago like I got a ride

1530
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:35,392
There is a little colonel of that in what they do there

1531
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,440
The way they operate is

1532
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,976
Enticed

1533
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
People in

1534
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
2 watt vape

1535
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,888
I don't know if you had this

1536
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,168
Is Ian go to college

1537
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
Which belief

1538
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,472
But like when I went

1539
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:55,360
Ouch I'm sorry I don't mean to disparage

1540
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,664
Fine

1541
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,736
The necessary University Missouri

1542
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:04,064
There's a guy who's come to the campus

1543
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,136
She would go around

1544
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:09,696
Country number people who were listening

1545
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
To their campus

1546
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
College

1547
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,840
He was around

1548
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:20,192
His main base was at the creek

1549
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
Got a ride

1550
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,824
Susan Missouri and he was always on

1551
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,104
Mizzou

1552
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,920
His whole thing was just screaming

1553
01:23:30,432 --> 01:23:31,456
Powderhorn

1554
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
How they're going to hell

1555
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:37,856
And what you would do if you would attract a large crowd of college kids who are mostly laughing at

1556
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:41,184
Keywood Gallatin

1557
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,488
Intubate

1558
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
And

1559
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,048
You know what

1560
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:46,816
Here's the thing

1561
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
It doesn't work

1562
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,888
Big picture

1563
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,424
Does work

1564
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,704
In terms of like

1565
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:57,312
1000 people are going to laugh at you and maybe someone's going to take a swing at you

1566
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:02,432
But you get to use that guy who takes a swing at you as an example of why you're right in your repressed right

1567
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
And the people who come to

1568
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,040
Maybe one out of every 5000 people

1569
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:07,808
Do you encounter

1570
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,600
Is going to be Extreme as f***

1571
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,880
And it's going to be a good

1572
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,648
Recruit

1573
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,440
The people like people like

1574
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,720
The black Israelites

1575
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
They are

1576
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
Operating a very similar

1577
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,144
It's at Broadneck

1578
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:25,472
Everybody

1579
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,240
But the people

1580
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
You do get or going

1581
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,592
Soldiers there going to be an acolyte

1582
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,456
Yes that's the reason

1583
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
Do they get along well

1584
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:39,296
Excellent.

1585
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
Is

1586
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,344
An offshoot of

1587
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,112
Malcolm X

1588
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,696
Malcolm X's Church

1589
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,232
Extreme enough for them

1590
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,840
I couldn't love him

1591
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:58,240
Because his words were so smooth is he still alive

1592
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:03,104
Branched off of the

1593
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,872
Create decipher

1594
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:04,896
Percent Nation Nation

1595
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:05,664
Gods on Earth

1596
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,712
Where is conception

1597
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,760
Is the black man is God made up of

1598
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,576
Which one Parts arm leg leg arm head

1599
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,368
Which are

1600
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,208
Especially

1601
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,232
English

1602
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:24,096
Don't spell it that way

1603
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,144
He believes that the black man is

1604
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,240
Existence

1605
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,288
Mutually

1606
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
Respectful arrangement

1607
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:50,464
Fat people in pop culture kind of believe

1608
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,512
These beliefs like the

1609
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,304
Among other rappers

1610
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,704
The rizs version of the 5%

1611
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,496
Is almost

1612
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Reform

1613
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
Five percent Nation

1614
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,384
He takes a lot of the racism out of it she has

1615
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,200
In later time I think if you went back to like

1616
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,272
When 36 Chambers was recorded it probably

1617
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,344
Handsome

1618
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
Mitre

1619
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
I might know too much about them

1620
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,488
The reason it's called the five percent Nation

1621
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,792
Because they believe that their 5%

1622
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,560
Population

1623
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,840
It is aware of the

1624
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,632
Truth and helping wake up

1625
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,400
The rest of the

1626
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,216
85% of the population

1627
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
Is deaf blind

1628
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,336
They have no idea what's going on alright then there's 10%

1629
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
The 5%

1630
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,408
Keep the 85

1631
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,200
But don't have a clue asleep

1632
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
That the 5%

1633
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,320
Is that the black man is

1634
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,904
In the more reform versions of

1635
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,208
These days

1636
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,488
It's more

1637
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,304
It's not really that important what race you are

1638
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
Is Maura self-empowerment thing

1639
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
Like the 5%

1640
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,424
You are a god

1641
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:09,824
Misogyny

1642
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,968
Perform Brett it's great it's interesting

1643
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,272
To answer your question

1644
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:23,136
Five percent nation is an Islamic group

1645
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,160
Black Israelites

1646
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
Which are more

1647
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:26,976
Assertive

1648
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:35,680
Ohiopyle

1649
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,728
Israeli

1650
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
I'm sorry

1651
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:45,408
Absolute black nationalist

1652
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,456
Which

1653
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
Seems like it would be common ground

1654
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,600
I don't from what I understand and I could be a little bit wrong about this

1655
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,648
What I understand

1656
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,416
Don't see eye-to-eye

1657
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,696
Catch up the by percent Nation

1658
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:00,512
Oh bummer

1659
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
You guys would have

1660
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:07,936
At this point to talk more about

1661
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:10,752
From Covington

1662
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,032
The Covington boys

1663
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,640
He says something

1664
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,368
Square

1665
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:30,464
1456

1666
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:34,816
I don't care

1667
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,120
Or

1668
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
So

1669
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,616
Two of those years at least

1670
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,456
Asia

1671
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:53,248
His whole timeline is fun

1672
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,576
School is awesome

1673
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,600
Must be great

1674
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
School you can go find

1675
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Pictures of

1676
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,184
Bunch of kids

1677
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,560
That's great

1678
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,376
School

1679
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,960
You bet it's crazy

1680
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,104
People who looked into the

1681
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,664
Their talk to others

1682
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,432
Student

1683
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,224
Who go to that school they fall into

1684
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
Problematic

1685
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,600
Very

1686
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,648
Singularly White

1687
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:37,024
Valedictorian

1688
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,304
Gay who is like

1689
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,096
This is

1690
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
He's a former Valley

1691
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,592
You always are available

1692
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,456
Sounds right I didn't graduate college

1693
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,480
Zoe

1694
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:00,320
Alex

1695
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,344
And what he does is

1696
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:02,368
Appeals to

1697
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
He's built up as a

1698
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
And because we've done our work

1699
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
Followed out

1700
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,304
We know this is a lie

1701
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,408
So Alex is already without talking about the

1702
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,176
Specifics of the

1703
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,968
Situation is it

1704
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,760
The black Israelites who were

1705
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:35,136
The provocateur the was the Native American guy was drunk

1706
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:46,400
Is black Israelites who were screaming at the kids go back to Europe

1707
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,448
Necessities

1708
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:53,568
Suburban is actively trying to

1709
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,616
Diffuse the situation between the two

1710
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
Hardee's in fighting

1711
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,088
Provocateur

1712
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,904
Is how you go to

1713
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:11,488
2018 Bugatti

1714
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:14,816
Which one cause martial law

1715
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,104
When the police

1716
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,992
Are there any

1717
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,784
Starbucks

1718
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Authorized

1719
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,160
These are the documents that he found on 4chan that are

1720
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:40,928
Completely

1721
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:46,560
These are the hit contract

1722
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,632
This is this to me is where like

1723
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,496
But because of the show that we do it never does

1724
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,520
Like the conversation

1725
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
Sing like that

1726
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:00,384
And all you have to do

1727
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,200
Where does your narrative go if those aren't

1728
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,504
You haven't proven that they're real

1729
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:09,600
So where do you have anything to stand on here if they're not real right

1730
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,624
No you don't

1731
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,672
This day all this falls apart

1732
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:14,720
This idea that the guy

1733
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,024
Is it provocateur falls apart

1734
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,608
He's even now throwing into in those documents

1735
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:24,192
That wasn't part of this before

1736
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:27,008
You know that the initial thing was a lie

1737
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,800
So you can add a hat to a hat

1738
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:34,176
You can lie on top of a lie

1739
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,736
If the antifa sometimes uses

1740
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,040
This guy was using a drum

1741
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:43,648
He must be logically sound

1742
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,416
You can call

1743
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,488
Clearly confirm that if a uses a drum

1744
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:50,560
Then by necessity if B uses a drum

1745
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:53,120
Despite there being no connection between them

1746
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,144
They must be

1747
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,728
Is the protesters

1748
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,496
Used drums

1749
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
This protest

1750
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Drum

1751
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,408
Possible

1752
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,176
Southern work

1753
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,040
Breaking news

1754
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Important

1755
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,952
Caracas is basically falling in Venezuela

1756
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:24,096
President here has recognized

1757
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
Crazy

1758
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:30,752
So has declared himself president of Venezuela

1759
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,128
But the president Nicolas Maduro

1760
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:41,504
I have no interest in litigating the presidency of Maduro because I sincerely

1761
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:44,064
What's going on right now is a coup

1762
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:50,464
And Donald Trump has expressed that he recognizes as the president of Venezuela

1763
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:54,048
All options are on the table in terms of dealing with a situation

1764
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,632
This could end up being a very very serious problem

1765
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,960
Because you know who recognizes Maduro still at this point

1766
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
Russia China

1767
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:04,032
North Korea Iran

1768
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:06,336
Turkey Mexico in many other countries

1769
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,896
There's a ton of oil in Venezuela

1770
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:13,504
It's not like the world is just going to agree to disagree about who the president

1771
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:17,088
And this could very seriously blow up into a geopolitical crisis

1772
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:21,696
Now that Maduro has indicated that he's going to cut off relations with the US

1773
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:27,072
It is given notice for diplomats to return to the US

1774
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,144
Because of our schedules this week

1775
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,936
But just before we started recording

1776
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:36,032
Indications growing that Trump will not withdraw diplomat

1777
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:37,056
Because the president

1778
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,336
He recognizes didn't

1779
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,104
Ask him to

1780
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,384
This is a recipe

1781
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,920
Before an international incident

1782
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,272
He said he would withdraw there were indications that he was going to make that statement

1783
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:49,344
Right before we started recording

1784
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,672
Absolutely I mean that could Spark

1785
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,464
It's like an absolute

1786
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:57,280
I don't know what the situation is cuz

1787
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,328
For the last hour and a half

1788
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,960
What you what you see

1789
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,240
Is the recipes

1790
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,008
Before

1791
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,544
Real f******

1792
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,312
In trouble

1793
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,104
Because it's not an isolated

1794
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,920
Like I know how bad Brazilian

1795
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:17,504
Like the idea that bolsonaro is in power

1796
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,320
But it doesn't have the same wedge

1797
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:23,904
That's something like what's going on in Venezuela right now does

1798
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,184
These are both

1799
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:30,816
Absolutely South America

1800
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,864
Central America

1801
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
This is

1802
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Like this is Jeff

1803
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
You have now

1804
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,240
Trump

1805
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,264
Trudeau

1806
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,568
Also

1807
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,616
Recognize that guy do

1808
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,896
The present

1809
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
Do you have the disease

1810
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:52,576
X group of people who like that is the real president of this oil-rich country

1811
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
No

1812
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
These other people think

1813
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:57,696
Maduro still the president of this contract

1814
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
What comes

1815
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,512
What what ends up happening

1816
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,280
Is

1817
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,840
Who does the military support

1818
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,168
If it is they support

1819
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
Decided that

1820
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,240
I don't know

1821
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,032
America doesn't agree

1822
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,568
What is that tarnish

1823
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Yeah

1824
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:20,992
Potential to be a ridiculous powder-keg

1825
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:25,856
Weird conversation

1826
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
Maduro is president

1827
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,440
He has received a lot of pushback from

1828
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,976
Amlo

1829
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,536
People are stoked

1830
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,328
Then he was like maduro's present

1831
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:40,960
That wasn't a thing that everybody cool

1832
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,752
Is is one of those

1833
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,032
Things where people have

1834
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,312
Very mixed feelings

1835
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,896
And I have I have mixed feelings to like a man

1836
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,856
Nonce

1837
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:02,464
Has been the leader of the National Assembly

1838
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:06,816
But you're not supposed to win the 2018 election is Alex's presenting

1839
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,400
The Carrington that election were Maduro

1840
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,680
Prairie falcon

1841
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,472
Javier Bertucci

1842
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:16,544
Renaldo a Qui Qui Hannah

1843
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,848
And Luis Alejandro rod

1844
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:22,688
If Alex wants to make the argument that Maduro is Win was suspicious

1845
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:24,224
Fine go for it

1846
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:30,624
We can have that conversation agree I do is the rightful winner of that election

1847
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,928
Some International Aid organizations

1848
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:37,024
It demonstrates a complete lack of awareness of what's going on cuz he wasn't even in that'll

1849
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:42,144
That's nuts I was I was going to facetiously say

1850
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,936
Of course he didn't win that election

1851
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,216
He didn't even run

1852
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,776
Because I thought that would be a fun joke

1853
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Nope

1854
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,336
He didn't even run

1855
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:52,896
Okay president of the Nash

1856
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:53,664
National Assembly

1857
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,456
Like Alexa

1858
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Essentially

1859
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,296
Equivalent

1860
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,280
Military government

1861
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,048
Asthma

1862
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
President of country

1863
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:14,656
It's possible to live in a world where you have

1864
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,472
Your misgivings about how Maduro runs the country

1865
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,032
At the same time recognize that this isn't

1866
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:23,104
Democratic cool happening right in front of our eyes

1867
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,664
I certainly don't know what the right answer is

1868
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,968
But it's not

1869
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:33,600
Immediately recognize the guy who declares himself president is the rightful president of the country

1870
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:36,672
About it

1871
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:40,512
What is electrum are great idea

1872
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:44,352
He can't run in Brazil anymore he might as well become president of Venezuela

1873
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:50,496
Exact extradite Lula Venezuela what happened

1874
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:53,056
I'm not not in a month

1875
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:01,248
We're laughing for like this is very very serious

1876
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:04,576
The deposit bility

1877
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,048
Real Siri

1878
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,608
Disagreement

1879
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,144
Among world powers

1880
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,680
He's very palpable

1881
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:22,496
Because Venezuela and their oil resource

1882
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
Very important

1883
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,360
Of not just our world but everyone else

1884
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,384
So

1885
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:31,456
The idea of Turkey

1886
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,760
Recognize Maduro is the present

1887
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,040
And we

1888
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
Are starting to

1889
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,576
Tuesday like

1890
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:37,856
Gaido

1891
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,648
Where do you take that

1892
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,672
If only

1893
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,952
There were

1894
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,744
Previous historical example

1895
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:46,048
America recognize

1896
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
Somebody is

1897
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,376
Resident who wasn't democratically-elected

1898
01:39:53,984 --> 01:40:00,128
I know I know but this is happening in front of our eyes right

1899
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
It's terrifying

1900
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:03,200
So Alex

1901
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:06,784
From now for him to

1902
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,552
Do you like

1903
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Hangman

1904
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
You hate

1905
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,952
Like four

1906
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,744
You hate regime-change

1907
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,304
You hate

1908
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,096
Democratic process

1909
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,424
Respect sovereignty of countries

1910
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,704
What are you doing

1911
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,728
Like it

1912
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,032
He has no

1913
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
He's a manager

1914
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Yes no

1915
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,872
Yeah this is

1916
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,176
I don't like it

1917
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:37,504
Makes me it makes me feel really uncomfortable

1918
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
When

1919
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Somebody

1920
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
Does it like endisys

1921
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,112
This is also true

1922
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,208
To always make it clear

1923
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,256
Party affiliation

1924
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
Not

1925
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:50,816
Important

1926
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:54,144
Not in our country not to me for or any

1927
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,448
Anything like that so

1928
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:02,336
F****** abandon their principles to watch things you don't like

1929
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:05,152
Getting on board with this

1930
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:09,248
Just because you don't like doesn't mean that this is the right

1931
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:14,880
If you don't have principles and f******

1932
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:18,208
You know like just say I don't

1933
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,000
Give a f*** about what it is I put

1934
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,024
I'm to believe

1935
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,792
And I will do the

1936
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:28,448
Which as we know from all of human history

1937
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,216
Always

1938
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:29,984
He's worked out

1939
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:30,752
Great

1940
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,568
Like I don't know how better to say go f***

1941
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,128
I'm at yeah totally

1942
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,944
Making those Arkham

1943
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,480
Know that it's not good

1944
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,272
Yeah that's going to affect

1945
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,552
People in Venezuela

1946
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,368
The collateral damage

1947
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
Ends up

1948
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:50,976
Yeah but gets

1949
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,072
It's dreadfully unacceptable

1950
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:58,400
Which is great because the Venezuelan people have been doing so well

1951
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,424
So long

1952
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,008
And now it's talked about the idea that they're like eating dogs all the time

1953
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,568
There's a conversation

1954
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
We had about

1955
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:07,872
You know Hugo Chavez

1956
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:10,176
Maduro has mismanaged

1957
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,456
Resources

1958
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
Absolutely

1959
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,016
There's also a conversation

1960
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,040
We had about thanks

1961
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,832
That end in that survey

1962
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,856
How much is that

1963
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,464
Actual

1964
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:29,376
It's not as black-and-white as that wanted to be on that

1965
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144
That ND

1966
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,424
Ikea

1967
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,704
Ikea

1968
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,776
But you know what like we talked we talked about

1969
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,312
Please stop

1970
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
Government and media talks about

1971
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
And I can't

1972
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,456
Find a moral argument

1973
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
For them

1974
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,504
Do you know what I mean

1975
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:46,784
I think

1976
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:47,808
I think

1977
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,576
Yeah

1978
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,880
It's hard because ideologically I think

1979
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,672
In terms of

1980
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
Is there a

1981
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,024
It's sort of like putting someone in timeout

1982
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:59,584
But if you look at it just from like on paper

1983
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:04,448
More like more like a child

1984
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
I have is like a parent

1985
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
Acting

1986
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Terribly

1987
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
I'm putting the child in

1988
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,576
A good

1989
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:24,160
Like to wait someone some countries out of line

1990
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
Cut off the aid

1991
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,976
Yeah okay

1992
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:27,744
Freeze accounts

1993
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
And that's worth

1994
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,816
Seems like that's the right thing

1995
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,608
Time where

1996
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,936
Received that the effect

1997
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:36,960
People that your friends are

1998
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:37,984
Which would be

1999
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:39,776
Gart

2000
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,568
The people who are in power

2001
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,616
It only ends up hurting

2002
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,384
The people beneath

2003
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,432
So we should know

2004
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,200
From

2005
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:47,968
Experience

2006
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
That it does

2007
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,552
Careers that it would work

2008
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,952
Closing borders

2009
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:59,488
It seems like a good argh

2010
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:05,376
Mixers

2011
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,400
Feels like the right

2012
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,936
To do but we have enough

2013
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
The experience we have

2014
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,008
History to know that it doesn't

2015
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,032
Just hurt

2016
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
The most vulnerable

2017
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,592
Forget I agree

2018
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,664
I don't know what to do with it I don't know what the appropriate saying

2019
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:21,760
International protocol

2020
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:22,784
What problems

2021
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
Is this is still developing

2022
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:28,672
And it'll be another day before this episode is out

2023
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,208
Right

2024
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:34,304
Be things that we're on our way Road as we're recording right

2025
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,840
And so I don't I don't know

2026
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:36,608
The situation

2027
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,376
Will develop

2028
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,192
The big point is that Alex does Notre

2029
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,496
He has no idea

2030
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:43,776
He's commenting

2031
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,056
Flippant

2032
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Which seems to

2033
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,872
Adjectives

2034
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,432
It indicates initial support for gaido

2035
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,552
Inasmuch as he saying that he should have been the rightful winner of the last election

2036
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:56,576
And

2037
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:57,856
It just it's

2038
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
It's a pathetic

2039
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,648
Position

2040
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,952
Like he needs to do better

2041
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,512
I suppose needs to prepare in anyway

2042
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,656
And just

2043
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,192
Without editorial position

2044
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,472
To reveal break

2045
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,032
So like you're in the middle of your show

2046
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,312
This newsbreak

2047
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,592
UTSA

2048
01:45:19,104 --> 01:45:20,128
Here's the situation

2049
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:24,480
We'll talk about it a little bit later need to get some more details

2050
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:28,064
Or

2051
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,856
If you're someone who is starting

2052
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,928
The History of Venezuela

2053
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,976
Understand what's going on

2054
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,792
You can edit or Eli's a little bit

2055
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
But I was doing

2056
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,680
Halfway think his

2057
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:44,704
For solving

2058
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,472
Venezuela

2059
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,776
Is for America.

2060
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
To take over men

2061
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:53,920
Target Sports

2062
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:56,992
So we have one more clip Jordan

2063
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,296
Post in our group

2064
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:06,464
On Facebook, tell your mother you're brilliant they're asking

2065
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,744
Early this morning and I am

2066
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,792
Recommend

2067
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:12,352
Gravette don't do it

2068
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,632
There been a couple post

2069
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,912
Asking if

2070
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,936
Anybody has any

2071
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,752
Idea is Alex knows about our show

2072
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,824
Responses that is always kind of like a

2073
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,128
I think he probably does

2074
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,152
I think I have some

2075
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:25,920
Reason to be

2076
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,200
That he does but

2077
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:27,968
Also

2078
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,248
Anything that icing

2079
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,064
For any evidence that I have about our show

2080
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,856
Could be explained Away by

2081
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
Through the Somali pirate

2082
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:38,976
It could all be coincidence

2083
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,256
There's nothing to say

2084
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,792
Rat bite

2085
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
I think

2086
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
I don't

2087
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,632
I don't think that you live in a world where

2088
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:49,216
There are two people who have been putting out multiple episodes

2089
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:55,616
Critiquing him shoes years at least somebody who works at in

2090
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:57,152
Infowars doesn't know about

2091
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:03,552
I think that's an unrealistic especially with his penchant for finding every single space

2092
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:05,600
Pacific critic about him the deposit

2093
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:07,904
Like somebody wrote a random ass

2094
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,488
Block episodes

2095
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:17,120
Operate

2096
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:20,704
There's a lot of possibilities I can't say definitively either way

2097
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
But

2098
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,264
I think this next clip

2099
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Made me

2100
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
Gasp

2101
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,872
From that Wednesday the 23rd

2102
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,152
Because

2103
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,736
It indicates that if he listens to our show

2104
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,016
He listens

2105
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:40,416
Early in the morning like before he does his show

2106
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,952
Listen to this

2107
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,368
Are you sure

2108
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:16,256
I have not heard him talk about the who being big listeners

2109
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:22,656
Except for that episode we that we put out on Wednesday

2110
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,800
It happens again

2111
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,824
Coincidence

2112
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,432
Probably a crazy coincidence nuts man it's

2113
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,456
I like

2114
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:39,552
I like living in this fantasy world where he woke up and listen to our shows like

2115
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:43,392
Yeah but who are fans of me I remember that

2116
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,768
Are you actually smart

2117
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:50,304
Are you f****** with us

2118
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,840
I need to know

2119
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,400
Besides

2120
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,936
At least one of the members

2121
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:56,960
Of The Who

2122
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,728
Is big fat

2123
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,312
Actually there's only two members that are still alive

2124
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,640
Rodger Daltrey Pete Townshend

2125
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,920
Keith Moon

2126
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,992
Not a fan

2127
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:11,296
Hundred percent is not as

2128
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,064
Alex

2129
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,440
In 1974 Pete Townshend said that he was a capitalist but his ideals were communist

2130
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,512
In 2012 interview where he said quote

2131
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:22,560
I try to stay away from American politics

2132
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,096
Cuz I'm a bit of a neocon

2133
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,144
I like the idea of America is the world

2134
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,168
Police force

2135
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:30,240
That's not in line with Alex in anyway

2136
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:33,568
Nathan

2137
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:38,432
Communist Tendencies back in the seventies and then he grew into a neocon

2138
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,224
Very regular trajectory

2139
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:46,624
For people of that generation

2140
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:51,488
But the idea that he would become a self-avowed neocon

2141
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,280
And it expressed that

2142
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:54,816
He's not even

2143
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,584
Boxed out

2144
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,632
I think that Alex.

2145
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:00,448
Just really talking about how Rodger Daltrey didn't interview

2146
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:01,216
Endorsed

2147
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:04,544
I think that's what he's going

2148
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:09,152
Trump stupid hair

2149
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:14,784
I don't know your house in order

2150
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,320
It is not

2151
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,136
But I looked for like

2152
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
Find like some indica

2153
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,720
Where is he close to Alex

2154
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:25,280
Legitimately the only thing I can find

2155
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,096
Yeah I'm into brakes

2156
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:28,864
Because

2157
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,192
Almost

2158
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,520
He's dead though

2159
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:42,688
Cookie phone died before that this one was from literally today

2160
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:48,576
I'm just talkin about what

2161
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:54,208
What if it was dead as long as

2162
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:55,744
Turn on the radio

2163
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,512
Diving

2164
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,328
I remember his dad

2165
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:00,352
I remember when it was

2166
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,376
I will tell you this

2167
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,728
No cuz really Entwistle

2168
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:07,776
Are we going to count you as a member of The Who

2169
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,336
Like to me Keith Moon

2170
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,872
Pete Townsend The Who

2171
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,920
Adultery and I wasn't go f*** themselves

2172
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:16,992
I understand

2173
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,040
You're wrong

2174
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,880
2002

2175
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,352
Dad

2176
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:34,144
Go to bed much like

2177
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,960
JFK jr. absolute

2178
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:38,496
The Cuban on people

2179
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
That's crazy

2180
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:46,432
I know I don't think we have any

2181
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:53,344
Who's the problem with modern-day stuff

2182
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,136
Has no like ability to

2183
01:51:55,392 --> 01:52:01,536
To talk about things on the Fly things like a coup in Venezuela

2184
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,560
Being so ill-equipped

2185
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,584
Discuss them right

2186
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,864
Just one thing which

2187
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:07,680
Bundesliga

2188
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,520
You just see him doing exactly what you'd expect

2189
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:14,080
You'd expect

2190
01:52:14,848 --> 01:52:16,896
Because like before he got the news

2191
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,712
Trump it already said that he recognizes guy.

2192
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,760
So like no matter what happens

2193
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,344
She's going to side with

2194
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:27,392
Gabapentin

2195
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:29,184
Navigate from Covington of course Alex

2196
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:29,952
What is going to

2197
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:30,720
Defend

2198
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,536
It's a that everyone is just re-signed

2199
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,352
All of it is so

2200
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,632
Nonsensical and point

2201
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,912
Except

2202
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:40,704
For the piece we're now

2203
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,984
I think we understand

2204
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,264
How to spray

2205
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:50,688
And I want at least we understand

2206
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,968
2009

2207
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:56,320
Whatever the brain damage

2208
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:00,160
Is being fumigated stuff like that

2209
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
I mean who knows

2210
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,000
If it's too vague

2211
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
Sweet meaningful

2212
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:07,072
This I think is more real

2213
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,608
And so I would like

2214
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:10,656
B b conversation on Facebook

2215
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:13,472
If you're if you're there it go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

2216
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:17,568
Let us know like I want to know what the audience think about

2217
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,616
Does that bring an element

2218
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:20,896
Toothache

2219
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:21,920
Where is ugly

2220
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,992
Yeah

2221
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,272
I don't know where to land on

2222
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:28,064
Ben and I do

2223
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:28,832
Value

2224
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,112
Our listeners

2225
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:37,280
But I would like to

2226
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,912
Also Alex

2227
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,216
Different Siri

2228
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,520
Alex has

2229
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,800
Created seven horcruxes

2230
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,408
Alright now we know that the way to create a horcrux

2231
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,176
Is 2

2232
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,456
Because that splits your

2233
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,224
Your soul apart

2234
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,040
According to

2235
01:53:59,296 --> 01:53:59,808
JK Rowling

2236
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:00,576
Just getting robbed

2237
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,160
And we know that he is killed in the past

2238
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,696
Dogs

2239
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:06,976
Humans

2240
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,256
All of these

2241
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,584
The split is so left

2242
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
Too many times

2243
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,144
He can't even breathe

2244
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,448
Everybody knows

2245
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:21,312
Sleep apnea

2246
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,920
Scientific

2247
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,968
It's good to know that there was a little bit of

2248
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,552
Sleep apnea self lock in there that I that I missed out on

2249
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:35,904
I don't know I just wish I would like peoples into it because I can't do this on my own

2250
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,696
I can't find my moral Center

2251
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:40,256
Because if I did I would say we can't talk about it

2252
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,280
Open the present

2253
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,304
I would just say

2254
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,096
Like if left to my own devices

2255
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,168
Yeah

2256
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,240
No but I don't think

2257
01:54:55,616 --> 01:55:01,760
Do you want to be like keep making fun of a

2258
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,832
That is not true

2259
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,136
I don't like to I don't punch down

2260
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:13,280
I need the conversation really is our Rapunzel

2261
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
Exact

2262
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,864
It's hard to know

2263
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:17,632
If that's the case

2264
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,448
We can see what the

2265
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,984
The expected impairment

2266
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,008
From the condition

2267
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:27,616
And you can fit a lot of it is the part that make

2268
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:28,896
29

2269
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:35,296
18 episodes of Alex listening to me freaks out and do stuff that's f****** stupid

2270
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:38,368
All just beat

2271
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,392
Points of

2272
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
His

2273
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:45,536
Like the rest of the stuff is all

2274
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,072
Boring wrote

2275
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,608
He doesn't know

2276
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,656
That's not a good show

2277
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:55,008
For us from talking about the stuff

2278
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
Is almost

2279
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
Clearly

2280
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,104
Deficiency

2281
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,384
Glutamine

2282
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,408
Excessive

2283
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:06,272
Put ourselves in a box

2284
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,344
You know but that that ass

2285
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,696
Which is

2286
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,744
Outside media

2287
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,280
Affect

2288
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
Whether or not

2289
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,632
Has a heart attack

2290
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,400
Tomorrow

2291
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,448
And six months from now he's back

2292
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,544
You can clearly see that the heart attack

2293
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:32,640
But he still has 10 million viewers a night

2294
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:36,224
I honestly don't think that measures into my

2295
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,016
Where I'm coming from

2296
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
Is just

2297
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:39,808
Human level

2298
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:40,832
Yeah

2299
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,880
And maybe it's because like I said

2300
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:44,416
Think that a large part of

2301
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,952
Where I'm coming from my hyper

2302
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:48,256
Comes from

2303
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,792
When I was in college

2304
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:51,072
Professor

2305
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:56,960
I remember yeah

2306
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,496
And he'd show videos

2307
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,032
Class

2308
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,312
In the like mid-80

2309
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,848
He was just

2310
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,664
Everything was totally

2311
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,200
Define

2312
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:08,224
Lecture

2313
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,248
Was just

2314
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:11,040
He couldn't communicate

2315
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:11,808
Anymore because

2316
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:15,904
That stroke and there were people in that class that would laugh at him

2317
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,208
Fond of him as a lecturer

2318
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:21,536
Add ideas

2319
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,352
I get that he's bad at doing his job

2320
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,376
Which is

2321
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:26,144
To give a lecture

2322
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,424
Cause of

2323
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
Yeah

2324
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,824
And I always got very very mad

2325
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848
People who didn't

2326
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,384
Understand that

2327
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
Prices

2328
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,296
I look at it

2329
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:45,088
Look at Alex in the same way

2330
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:47,392
I look at this like

2331
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:50,976
Whenever we talk about these hypothetical brain damage

2332
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
Which type thing

2333
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,024
They haven't been is conch

2334
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,072
Like the idea of you

2335
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:56,096
Express

2336
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:57,120
Sleep sitting up

2337
01:57:57,632 --> 01:57:58,144
CPAP machine

2338
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
Don't work

2339
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,448
Yeah whatever

2340
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,472
We need surgery

2341
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:02,752
What is thick ass neck

2342
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:04,288
I mean

2343
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:15,296
I don't know I don't want this out

2344
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,024
Moral relativism is fine

2345
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,048
It interested

2346
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,072
We're just going to keep

2347
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:28,352
Keep expressing that we don't know

2348
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:29,888

2349
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:30,912

I relapsed a brand

2362
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:27,488
That's correct

2363
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,048
But

2364
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,096
You are listening and you'd like a butt

2365
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,912

Not thrilled to sex

2376
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:27,648
You just picked out of everybody who's ever lived Earth on Rockstar life probably kill somebody

2377
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:32,256
I don't know I've never heard any evidence

2378
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,536
But Rodger Daltrey is killed by

2379
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,912
That he has technically probably killed

2380
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,384
