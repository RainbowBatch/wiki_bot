00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,792
I forgot

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
We're so out of practice

4
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
We have a couple days off and I forgot the pizza

5
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,224
And annoying

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,088
Absurdly long

7
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
But I'm thrilled

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,000
Transaction not appreciate that unfortunately

9
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,144
I got an awesome time frame

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
25th

11
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
2009

12
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,008
Chunk and Alex Jones is broadcasting

13
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
Career

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
There's some stuff

15
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,592
Blow your mind

16
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
There's some stuff that blew my mind

17
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,944
There's some stuff that should never have happened

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
Really quick what you're about to witness what you're about to

19
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,552
Secure is

20
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,832
Evidence

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
2009

22
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
May have been the zenith

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Alex Jones is mainstream

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
Any plays out in some ways that I don't

25
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Any of us could have ever predicted

26
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,608
And I think

27
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
He still thinks

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
He's there

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
I think in 2018

30
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
I'm dancing around just a little bit it'll all make sense I was going to say is this

31
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:57,248
Whenever kylo Ren murders Harrison

32
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
No no

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,904
This is a salad.

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
Looking back

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Halcyon Days of Alex Jones being relevant

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
To a certain extent

37
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
I feel like he's more relevant now and less

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
Even

39
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
Alright Jesse's wife

40
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,944
I want people to get excited for

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,832
Something really profoundly sucked out something to talk about

42
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
It messed up our new donors

43
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
What's going on

44
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:49,216
The gentleman

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:52,032
I'm not sure if I should

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Even bring that up

47
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
I appreciate it

48
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,368
Means a lot

49
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
Thank you so much

50
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,512
Defensive like

51
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:19,168
Yeah that's right you are going to donate to our show.

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,360
Not at all

53
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Absolutely

54
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Appreciate it

55
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:44,000
This is a new level of

56
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
For now we have

57
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
Foreign policy global

58
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Technocrat

59
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
I don't understand why we have any of these levels

60
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
Our next episode

61
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
We have a brand new level

62
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
They were going to

63
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
To be revealing I'm not going to be turning into some Dragon Ball Z

64
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:12,416
We get somebody all the sudden there's Super Saiyan level 3 word what's going on

65
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,256
Necessitate

66
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
And one of those circumstances happened this week

67
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,911
Brian

68
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Posted in our Facebook group

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
Magazine

70
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
On eBay and listener

71
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Jumperoo

72
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
Bought them and got them sent to my house so I have an entire collection of info

73
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
2013-13

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,423
Christy

75
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:06,175
I've got one of them entirely

76
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,295
Library

77
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
I'll be creating about Alex Jones

78
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Which is the

79
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,695
Memorial Library of potion and lies

80
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,487
I have names like Egan

81
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,279
They're excited about that but

82
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
I had to say

83
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
Terrible writing

84
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
It's terrible writing

85
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
Buttman the graph

86
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Design work

87
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,407
He's on point I don't know who's doing this graphic design but

88
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
Lick man it looks

89
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,015
Good I'm going to post a pictures of it but like

90
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
There's some

91
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,183
So

92
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,071
Miles above that really just blew my mind

93
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:00,191
I'll post a picture of it on our website

94
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
Videos of meteor

95
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,431
There's a volcano going off

96
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,759
This is great graphic design work that's pretty good

97
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
If I grabbing

98
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Any whites

99
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
I appreciate it so much

100
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,671
Thank you all and everybody out there

101
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
The new level the Keegan his achieve

102
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:31,423
Hey we would be doing that right now but I forgot to make the battle happen

103
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:39,103
Specifically chose as an eerie resemblance to our poster where the volcanoes in the background and I could

104
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,175
Definitely see you're tackling Alex Jones because I'm about

105
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,455
Yeah yeah

106
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
For sure

107
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
Anyway

108
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
Alex Jones

109
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
But my love of talk about bulshit his not

110
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,799
Rectifier by Fred

111
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
2004

112
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,127
And it's really interesting that if you look at

113
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
The history of the Tea Party

114
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
Yes one of the things going

115
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:17,759
This is what we're looking at

116
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
As we go

117
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
2009

118
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,391
If you look at it it all grew basically out of

119
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Foundation

120
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Freedomworks

121
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,743
Americans for Prosperity

122
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
They funded a bunch of

123
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
Glenn Beck they basically bolster him today

124
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,655
Irrelevant

125
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
Sponsors

126
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,055
So I love it

127
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
I love whenever a small amount of billionaires control all the finances

128
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,295
Americans for Prosperity

129
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
That were on

130
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
Split

131
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
A group that was founded by David Koch

132
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Charles Koch

133
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,559
The 1984

134
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Now

135
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,935
Do you know who the first chairperson

136
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,959
Of the

137
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
For a sound economy would

138
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:15,103
When they founded it in 1984 Oliver North

139
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,431
Interesting

140
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,759
Why not

141
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:25,855
And so at this point in 2009 January 22nd

142
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,391
2 days before

143
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,951
Trevor Leach

144
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,975
Who is the chairman

145
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
The Young Americans

146
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,023
For Liberty which was a group

147
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,327
Actually named if he is a young American

148
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:38,399
Anna young conservative

149
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,983
F****** play easy chairman of the Young Americans for Liberty

150
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,799
What is a group that sprung out of Ron Paul's failed presidential

151
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
He organized

152
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,943
Tea party to protest

153
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Bo Beastie taxes

154
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
The governor of New York

155
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,319
I put in place

156
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,975
Can't buy large 24

157
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
Kickoff

158
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Of what would end up becoming the

159
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,351
These.

160
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:14,239
Copycat but a lot of it is also a interconnected

161
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,335
To describe these people is

162
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
Akin to the serial killer or kidnapper

163
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,967
Meyer's book

164
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:27,295
I'm not sure if she cleaned it but that book dark money they talk about it is

165
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,879
The code to put the coax

166
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,183
With their

167
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Directions

168
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
To put space metaphor for Goldman Sachs

169
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Good luck

170
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,447
Metaphor

171
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
Everyone knows visually what an octopus is the word octopus

172
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Work you can put in a lot of

173
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:59,551
All right we got

174
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,111
Is chicken the same family

175
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
You got it

176
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:09,535
All of these other white

177
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,639
A lot of this is because

178
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,223
Something happened the way it starts out the show on January 22nd

179
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Makes me feel

180
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
He's not aware

181
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Of a lot of those forces that are at play

182
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,647
The funding

183
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,671
Adecco card

184
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,535
Is already in the works

185
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,839
And it's getting ready to Bubble over

186
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
Is it the end of the formal

187
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,679
The protest

188
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
That went like a larger

189
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
February

190
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
I am in the month after that but not Fox News

191
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,127
Started covering it and all that s***

192
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,223
It is it is like

193
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
A little bit under the surface

194
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,551
Even to someone like

195
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,111
Best friends with Ron Paul

196
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
The leader of the Liberty

197
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
Right it's important because

198
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Listen to this clip

199
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
It shows a lack of

200
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,095
Of forces at play

201
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
Both parties

202
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Jones

203
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
I don't even know what that

204
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
I do

205
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
But no one is talking or discussing the fact

206
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
Pub

207
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Racist

208
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:32,639
So in the next two to three weeks they're going to collapse

209
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Prediction didn't

210
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
New always been right

211
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
Even he knows

212
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,951
Is Fox News is talking like that

213
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:52,351
Even he is aware of that like

214
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
They know there's no steak

215
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
Also he doesn't

216
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Seem to realize is that like

217
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
His rhetoric

218
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Being co-opted for

219
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Specific reason

220
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
Because they don't want him involved

221
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
But they want

222
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,783
What is to be a piece of this artificial

223
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
AstroTurf movement

224
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
So

225
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
It's tough cuz this is another moment where you can almost sense

226
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
Feel left behind

227
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,511
Like he sees his buddy

228
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:23,071
Ron Paul going on

229
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:29,471
I'm saying the things that I like to talk about

230
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
This is the best movie

231
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:41,503
Because once again as we've proven and as we William

232
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:48,159
Every episode

233
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,583
Veronica

234
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
You never gave up the game

235
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:04,543
Give It Up

236
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,151
I don't know much about Glenn Beck

237
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,623
Glenn Beck comes from like his Mormonism and stuff like that

238
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Shock jock

239
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
That's really invalidates all of his

240
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:28,095
Theatricality and fake crying and stuff like that

241
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Cuz at least like there is

242
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,727
I think there's an argument someone could make and I wouldn't hit him

243
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,799
Like Alex really believe the things you say

244
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,991
Yeah I mean like if someone told me that you said Glenn Beck really believe the things he saying I would hit them

245
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Sudbury

246
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Conversation about it

247
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Because

248
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
Heathens

249
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
There's there's so much

250
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Craft

251
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
To Glenn Beck

252
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Career

253
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
In terms of like

254
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
A

255
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Fake

256
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Low-rent Howard Stern

257
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,919
Prank calls on the morning show

258
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,183
Fox News and then they are

259
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Who is about

260
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
The old time

261
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,255
Isn't folks Enos

262
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,375
A little bit of Garrison Keillor a little bit of like Pat Robertson

263
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
A little bit of Rush Limbaugh

264
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Is an artificial creation

265
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
Very easy to see through

266
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
Remember him

267
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,943
About 9:12

268
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,783
He should f****** die

269
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,343
Remember how we felt on 9/12

270
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
I want to murder you

271
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,999
512

272
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Hey you know what I don't like

273
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,167
Think about how you were on 912 I would hit that

274
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
Get that s*** out of your

275
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:12,799
Don't know really fun fun little piece of information

9

278
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:22,271
Statements and 12 principles

279
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
Publication like about these

280
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,159
Steve informations in 12

281
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
Principles or something like that

282
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:36,351
I was like what our movement stands for America

283
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,751
Buy coke money

284
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:46,847
Don't deserve this planet

285
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
Or whatever

286
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
Attributes

287
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:56,063
Already already

288
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Completely crib

289
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,391
From a book by W Cleon skousen

290
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,207
No that's

291
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
His uncle

292
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:09,631
Joel skousen who's on the show his uncle is W Cleon skousen was a member of the John

293
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,263
Society is mostly responsible from everything I've been able to tell

294
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
For a lot of

295
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,335
Active misrepresentation

296
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
People live cam

297
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:27,039
Where can I get more in-depth in the future episode I have a couple

298
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,111
Episodes we're going to do

299
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
I'm preparing those right now

300
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,439
So don't need to do that

301
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,975
It's interesting to see the

302
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
This lineage of

303
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,559
Montebello

304
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:41,119
Uncle book that he wrote is

305
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,935
Responsible for Glenn Beck 912

306
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,959
To become more lies

307
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,983
Exactly

308
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,055
Allconnect

309
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,383
Here's another clip I guess

310
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,151
About

311
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Jokes

312
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,991
Tea Party

313
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Does misrepresentation

314
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
Presentation of

315
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
Becca said

316
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Vanity

317
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Fairly recent

318
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,567
Stop.

319
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,367
What like

320
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,791
The truth

321
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
And their CEOs and people

322
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
That's

323
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,775
Absurd

324
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Absurd explanation

325
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,847
What's happening

326
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,943
I don't think any Media company has ever accounted for like

327
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
Oh well if we don't tell the truth we're going to lose a lot of list

328
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,623
About that

329
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,415
Alright so

330
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,999
Here on the 22nd

331
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
You know what you know

332
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
You don't want to my favor

333
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,847
Commercials that he had back then never not going to love me some random

334
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
You don't have a diamond gusset commercial 2009

335
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,783
Sponsor that I've never heard of before

336
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
And it's a scam to help you get better memory

337
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
The school of phenomenal memory

338
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Information quickly

339
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
And efficiently

340
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
You need to exercise

341
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
Exercise mental

342
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
Improve your memory

343
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
The school of phenomenal memory will a

344
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Is your person

345
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,567
One completed

346
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,847
You'll be able to memorize

347
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,407
Information

348
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Guarantee

349
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Hypnotic techniques

350
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Or other tricks that you said

351
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Valerie asked you why you think I don't trust that commercial

352
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,463
Well

353
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
School of phenomenal memory already seems a little bit over salad

354
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,727
Also misspelled or mispronouncing demonic

355
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
That's what they were to namik

356
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,615
Did you take Manama Cannon there

357
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,943
Different companies that made it to air

358
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
He mispronounced mnemonic

359
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,575
Baby did you forget that maybe you need to take the six

360
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
E-courses again

361
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,463
Monadic Menomonie yep that's crazy

362
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,559
60 lessons and then you will be able to memorize entire books

363
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,471
I don't know but I think that's a pretty absurd

364
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615
Some pop psychology bulshit quite like that

365
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
I'm so undershirt

366
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,479
Our old buddy

367
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
The guy who's

368
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:12,319
Himself Hellyeah bobcat

369
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:18,976
Comes back Bobby chaps and I started to really enjoy Bob Chapman

370
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
Man voice

371
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,560
And very much unlike Tracy Chapman

372
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,096
Is completely

373
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Absurd fear-mongering

374
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,424
On this episode Alex

375
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Havoc

376
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
Pacific point

377
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:29,984
And bring him on

378
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,008
Use for him

379
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,848
But I think you'll be able to figure out exactly what's up

380
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:43,040
For Staples the rich guitar Ridge How It Go

381
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,440
Arabic

382
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
Retired for two years kennel

383
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,056
Former world

384
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
For 30 years

385
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,008
Is there a snow

386
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,056
Explanation

387
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
The fact that you

388
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Be able to stay out of

389
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Financial Harm's Way

390
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:51,136
Come with me if you want to live cuz I also enjoy the title

391
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,744
Alex Jones arguing with song lyrics

392
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
No this song is incorrect

393
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
How did know

394
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,520
Alpha flight

395
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,128
You can see the game real pretty clearly right there

396
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,920
Baba

397
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
Talk about like how the economy is going to collapse

398
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,088
Buy gold

399
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,672
I mean unless you want to survive the coming apocalypse

400
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:31,840
I know there really isn't the reason but

401
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
The table more or less

402
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,104
Right after this clip Ted comes on talk about his British sovereign

403
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
Lady Sovereign

404
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:48,224
Shut up

405
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,808
Shut up

406
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
Anytime I take a shot

407
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
Anytime I f****** go for it and just look at me weird or give me naked appointment

408
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,400
Look at you

409
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,752
There's a little weird that was. That was just as I read and I wrote

410
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,288
You say that is not a weird.

411
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:17,152
Incredulous open already

412
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
Fair enough

413
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
That's a fun game

414
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,600
Little bit like

415
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,184
Chair sales pitch like

416
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:35,840

420
00:24:54,272 --> 00:25:00,416
Hard Sell

421
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,464
Playing out there

422
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,096
I don't know what else to say about it but like if you're

423
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:14,240
But if you're listening you don't understand what they're doing

424
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:18,848
You poor girl

425
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Is that there's a lot of like old people

426
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,176
The same people who fix

427
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Thumbs up

428
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,968
VC who don't

429
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
Understand what's going on

430
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
And they're the ones that got ripped off

431
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,392
Anyway your prosperity

432
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:34,464
Built entirely upon the backs of TT

433
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
For sure

434
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
August 22nd we're going to days

435
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
To Barack Obama's

436
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:45,472
Does inauguration man-o-man

437
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:46,752
The stars are out

438
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Haha

439
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
Alex Jones on the 22nd

440
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Joe Rogan is

441
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:57,760
So do we get to hear a little bit of Joe Rogan is like

442
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:02,880
Joe Freeman

443
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:07,744
Being sweet and dumb I don't know Eddie Bravo was like a media figure in

444
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
In 2009

445
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,376
I don't know their history but I've had him and Joe were friends

446
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,216
2009

447
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,240
I don't know if

448
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Anyone

449
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,312
Cared about how stupid he was

450
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,872
Or how Charming he was

451
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:29,248
That's what Joe Rogan is in town he's in Austin and so he comes into Infowars Studios

452
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,088
And through it we kind of realize that Alex and Rogan have

453
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
Exactly one story together

454
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
That makes their French

455
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,584
Ladies and gentlemen

456
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,144
Microphone

457
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Important

458
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
Are you

459
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
We met in 99

460
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:21,216
Remember when when when

461
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
George W bush Mass

462
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:27,104
Silhouette

463
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
Running around the grounds of the Capitol building

464
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:38,368
That's the only story they really had it up like twice

465
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:44,000
On this episode and brought it up on when he was on Rogan podcast

466
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,096
So they wore ex-presidents vast and did not rob

467
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,448
You can find the video of it it's on YouTube it's swelled up

468
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
It's just I'm running around in masks and then smoking weed in the bathroom

469
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:58,848
It's not

470
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,736
Shenanigans Charming on detail of Alex Jones

471
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
It would be like if you and I were friends

472
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
For 10 years

473
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,624
And the only story that we had was

474
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,928
That time that we did shows in The Burbs

475
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
And had a great time

476
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,608
Like if you remember the time that we got on air together it was

477
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
That came up

478
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,704
I mean it would be like oh you're trying to really

479
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
Reinforce that your friends

480
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Figure.

481
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:32,384
Well it's kind of spread

482
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
You think we're fresh

483
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,760
I know we're not really friends

484
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
But

485
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
You're so

486
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,880
There's a slight imbalance

487
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,072
Exploded

488
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Music

489
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,632
Use a

490
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,168
In-demand stand-up

491
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,824
Newsradio

492
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Because we talked about it

493
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,576
A little bit about being

494
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,720
And it's because of that now I got to really appreciate like

495
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:25,120
Craft of creating like a good television show so makes it hard to do another one

496
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:34,848
Goofy game show in others not really supposed to be a cop

497
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,016
It never happens

498
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
Your backups.

499
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
So the connection cut out the government

500
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
Well I'm a far less threatening than any of those gentlemen

501
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
About me I had comedian

502
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,224
Those kind of making fun of Alex

503
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,344
Little little

504
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,744
New World Order imater scary event

505
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,584
Cliffview Resort of making a

506
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,376
They're doing an impression

507
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
2 m

508
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,216
You know Rogan not

509
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
Totally

510
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Not into

511
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
Some of the things that Alex

512
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
Shazam 2

513
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,664
She is about Ron Paul

514
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,248
First off

515
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:53,184
Restructuring of our government

516
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,168
I mean

517
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,520
He's a real conservative

518
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
A fiscal conservative a social conservative

519
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
The federal government is completely out of control that is

520
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,392
It's a flawed Institution

521
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
He believes have to get rid of the Federal Reserve

522
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,312
I mean if you look at the way it is now

523
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,848
This is a honeycomb

524
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:47,968
Option and

525
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,552
Sure whatever you responding today

526
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
I can't even now I can't even remember what

527
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:57,184
Man just

528
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,864
F*** is he talkin about whatever he's like everybody knows

529
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,680
Good idea to get rid of the IRS2Go

530
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,984
Everybody everybody doesn't know that

531
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,896
It's easy to get seduced into Ron Paul's line of thing

532
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
Because he is very sensible.

533
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,968
Foreign entanglements

534
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
Stuff like that

535
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Drug policy

536
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
I'm so if you're someone like even like private prisons

537
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Here again

538
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,952
To like someone like Joe Rogan

539
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
Weed all the time and

540
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,816
Generally inclined towards pacifism

541
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,840
Like

542
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
Rich

543
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,424
Yeah except

544
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,008
Travolta be abolished the FED in the IRS cut

545
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,360
One of his biggest bike rally

546
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
Comprise the goes around is

547
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,712
Federal Reserve

548
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Check if this is

549
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
This is sort of a misconception

550
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Playing on people's

551
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,880
Unawareness of what actually goes on

552
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,696
Yeah cuz you can go to the federal reserve's website

553
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,976
And audit

554
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
Does the Federal Reserve ever get audited

555
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,584
Yes

556
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
.

557
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:12,192
The the Board of Governors

The 12 federal reserve banks at the Federal Reserve sis

559
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,056
System as a whole are all subject to several levels of auditing

560
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:18,336
1

561
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,432
The government accountability office conducted numerous reviews Federal Reserve activities every

562
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,736
To the board's financial statements and

563

Compliance with laws and regulations affect

The results of this

567

Independent auditor released

574
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,472
Nations related to programs and operations of the board

575
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,544
As well as those boards delegated to the reserve back

576
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,664
Some of the reserve banks are also audited annually by

577
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Independent outside auditor

578
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,040
Each week the Federal Reserve publishes its balance sheet

579
00:33:59,296 --> 00:33:59,808
Charts of

580
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,344
Recent balance sheet track

581
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,624
It also provides a

582
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,672
Interactive

583
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,696
The balance sheet is

584
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
Including the Federal reserve's h-41

585
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Statistic release

586
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,352
Affecting Reserve balances of depository in

587
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,120
Institutions

588
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,704
Statement of the Federal Reserve Bank

589
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Clearly fake

590
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
Has just about their balance

591
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,040
Team doing making it up

592
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
I don't

593
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:36,416
White understand where the line is drawn between V like

594
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
Rallying cry to audit the Fed

595
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,000
And the reality of what is

596
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
You've done

597
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
Do you know like what is

598
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,608
Not being done that they want done

599
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,376
Call Oliver

600
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,656
Okay great

601
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:52,544
What do you want you think the answer is

602
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,336
You bring that stuff another like

603
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Yeah

604
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:00,480
No matter what do you think isn't being audited

605
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
It is unsatisfactory

606
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,184
Same thing that same bulshit from Rogan that stupid

607
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:13,024
Is always like oh well it's a it's a

608
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
The complicated

609
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
This was like

610
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,656
Yeah cuz it's a f****** insanely complicated complicated sis

611
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
Unlike a one-word

612
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:33,760
Like with those men in the middle or liquid

613
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:40,160
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

614
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Shouldn't be

615
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
Because according to the law

616
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:49,376
It is the outgoing director who can appoint his follower

617
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,912
In the interim or whatever

618
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
Right

619
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,240
This is base to The Reason

620
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:56,544
Challenge is it based on

621
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,336
Law that was written that

622
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,640
Kind of says that that supersedes with

623
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
The president appoint

624
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
It's the difference between the life

625
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,552
Should or could

626
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:13,952
Fire log

627
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
Actually said was

628
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
Could

629
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
Like there's no way you can write perfect bulshit on there

630
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
Wyatt becomes Hokage

631
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
That sort of semantic breakdown

632
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
So

633
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
What are the other reason

634
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,640
Three sort of frustrated with Joe is that

635
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:38,016
As we as we saw in the beginning 2017 when Alex was on

636
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Rogan's podcast

637
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
Chief complaint

638
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
I had was

639
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
Rogan Woods

640
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Something

641
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
Maybe challenging or like a question per hour

642
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,864
Alex Wood

643
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,936
Yeah that's right

644
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:00,544
Repeatedly and also Joe talking about

645
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
Working

646
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
For the u.s.

647
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:06,688
Collegial interview

648
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,784
Rogan's career need to listen to

649
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,112
Ears Alex saying that Obama is

650
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Going to be worse than Hitler

651
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:30,752
Bush was bad

652
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
I know it

653
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,592
Aaron is just accepted

654
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:42,784
And now you know he's got the spoiler is that

655
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
Behind the scenes

656
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
Right now

657
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,136
In January 2009

658
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
Alex

659
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Editing

660
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
Producing his Obama

661
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Deception docket

662
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,072
He's already

663
00:37:55,328 --> 00:38:01,472
The quick turnaround time South Park episode later on I don't think it's on the episodes of recovering he gives

664
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
The release date of it

665
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,360
He's rushing Vistaprint

666
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,664
Okay basically all right

667
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Do you understand

668
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:17,600
Painting Obama in a really negative dictatorial light only serves your interests

669
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:20,160
I'm selling this documentary that you're creating

670
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
That's what you're doing

671
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,048
Okay

672
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,584
Documentary money

673
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,704
I'm guessing they definitely wouldn't have although I would almost like to live in an alternate his

674
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,008
Street where we get to mccain-palin

675
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
Ception

676
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
11th hadn't happened I doubt that

677
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Well certainly.

678
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,368
But I bet that Alex wouldn't have made any documentaries that were

679
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,160
Harshly critical of bush

680
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,464
I mean we can't rewrite this

681
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
We're going to have to develop a niche

682
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
Interdimensional travel

683
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
Perhaps contacts

684
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,704
In Vacaville prison

685
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Call call Mark

686
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Abso

687
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,848
Despite Alex

688
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:14,688
Who knows what his motivation

689
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,016
His motivation maybe Pyar me his motivation

690
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,320
He's trying to

691
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
To fix the defect or

692
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,280
What's the time

693
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,328
New World Order

694
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:39,264
Well do you think a new world order that I mean like a new order to the World hours today

695
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,872
New world cattle-raising starts

696
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,480
What is a set

697
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,112
One World Government

698
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
What a good idea

699
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,072
A little bit not pushing back

700
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
You should have said what are you talkin about when they say New World Order memes a global government

701
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Ocala Post

702
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
Good question

703
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,128
Is it possible they just mean a new

704
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:20,736
Way that the world will be ordered in the world

705
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,040
Especially considering the fact

706
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,368
Mere moments ago

707
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,904
He was grieving

708
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,952
To get rid of all of this

709
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:42,752
Old World Order

710
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:46,336
Premature for me to bring this up but like I've been reading Carol quickly

711
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,384
Tragedy

712
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:53,248
Misrepresentation

713
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,576
That's not what I was writing about

714
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
So much

715
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
The focus of people like the author

716
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,768
School of economics

717
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:08,096
Lamesa Institute which are big parts of Alex Jones's

718
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,400
Philosophical underpinnings

719
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,424
Desire to get back

720
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Gold stand

721
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
Desire to go back to

722
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
Dupree 1914 economics

723
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Which is when the Federal Reserve

724
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
What I remember.

725
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,224
It was wonderful

726
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,784
But what's interesting is

727
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:32,160
The internal Quickly's book if you look at he does talk about how there's a network of bankers

728
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,184
Some stuff that we're trying to

729
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:36,512
Manipulate settings after World War 1

730
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,608
What cuz that just makes good Financial

731
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,912
What Alex never takes

732
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Come to a cow and never really disgusted

733
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Is that

734
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
Their goal

735
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Stanford

736
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:58,783
Donuts in my headband

737
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
These the protocol herbalist

738
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,135
Yeah it's Alex's is taking

739
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:10,559
The people that Carol quickly wrote about the beginning of the interconnected

740
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
They have the exact same goals as the message

741
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,679
Well yeah but that's cuz we all know they were

742
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
Correct right

743
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
I don't know what to think about that but

744
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,615
Everyone polish

745
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,151
Evil

746
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,199
Even in the service of

747
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,759
A good idea okay

748
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
So these globulus

749
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,831
Their coop.

750
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:35,391
The get back to the gold standard argument

751
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
In order to

752
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:41,023
Further cement their power

753
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
If that word

754
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,399
If we were to go to the gold standard and they would be able to submit

755
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:49,215
Their power

756
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,287
Standards in order to keep them from doing that.

757
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,311
It's too loud

758
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,615
Thanks so much that's good

759
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,431
So

760
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,527
I remember

761
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
Do whatever your enemy.

762
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:11,231
The right the same thing

763
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:19,167
Mister Rogan leaves

764
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,215
We don't have Eclipse but it's worth bringing up

765
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,751
Austin Police

766
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Okay yes going every now and again back then

767
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,383
Really

768
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:36,063
Because already savedo does an impression of Alex to his face also

769
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
You hear a kind of thing

770
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
Because he believes

771
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:43,231
She believes in Community Connection

772
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:48,351
Stuff like that makes it a priority to go around like I looked into him and like

773
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
As much as

774
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
You can ever like

775
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,167
Stop

776
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,703
Kind of like a lot of

777
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,471
The stuff that he seems

778
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,031
To be about seems like a good dude it seems like

779
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:02,431
I don't know enough to give him a rubber stamp

780
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,711
Mayor or not

781
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
UNLV police chief

782
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:09,343
Houston came over in like 2016 from Austin to Houston

783
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,647
To work on that department

784
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,719
And during Hurricane Harvey he was f******

785
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,511
Out there with his people

786
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,815
Elderly people from building

787
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
Huey like

788
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:26,751
He had this whole thing where you didn't trust the electronic and automated gauges that would tell him where there was danger zone

789
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
You got all the people out

790
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
Monitoring particularly

791
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,383
Vulnerable sites for flooding

792
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,967
Where they're old people and disabled people there that would need help

793
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,735
Music

794
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,343
Proactively trying to make sure that the damage would be as low as possible

795
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,159
And that's one of the major reasons that cited for why

796
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,183
The death count wasn't

797
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
Is because of his

798
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,279
Really active

799
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
Really engaged

800
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Approach

801
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
Alright so we did some heroic ass s***

802
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,471
Well yeah I would say so and it falls in line with

803
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
The philosophy that he espouses

804
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
For policing

805
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,799
With

806
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:01,823
On Alex's

807
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,127
The show and interviews that I've read with him son

808
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
That is like

809
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
You're going to make much better work

810
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
You get out there murder

811
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,623
There's also has a very strong position of

812
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
Keeping his

813
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Officers

814
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,719
Accountable for their actions

815
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Trying to make

816
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,327
Body cameras automatically turn on as opposed to

817
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:26,143
IOU

818
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:31,775
Getaround s*** could never imagine get around that

819
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,871
I think he's pretty cool seems pretty on the level

820
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,503
Further review answer the two of them have a fine again

821
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,807
Does jovial conversation with each other and

822
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:48,415
Alex keeps trying to bring up that lady who got arrested

823
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:51,999
Spelling of Bloody Mary on an airplane

824
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
I don't know that story I've ever you have to send it

825
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:57,631
It was just that over and over again, I thought I'd no idea

826
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,727
What do you mean you can't comment on something you know.

827
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,567
We move on now

828
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,895
And it's just this on the 25th

829
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
August 24th is a Saturday

830
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,735
On the 23rd

831
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,759
We get

832
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,319
My voice went weird.

833
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,647
We get a little glimpse

834
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,183
Intuit Alex Jones's Finance

835
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Does look like back in

836
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:22,975
2009

837
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
So we're going to be

838
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Truck show

839
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,551
Worrying about can I get a microphone can I get a camera

840
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,279
Sodus Point

841
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
Concerned about buying a Michael

842
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Yeah

843
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Van Dyke

844
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,631
I mean I don't know

845
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,423
I don't know

846
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
Look like a good mic

847
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
Couldn't be more than like

848
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Thousand dollars

849
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
So the idea that he has to

850
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,663
Concerned about $1,000

851
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
It gives you a sense of the operation

852
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,479
But he's running

853
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Now

854
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
The same time

855
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:25,951
Important to get the highest quality for your lowest dollar that make sense

856
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:32,351
95 bucks

857
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
It isn't necessarily the top-of-the-line

858
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
Absolutely

859
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
You could very easily

860
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,983
He talked about I don't have 500

861
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Snapshot

862
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
January 20th

863
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,895
2009 that's where Alex's finances are at

864
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:51,295
I'm inclined to believe it's the prior though

865
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,159
Well we're not in trouble

866
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,231
Which in Alex Jones pilot who'd never

867
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:03,071
No I think it but I think I took

868
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,095
Sincere

869
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Lakers

870
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,655
She's asking for money

871
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
If he's wanting money

872
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
We are in trouble

873
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751
Is the way to get it

874
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,311
Can you make the situation much more dire

875
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,919
Him saying we're not in trouble means like

876
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:23,295
We can use your money but you know I'm not going to f****** be manipulative about it

877
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,111
With my gold

878
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:30,207
So Jordan mysteriously told you at the top of the show

879
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,023
This is the Pinnacle of Alex Jones

880
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Relevant

881
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:39,679
Interview with with Joe Rogan

882
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Yes celebrity Joe Rogan

883
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:41,983
Pixel

884
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:46,847
I could tell I was looking down

885
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,663
Do you also have you also have

886
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:52,479
An interview with legitimately

887
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,783
Police chief of Austin

888
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
Yeah so there's cultural

889
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
Write these are in the

890
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:02,719
The chief is giving him the time of day to come into studio for like

891
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
This pretty

892
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
That's pretty

893
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
But then

894
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
On the 23rd

895
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,679
Something happened that I never expected to

896
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
Angelina Jolie

897
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:17,055
Chris krs-1 Parker parkervision

898
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,247
Vicious

899
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,439
Peach Productions Bland

900
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,863
Message

901
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Dexterous

902
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:53,407
How's asr-10 how's the real is it to hear him read that bio he is reading it

903
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Very uncomfortable

904
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Krs-1 is on the show

905
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Why

906
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,231
Don't know

907
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:13,375
Is it going to do a couple of tracks know he's not but it does turn out that Kara's one he's very much

908
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,911
Afraid of the New World Order

909
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:15,679
And the Illuminati

910
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,031
Yeah I guess I don't know

911
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,895
Look if anybody should be afraid of the New World Order

912
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:25,663
Ckrs

913
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
So what I mean

914
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
Like

915
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Man

916
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,319
I don't I don't know what I don't know what to

917
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:34,111
I think about this other than like

918
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,719
If I'm the next episode like Jayru the damages shows up I'm going to be like

919
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
What happened

920
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:46,911
Krs-1

921
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,335
You made it I would say

922
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:58,175
You know what I bet Master P would go on but I bet Alex wouldn't have

923
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
That's what I would guess

924
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
That's not

925
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,831
You want to go with Big Daddy Kane you think

926
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,879
Willard

927
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
It's just

928
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
Super weird to me and I would really love to talk

929
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,999
Gareth one now and ask him what he's

930
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,279
Like

931
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
We won't go back on

932
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,727
And I like

933
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,519
You do it is another

934
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,079
When I say his mainstream relevance

935
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,407
He puts out isn't still overt

936
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,967
Someone who is

937
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
A smart

938
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
Insightful person like krs-1

939
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,343
Could come on Alex's show

940
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
And find common ground

941
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,159
What's some of the things of like

942
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:43,231
Yeah I don't like I don't like violence

943
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
And stuff like that

944
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,607
And what have you

945
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,679
I disagree with the way they look at

946
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
The New World Order and stuff like that

947
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:56,031
I understand also

948
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:56,799
The people have

949
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,615
So it's not like he's in Kara's one is insane.

950
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:06,783
Killer Mike went on today

951
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:07,807
The owl

952

Killer Mike

953
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,695
I couldn't do that

954
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463

00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,767
Qpublic

956
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,047

963
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,735
That I just

964
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
I think you would get

965
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,527
Too much lag

966
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Cuz you got one

967
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,391
And then all of your fans would end up posting all the time she said really

968
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
F***** up stuff about black people

969
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,999

Don't go on his show

972
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
Even if it is just

973
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,263
Like we see eye-to-eye on Gunn

974
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,311
No way

975
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,615
Well they don't see eye-to-eye

976
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,895

Because of that

988
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,735
He was labeled a black identity

989
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:47,135

01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
Which other and

1143
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
And disasters

1144
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Come together

1145
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:07,455
Carrot one

1146
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,223
To save us

1147
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,015
That's just

1148
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:19,999
I never forget about what is it is it

1149
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,327
Interviewing

1150
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,119
It's a little bit more of that with Alex line

1151
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,519
Sad

1152
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,359
In Austin Texas

1153
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
Krs-1

1154
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:40,223
So much for joining us

1155
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,759
Have you studio tomorrow

1156
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
There's no snow tomorrow

1157
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:48,927
Straight up we don't

1158
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,487
I'm right in your left

1159
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,839
I hope we win

1160
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
Not right now

1161
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
What a bummer

1162
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Port Apartments

1163
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:10,175
Hip hop stands with Alex Jones

1164
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
I feel like

1165
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,759
I don't think krs-1 speak

1166
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Score Hip Hop

1167
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,391
Delightful and wonderful his music

1168
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:25,791
I don't think he has all of hip-hop

1169
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Ever

1170
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
Terrace one

1171
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,423
Disappearing more time than this will find out

1172
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
Haha

1173
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,215
Professor Griff

1174
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:36,799
She seems to like Alex Jones quite a bit

1175
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
Immortal Tech

1176
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:44,479
Those are the rappers that I can pick up who have had any affiliation with Alex

1177
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,503
Stanford

1178
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:51,903
Mainstream pop

1179
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Who's the king of the soulquarians

1180
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,815
Bob Chapman

1181
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Bob Chapman

1182
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
A comes back

1183
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,887
On January 23rd

1184
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,679
That's very weird

1185
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
The economy coming down

1186
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,799
ARS Wanda doing it

1187
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,319
Forecast

1188
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,599
Open right now

1189
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:24,415
Revising your forecast

1190
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
Chili's

1191
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,143
In the forecaster

1192
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
At the beginning

1193
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,703
The forecast

1194
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
After hours

1195
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
Or I want to catch people

1196
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
Attention

1197
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
I said

1198
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
This is it

1199
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,407
You go all in on gold

1200
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
Silver because

1201
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
They're going to take off

1202
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
Which I've never said but

1203
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Never

1204
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,599
So go all in on gold and silver

1205
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
Not surprisingly

1206
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,175
Prices

1207
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:24,575
More

1208
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
Doesn't get any better

1209
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,543
Jesus Christ this is so over

1210
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:48,895
What they were yesterday we can't just let this go

1211
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,687
This is a limited

1212
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
Time

1213
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,223
Offer

1214
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
Two days in a row

1215
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,295
Alex has Bob Chapman on

1216
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,903
To talk to Gloom about the economy so you need to get in gold and silver

1217
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
Immediately transition to Bob

1218
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:07,839
Time to do his failed pitch on gold and silver

1219
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:12,447
This is what makes me think that you're not necessarily

1220
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:13,983
Reality

1221
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,775
Is there pushing this

1222
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,591
It's tough to say I don't know

1223
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:23,199
I don't know I don't know if you did this forecast 2 weeks ago

1224
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,991
Today be any different than yes

1225
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:32,159
Did he just get some sort of brand-new forecast in the ultimate Saturday forecast

1226
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
But Alex

1227
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,815
And maybe it's just because he had a little bit more decorum back then

1228
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,607
And doesn't want to show ass

1229
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
Maybe that's why you said we're not in trouble

1230
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,679
Moana look like

1231
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,519
Modern-day giving up

1232
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:49,567
The pretense of not being desperate

1233
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,383
Bothering

1234
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,431
You know what if we

1235
01:05:54,687 --> 01:06:00,063
We don't make a ton of money but we just survive that's okay maybe there was that feeling but now he's

1236
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
I need a lot of money

1237
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,159
I know it's time for me to tell

1238
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,439
But I will say

1239
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,975
Another guy

1240
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:07,999
On the show

1241
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,583
Snow krs-1 it's actually Kool herc

1242
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,119
It's not

1243
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:19,263
Guide

1244
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,799
He's one of the good ones are the bad ones

1245
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
He was he was

1246
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:28,223
It's pretty good or bad I suspected this guy does not stand I'm not terribly sure but

1247
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
Your yours Alex

1248
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:36,415
Report on what's going on worldwide

1249
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
Problem

1250
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,631
My problem

1251
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:57,919
Course

1252
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,479
What is

1253
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
Responder

1254
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
Sounds like a half-hour with his

1255
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,815
Survival food sponsor

1256
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:21,471
He's much like the soap guy but he doesn't say any limericks so I'm not going to listen to him

1257
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:25,567
Alex is going to sell it now it's get the cut

1258
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
It's just

1259
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:27,871
F****** over

1260
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
Read a ruler

1261
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,711
Three days worth of food

1262
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,735
30 Celsius

1263
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,783
Pens that have 3 days worth of food

1264
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
Okay but what if you run out after

1265
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:42,719
Three days you should buy more than three days worth of food

1266
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,743
21-day Bend

1267
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
Just for like Fine Arts

1268
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:54,751
Like maybe

1269
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
Snow storm that hit New York

1270
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
Shuffle Bot like

1271
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:12,159
Why everybody is needed all the time

1272
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:19,583
Yours give it a Hard Sell Here

1273
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,983
That much different from Blue Apron Plus

1274
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
A little worse

1275
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:31,615
If Blue Apron was trying to scare you into buying it

1276
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,431
And also Blue Apron

1277
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:38,271
Okay

1278
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,319
Steelers

1279
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:46,719
Does perishable that you can't keep it in your shelf forever that's the survival food

1280
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,999
Totally

1281
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:52,351
Military rations are the only thing to eat

1282
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Yeah

1283
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,519
So on this show also I don't have any time I do a special episode by myself about this is who I think it is

1284
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,055
Merritt's covering butt

1285
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
We have a limited time your show tonight

1286
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,639
I couldn't make this a 3-hour epi

1287
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,199
But there's a couple calls that Alex

1288
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
Square peg

1289
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,503
Call him out on

1290
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,551
And it's really in

1291
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,831
Interesting how we respond

1292
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,111
Because he

1293
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:21,023
He's arguing with this one guy cuz this guy calls any talks about how that subsection 51 Barbie baba baba

1294
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:27,167
The subject section you're talking about the next one after it says

1295
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
You need

1296
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Consent

1297
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
Informed consent

1298
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,991
And then he goes to commercialism

1299
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,295
Or whatever so on the radio

1300
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,087
Commercial plane

1301
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,391
Put on the Infowars stream

1302
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,415
They're still talk

1303
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,439
They're still talking

1304
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:50,975
And key

1305
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:53,023
It's worth equivocates with the guy a little bit

1306
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
And

1307
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:58,399
Exactly what it is but that brings up something

1308
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,191
You exaggerate about this

1309
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:01,471
Completely wrong is like

1310
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,015
It wasn't about that subsection video admit

1311
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:19,135
But then you know that

1312
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:26,303
Got got to go got to get back to the shop

1313
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:35,775
I can leave it off the actual episode

1314
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:41,663
Cuz it's far more important things like Heroes one like Joe Rogan

1315
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,199
This team is developing of

1316
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,063
I've almost Vaudeville

1317
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:51,903
This game that they're playing in order to sell gold

1318
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,207
We get to the 25th

1319
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,231
The Sunday show

1320
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,023
Like I said

1321
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,095
One of the big reasons that we're doing this 2019

1322
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
The receipt

1323
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,679
Shocking differences in Alex Jones

1324
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,983
Philosophically from 2009

1325
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,007
We go to the board

1326
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:13,407
We continue to either anti-police neutrality

1327
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
He is

1328
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
Also

1329
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,503
Explicitly pro-palestinian

1330
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,527
Not Carol

1331
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:22,879
He doesn't talk about Soros the bad guys of the Rockefellers in the Rothschild

1332
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:26,719
Differences in

1333
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,279
That day's Alex Jones in present-day Alex down

1334
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,815
Here comes another one

1335
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,631
Just signed a

1336
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,215
Friday weather

1337
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Leader of Israel

1338
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,823
Minister of Israel

1339
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
Next year

1340
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,663
Buckle

1341
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:47,967
Program

1342
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:48,735
Or two

1343
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
So

1344
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
On the waterfront

1345
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Obama

1346
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,367
Exactly Spanish

1347
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
Neocon

1348
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
The Pat Robertson

1349
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
Coming out

1350
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:02,047
Alex knew in 2009 that are on

1351
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,351
Program of nuclear

1352
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,119
Is peaceful

1353
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
The exact

1354
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,263
He says that they were trying to make nukes

1355
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,287
The entire time

1356
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,871
The modern-day with trying to make rationalization

1357
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,919
Infer why Trump is cool to get out of Iran

1358
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,735
Deal and what-have-you

1359
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,551
What he's essentially talking about is

1360
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,831
Trump's position now

1361
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,111
Which is

1362
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:30,463
You're either going to give those up or we're going to a hundred military options

1363
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,511
Where is position was

1364
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
How about

1365
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:39,423
And we make an arrangement where in

1366
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
We give you your money back

1367
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
Chris

1368
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,591
You can get your money

1369
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:50,943
Also you will agree to all sorts of testing

1370
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
Oversight

1371
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:57,343
And the Iran deal did have very specific

1372
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
Pieces of like

1373
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:04,767
If someone is not in compliance with the deal these are the steps that can be taken

1374
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,047
Cuz there wasn't

1375
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
Because some countries

1376
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:16,287
So when the deal was made there was an expectation

1377
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,567
That was a possibility

1378
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
So they were pieces of

1379
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,127
The deal dealt with

1380
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
So no getting rid of it

1381
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:28,831
Stupidest thing in the world can get the money back we're not going to be able to enforce the same

1382
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,903
Iran deal

1383
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
Why

1384
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,863
But everybody is not going to go along with city on a hill.

1385
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,495
Like France

1386
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,151
Who's chaos

1387
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,735
Drunken

1388
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,551
Ex husband divorce

1389
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,343
That's the way the world treats

1390
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:06,207
Pray that they go for regime-change

1391
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:07,999
Title

1392
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:11,327
Exaggeration

1393
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:15,423
To deal with this guy cuz we need the alimony money but God

1394
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,751
This is the worst human being in the world

1395
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,543
It's really really f***** up

1396
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,567
That Alex

1397
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,335
That's his position

1398
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
2009

1399
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
Counter

1400
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:30,015
I don't know a hundred percent to turn everything

1401
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,295
Don't

1402
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
Because

1403
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,623
All they're doing is playing

1404
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,975
Reply

1405
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:51,519
If Trump does anything that Obama does the most brilliant idea

1406
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:54,335
Even if it was a good idea even if they know it

1407
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
It's a good idea

1408
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,199
They have to support Trump

1409
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,479
These people don't

1410
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,807
Believe in anything this is why

1411
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:05,855
We've touched on something that is why I'm not into

1412
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
Interested in the current day

1413
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,951
Like

1414
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,071
The Thursday show from last week it was just

1415
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,607
Piles of b*******

1416
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,631
But when I watched

1417
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,983
People on our Facebook group do want us to talk about the present day

1418
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,311
So maybe instead of Project Camelot on Wednesday we'll do it modern

1419
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,079
Episode

1420
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
Just to be like

1421
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
Here you go or whatever

1422
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,967
One of the things that

1423
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:35,551
What really struck me is it first of all it's an incredibly stupid

1424
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,855
More so then

1425
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
In 2009

1426
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,159
For sure

1427
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,743
Jumping back into watching it after having not watched for liked

1428
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,047
Stop shows like

1429
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
F*** this is stupid

1430
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,863
Like I was just like

1431
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,911
There's nothing there

1432
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:54,751
And all the things that I could really bring up our like

1433
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,543
His guest is a monster

1434
01:15:56,799 --> 01:16:00,895
And I could tell right Alondra list of things about this guest

1435
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,735
Like and then all of the other stuff is like

1436
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:05,759
He's a hypocrite

1437
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,831
And as we talked about over and over again you even brought up there

1438
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,879
That doesn't matter

1439
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,207
Right

1440
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,023
Big version of it in 2009 the hypocrite

1441
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,559
Is much more interesting to me

1442
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,327
Because

1443
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,911
You can look at them in I gave you the hypocrite about xyr seat

1444
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,471
Critical

1445
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,287
His awareness in 2009 that are on

1446
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
Nuclear program

1447
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
Was for domestic use it was for electricity in research and stuff like that it

1448
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,575
Hypocrisy

1449
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
In present day

1450
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,135
But in the past

1451
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,415
Clue

1452
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,695
It's a clue

1453
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,487
Because the thing

1454
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,023
Change for a wreath

1455
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,583
And the specific things that change

1456
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
Change because

1457
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Someone f******

1458
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:59,263
So these are hypocrisy

1459
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,799
Many of these people are

1460
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:03,615
Actually motivated more by money than ideology

1461
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:10,271
I mean baby I don't know I haven't started a whole lot of a lot of them

1462
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,295
Human Nature

1463
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Right

1464
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
No not

1465
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
But these guys are still alive

1466
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:18,207
I'm trying to make

1467
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,999
But like Impreza

1468
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,535
It's pointless hypocrisy

1469
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,815
In the past

1470
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:24,607
It's indicative of something

1471
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Clue

1472
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
There will be

1473
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,471
You know there is follow-up on

1474
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,055
I'm not trying to bust him for hypocrisy

1475
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,639
To guide me

1476
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:37,407
Towards like

1477
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,711
Who

1478
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,991
Would have

1479
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
The Pacific

1480
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:43,039
Goals

1481
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:43,807
In my

1482
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,135
That Alex is rhetoric changed

1483
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,463
The shortlist

1484
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:54,047
I bet that really brilliant

1485
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,679
Because what we are talking about in 2009

1486
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,727
Is a more independent

1487
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Alex Jones

1488
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:05,311
Is not quite as beholden to

1489
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,335
So many of these

1490
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:14,527
He's independent at Subways but then also of course

1491
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,343
Independence

1492
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:22,719
Then you start to see exactly whose motivations

1493
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
Archangel

1494
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:24,767
Exactly

1495
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,327
It's not just like

1496
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
I don't like

1497
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,375
Bisque

1498
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,399
I meant Big Biscuit

1499
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,423
Comes in Idaho

1500
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,983
Weird example

1501
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,519
Big lobster bisque

1502
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:41,919
You know like it's not a superficial thing where you change

1503
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Better

1504
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
Name

1505
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Big Berkey

1506
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,271
Big Biscuit

1507
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
Big Beth Bath

1508
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:51,135
Water filter you don't want biscuit

1509
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
To be associated with the filter

1510
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:59,071
You will make it to the Superbowl

1511
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,863
Now I can't remember

1512
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:07,263
I thought you're talking about

1513
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,055
Bronson's

1514
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,847
What like a baby

1515
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
Who cares

1516
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:18,015
Yeah that's the point I was trying to make is that like these are not superficial pointless things

1517
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
The change position

1518
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,111
Shrek the idea of like

1519
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,159
Being cool with what Iran was up to

1520
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Position that check

1521
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,999
Did you have bean Pro net neutrality

1522
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,303
Shifting to anti net neutrality

1523
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,327
Is a position that

1524
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,399
They aren't they aren't superficial

1525
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,935
Preferences

1526
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,215
Or something like that

1527
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:39,263
So that's

1528
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,847
Very

1529
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,407
More revealing thing is that these aren't just

1530
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:50,015
Wide Republic adopting random like a wide swath

1531
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,295
Policies

1532
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
So much as

1533
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,879
Why would you change your opinion on

1534
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
Specific

1535
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:56,927
Stickley netnutri

1536
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,487
That is if you thought about it

1537
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,279
Clearly against your best in

1538
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
So

1539
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,863
If you're picking something specific

1540
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,167
Said something

1541
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,215
Add what are the things that don't

1542
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:13,055
You also another

1543
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
Clue Into

1544
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,128
This guy

1545
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,176
You know the things that don't change

1546
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
Like him thinking climate change is about carbon tax

1547
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:23,040
Write those sorts of things that are consistent

1548
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,856
He's very pro-russia stamps

1549
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,416
Like those sorts of things are things that you know

1550
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
All of this

1551
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:29,952
6 Clues

1552
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,744
And I understand why this isn't like

1553
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,584
Maybe as fun as listening to Alex breakdown enough laugh at him

1554
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,608
I get that

1555
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
But this is

1556
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,680
Substantially more important

1557
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Exactly

1558
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
Alex Jones

1559
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
He said that he was going to talk to

1560
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,128

1561
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,200

1564
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:01,696
Alex who does not like krs-1

1568
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,120
That might be one of those

1569
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,192
Terrorist one show

1570
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:15,520

He told me you're the whole cap

1590
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Michelle

Exponential

1599
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Pretty crazy

1600
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,192
So

1601
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960

Gentleman

1608
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,224
I'm not generalizing

1609
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:07,648
Of course UFC fighters list of salt

1610
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,768
I don't begrudge Alex

1611
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,304
For thinking that

1612
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,096
Maybe Everyone likes him

1613
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
When he has in the same week

1614
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,680
Joe Rogan and krs-1

1615
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,216
Making time for her

1616
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,008
You know

1617
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,872
Now what they probably said work

1618
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:32,736
Something like that

1619
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,928
Sit around the dressing room and listen to me

1620
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
Like you could

1621
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,000
You can understand where like

1622
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,328
You got to pick up

1623
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,376
And maybe like Icarus

1624
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
It leads him to

1625
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,680
The fly too close to the Sun

1626
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,984
Because he thinks he's a much bigger deal than he is

1627
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
At this time

1628
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:56,800
Anyway

1629
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:02,432
Harb recent episode I told you that I thought that Alex wasn't going along with the Obama didn't

1630
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Swear in

1631
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,088
That didn't do the inauguration correctly clean

1632
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Inauguration

1633
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,840
We pointed that out to Obama then two days later

1634
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,424
Do large parts of it

1635
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,216
So right there

1636
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
Already

1637
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,288
Reported on it

1638
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,872
That made him redo it has already taken credit for that

1639
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
Absurd

1640
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:35,968
He then was born in

1641
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,600
Cameraperson there but in my cereal

1642
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,368
Record it

1643
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,952
Any did the Square NY have a camera Facebook

1644
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,840
I guarantee you

1645
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,912
Debates about Woody swearing on a Bible

1646
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:57,984
Hannah was he really a Muslim almost at work

1647
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,360
Alright

1648
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,640
So if

1649
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,408
Conspiracy

1650
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,176
Youtheory map

1651
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:10,528
The way that it is metastasize is now we're past the the

1652
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:15,136
Cinderella midnight theory of global

1653
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,184
If you don't do things right

1654
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,232
The first time everybody invalidates it

1655
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,512
And we're onto

1656
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:22,048
The whole reason

1657
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,584
It so people wouldn't

1658
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,608
See that Obama

1659
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,632
Wasn't going to

1660
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,400
I swear it on the

1661
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
Okay

1662
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Because he's

1663
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,312
For example Theodore Roosevelt

1664
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,104
Didn't use the Bible when he was taking the oath in

1665
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
1901 John Quincy Adams

1666
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
When Pierce war in on a book of the law

1667
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
With the intention

1668
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
They were swearing

1669
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:41,504
The Constitution

1670
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:46,624
Johnson was born in our Roman Catholic missal on Air Force One

1671
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,440

Instructions and

Necessary for the celebration

1676
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,520
Nevermind

Yeah

1678
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
Are plenty of bread

1679
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
In our history

1680
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,640
And other things

1681
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
That are not

1682
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,480
Bet bet

1683
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
Cockamamie

1684
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
That's not

1685
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:16,320
Anything anything any of the

1686
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,368
You can go back

1687
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:19,136
American Pie

Make a big deal out of this

1690
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
So would you believe

1691
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Yes

1692
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
The Bob Chapman is on it

1693
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:34,240
He's on again

1694
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:36,544
And we learn a little bit more about him

1695
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,824
Here on the 25th

1696
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,384
That is super duper

1697
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,456
When I was 9 krs-1 denied ride

1698
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,248

Everyone is 95%

1705
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,824
Everyone just like just like every dictator gets the popular vote

1706
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,664
Single person that Alex Jones talks to his 95%

1707
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:14,944
So stupid

1708
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,992
Nike Huaraches

1709
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Retired

1710
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,576
Didn't have.

1711
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,856
Was the largest private seller

1712
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
Gold Brokers well

1713
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
Toys for 45 years

1714
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:26,976
Help Tempe

1715
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,512
Producing public. Are called

1716
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
Conspiracy

1717
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
Gary Allan

1718
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,072
His partner

1719
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,864
Work with us on the other leaders

1720
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,728
That is big so many other leaders in the

1721
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
The fight again

1722
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,800
But that's big

1723
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,824
From 45 years

1724
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,360
I didn't know

1725
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,384
The bobcat

1726
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,920
Was responsible

1727
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,944
For financing

1728
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:51,296
And Publishing none dare call it conspiracy

1729
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
In the

1730
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,184
Influence line of Alex Jones's life

1731
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,464
That's

1732
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
Really

1733
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
William port

1734
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
And if

1735
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:08,960
Making it so we're going to need to do a full on episode about none dare call it conspiracy

1736
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,520
It'll be fun you'll be very mad

1737
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:13,824
But it also led me to be like wait

1738
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,616
I need to look into Bob Chapman

1739
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,408
Yeah because I was like

1740
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
He's just a

1741
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:24,832
Stupid gold guy whatever who cares

1742
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,624
I'm not really worried about what this guy

1743
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,464
Like for the most part

1744
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:32,000
The clown and then I started to look into

1745
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,560
And Bob Chapman is

1746
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,888
What would I call him

1747
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
A fast car

1748
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,728
He's a blossoming flower of question

1749
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,032
It cannot be answered

1750
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,568
He's dead he's an onion bloom

1751
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:48,640
Yeah there's layers and layers to a little bit

1752
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,688
Stockbroker from 19

1753
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,480
Cheetah 1988

1754
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:57,088
During which. He was probably the largest gold and silver broker in the world

1755
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
According to his

1756
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,160
So

1757
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,464
But I believe he was a big

1758
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
I'm sure is a pretty big Square

1759
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
But that bass

1760
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,048
The question

1761
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,864
What the f*** happened between that. And now

1762
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:12,448
To reduce him to being the from the top gold broker in the world

1763
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:14,240
And obviously a billionaire

1764
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,544
To be independent filled future Act

1765
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,872
The setup

1766
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:20,896
No

1767
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:22,944
After 1988

1768
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:26,528
Well it would have been the stock market crash of 87

1769
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:28,064
No

1770
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:33,696
Also there was actually looked into because I thought that 87 was possibly a source

1771
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:36,256
He lost everything but you couldn't

1772
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,560
Because golden dip that far

1773
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:41,376
Only took a short

1774
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,656
Fairly small dip

1775
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,984
It was not something that someone like Bob

1776
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
Call Chapman

1777
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,544
Would have

1778
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,824
He's f****** stupid

1779
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
And just

1780
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,664
Babies sold everything during that

1781
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,456
Small dip

1782
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
I'll be at most likely

1783
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,064
Be better as help

1784
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,160
But I watched outfits for this

1785
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,720
It doesn't make sense he's someone who's like

1786
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
His whole life

1787
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
Is just about buying gold

1788
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,328
And I gold will save you

1789
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,144
And the idea that it starts to go down a little bit and he doesn't

1790
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,912
Hold on to it

1791
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
It just us

1792
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
Track

1793
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,776
It would be but it would be very ironic

1794
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,360
Do something had to have happened at that point because

1795
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,896
If he was a huge billionaire

1796
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,200
Maybe he still was I don't know

1797
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
But if he was

1798
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
Money

1799
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,272
Financial interest

1800
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,296
Wouldn't be

1801
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:36,672
Making him do this embarrassing s*** on Alex's show

1802
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,720
Somehow then that make sense

1803
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
But if not then there's some philosophy

1804
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,352
That is guiding him towards being this

1805
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,144
Trump frolicsome today

1806
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:50,240
I don't think so just married one

1807
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Throughout his life

1808
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:54,080
But I looked into it a little bit more

1809
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,360
An interesting

1810
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:56,640
419 6

1811
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:58,176
222 1976

1812
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:00,224
Give me pretty much all of his money from

1813
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,504
South African culture

1814
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:11,232
What those ears

1815
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
Where was Apartheid

1816
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,792
I was alive and well

1817
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,560
He was making

1818
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
Shootings on South African gold shares

1819
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:21,472
During a time when I was it was that intention

1820
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:24,544
Subclaim after 1976

1821
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,640
She started moving to North American golden silver any sites

1822
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,408
As the break-in

1823
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:32,736
Interesting Lee many experts view the Soweto riots

1824
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
Lesbian

1825
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,368
And in the open

1826
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:41,440
Which obviously made his gold operation impossible to run

1827
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,000
Adult for North American Gold which

1828
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
Definitely be lower-margin

1829
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:49,376
For him due to overhead expenses don't exist in apartheid

1830
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:53,728
So he's making a killing off this s*** and then pressed black people

1831
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,312
Started standing up for themselves

1832
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
Education

1833
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
People died

1834
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,968
Is horrible

1835
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:04,992
So

1836
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,272
What you see then

1837
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,808
Isn't having to shift

1838
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,368
From this spur exploitative

1839
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:14,208
System of making money off the gold

1840
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,000
And the resources of South Africa

1841
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:18,304
Into much less lucrative version

1842
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,328
After 90

1843
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
T76

1844
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,376
Should have switched in the canto

1845
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,144
What diamonds

1846
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,912
Now interesting

1847
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,448
Knock knock outfit

1848
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:27,008
From 1970

1849
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,288
Cheetah 1973

1850
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,312
In those gear

1851
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,896
Bob Chapman lived in Johannesburg South Africa

1852
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,176
And did Rhodesia

1853
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,528
There's literally no champ

1854
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,576
So you could live in two of the largest and

1855
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,624
Cruelest white nationalist States in Africa

1856
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
For three years

1857
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,976
And not be keenly aware of how racial oppression was in place

1858
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
And how it works

1859
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
And his f****** telling

1860
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,120
Informed his life and work

1861
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:53,888
At all

1862
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:56,704
The only explanation I can drop him that if he was perfectly fine

1863
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,544
With a tons of money

1864
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:05,920
Yeah I would say he's not he wasn't just perfectly fine with it he was overjoyed

1865
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,712
Certainly.

1866
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,736
Delightful

1867
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,272
Troubling

1868
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,576
That wasn't already enough

1869
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,344
He lived

1870
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,392
In Rhodesia in South Africa

1871
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,928
From 1970 to 90

1872
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:17,952
Team 73

1873
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,768
None dare call it conspiracy was published in 90

1874
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,792
1871

1875
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,864
30 time to Bob Chapman would have been financing

1876
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,168
And helping get none dare call it conspiracy published

1877
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,984
He was living in apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia

1878
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,264
And making a killing

1879
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,568
Stealing and selling natural resources

1880
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
Apartheid

1881
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:44,064
Great

1882
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,832
Stormy Dan

1883
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:45,856
Sorry

1884
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:52,512
Thought it was delightful.

1885
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,280
Everybody prison

1886
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,560
Entire goddamn life

1887
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:59,680
So I started publishing the Gary Allan report which I can't find any copies of those or anything

1888
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,704
Sing about really online

1889
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:07,872
Early newsletter type of thing baby

1890
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:09,920
Like really really early types

1891
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,712
He then went on to publish

1892
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
Claim to fame

1893
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,112
Does a newsletter that presents

1894
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,672
Investment business

1895
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,208
But I found an archive of it

1896
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
I started reading them

1897
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:30,656
They're the ramblings about the New World Order the Illuminati

1898
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,680
Eddie mobile

1899
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,216
Any cost

1900
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,800
Sentences that people buy gold the newsletter is

1901
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,080
A hundred percent of vehicle

1902
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,104
For selling gold

1903
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,384
Sphere

1904
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,408
Fear-based mind

1905
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:45,248
His entire career is based on

1906
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,856
Droid nationalist apartheid States gold sphere

1907
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,160
Based pimping

1908
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,440
On Alex Jones Show

1909
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,464
Kind of

1910
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
Common trajectory

1911
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:58,304
If this is incredibly f***** up stuff

1912
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,376
I'm trying to look deeper and find out more

1913
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
Connections

1914
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,192
That could possibly exist but like

1915
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
I don't think

1916
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,896
You get more messed up than the idea that the guy who's financing and helping put out none dare call it conspiracy was

1917
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:14,176
South

1918
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,456
Skin apartheid

1919
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,016
Getting gold and getting rich off it

1920
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:21,600
Black women complain

1921
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:25,440
I don't think white nationalists are good people.

1922
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,256
Here's another interesting wrinkle

1923
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:30,816
And the international

1924
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,888
In one of the issues that he put out

1925
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,936
Very literally

1926
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:37,216
He said that

1927
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,520
If Ron Paul doesn't get elected president

1928
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,544
We're all doomed

1929
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,104
He's a big Ron Paul guy

1930
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:44,128
Has connections

1931
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:45,920
Society

1932
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
He's dead

1933
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,784
Pancreatic cancer

1934
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:51,552
Couple years back

1935
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,416
Let's go Khalid

1936
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,184
Let's get him again

1937
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:02,304
Probably living in some new Rhodesia somewhere

1938
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,400
F****** a****** New Berlin

1939
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
That's a real bummer

1940
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,800
But this appearance

1941
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Why is he on

1942
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,640
Well I would hope

1943
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
To sell gold

1944
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
For the schuckmann

1945
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:21,504
The owner of

1946
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,392
Call brokerage

1947
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,744
It's right there I just want to be totally clear cuz we have to be super fair Dallas

1948
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,560
This is the only time that I've heard him

1949
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,840
Correctly

1950
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,376
Site hoot at Anderson

1951
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:43,264
Yeah he will say he's a sponsor or something like that but this is the only time that I think he's above board

1952
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,568
In terms of like FTC rules

1953
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,104
About you have to say

1954
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,128
That this person

1955
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:51,200
Run your f****** Network and owns it

1956
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:55,040
I don't think most people listening

1957
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
I would have heard it

1958
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
Chad

1959
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,648
Bought gold

1960
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,416
800

1961
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256
He hasn't it

1962
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Score

1963
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,560
He also won

1964
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
I'm Your lady

1965
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:12,960
Hard copy

1966
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,056
Cam

1967
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,360
I wanted to briefly bring

1968
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:22,176
800

1969
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:22,944
686

1970
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,224
7

1971
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,248
So they could call

1972
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,528
And find out about that

1973
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,416
Midnight tonight

1974
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,952
Because then he's got

1975
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,024
Going to have to put clock on it

1976
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
Higher price

Well

01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,920
Recommend gold and silver related assets

Very strong

1986
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
Because

1987
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
Can say

1988
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,296
After all my years

1989
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Experience

1990
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
This is the only place

1991
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:08,256
And he's selling it

1992
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
That price

1993
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Purchase

1994
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,688
Pay $45 he was selling them at that level

1995
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,992
100

1996
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:33,344
$15

1997
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,672
Please

1998
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:41,024
Alright talk to you like

1999
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,072
That is so

2000
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:43,840
Over

2001
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,608
If so

2002
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,960
So Bob has said then all is like the only thing that then makes

2003
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,520
Tattoos that Bob has a vested interest in

2004
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:53,312
Genesis communication

2005
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,848
Invited

2006
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:58,176
I can't I can't find

2007
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:02,016
At press time I can't find a specific connection

2008
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,296
Between the two past

2009
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:07,904
Philosophical connections the Ted Anderson is a big booster for Ron Paul

2010
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,440
And I also

2011
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
Has

2012
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,744
Leaning towards

2013
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
John Birch

2014
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:20,192
Both have that leaving without having basically I'm just saying that that's the only

2015
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,216
Firm connect

2016
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:26,592
I can find between the two of them outside appearances on the show

2017
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:31,456
It's late because Bob Chapman was a player in the game he's just going to stay on the sidelines

2018
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:37,856
Fell for somebody else National forecaster is a sponsor on Alex's show and it appears that they're also again

2019
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,136
Communications van

2020
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,184
So they buy add time

2021
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,976
That's one connection but it doesn't

2022
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,256
Rationalize this

2023
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,584
It doesn't it doesn't make would be

2024
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:48,864
Like

2025
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,680
In many ways

2026
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,472
Sticking his neck out

2027
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:58,336
Credibility as a Wonder

2028
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,616
What's the world's largest

2029
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,432
Golden silver brokers in tubing like

2030
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
Right right

2031
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:07,296
But Midas resources is like these deals are amazing

2032
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,600
And I don't I don't want to read like

2033
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,672
The pages of rip-off reports

2034
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:16,512
About Midas resources if you Google

2035
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:18,048
It's very easy to find

2036
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,840
Pages and pages of

2037
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,376
People who got ripped off

2038
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,400
Bite my tongue

2039
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
Market

2040
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:26,240
Constant Market

2041
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,264
Horse tears

2042
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,800
Constant weird like hidden

2043
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,568

Speed

2045
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,128
People who bought gold at like

2046
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,664
A certain amount and then trying to re

2047
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
Resell it later

2048
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:40,064
I can't find a buyer for you

2049
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,112
Constant with with

2050
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
Ted Anderson

2051
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:45,184
It was a reason that he lost his truck

2052
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:45,952
Cabuyao NYC

2053
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,976
2015

2054
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,256
Cuz this s*** caught up

2055
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,352
I'm trying to reinforce the point that you are making

2056
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
Is it like

2057
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,680
He has to have some sort of skin

2058
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:56,704
In this game

2059
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,544
It doesn't make sense for him to but I think you probably also knows

2060
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
Enough

2061
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,104
He has decades in the gold business

2062
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:04,640
Noah's potato

2063
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:12,576
So he knows that I want to get on board with this Camp it says

2064
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
Where is

2065
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,440
Alex just

2066
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:18,976
Later

2067
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,536
Wrinkle of his career

2068
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:23,584
Oppressed minority

2069
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,912
So I don't know man I don't know what conclusions week

2070
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,680
You can draw but

2071
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,472
There's something

2072
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,008
Really really major

2073
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,312
Really really f***** up

2074
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,336
What the f*** is

2075
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,360
Chapman Do It

2076
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:37,408
How old is he

2077
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,528
Like 12 or something along those lines so he's

2078
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,576
You got to be late seventies right now

2079
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
Let me see

2080
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,160
So

2081
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,696
Died 76

2082
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Oh s*** too he's in his early 70

2083
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,048
He died in 2012 so that's

2084
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:57,888
3 years after the Escape 7373

2085
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
73

2086
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:05,056
Not a big player in the game anymore obviously since he's on

2087
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
Infowars

2088
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,896
Still got something going on

2089
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,688
International forecast

2090
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:13,504
I'm just being a

2091
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,344
Magazine

2092
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:22,464
Gold propaganda

2093
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,744
I don't know I mean

2094
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,024
Yeah probably

2095
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,560
I have to

2096
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,840
He's also doing like insult

2097
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,656
Chipettes up like that giving Financial advice to people on

2098
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,448
I would assume

2099
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,008
I don't know man it's really weird

2100
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
Easy racket

2101
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
Refuse

2102
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,640
Like if you're hiring him you should really already know what advice is about

2103
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
That defect unless they give you

2104
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:46,528
Read the amazing advice Everett what's your what's your ossicle

2105
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,088
What would we need to look at is

2106
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
This

2107
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,648
3 days

2108
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,928
Is an Alex Jones history

2109
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,696
Open up

2110
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,000
A number of questions that I think are running

2111
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,048
Expected

2112
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,328
The first

2113
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,120
Is what happen

2114
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,168
Like because

2115
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,448
Or what didn't

2116
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,984
You know cuz like

2117
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,032
They're like I said there's a decent chance

2118
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,824
You still a billionaire and coming on and chill

2119
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,872
Like if you shilling

2120
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,176
And not in financial disaster

2121
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:15,712
Then what is

2122
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
His motivation

2123
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,784
What's the final of the philosophical reason

2124
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:23,648
If you could just be he's old and nobody else is paying attention

2125
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:28,512
Certainly we all know that the show is the

2126
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:34,144
One-Stop shop for old weirdos talk to anymore

2127
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,216
The flipside is if he doing it for money

2128
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,496
Then what happened

2129
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,288
Where did he lose his billions of dollars

2130
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,848
Because he had to have had billions of dollars

2131
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
If you was

2132
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,152
Raping South Africa

2133
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:45,920
Yeah

2134
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,456
Second question

2135
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:54,624
What was going on in 1970 19 71 when he was living in Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa

2136
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,672
And helping Gary Allan Get none dare call it

2137
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
Conspiracy palette

2138
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:59,744
What the f*** was going on there

2139
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,024
And is there a connection

2140
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,328
Is there some sort of

2141
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,144
Is that cool

2142
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:10,496
So there's that

2143
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,568
And then third thing is I guess I don't know

2144
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:20,736
Do they keep doing this

2145
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:31,488
I don't know if we can a batter that from these these

2146
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:34,048
I believe it was in the 90s

2147
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
In the 90

2148
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:37,120
I believe so it's possible

2149
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:40,704
Responsible

2150
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,240
You know like it like

2151
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:44,800
Where else are you going to admit maybe maybe

2152
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:46,848
Chapman

2153
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
Acolyte

2154
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,408
Maybe Ted was like all

2155
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,688
Too late for me to rape

2156
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:53,504
Country so I'll talk to this guy and see what happen

2157
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,784
Let me see if I can

2158
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:57,600
Can get a star chart North America

2159
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,416
I'll try and fleece

2160
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:03,488
I don't know if I can find

2161
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:04,256
Start date

2162
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
For Midas

2163
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
Function

2164
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
Negative

2165
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,800
Harshly negative reviews

2166
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:19,616
Now that not a solid BBB rating

2167
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:20,896
Check out piss

2168
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:21,920
Consumer.

2169
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:27,040
I like that I don't know I can't

2170
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,904
He was his mentor

2171
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:32,928
Is that Darth Vader

2172
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
You welcome

2173
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,768
Also that is another piece of it.

2174
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,048
Needs to come into question

2175
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:38,816
Another big

2176
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,632
Clearly

2177
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,168
Bob Chapman

2178
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:46,240
There's an indication of someone who

2179
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
Who is fine with or

2180
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
Sports bike

2181
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,312
Right

2182
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:52,384
You can't live without you can't have the career that he had

2183
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:53,152
Without

2184
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,736
Pretty well

2185
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,272
So

2186
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,808
How much of that is relevant

2187
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
I don't know

2188
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,416
When you get there

2189
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:06,208
Most of these

2190
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,000
Most of these people who are

2191
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,280
So

2192
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,328
Violent towards

2193
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,352
The rights of

2194
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,376
Any kind of Labor

2195
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,656
There are also

2196
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,936
Violently White

2197
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,704
Naturalist

2198
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:22,336
Let's talk about the Koch brothers

2199
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,920
Whether or not race is their stated

2200
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
The Bugaboo

2201
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
So to speak

2202
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:32,832
They're all of their he added

2203
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:35,392
Bugaboo

2204
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,720
Kabul

2205
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,792
All of the Bugaboo

2206
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
All of the

2207
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,352
Things that they are for

2208
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
Did they are advocating

2209
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,752
If you if you start talking about

2210
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,568
Getting rid of

2211
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:57,408
You know when you start doing them

2212
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,200
That is mainly

2213
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,480
Racial bias

2214
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:06,112
Well that didn't last a racial violence together

2215
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,904
Together but what's the highest percent

2216
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,208
You know all of these

2217
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,232
Sings all of the

2218
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:14,304
These policies put these conservative fuckfaces

2219
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,608
Want to divorce from

2220
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:17,632
From there

2221
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:19,168
White nationalist

2222
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,008
If not entirely

2223
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,032
Affecting

2224
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,824
American Idol

2225
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,384
I would just bring in

2226
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:30,176
Conversation I guess

2227
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,200
Is

2228
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:32,992
Violence

2229
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,016
Is the app

2230
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,808
But is it

2231
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,136
Intentional violence or is it just a

2232
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,184
Lack of regard as lack of

2233
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
You know what I mean

2234
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:47,840
Yeah I don't know but it does for the conversation

2235
01:47:48,352 --> 01:47:54,240
It doesn't matter in terms of it being wrong both are wrong but it does matter in some ways because you have people who are like

2236
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:56,288
You know daily Stormer

2237
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,128
And stuff like that who I like know I get hard thinking about

2238
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:06,016
Destroying my door and then you have people who I would say probably isn't like

2239
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,040
And out now Tracy

2240
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,320
He's just like

2241
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,112
This system that really

2242
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:16,512
Viciously oppressed minority group

2243
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:19,328
The non-white

2244
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:22,400
This system was really lucrative

2245
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
Ton of money

2246
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:30,080
So I'm not that I don't notice

2247
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:34,688
The violence or something like that

2248
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,456
But it's different

2249
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,760
In terms of what you want to keep your eyes open

2250
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
The clues

2251
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
And the point

2252
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,880
Don't find too much

2253
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,488
Particularly it whether or not there is a

2254
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,512
Distinction

2255
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,048
I don't give a fuk

2256
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:54,912
It's academic weather

2257
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:00,032
Bothers me far less than

2258
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,592
I understand

2259
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:03,360
And I agree

2260
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,640
But I'm just saying

2261
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,408
4

2262
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,200
The keeping things straight

2263
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:12,320
In terms of what we're looking at another one

2264
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:17,440
Totally feel like in terms of like not getting off track and being like Bob having the racist

2265
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:21,536
Something like that it's important important

2266
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:27,936
It could lead us down a stupid road

2267
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:35,104
But whether or not that is is it different

2268
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
Fun

2269
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,480
All except that only because you got to get out of here you got a show tonight

2270
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,248
So

2271
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:45,600
Let's do it so this brings us to the end of January 22nd

2272
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,904
25th and 2009 I think

2273
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,696
Is a lot of Revelations

2274
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,720
A forested

2275
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
There is one

2276
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:52,768
Infowars

2277
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
Yep we're

2278
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:58,912
Nobody asks Alex follow-up question is unfortunate

2279
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:03,008
Nobody ever asks

2280
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:06,592
Follow-up question

2281
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:07,616
Alex

2282
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,896
Tell Anderson to Bob chapek

2283
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,920
Under clearly running at the

2284
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:15,552
Three man three-card Monte Styles scam on the radio

2285
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,856
Alex

2286
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,904
Do do some rest in about fear

2287
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:21,184
And then bring in the closer

2288
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:25,024
Exactly like you soft

2289
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,304
Metaforas Park

2290
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:27,840
So

2291
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:31,936
The f*** is wrong with you guys or what we're going to end up learning

2292
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,216
Because that Saturday

2293
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,496
The 24th

2294
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,592
Is when that first tea party thing happen first

2295
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:39,616
Little protest

2296
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:45,248
Is growing

2297
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,040
My suspicion is

2298
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,088
Alex is going to be

2299
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,624
Against

2300
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,648
To start with

2301
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,696
He's going to he's going to be like

2302
01:50:56,512 --> 01:51:02,656
Petty and bitching about how it's not

2303
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:09,056
But I don't think he's going to he's going to be against but I agree that he's going to be

2304
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:11,104
I think he's going to be like

2305
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:19,296
Call me Ernie Crusher 2

2306
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:24,160
That this was so I think there's going to be some of that but I think he's going to get with

2307
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,184
Program free

2308
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,488
Suck my that's my theory but we'll see

2309
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:28,512
We'll see how it plays out

2310
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,048
Cuz you and I are both just

2311
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:32,608
Bowling alley have no idea

2312
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,400
I think from the 25th

2313
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,680
From the 25th

2314
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:39,008
To whatever it will be I give it two weeks

2315
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,032
Before he is

2316
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:43,872
He is right there saying that these guys

2317
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:47,200
A little bit more than

2318
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,904
Two and a half hours

2319
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:59,744
Cuz we've seen this trend it that goes through so he keeps getting left

2320
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,768
Behind by stuff

2321
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:07,168
Like we see it already was Ron Paul going on Glenn Beck in this episode modern-day with qanon

2322
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,704
Buc-ee's

2323
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,752
He waffles back

2324
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,288
Come forth with PICC line for being like

2325
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:14,336
I don't trust it to being like

2326
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:17,408
The only thing to trust he doesn't do that

2327
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,456
Does

2328
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,480
Momentary like

2329
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,552
Hacker got really rich

2330
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:26,624
Berlin to Max Keiser

2331
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,072
But

2332
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,352
That's why I think

2333
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,120
It's going to be longer

2334
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:43,264
If there's one thing that is through-line throughout his career Beyond just being in favor of Russia

2335
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:44,032
It's Vicky

2336
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,824
He is a late adopter

2337
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:50,432
He is someone who comes to the party late and then is like

2338
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:53,248
He was here the whole time

2339
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:56,064
He started it

2340
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,088
Start

2341
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,672
So I think it's going to take him longer cuz you didn't know

2342
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:01,440
Understand

2343
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:05,280
Reality

2344
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,072
Jerome corsi and Alex Jones

2345
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,120
Turned on Cuba

2346
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:13,216
Sure Riley from their articles though

2347
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,288
Qanon

2348
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:18,336
An overbite

2349
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,640
The globalist took over Cuba

2350
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:22,432
When did they get there

2351
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,064
What happened to sveta qanon

2352
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,088
Making fun of Jerome corsi

2353
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:35,744
Sort of like

2354
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,304
Javis Petty idiot

2355
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,072
So stupid

2356
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
So f******

2357
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:45,216
I thank you Jordan for taking time out of your busy day to come in and do this is much more fun than

2358
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:46,240
I'm here with the plants

2359
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:49,312
Sticker Cthulhu Bank

2360
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,920
Remember who it was but someone

2361
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:59,040
The figurine

2362
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,672
