00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:15,616
Sit around

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:22,016
I don't know where that came came from but it

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:28,416
That look on your face made with you a lot

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,000
Wake up Olaf

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,304

Vanilla in the house then I've no idea what it is

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
Bring up what novelty beverage

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,312
But this time I thought of you because

10
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
How quickly I often

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,432
Find novelty

12
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:53,504
Is that you came in with this orange Vanilla Coke

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,600
Had it already

14
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
A quick

15
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440
Do you know what I almost

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256
I generally end up going

17
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
Just as an

18
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,072
To get out of the house almost

19
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
Like all end up at the

20
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,912
The store or Walgreens or something you know

21
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,288
2 what's new

23
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,336
I tried to Eminem

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
Cuz I thought it would be like a Nutella filled

25
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
Yeah it's not bad but it wasn't

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
I nearly it was between

27
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:33,952
Orange Vanilla Coke which I just took a taste of it is absolute it's not a whip

28
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Today but from my

29
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
My first voyage with it

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
I can say it's not a

31
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
7-Eleven

32
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448

To feel alive

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
You did get that cotton candy energy drink

38
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
Should have been way worse

39
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,560
Subtle flavor of cotton candy

40
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032

Instrumental in helping create this thing

60
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:20,704
That can be my job

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,264

Alex Jones

127
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
He was up to

128
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,143
In the aftermath

129
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,191
Ice as the fee

130
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,471

135
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,015
Out of context drop

136
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,063
Seem to be like contradiction

137
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:26,463

00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,767

We don't have any clips

143
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895

00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
Went home

153
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
Maybe I don't know

154
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
I don't know how much that was a stage

155
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
And enjoy what we

156
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,807

157
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575

I think it was from December 31st

162
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,047
Of 2017

163
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583

You'll never know what we think about Mike Adams

167
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Cuz we're not talkin about it

168
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Alex Gibbs

169
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Excuse for why

170
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:52,735

176
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,351
I sent Austin to Alex's Studio

177
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
35 minutes before he's on air it's just literally impossible

178
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,799
I would say our Mack

179
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103

180
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
35 minutes

181
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,943
Get off the plane for another fit

182
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:00,831
Splitting hairs

183
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023

00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,143
Feels good

187
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,727

00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,071
So I forgot to

198
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:17,631
Said I really think

199
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,799
Harris wittels

200
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Give myself about an

201
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,663
Yeah

202
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
I feel it's always presumptuous

203
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
Give yourself a name

204
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,623
You can't give yourself

205
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
You can give yourself a b

206
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Imli allows at

207
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
The height of

208
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Hubris

209
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:47,839
Himself Curtis's

210
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,399
I give myself a B on that

211
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
Unheard of

212
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
That's the

213
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Icarus levels

214
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
Can you imagine

215
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,847
Giving yourself

216
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
100%

217
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,295
I don't need anybody

218
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Good job

219
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,599
A+

220
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,207
Uno

221
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Rocoto

222
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
He's the only person who's in charge

223
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
A+

224
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:32,895
Piers Morgan

225
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
You know what

226
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
You know what he saying

227
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
I was awesome

228
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,439
I stood up and I told him

229
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
Hollister

230
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,839
Interesting about his

231
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Piers Morgan is he kind of admit

232
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,239
You only started

233
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
To get him deported

234
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
Has Morgan deported for attention

235
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
But it's nice

236
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,319
First Amendment

237
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,135
Obama

238
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
At the end of the show

239
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,975
Respond

240
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,863
Signatures

241
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,215
What are most important values

242
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,479
Morgan wants your guns

243
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,295
Afraid

244
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:46,367
I knew that this would be something that would

245
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,231
Was explaining

246
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
About

247
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,815
Strategy

248
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
Oh we'll talk about Glenn Beck and Alex Jones

249
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Publicity back

250
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
For that

251
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,871
Alex knew the Piers Morgan probably talk about how Alex

252
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,967
It's going to be great

253
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,831
I would give him an A minus probably disease

254
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:22,207
Yelled a little less from his listeners

255
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
Episode

256
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,303
Some people thought he look like a buffoon

257
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
It would it would be

258
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,631
Chakra see where I

259
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,679
To criticize anyone for amount

260
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
That's true

261
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,823
Not me I could pretty consistent

262
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:41,151
Appling way to talk about

263
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,735
Critical perspective

264
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
Was a Yeller

265
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
Is very very loud

266
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:50,879
And people would

267
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Distantly

268
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Insulting

269
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
Make me feel like s***

270
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
Animated me

271
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,583
It turned into

272
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,375
Complex

273
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,167
Just why I have a deep voice

274
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
But I try and see

275
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Much softer

276
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Nowadays

277
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Later in life

278
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,967
I worked

279
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
A job train

280
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
In that clip to saying that the Obamas

281
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,279
The administration

282
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,631
I was forced to respond to his petition to pour Piers Morgan

283
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,935
New York and Alex is going

284
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
To use that

285
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
2 thread

286
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,239
Conspiracy

287
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,823
Piers Morgan Giddings the Obama's to respond to it

288
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,663
Because the NN is full

289
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:51,295
Citi

290
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,743
Specifically and everyone around him more generally picture Alex's

291
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:03,327
Episode involved

292
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
Stories of his time there

293
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,287
There's poo smeared on the walls around

294
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,711
So long it's just he's rambling

295
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
Was water up

296
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
Media operation now there's s*** on the wall everything is it just repair

297
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,095
Is there was nothing else to talk about I probably might have kept

298
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,655
Have some of that

299
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,215
Where Alex

300
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,519
6 planes de Paul Joseph Watson

301
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
But he is all over the Press

302
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
In the United Kingdom

303
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
Gotcha talk about Alex

304
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,735
Would you leave to Alex to talkin about

305
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
Books written by Churchill

306
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,391
A startling confession about whether or not he's read those books

307
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,119
On the cover or close to the tavern

308
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,063
Winston Churchill

309
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
You read all of them

310
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
You want to know the history

311
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
English speaking

312
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
31

313
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,655
I guess I'm in Wonderland any other

314
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Speaking paper

315
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,007
There's three books

316
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
Television

317
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,591
The story of whatever

318
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:57,247
Alex is asserting that the British Empire got done sucking off the UK or whatever and then it moved over here

319
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,783
Uses as a source for this

320
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Three parts

321
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:05,439
The three-volume history of the British Speaking people

322
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,463
I read one of them

323
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Alex

324
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,815
Your whole thing you didn't read everything

325
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:14,399
Admit that you've only read one out of the three books

326
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Chinese food

327
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:25,919
My perspective

328
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:30,015
Entirely

329
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,063
White

330
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
You still haven't

331
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:38,975
I don't know what's going on

332
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Has like a couple books

333
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
I'm most of the science picture

334
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,679
I don't understand about it all who cares

335
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
So like I told you.

336
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:55,103
Who's mirror on the wall

337
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Interesting Falls version

338
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,431
Of him going

339
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Go to New York

340
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,039
That one comes in

341
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,343
He tries to turn this into

342
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:11,487
Thriller novel

343
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:19,423
Elmore Leonard

344
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
This is not

345
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
This version of

346
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
Alex is going to

347
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,575
Other women

348
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:49,631
Shopping mall

349
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,855
And

350
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:35,199
Jersey

351
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,783
I hear there's a lot of candy in New York who got to get out of there

352
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
Because

353
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,192
New York

354
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
This is

355
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
This is

356
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
A level of paranoia in

357
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Just

358
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:38,944
Fabrication of what

359
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,832
I can't remember which movie it was an extension

360
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,648
Yeah they are what movie is nightmare

361
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
Thinks he's being followed

362
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
Just a guy tried to go to Chili's

363
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:58,912
The time that you

364
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,984
You decided to put your evidence publicly forward

365
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
Of someone following

366
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Being followed

367
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,664
All that sort of bulshit so like

368
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,456
I just hear this and I'm like

369
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,528
Story if you want to put that into six

370
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
If you want to write that into some sort of a novel

371
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,952
That didn't happen to you out

372
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Parallel today

373
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,048
Backstory

374
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,584
Island

375
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
People who have no hands

376
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,704
And their faces were weather chest

377
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,240
Bananas

378
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,592
You're some big ole Explorer and you feel like you got to tell peep

379
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,712
Maybe you just want to do York and shattered a Morgan that's fine that's still a

380
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:45,248
You know what to

381
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,344
At least slightly on knowledge

382
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
Most of his audience

383
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
Probably never been

384
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
Canton New York

385
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,512
Maybe a little piece of it that is

386
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,864
I know that's pretty f***** up

387
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,360
Border

388
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:17,504
Yeah probably wouldn't come back and be like feds chasing a wire

389
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,552
Their version

390
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,112
Falsified versions of the outside world

391
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,416
Might be closer to accurate

392
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
New York

393
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,840
Course

394
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:38,240
This country

395
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:44,128
From Texas

396
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,232
The first

397
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
York

398
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,120
And part of that is just due to immigration and settlement patterns

399
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
1800

400
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,680
Pretty much everyone

401
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Europe arrived.

402
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,544
East coast and not all of them ended up heading any further west from there

403
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
That's normal

404
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
That's a good explanation for why the mafia and they was formed in the Italian Community

405
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,136
End up being in other cities outside of the East Coast

406
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,696
But that doesn't mean there wasn't

407
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,072
Huge organized crime operation out of Galveston

408
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Beginning ammonites

409
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
1820

410
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,448
Is a bootlegging operation eventually grow into involved

411
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:44,032
Protected by bribes to corrupt government officials

412
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
That's a good call on her

413
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,408
Closer Alex grew up the Civello crime family was in operation

414
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Dallas from

415
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
21

416
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
Neatly covering the gears went out

417
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,528
Would have been living

418
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:55,296
Dallas

419
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,880
Interesting laid the head of that family Joseph Civello was friends

420
00:24:59,136 --> 00:24:59,648
Jack Ruby

421
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:03,232
Dallas Nightclub owner killed Lee Harvey Oswald

422
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
Superkilen JFK

423
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,424
There been strong indications that Ruby was involved

424
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,496
So I wouldn't

425
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
Also also

426
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:23,712
Song that Alex sings very frequently commercial Eastbound & Down

427
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Roundabout in trucking

428
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
There's a line in that song

429
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,392
There's beer in Texarkana Atlanta

430
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,184
But there's beer in Texarkana

431
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,256
And the reason for that not granted that movie is

432
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,280
About Prohibition

433
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:41,632
That movie is about how Coors didn't have preservatives in it

434
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,216
Tasted better run Coors

435
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,824
From states where they could get it to Safeware it was illegal that preserved

436
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
That's why

437
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
That's what I really don't remember that being

438
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,760
That's why they have cores

439
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,904
About

440
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
They don't necessarily about Prohibition but it Harkens back to

441
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,584
Because I like in Texarkana and around there

442
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,144
Was

443
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,728
There's a history of that in that part of Texas

444
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:23,104
Organized crime of some sort

445
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,944
That story is more interesting than

446
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,248
Just a guy who needs to get preservative free beer

447
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,272
Crossover is

448
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,808
Because it has the archetype

449
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,112
Elvie's beer runners

450
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,392
From prohibition

451
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
It came from

452
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Supercross

453
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
It's not all

454
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
These families

455
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:51,008
Along with the eastbound down all the time

456
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
Still crazy

457
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
E-waste

458
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
A lot of time

459
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Looking into

460
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:28,384
Most children

461
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:33,504
Organ failure

462
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,904
Most

463
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:48,608
Fluid

464
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
300

465
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,192
What

466
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,568
You can go pull up Jordan

467
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
Okay alright

468
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:05,760
RX300

469
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
Didn't say that

470
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
He said 350 said 35,000

471
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:16,768
2 years

472
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,792
In the middle

473
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
You know sometimes it's a lot worse

474
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
Sometimes a tire

475
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
But that's

476
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
KT man

477
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
Last year the number of deaths

478
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
Flu and flu related complications

479
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
3000

480
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Like that

481
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
That's official

482
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
I would have been more

483
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
He said we talked

484
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,992
And just ended this

485
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Adapter

486
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Most children die

487
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,088
And just I put it.

488
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Around a little bit

489
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,512
Find even a Nutty website

490
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,840
Play the flu every year

491
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
Ridiculous

492
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,936
No idea where Alex is getting this information from

493
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:59,008
The guest

494
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:04,896
The woman who comes on out to show itself

495
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
She does sound like Ground Zero for crazy b******* like she called herself a doctor and she sells a $35 card that says I don't

496
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Similarity without

497
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
General stubblebine

498
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
Who Alex loves

499
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
I did also find a post Barbara loaf

500
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,680
Another of Alex is stupid anti-vaccination

501
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,496
Suggested

502
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,544
600/750

503
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,824
Influenza deaths

504
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,384
Record

505
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
97

506
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
This post

507
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
Information is it

508
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,784
Formation it

509
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
To doesn't match this

510
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Conclusion all

511
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,672
The information she links to isn't even a chart of death totals

512
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,952
It's of death rate

513
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
So the table might

514
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:59,168
864

515
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,520
64 but that doesn't mean 864

516
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
That means

517
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,824
864 / 1

518
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,592
100000

519
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,896
Seems like

520
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:18,368
Like what she's misunderstanding cuz all the information

521
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:22,464
Stupid that it doesn't say what

522
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,256
Venezia's

523
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
It doesn't

524
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,584
She also opposed

525
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,376
Table from Mercola

526
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,912
It does backup harasser

527
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,984
But the problem is

528
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
TDS anti-vax Outlet

529
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
Depot and Burkholder using the same

530
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,384
DC information as

531
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
Thesaurus app for

532
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,552
If I had the

533
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,880
Was just an intentional or possibly more worryingly

534
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
National misunderstanding

535
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:52,928
About the difference

536
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
Definite death rates

537
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
Even so her fake number

538
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,840
Weis what Alex is it what's going on

539
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,888
Bottom line

540
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,936
And what they're saying

541
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
The flu kills a whole lotta people particularly children

542
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
That's the reality

543
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:16,480
Working anymore to try to figure out where he got that 300 number from cuz I can't find anywhere

544
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Yeah

545
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,808
Also also

546
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
The very concept

547
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
The very idea

548
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Call Madison

549
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Acrostic

550
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
Entire United

551
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,232
Aspiring

552
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
To blame

553
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
30000

554
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,120
On the fluid that had nothing to do with

555
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
With the flu and only 300

556
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,192
Children died

557
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,984
Of the flu

558
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Worldwide

559
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,032
Conspiracy

560
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Would be

561
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,104
Unbelievably

562
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,944
Yeah

563
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,736
More than one doctor Whitley

564
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,504
Please come out and say

565
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
You know what I remember none of my patients

566
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,208
I think there's probably a conversation

567
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:58,976
She can have

568
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
These people wouldn't be willing to have it cuz it would be nuance

569
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
And it would

570
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,352
Go get them excited

571
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
Understanding a little bit better how it works

572
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
In terms of like flu-related top

573
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
Occasions

574
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
Better understanding of why those two

575
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,896
6 are lumped in together

576
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
The flu and flu complications

577
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,760
Like understanding that better would be a better you

578
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,576
I think

579
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
Be better

580
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
To do that

581
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,000
Not really

582
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,304
Oh

583
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
Play something that they fight tooth-and-nail

584
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,704
Creating existential dread

585
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,984
Fake

586
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:42,752
Plot against

587
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
White people

588
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
So stupid

589
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,528
That was kind of a little bit out of left field because Alex's

590
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,368
Bring that stuff up and ranting about it was also a little bit

591
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,904
Out-of-left-field

592
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
So it just came up

593
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
I know he gets back.

594
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
CNN

595
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:07,072
Aaron dykes

596
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,120
Is in studio one of those reporters

597
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
Is sitting around with him

598
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,424
I'm not sure if you

599
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:15,520
Clip or if it's later but

600
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,312
Know that Alex has a little bit of an audience

601
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
Studio

602
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:42,656
Turn over the table

603
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:48,032
I said that

604
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,576
Alright man little vain

605
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Lil Wayne

606
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:07,744
If they went out of their way to make

607
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Saturday

608
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,864
First of all it's

609
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,144
Crazy that Aaron dykes

610
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,264
It's kind of like the globalist

611
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,944
Already we're comparing that to Alex

612
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,992
I would give

613
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,040
To the response if Alex was like

614
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:34,880
Now hold on that's getting a little bit crazy all I did was go in there

615
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,184
Have an argument yell at this guy

616
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,680
Only is he like reaffirming and doubling down on the idea that he's like

617
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
Price for doing this

618
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:54,848
I can't believe you thought about that earlier

619
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,432
Manifest

620
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,320
Messianic beliefs about himself

621
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
Yeah

622
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
Jerusalem syndrome

623
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,304
So f****** bad

624
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
Yeah

625
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
Do you want to go to Israel

626
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,920
But I've heard of that.

627
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,736
I don't know if it's

628
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Very similar

629
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
2

630
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
I talked about how much Madonna came back

631
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Right right

632
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Alright

633
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
Alex

634
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,536
Discusses what happened

635
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,560
The end of the inner

636
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:50,144
Morgan has version of

637
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,496
There were detectives follow me everywhere I had to get out of that City

638
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Scared for my life

639
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
This also

640
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
Piers Morgan tonight at me

641
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
Ground

642
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:26,240
Pretty soon nobody going to want you anywhere in the world

643
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Dysphasia

644
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
Lyrics

645
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,832
He just looked at

646
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:49,792
Alex

647
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:56,192
2 weeks prior to this reptile

648
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,080
David Icke the f*** out of here

649
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,128
I just think that he's wearing a plastic

650
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:06,944
Sick mask that I can remove to see his face underneath

651
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,040
Of course

652
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
Open space was twitching with fear about the

653
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
Integrity

654
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,928
Drinks vitalik manifested

655
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
British accent

656
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,584
And Alex

657
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,632
I will believe the first

658
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,424
Pictures of that story

659
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,264
Are we done here are you a coward

660
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Piers Morgan

661
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,152
Yeah sure whatever

662
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,552
It definitely feels like whatever it was

663
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,184
Jordan

664
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
13

665
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,376
We've been doing this investigation into the days after because I wanted

666
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:59,168
Do have a real long-billed

667
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,984
To find out how Alex felt about the endives headquarters

668
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,776
That is not why we've been trying

669
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
Figure out when Alex

670
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Goes

671
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,128
The full mile

672
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,200
And being very awful about saying

673
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,016
Any bad so far

674
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,040
We've heard him

675
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Pretty strongly believe

676
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,160
That it was at least

677
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
A false flag

678
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
And as much as

679
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
The governor

680
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Mainland

681
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
The do it killed him as a pet

682
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,120
Or whatever

683
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,168
So far we still believe

684
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Yes

685
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
At this point Alex is not

686
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:39,872
That would make you

687
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
Think otherwise

688
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Here we go

689
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Ears with Alex

690
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:50,368
Happy birthday.

691
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:25,184
Music that literally sounds ominously like he's about to say

692
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
It's really good

693
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
Yeah it's almost good production

694
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,912
Oh no

695
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:41,312
So much so that I didn't notice it like I just felt itself

696
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,224
Oh no this is the first indication of where this is

697
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,016
Oh yeah

698
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:55,136
This is where the crisis actor narrative

699
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,952
January 23rd

700
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
3 weeks and a half three weeks

701
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
This develops

702
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,888
The course of the episode

703
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
Cuz now that he's got

704
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
Most of this

705
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Time is been about

706
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,240
Target

707
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,008
Piers Morgan

708
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,288
Good on you

709
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
Have fun

710
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,152
Right

711
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
The middle of the shower so

712
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,248
He starts getting in

713
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
To Sandy Hook

714
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:23,808
Text

715
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Calls

716
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
And one of the callers

717
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,648
He gets

718
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Actually brings up

719
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
But it's not yet

720
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
Yes have you noticed how all these reporters

721
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
When they're when they're supposed

722
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:44,032
Seen it seems like they're standing in front of a screen or something like there in a studio

723
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,080
Like whether it's foxy

724
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,408
CVS or MSNBC all the reporters when there's

725
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:55,296
I don't know I mean to me

726
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,768
Smoking marijuana

727
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:21,664
Yeah they even had a director there in one of those tall chairs sitting there I mean

728
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:31,904
At the rank in the military

729
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,800
Run the drill

730
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,431
Understand

731
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
Any idea

732
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Set bad

733
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,831
What does Big Sandy Hook narrative

734
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
Dakota

735
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,439
What he talks about is the idea of Anderson Cooper's nosed

736
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,767
Disappearing

737
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:14,655
It's interesting that his justification for believing

738
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:21,567
This misunderstanding he has about the Gulf War

739
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:24,895
You know we talked about is no

740
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:31,039
He was confronted with that information in his deposition

741
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,391
You hear that you hear it.

742
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
Pieces

743
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,695
Narrative

744
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,815
Here before he has what he needs that narrative for which is the arguing about Anderson

745
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
That's fascinating

746
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,935
The defenses here before The Chronic

747
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,591
That he's got a narrative

748
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,127
Later on for standard

749
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,151
Cooper no

750
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Not that

751
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,967
The idea that his callers are feeding

752
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:03,551
Internalizing

753
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,087
I think I seen

754
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
When is

755
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
That the caller isn't even talking about

756
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Anderson Cooper Center

757
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
Or anything like that

758
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,655
He is just talking about this in general

759
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
Alex

760
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,079
I don't know I

761
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,151
I've heard this conversation

762
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,943
100

763
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
As just

764
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Suffocation

765
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,783
4

766
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,111
We don't have not heard

767
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
Certification for others

768
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
As just a standalone

769
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
Only exist

770
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,071
And Alex is rhetoric at least in the.

771
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Something about

772
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
Cooper

773
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,167
To hear it without Andrew

774
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:51,935
Justin Cooper

775
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,215
Is weird

776
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
What is the color of

777
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Who knows

778
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,455
There's if you have some people there but somewhere actors

779
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,991
That's not good

780
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,575
Dipping the toe

781
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,071
Now that we've talked about actors

782
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
77 bombing and others

783
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,423
Because we're going to discuss

784
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Why that's f***** up

785
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
You're in a little bit

786
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:29,823
Who is the professor

787
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
What does that mean

788
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
He was tenured

789
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,367
Before we get there I want

790
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
A little bit

791
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,719
I think this next life is really s***

792
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:07,455
PetSmart

793
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Got that smart

794
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,343
True introduces is

795
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,391
How do you know which ones are taken which are

796
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,231
Do you know like the idea of like somebody survivors are real

797
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,375
But you know what I'm saying

798
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:32,799
During the idea that some people were actors there and then

799
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,895
All that does is give cover and allow people plausible

800
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,455
Permission

801
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
To say anyone

802
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,015
Anyone

803
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,831
Exactly

804
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,647
Didn't know everyone has to be

805
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:50,719
Guilty

806
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,607
Is really the only thing that you're going

807
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:59,167
Allowing everyone to be your f****** actor

808
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,959
But without having to take

809
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:05,311
Responsibility for that and still be able to hide a little bit like

810
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:09,407
The fake one

811
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Right

812
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
If you don't to be harassed

813
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,903
Or if you are real victims you should be on our side against these other fake people

814
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,303
Maybe one

815
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,607
Totally

816
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
That sort of thing is so f*****

817
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
Batman Tyler alter

818
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:40,383
What you hear in that clip is Alex does believe

819
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,663
People died there at 7

820
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
People or actors

821
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,223
But that's a facade

822
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
That isn't good

823
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
To me that clip

824
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,087
Is him

825
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,111
Adopting this

826
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,439
Even though he's

827
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Some people died there

828
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
Who cares

829
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
That is

830
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Window dress

831
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:08,799
Now I still don't think that he's as far as he's going to go but this is a

832
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,335
Watershed

833
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Episode

834
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
But I think

835
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,199
And maybe part of it is because he's so tired from going

836
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,735
New York City's not being cautious

837
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,343
But also the timing of it does match up because an article about this professor

838
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,231
So maybe it's just one story

839
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,279
It's about a week after that

840
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,815
Professor started talking about

841
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
Sandy Hook

842
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
I think so

843
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
Once you open up

844
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,727
Open up the victim

845
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:38,495
To harass

846
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:44,127
Bright

847
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
To be harassed

848
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,943
Functionally

849
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
I'm saying some are actors

850
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:49,247
For all

851
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,063
Who who's going to receive

852
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
The consequences

853
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,111
Is already

854
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,391
A hundred percent

855
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:05,631
Show you know I don't know

856
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,775
We can look at those we can see like oh wow okay here's where the dam broke

857
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Basically

858
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
But I don't know

859
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:18,687
Like I don't I still don't

860
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,015
I don't know I don't know if it's okay for him to say these things

861
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
I'd rather

862
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:28,671
Court of douchebaggery I will pronounce

863
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Guilty

864
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
Call her now calls then

865
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,375
He's gone in the car

866
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,447
The car and Alex

867
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,775
Gives what appears to be a restrained

868
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Amerigo's real bad

869
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:52,479
Yeah well. That thing is a mama msad15

870
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
I understood that the AR actually stayed in the car can you clarify

871
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:03,999
What actually happened with what we actually use

872
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,967
My Good Ol Boys

873
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:28,831
South Florida sun-sentinel professors Church controversy by

874
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,671
Dispute

875
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,463
4 conspiracy theories

876
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:38,559
Diversey

877
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:45,215
Call

878
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:29,247
If you believe believe is he Rambles even further off course

879
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,039
Doesn't really get back

880
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,879
2 after his

881
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Contract

882
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:40,255
But the caller is calling me whether or not this done was taken into the school

883
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
Doesn't know

884
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
At this point

885
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,095
Ary

886
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
Makar

887
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,447
But I know at this point

888
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:54,847
I don't want to say what I think right now or whatever

889
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,151
Should have been his lying

890
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:00,735
Or entirely

891
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:01,759
What happened

892
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,575
Let's wait till the information is out there that's

893
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:06,367
But without missing a Beat

894
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
After he says everyone's waiting

895
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
For me to say what I think

896
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,511
Goods back to the story

897
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,303
Of this Florida Professor who says

898
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:20,959
And then the article says that he's a conspiracy theorist and Alex attacks the idea that

899
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,543
What is what gets him off course into the

900
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
Ted Bundy fantasy

901
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,359
He has a weird first person

902
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,383
Narrative

903
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,735
Literary devices

904
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,503
It's great to be a

905
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,831
But from time to time

906
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
Maybe you're just talking about what you

907
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,927
It feels a little like that

908
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,951
Philo personal

909
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
Has the most

910
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
Infowars

911
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,095
Exactly

912
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,887
Imagine what an Infowars

913
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,679
Caller would sound like

914
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
The speed of the

915
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
Trails off

916
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Infowars voice

917
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,359
Yeah B

918
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,687
Unless interested in the collar as I am Alex

919
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
These thoughts

920
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
Whether or not it's intentional or

921
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,343
Completely soaked

922
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,903
I think that it's a pretty strong and

923
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,951
Navigation

924
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,231
He believes

925
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
Is mirrored by what this professor

926
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
From

927
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:22,399
A structural standpoint how's that

928
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
That train

929
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:28,799
I went down the tracks unfair assumption

930
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
He was

931
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,591
Reading through the Arctic

932
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:32,639
Whenever It Came Upon them question

933
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,175
Why he was saying

934
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,759
Right

935
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:38,783
Considered a conspiracy

936
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
It's kind of like

937
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
Can get another pretty strong

938
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,119
Alex

939
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
Professor

940
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Control

941
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:46,367
Really gives me a strong

942
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
But Alex

943
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,671
Is trying to

944
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:54,047
I think he feels like he's responding the way he does a lot of times when something new comes up

945
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,327
Turn off this for a long time

946
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,935
Almost trying to one-up it like we saw him do that with qanon with the fake Zach

947
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,263
Yeah this is intelligence

948
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
Reclaim

949
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
The cube storyline

950
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,663
He feels like he's getting ready to do that with this

951
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:14,783
Professor is come up in his world and saying like there's these crisis actors

952
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,831
Who are actually what's going on

953
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:19,903
I think Alex might take that as a little bit of Anna

954
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,927
Front

955
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,719
I feel like I've known that forever

956
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Yeah

957
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,071
It sounds like a

958
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,375
Normal kind of progression for him

959
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
He wouldn't he would never have gone that

960
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:37,055
It's possible he would have gone that far but the impetus is almost always

961
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
For him to like

962
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,127
Kick the kick the ball another 10

963
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,151
10 yards down.

964
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
Because somebody else

965
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
Went a little bit further

966
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,783
Evolutionary arms-race

967
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
For him going back and forth with

968
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,927
Evolutionary and motivation or

969
00:54:55,487 --> 00:55:00,095
Just like acknowledgement that he has internally that if he doesn't he doesn't have a place in the market

970
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,631
Like whatever it is

971
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:05,727
You know I need to be more extreme than other people or else what good am I

972
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,567
I'm not interesting

973
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:13,663
I'm interested in someone

974
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,223
Sorry someone is coming in with this level of crazy

975
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,575
That's I'm screwed

976
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,903
So Alex keeps bring up his Florida professor

977
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
Florida Atlantic

978
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
The guy's name is James

979
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,839
I believe that this episode is the official beginning of

980
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
Crisis actors

981
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:34,911
December 9th

982
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,959
Episodes from 2012

983
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,751
Adjusted Robbie Parker was acting

984
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
Like an actor

985
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
It is Prescott

986
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,407
That's pretty trouble

987
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,479
Traduction

988
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,807
We have we have Alex taking these ideas much more

989
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:58,719
In late December 2012 number very obscure blogs were starting to propagate theory that victims

990
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
Survivors of

991
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
The shooting at Sandy Hook

992
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,863
They're basing this off of website run by a group called vision

993
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
Do a crisis actors

994
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
For hire

995
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:13,055
They offer the experience actors who could improvise within the framework needed for the drills

996
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,639
This isn't anything new there were usually called role-players

997
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
The past

998
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
And they've been used in

999
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Any sorts of situations

1000
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Forever

1001
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,759
The only thing that was different about the

1002
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
Is it the name was new

1003
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
Crisis.

1004
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,647
And it was

1005
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,927
It was way scarier

1006
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,231
And people latched onto it

1007
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,511
It really isn't in Fort

1008
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,607
I was reading over a bunch of emergency

1009
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,375
Responders

1010
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Discussing

1011
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,911
Role-player

1012
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,679
Crisis actor

1013
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,471
And one of the things

1014
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:44,031
Especially for medical First Responders

1015
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,823
You need someone who can

1016
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Because yeah you know like if you

1017
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,711
You're running a scenario where for training purposes

1018
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,991
You have people who are

1019
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,039
First Responders who were showing up

1020
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,343
And someone is like I have a heart attack

1021
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,207
That doesn't help them diagnose now on the Fly

1022
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:10,399
My arm is jingling in this otherwise

1023
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,935
Diseases or a condition

1024
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
2%

1025
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Allowed

1026
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Situations like

1027
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567
Is obvious

1028
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,103
Exactly what you would do

1029
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,895
And it's not something

1030
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,175
That's uncommon

1031
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Or hasn't

1032
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
For very long time

1033
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,039
But they calling a crisis actors

1034
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,599
Add these people offering

1035
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,391
Them on their website

1036
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,415
Maybe

1037
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,439
People create

1038
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
A bunch of bulshit

1039
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,583
That's okay December 2012

1040
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,631
These weird obscure blog started talk

1041
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,935
And at that point most of the attention

1042
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,727
Should be paid to the sort of ideas

1043
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,287
Some sources that were decidedly on what I would call

1044
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,823
The Project Camelot

1045
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,895
Motherboard did a little bit of a

1046
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:53,663
Deep dive into

1047
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
The crisis actor RV

1048
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:59,807
Kmart from where particularly one-place

1049
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:04,671
Websites

1050
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,999
The post said that the hook was a drill alongside the

1051
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,023
The suggestion that quote

1052
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
The timestream aspect is more

1053
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,631
Compelling given the interval of 7 days prior to the

1054
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,679
December 21st 2012 solstice

1055
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:22,335
Ritual bloodletting is Beka balls method for internal power prior to especially when

1056
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
It's important

1057
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:32,063
Right idea being a part of a lot of websites like that

1058
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,439
Apocalypse

1059
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,975
Types

1060
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
A lot of sorts of ideas

1061
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
Speed of this Theory germinate

1062
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
But it wasn't

1063
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,983
Auto January 1st 2013 post on his blog James Tracey Road

1064
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,335
Quote after such a heroine event why are selected would be family members

1065
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
Students lingering in the area in route

1066
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,431
The offering themselves for interviews

1067
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
A possible reason

1068
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Working under the direction

1069
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
Federal authorities

1070
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:08,415
It in coordination with cable and broadcast network talent to provide TaylorMade crisis acting

1071
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,951
It realized realized

1072
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
Berkeley drive home the event

1073
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Tragic feature

1074
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:15,583
James Tracey by virtue of being a college

1075
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,215
Professor legit

1076
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,495
Heading to a world of

1077
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,079
Things College professors think are worth considering

1078
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,615
It's a very big difference

1079
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
To have a lunatic

1080
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,199
On-time stream typa blog

1081
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,063
Even though you can have lunatics your credibility

1082
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,647
Yeah

1083
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,719
The veneer of respectability of plausibility

1084
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,023
With the inclusion of a college professor

1085
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
As well as amplify

1086
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,607
Theory well outside

1087
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
Security that it was

1088
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Before

1089
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,447
As motherboard points out quote

1090
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,239
A search on Google Transit lines

1091
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
This timeline

1092
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:59,103
Searches for crisis actor only register on the site after Tracy

1093
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
These blog posts motherfuker

1094
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Right

1095
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,687
God dammit

1096
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:05,503
Closed

1097
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,063
Alex Jones disgusting

1098
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,367
The professors Court Reporting is a major

1099
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
So the crisis actor

1100
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
Narrative writing

1101
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,999
Troubling development

1102
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:16,767
To see this

1103
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,167
Even Tracy's writing about the topic didn't raise it to a level where you might call that sort of an idea culturally relevant

1104
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
What does signal booster

1105
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,215
To come from a theory be

1106
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,239
Being discussed

1107
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
Any credibility

1108
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
Alex's show

1109
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,079
Huge

1110
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,663
Support strong

1111
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:42,623
Where is absolutely necessary

1112
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,647
And maybe we should also

1113
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,231
Tenaya major shooting happened

1114
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,767
Then 10 years worth

1115
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:53,631
Fired from his position at FAU

1116
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:58,239
His post

1117
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,823
It wasn't a First Amendment issue in the firing was accurate

1118
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Correct

1119
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,663
Cu the professor the rules

1120
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:09,247
Needed to report other sources of income to the university

1121
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
Which is blog qualified

1122
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,575
The two brought in the required

1123
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Limani

1124
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
Additionally used University equipment

1125
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Recorded

1126
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Podcast

1127
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Without reporting that

1128
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,023
They fired him for not following the rules

1129
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
Not because of the

1130
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:22,559
Disgusting

1131
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,839
He said well not follow

1132
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:25,887
There's a difference

1133
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:30,495
Argument is Alex

1134
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,287
Somebody's questioning techniques

1135
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:37,407
Sending Lenny Posner a certified letter demanding proof that his son was ever alive

1136
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:39,455
And that he was actually his father

1137
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,247
This was a response to

1138
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,063
Depositor filing a copyright claim on one of the pictures of

1139
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,855
What is Sun The Tracey was using

1140
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
Pushes conspiracy

1141
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,207
When positive didn't agree with b******* demand

1142
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:54,559
Tracy Guzman non-response as evidence the people are covering things up and

1143
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Did they have something to hide

1144
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
Is it they didn't have

1145
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,679
Something to hide how hard would it be to prove it there with you

1146
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,727
Exact

1147
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
That's how hard it is

1148
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
Is go f*** yourself

1149
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:04,799
Exactly

1150
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,615
Tracy was involved in was harassment

1151
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,407
He was directly harassed

1152
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175
Some victims band

1153
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,759
And Alex Jones gave his idea the platform and helped spread them

1154
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,551
On January 8th 2013

1155
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,135
A write-up

1156
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
Founder of

1157
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,743
And since then

1158
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
Tons of Art

1159
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,535
Rain

1160
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,655
Egyptian

1161
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,703
Not sure exactly what what's going on there

1162
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
I don't know

1163
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
As recently as November 27th

1164
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
Infowars has posted articles

1165
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,407
Discussing his firing as being a free-speech issue and

1166
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,687
Simplifying the perception

1167
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
Of James Tracey

1168
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
God dammit

1169
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
This is all loaded bulshit

1170
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,831
I would say that I bet anything

1171
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
Tracy will show up

1172
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
The cast in the near future

1173
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,695
But they'll be unfair because I already know that

1174
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Of course

1175
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
Of course

1176
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:57,791
How could you not

1177
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,327
We got the

1178
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,911
Of course

1179
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,727
The meme kid

1180
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
Yeah

1181
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,103
This guy

1182
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,151
I will say

1183
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,687
The only thing I have

1184
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,711
To say regarding Tracy

1185
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,479
Aspiring

1186
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Is that yes

1187
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,039
He probably did

1188
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:19,807
Get fired

1189
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,343
And you did not follow the rules

1190
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
But

1191
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,671
There are probably could have given

1192
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,695
I'm a slap on the wrist

1193
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
As opposed to

1194
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Completely firing

1195
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,631
Denying a school shooting is probably affect her and why they

1196
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
Enforce those rules so strongly

1197
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:41,823
I would say that it possibly

1198
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:49,247
One of his arguments is like because I said these things and they wanted me gone

1199
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:56,671
You f***** up even worse victims are actors and stuff like that

1200
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,095
Because otherwise yet

1201
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,167
You open up the door for them to fire you for cause

1202
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,727
Where is it

1203
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:16,127
Are you then you could sink this ship

1204
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Because you're so f******

1205
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
Stupid

1206
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,415
I told you to keep in mind the 7/7 bombings

1207
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,535
After these blog

1208
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
Started to talk about crisis actors

1209
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:37,631
Use data

1210
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
Sandy Hook

1211
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
The idea started to work

1212
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Backwards

1213
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,007
People started to make theories

1214
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
After

1215
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:50,431
These ideas came out about past events at them

1216
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,967
When those actual event

1217
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,783
Exactly

1218
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,135
There are arguments that are starting at around this time

1219
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,927
That

1220
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
2 past events

1221
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,231
As opposed to

1222
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,023
We talked about it

1223
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,839
Bulshit

1224
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
I call foul

1225
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,215
I want I want pictures

1226
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
We can't do that

1227
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:20,895
Alex probably did talk about the idea of

1228
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
Like

1229
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:28,831
He did you know we talked about like people doing the shootings were an actor

1230
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,935
Those sorts of ARG

1231
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
Used arguments of

1232
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
False flag

1233
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:52,127
Whole cloth different party

1234
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,175
Who's doing it to rile up

1235
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,455
The party you think it it

1236
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,575
There were actors who are victims

1237
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
And stuff like that

1238
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,671
I don't remember hearing that

1239
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
In other time

1240
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
Games prior to

1241
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Turn Alex's coverage of other

1242
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,095
Really interesting because it never occurred to

1243
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,911
Like

1244
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,239
About whether or not I'd heard the crisis actor narrative

1245
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,263
Sandy Hook

1246
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:20,287
Because I was always just

1247
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,871
I just assumed if we had heard that if we were hearing the prices

1248
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,151
Narrative

1249
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
That means that

1250
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Probably heard

1251
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:34,367
But I don't remember anybody you're right I don't remember anybody

1252
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,415
They think they were after 2

1253
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,023
I don't know if I would be

1254
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,047
Real stupid

1255
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,327
To sit here until

1256
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,631
Absolutely

1257
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,447
I bet that those sorts of ideas did live somewhere

1258
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,775
The popularization of it in the application of it

1259
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
It's a past event

1260
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Absolutely

1261
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,407
For certain that Alex is 100%

1262
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,759
But I know that the conspiracy world

1263
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
Engageny

1264
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
Savior

1265
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
Do some of it

1266
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Rewriting

1267
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
What is narrative

1268
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,231
To fit this new hot

1269
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,255
Conspiracy angle

1270
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,279
Yeah that's

1271
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,815
Because it's just

1272
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,095
It seems like one of those things

1273
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
Where

1274
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,447
And it is a fun fact

1275
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
Everything started

1276
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Golden neighbor fortnite

1277
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:27,871
Team 10

1278
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,431
Vision-box organization

1279
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
Offering

1280
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,295
So deep

1281
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,319
Said before

1282
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Before this point

1283
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
Behind it some of them

1284
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
Could have existed

1285
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
Invariably

1286
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,071
Not to the level that it did afterwards

1287
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:51,935
Was hanging around

1288
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,751
Conspiracy blogs and message boards around this time

1289
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:59,871
I do remember it's like taking off like wildfire

1290
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,199
Like I remember the idea of Crisis actors

1291
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
Coming up and it being

1292
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:06,783
Like new to look into

1293
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,599
As opposed to like being high key

1294
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,903
Yeah that that's worth

1295
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:14,207
It's really weird to think about

1296
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,767
More looking into this as we

1297
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
We go along

1298
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,815
Because now that it's in

1299
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
Alice's

1300
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,703
That boxes that box is open

1301
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
It's never closing

1302
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
Until there are no more

1303
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Yeah

1304
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,407
Lots to talk about

1305
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,711
I don't think this is

1306
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:41,087
Call me Gary

1307
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:46,719
I promise to Jones House praying for you last night

1308
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,535
You went in the video

1309
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,095
Can you put it on late at night

1310
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,215
A couple

1311
01:08:57,727 --> 01:09:00,031
CNN comments that tie into a

1312
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:06,431
Sandy Hook, even though I know you said you don't really want to

1313
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:19,231
Confirm

1314
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,863
Shrimp

1315
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,919
That's a damn to that

1316
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Respond

1317
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,455
Now that's a no-go

1318
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,063
Whatever Smoking Gun

1319
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,111
News about Sandy Hook

1320
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,159
Usually

1321
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
You would assume that that is him saying

1322
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:54,047
Aurora

1323
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
He's trying to

1324
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,143
New York

1325
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,615
So go with it everything that you believe is now go with

1326
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:22,207
People prove their children other children

1327
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:31,423
So his next clip Alex gets off that

1328
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,983
Charlie Sheen

1329
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,615
You was on the phone with

1330
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Denise Richards

1331
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:42,175
Charlie Sheen

1332
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,015
The phone

1333
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:48,319
And he accidentally insults her without knowing it

1334
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,623
Talk to her

1335
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:57,535
Charlie Sheen sitting there ever sit around his pool and he hands me his phone he says they talk all the time

1336
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:06,751
How is it going

1337
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
I got pictures

1338
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
Bongos click

1339
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
And then

1340
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,879
Is it, guys definitely saying

1341
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
He's on heroin

1342
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:30,047
And then like a month later I'm in the grocery store

1343
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,351
And it was that pug

1344
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,519
The story cuz I am

1345
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:45,151
Asian gentleman that I worry about my God

1346
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:47,967
Denise Richards

1347
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,271
A year ago

1348
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,071
All I hear is guilty conscience

1349
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:07,679
Alex killed that dog that's why.

1350
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:15,359
I have it from good DHHS sources

1351
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:23,039
He called her and gloated about it

1352
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,319
How's your dog doing

1353
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
Dogs

1354
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,303
They come up

1355
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,863
You more than

1356
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,399
Statistically

1357
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,167
Reasonable

1358
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
Music nut

1359
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
You think about

1360
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,751
You think of

1361
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:44,799
I don't know

1362
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:49,151
Not outside.

1363
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,855
Do dogs die when they're around

1364
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,743
Yeah. All you doing is cutting out every time I was talked about a dead dog

1365
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:07,583
Not proof recently Alex talked about

1366
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:11,167
The song about Denise Richards

1367
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:17,055
Okay

1368
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,591
Legend

1369
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
Amazon Logan Paul show

1370
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Logan Paul's dog

1371
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:32,927
Allegedly

1372
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,839
Know what I'm saying is that he talks about dead dogs even more than

1373
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
We talked about

1374
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,423
Pretty wild

1375
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,287
Earlier you said that you know 13

1376
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,311
Smoking guns

1377
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,335
Sandy Hawkins

1378
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
You know

1379
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,407
Aurora

1380
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:54,431
York was fake

1381
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:56,479
It is next clip you gets a like

1382
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,015
Really fundamental piece of

1383
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,063
Information wrong about the Aurora shooting

1384
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,855
It makes me think that maybe

1385
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,391
I'm not going to trust you about others

1386
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,999
Murder

1387
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,143
12

1388
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,679
The reason that

1389
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,263
There was a bunch of people

1390
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,967
If you don't know how many people died in this event that you're weaving a massive

1391
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Conspiracy about

1392
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,039
I don't believe you

1393
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:35,135
I know that it seems like a trivial thing the difference between 12 and 14

1394
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
But if you study this stuff

1395
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,255
If you're researching it the way the Alex says

1396
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,535
Then you know that

1397
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,839
You know these trivial details

1398
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:50,239
Like if you and I were extemporaneously talking about Sandy Hook and you said that 29 or 30 people die

1399
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,055
I wouldn't that was

1400
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,847
You don't know anything

1401
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,871
About it

1402
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,151
Navigation that you don't study

1403
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
Yeah you're not putting forth some

1404
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,967
I'm sort of the crazy

1405
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,271
You have permission

1406
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
To be off

1407
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,063
About slight

1408
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:11,487
Because I didn't really tell you I didn't really read into it before I would rather you know details

1409
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,023
Dumb

1410
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,583
It's a damning indictment of your opinion

1411
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:20,959
About XYZ whatever my theory is

1412
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:24,031
It sure is a damning indictment

1413
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:24,799
For sure

1414
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
He

1415
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:30,175
I can't I can't handle this trip

1416
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:30,943
Correctly

1417
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,783
Wiki marveling that there were a

1418
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:36,831
Murder in

1419
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Murder

1420
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
But only

1421
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,903
In his words

1422
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:43,231
Does he not realize that if you open

1423
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,255
Fire on a

1424
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,791
Close movie theater

1425
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:49,887
You have committed attempted murder on everyone in that movie that he doesn't

1426
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,911
Understand

1427
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:54,751
He doesn't understand

1428
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,567
Come close to getting a reading comprehension

1429
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
Stevens

1430
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,223
Attempted murder

1431
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:07,295
I think it's probably just dumb

1432
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,855
Little own it just

1433
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
Attempted murder

1434
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:15,231
Gets back to complaining

1435
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,303
Talks about how art

1436
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,583
Is criticizing

1437
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
A little bit

1438
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,143
Authority

1439
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
This point cuz he hasn't been allowed back on yet 2016

1440
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:32,383
Good back on Max Keiser show Stillmatic

1441
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:35,199
And this is some of the other early

1442
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
Conspiracy mirror

1443
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:54,655
It's on

1444
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,335
You're misinterpreting all that stuff.

1445
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:07,455
I mean artista

1446
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,503
The school

1447
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
You can't defend yourself

1448
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
For making a

1449
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
Conspiracy out of

1450
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,279
Misreporting at the immediate

1451
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,559
Aftermath

1452
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,375
You have to

1453
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,447
Giving out you have to be enough of an adult

1454
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:30,751
To understand that some details are going to be

1455
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,799
Bierock particularly in police

1456
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,615
Because they are raw

1457
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,663
Just people responding to

1458
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,759
He's over there

1459
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:48,159
And when they say two Shadows that could be the two reporters

1460
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,303
What do Oregon flying over

1461
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,863
There are exclamation

1462
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
For all these things

1463
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,471
In the time before those explanation

1464
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,751
Are publicly known

1465
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,775
Alex is able to

1466
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,311
Do this sort of b*******

1467
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,711
At least

1468
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,991
We don't really

1469
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Good to know that

1470
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,879
Shows the

1471
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,415
Spend all the time debunked

1472
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
King lies in

1473
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:24,255
I really promise

1474
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,791
Sancho's

1475
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,959
You know why we're bored

1476
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:36,031
Cuz we don't spend all of our time

1477
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,055
King about Piers Morgan

1478
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:37,823
Like

1479
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:43,455
And I mean that specifically and metaphorically and literally literally

1480
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:47,551
Would go up

1481
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,879
But more metaphorically

1482
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,439
Kind of embarrassing incident happened on

1483
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,463
Where y'all at

1484
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Piers Morgan

1485
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,535
I know you spent most of this episode

1486
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
Just talkingshit on Piers Morgan

1487
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:03,423
Everything like that guy the f****** a****** they tried to kill me and doing

1488
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:10,079
Play tried to f****** kill me I had a staredown with him after the interview when his producer was cry

1489
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:14,175
And I told him that you'll never take down the Republic all this stuff

1490
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,503
If we did that metaphorically with our everyday life

1491
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,831
You know like to go all the way

1492
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,903
Creative

1493
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,463
Fiction

1494
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,255
That's something I turned it into like

1495
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,327
Truth purple ship

1496
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,167
Probably have a lot more

1497
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,703
Small talk a lot more

1498
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,311
What are lying all the time

1499
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,639
Grocery store

1500
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:54,879
I went to Home Depot to make it out of there

1501
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:56,927
Plant

1502
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,463
Drove

1503
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,255
South Bend

1504
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
Very successful

1505
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:12,287
Expand a Morgan British

1506
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,128
And also he

1507
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Calling him a

1508
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
Snot-nosed

1509
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,272
Not talking about like worshipping the

1510
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
It's not in his nose

1511
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,856
And stuff like that

1512
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:29,440
Hillary loses track of what

1513
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:34,560
Fertile job or whatever whatever Supercut of all the times Alex

1514
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,328
Snot-nosed

1515
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,160
Morgan Smith

1516
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,744
20 seconds

1517
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,816
Indicative of a lot of

1518
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,608
He said snot-nosed probably a hug

1519
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,400
Episode

1520
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,960
Drinking out of Piers Morgan

1521
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:13,728
Mancino's

1522
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,520
So we

1523
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
Imagery

1524
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
I can but I can

1525
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,152
I don't enjoy it

1526
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,480
I think is

1527
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
The turning point

1528
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,528
Alex's

1529
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
Cover

1530
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,416
Cuz we're seeing the professor

1531
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,184
Introduced

1532
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,208
Do the preceding

1533
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,000
And we're seeing him

1534
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,536
Amplify

1535
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,840
And respond to it in a way

1536
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,400
That indicates to me in adoption

1537
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,240
Exactly how it plays out

1538
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,312
January 9th

1539
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,336
Which will get in

1540
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
Send stuff

1541
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:58,528
He really just continue stalking about Piers Morgan

1542
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,392
God dammit

1543
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
He doesn't even have

1544
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,464
Lego the whole Sandy Hook

1545
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
Book stuff is tossed off

1546
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,280
It's just like oh yeah this is

1547
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,448
Well it's not as big of a priority for him because

1548
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
What book is important

1549
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
As for him

1550
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:21,056
To get attention

1551
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,616
Self apologize

1552
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,896
Kotoko battle

1553
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,200
Or whatever in support of gun right

1554
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,992
There's much more publicity

1555
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:29,760
Be at this

1556
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:32,320
In him doing stuff with your Morgan

1557
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,112
Then there is in Sandy Hook stop

1558
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:40,512
Put that a little bit on the back burner ignoring it necessarily

1559
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,608
Speakers on the 8th

1560
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:51,008
It was talking about

1561
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:57,408
Hang out of it

1562
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,248
Much as they can

1563
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
2

1564
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,576
Make their argument with the same source

1565
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:08,672
Stupid

1566
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:18,144
They're so scared of me

1567
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,472
Throat throat

1568
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
Most people are in

1569
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:31,712
Interested in the conversation

1570
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,600
I'm drinking out of everybody

1571
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:41,184
Appearance of the idea that he is the biggest thing in the world

1572
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:48,096
Biggest story in the country right now

1573
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:59,616
He's the biggest store in the world

1574
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
Conan

1575
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,296
That's not making you said you're not the biggest story

1576
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:10,112
Do just we're really easy as a Target

1577
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:14,720
And maybe the writers wanted to go home

1578
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:21,376
Writes itself even have enough jokes until you just said

1579
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,936
What else is in the news today oh Alex Jones is a dick

1580
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,520
A little bit of

1581
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,336
Because that's exactly what Alex

1582
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,872
Metastasized

1583
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,152
Stop making fun of him and

1584
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:37,760
But I also don't think there's anything wrong with me

1585
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,832
No game but

1586
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:45,184
He also if you don't understand it back in 2013 every reason

1587
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Do not understand

1588
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,024
A very very forgivable thing

1589
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:51,840
In the world

1590
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,288
She has a relative of somebody who died Aurora on

1591
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,336
To talk about how I know

1592
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
Did you get the call

1593
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,176
Late at night a Morgan has somebody on

1594
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,040
Who is the relative

1595
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,648
About how

1596
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
You know

1597
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
You don't want

1598
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,208
People

1599
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,000
Experience

1600
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,280
Of waking up

1601
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:25,376
Recalled that you loved

1602
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:28,448
Eddie's specifically says that I would never want out

1603
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
Experience

1604
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,776
And that's why we worked

1605
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,800
To keep guns out of the

1606
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,592
Atwood

1607
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:40,480
Possibly do something which I assume a personal insult not a threat

1608
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,552
Gotcha

1609
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,344
It says about this guy

1610
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,672
Whose family member was killed in Aurora

1611
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:57,120
He's talking about last night he was a hanging out with his family there was a storm in Austin

1612
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,424
The internet's not working so well

1613
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:19,136
I feel sorry for his loss victims

1614
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:21,184
Sandwich from Aurora

1615
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,792
I feel sorry for his loss or whatever he came off as a super scripted actor

1616
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,840
That's a man

1617
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,264
I feel sorry for Denise Richards pug or whatever

1618
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
Right

1619
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,104
Ulta

1620
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,560
Okay

1621
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,096
I mean whatever

1622
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,912
Hey comes down to this idea to like there

1623
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:06,496
This early and Alex's getting comfortable with it

1624
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,568
It's so you do expect him to say stuff like that

1625
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,592
Partially or fully

1626
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,360
Stage

1627
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,176
Entirely sure where the money

1628
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,480
What's the angle we're going to go

1629
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:21,600
Until this episode messerly really

1630
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,880
Nail down

1631
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:25,696
Articulated

1632
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,000
For someone like Alex

1633
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,792
The difference between saying

1634
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,840
Partially and entirely staged

1635
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,608
Is negligible

1636
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,656
The effective it doesn't matter

1637
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,704
Exact your inspiring

1638
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
The same sort of

1639
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,520
This isn't real

1640
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,288
You can't be

1641
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:45,920
Be trusted as right as a Survivor is a family member because you might be

1642
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,200
One of the bad one

1643
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,832
I feel as

1644
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:56,416
Episode

1645
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,208
And Alex

1646
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
Pretty consistently

1647
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,768
The hook is

1648
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,816
Partially or totally staged

1649
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,096
It doesn't matter

1650
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,680
There will come a point where it gets to like

1651
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:08,704
This is the whole f******

1652
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,776
You will get to that point in his rhetoric

1653
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,080
But this is this is

1654
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,896
Yeah but that's what I

1655
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,176
The consequences

1656
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
Are the

1657
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:21,760
Right so it doesn't really matter what the difference

1658
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:23,296
What's the difference

1659
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Specific words

1660
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:30,208
It's still going to result in the same harassment I think there's Nuance for our like sort of academic

1661
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,000
Realistically

1662
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,328
This is all this is already

1663
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,912
Which makes it all the worse that Alex

1664
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:39,680
Next

1665
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
Declares himself

1666
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,408
Statesman

1667
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,480
7677

1668
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:55,552
And unfortunately

1669
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:07,840
I agree with that Ted Nugent doesn't get the whole picture under any bus please

1670
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:13,984
He's not answering his calls

1671
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:17,312
Yeah

1672
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,336
The whole

1673
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:24,480
Or is he talking about a specific

1674
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:38,816
This dude doesn't leave s*** anymore he's too old is retired from the house

1675
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:45,216
Is interviewed

1676
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:47,776
Much about Cindy hooker any of that stuff

1677
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:52,640
Talk s*** on Glenn Beck a little

1678
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,200
Search Cadillac

1679
01:29:56,736 --> 01:30:00,064
This episode so far being just Alex s*** talking other people I hate

1680
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
He sucks going back sucks

1681
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:12,096
Go fuc yourself up Chris Morgan

1682
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:16,192
Call I love you but you're worthless now is all f****** May

1683
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,800
Larry Pratt

1684
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,104
I'm gone owners for America on again

1685
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,152
And it's just more like

1686
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
Of course nothing

1687
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,832
So we can skip over that

1688
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
Piers Morgan's episode on the 8th

1689
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,928
Did include

1690
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,000
Really inappropriate

1691
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,280
Piers Morgan

1692
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,352
But I also think it's a

1693
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,680
Now I'll get into what I mean on the other side of this

1694
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:50,240
But I think Alex has one of his own

1695
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
Complaints

1696
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:53,312
That I think it's legitimate

1697
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,872
But he's also making way more out of this

1698
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,944
I didn't shake my hands busy

1699
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,768
See my Facebook

1700
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:36,320
With a semi-automatic

1701
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:48,352
Uniform

1702
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,384
So the first thing I want to point out is that Alex

1703
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:04,480
Clearly understand the consequences of word being said to audience

1704
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,272
The way audiences are going

1705
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
Hear them

1706
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:10,624
When he is Target of it he clearly understands

1707
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,160
This is a threat to his safe

1708
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:17,536
Argument of I had no idea how people would hear what I said

1709
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,328
Ifucking window

1710
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:23,936
You know exactly the way people will hear your words

1711
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,472
Okay well what if

1712
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:31,872
Crazy viewer appears Morgan

1713
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
A theorist

1714
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,712
Shows up at

1715
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,528
Cuz a Morgan's words

1716
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,344
And I will never

1717
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:42,112
Sprite

1718
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:42,880
It's on sale

1719
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:48,512
I think he plays this clip way too many times on the episode

1720
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:52,096
Auntie editorialize is on it in terms of like

1721
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:58,752
Uniform it's okay they all this stuff

1722
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,592
The guy who wrote Friday Night Lights

1723
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:08,480
What are writer

1724
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
He

1725
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
Is

1726
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:17,184
Is bring a gun to a boxing match

1727
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952
Shootout

1728
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
But the end

1729
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:23,328
I do think

1730
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:25,632
The first the lady who responded

1731
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:27,168
Might have thought

1732
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:28,192
Ahmet puncher

1733
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,032
Like I don't think that they're laughing at the idea of shooting

1734
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,616
But Buzz bissinger I do believe was saying

1735
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,920
Saudi idea

1736
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,200
They're all like

1737
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:42,784
Has existed chorus of laughs about murdering Alex

1738
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,856
Might be a little unfair

1739
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,392
I think that that's important

1740
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,160
For clarity

1741
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,208
But the larger picture of it

1742
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:51,488
That's f***** up

1743
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,024
Is it appropriate

1744
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,328
Like I don't think it's right

1745
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:57,888
For a Morgan to not stop

1746
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:02,496
Like I know that we all hate Alex

1747
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,824
But you expressing something like that isn't that is no place on

1748
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,360
My Shout

1749
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:13,760
Working at in and out of the show I don't know

1750
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:17,088
Behind the scenes of edited out of Archer

1751
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,160
Not as many as you might think

1752
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
You yell

1753
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:24,512
Is not okay

1754
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:29,120
Have a good point at least

1755
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,680
So I kind of think

1756
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,216
They made

1757
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,312
Recovering Alex

1758
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:40,640
Is illegitimate

1759
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,920
Pretty good Alex's bake

1760
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,944
You making it poorly

1761
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,224
But I think it's a legitimate

1762
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:46,016
Inasmuch as

1763
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
Peterson is

1764
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,088
People f***** up big f******

1765
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,624
Alex is capitalizing on it

1766
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Nobody

1767
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
Stop that

1768
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
I think in making a big deal out of this

1769
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:01,376
Because it's an unforced error on.

1770
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,400
Is really fun

1771
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:08,288
This next one is not

1772
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:15,456
I don't want Alex Jones

1773
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,016
I get the phone call at 3 in the morning

1774
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,600
The one of his children has been shot and killed by somebody shouldn't have

1775
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,904
A handgun or a

1776
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,304
Rifle or a automatic weapon

1777
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:03,840
Is

1778
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,936
Aurora Survivor

1779
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:11,264
Who was on the show expressing that ideas like I don't want out

1780
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
Get that phone call

1781
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,848
Even if I disagree with him but this

1782
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,664
Should have to

1783
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
Rheostat

1784
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,712
And Alex

1785
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
Because he's a f***

1786
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,248
Idiot

1787
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,576
Interprets that is a Veiled Threat on his family

1788
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,600
Which is nonsense

1789
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,136
Does he

1790
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:30,976
I mean cuz I'm almost on the edge of feeling bad for

1791
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,024
Why because

1792
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,048
Is that dumb

1793
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,120
Well am I don't know because

1794
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,912
Purposeful

1795
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
Bulshit

1796
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,704
Or if it's

1797
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,240
This guy genuinely

1798
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
We cannot under

1799
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
Stand

1800
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,544
People

1801
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
Not wanting

1802
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:51,712
Process I think Mikey lives in this world

1803
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,736
Is expressing empathy

1804
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,528
For him to

1805
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:55,296
It is like

1806
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:58,112
You're trying to kill me like that so lonely

1807
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:03,232
I think it's entirely possible that that is what's going on that he has to

1808
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,024
Interpret every

1809
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,560
Sing that doesn't fit

1810
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,840
His like sort of

1811
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,632
Skewed worldview as

1812
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,704
It's sort of recontextualizing a little bit

1813
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,752
I think that's entirely possible

1814
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:16,544
But I honestly

1815
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,080
There's another possibility

1816
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,128
That possibility is

1817
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:26,016
He knows that what he does is inappropriate

1818
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,320
And so every time that there is

1819
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,624
The possibility of creating

1820
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
A victim narrative

1821
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
Himself

1822
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,488
He needs to capitalize on it in order to build up

1823
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,304
The perception of the scales

1824
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,096
Or that he's in the right

1825
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:44,448
Kill my kids their eyes

1826
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:48,800
Twinkle when they say they don't want me to get a call at 3 in the morning

1827
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:51,360
H b at my family member is dead

1828
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:56,992
Their eyes are twinkling because they secretly are saying they want my family they want to kill my children

1829
01:37:57,248 --> 01:38:00,064
Why would I behave in any other way than the way on.

1830
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
I think there's part of it is that is rash

1831
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:03,648
Analyzation

1832
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,184
Whether it's to his audience

1833
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
Number to himself

1834
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:09,792
I suppose another party

1835
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:10,560
Would just be

1836
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,840
The idea of

1837
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,608
His

1838
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,376
Anime

1839
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,424
Wanting anything but

1840
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:16,960
Total Destruction

1841
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,824
And reveals his own

1842
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,640
You know

1843
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,688
Opinions on that is

1844
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:29,248
For his enemies he wants nothing but total.

1845
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
Well you know

1846
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:32,832
Creating a perception that is totaled

1847
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:33,600
Destruction of him

1848
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:38,208
All all manner of Nyssa

1849
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:41,024
Perception all sorts

1850
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,608
What is if you're up against

1851
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
Something that

1852
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,168
Destroyer

1853
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,728
You got a lie a little bit in order to get people against

1854
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,264
The truly evil force

1855
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,080
You know that sort of vacation

1856
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,616
Could be peace

1857
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,224
Train through all of his

1858
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:01,504
Forever

1859
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,064
Annie opportunity

1860
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
To create a

1861
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,880
Some sort of

1862
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
Victimhood

1863
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,696
For himself where it doesn't

1864
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,256
So did it does fall in line

1865
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:21,472
Scattershot or if it was something right

1866
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:24,800
Overtime

1867
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,592
Just part of his world

1868
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:30,688
Write your shoe that you really can't answer without

1869
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,736
Stampy probably like

1870
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,528
What is the ID

1871
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,320
Strategic or pathological

1872
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:39,392
I believe either but whatever the case

1873
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,672
It serves

1874
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:47,328
Earlier in the episode I

1875
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,120
Do you that I think that

1876
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
There was a

1877
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,656
Piece of this

1878
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
Didn't go

1879
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,448
Super Wells

1880
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:55,520
There's a couple called that Alex

1881
01:39:56,288 --> 01:40:00,128
On this episode that are like hey man

1882
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,480
What you did was more

1883
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,552
Productive towards the goals

1884
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,112
Arpino putting forth

1885
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:11,648
You acted like a crazy

1886
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Gone owner

1887
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,000
There's only going to be used as an argument to take away people's gone

1888
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:17,536
Yeah

1889
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:28,032
It's my fault, man in the arena do not understand

1890
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,568
Right so that jerk-off motion

1891
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,104
Response to most

1892
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,176
This episode is about 3 hours

1893
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:34,944
15 min

1894
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,224
3 hours

1895
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,784
Generally shows

1896
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
3 hours long

1897
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,112
But if you wants to go into overdrive heki

1898
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
Keep the show going

1899
01:40:43,648 --> 01:40:44,928
Clearly he intended to key

1900
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,952
Keep the show going

1901
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,488
But he got a call

1902
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:49,280
It was along those lines

1903
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,328
The idea that you are

1904
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
You know you're acting

1905
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,936
Pretty much right after

1906
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,240
In overdrive now

1907
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:01,824
Full discretion of

1908
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:05,664
Press the button and then do whatever

1909
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,224
Where this guy confronts him

1910
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,504
About

1911
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:18,720
Quintessentially fit every single stereotype

1912
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:22,048
Sliders

1913
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:25,888
Murdered

1914
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:43,040
No you're the one that's always ranting about cointelpro and that's exactly what you were doing

1915
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,344
You were controlled opposition dude

1916
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:52,000
Well you know what a myself and I believe what I did was write getting mad at him so I appreciate your call

1917
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:58,656
Goes around

1918
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:05,056
One form of psychological warfare they engage in

1919
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:17,856
Show

1920
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:21,184
Build a organization

1921
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,120
Sophisticated

1922
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:34,752
Clip earlier Alex talking about

1923
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:37,312
Like people talking about him on CNN is

1924
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:38,592
What is a threat

1925
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,896
Recognition of the relationship

1926
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:41,920
Audience

1927
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,736
Babies fully aware of that

1928
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:48,576
Part is real

1929
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,392
Because it's an awareness

1930
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,440
Understand

1931
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,720
That

1932
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:57,280
People criticizing him are helpful to

1933
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,096
Why wouldn't

1934
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,376
That sort of thing

1935
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,912
In order to

1936
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:04,192
I will tell you why

1937
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,472
Because while listening

1938
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:09,312
I realize that he is a loser little

1939
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
Who is throwing a tantrum

1940
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:18,272
Criticism from people that what he did was

1941
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,064
Wasn't

1942
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,624
That people who are for gun

1943
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
Control are again

1944
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,184
So

1945
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,120
I think the point here is that

1946
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:38,240
This is a good explanation of what

1947
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:41,824
With Alex

1948
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,616
Because criticism

1949
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:48,480
Of him to work in his favor a lot of the time

1950
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:53,088
Dude I got to go in Bishop

1951
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,928
You're controlled opposition dude it's a good it's a good catch all

1952
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,464
It's a good catch all and it's

1953
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,000
Defect

1954
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:02,304
Really sounds like his feelings

1955
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,352
He really sounds like you

1956
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,376
You having that moment

1957
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:07,424
It's probably why he doesn't Court

1958
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
Because it's like

1959
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:14,336
Like criticism on a very real personal level.

1960
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,944
Personally I know but taking it personally allows him to

1961
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
And you like Sanger

1962
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:22,272
You're a lot more than most other feelings

1963
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:26,368
CID

1964
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,904
Feelings whatever they might

1965
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,720
Maybe about anything else

1966
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,488
For saying that

1967
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,536
He's controlled opposition

1968
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,304
Greenbelt lake

1969
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,328
What

1970
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,656
You going to do what I've done I'm great

1971
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,752
I think

1972
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:45,824
I don't know if you see ghosts

1973
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:48,896
I don't think

1974
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:54,784
Narcissism

1975
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,392
So I think

1976
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,208
January 7th

1977
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:02,976
Nice

1978
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:03,744
Stretch

1979
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,816
I think of the down

1980
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:09,120
I want to call it down

1981
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,400
Now we still got to wait

1982
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,960
Yeah but it's

1983
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,800
It took me was December 4th

1984
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:17,824
Who's the shooting

1985
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,360
And now January 8th

1986
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,152
Can say definitively

1987
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:21,920
Starts to

1988
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,456
Internalize

1989
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:27,808
Re report these a crisis actor

1990
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:31,904
If that's if that's

1991
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,000
I mean we're done

1992
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,536
Timestretch

1993
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:39,072
You got to still push forward and

1994
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,864
Houses develop

1995
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,912
But I'm glad

1996
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:49,056
No words fail us intellectually

1997
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:50,336
Interested

1998
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,896
Satisfied on some level curiosity

1999
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,224
We know this point is

2000
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:58,784
Mark

2001
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,112
Consequentially this is when he said what we expect

2002
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:06,464
Another one

2003
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,560
The result of

2004
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,632
Some crazy person

2005
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,936
He already knew it

2006
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,240
Also come into play

2007
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:21,568
He only is starting to really talk about this

2008
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:23,104
Sauce and put it for

2009
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,640
Because he has the cover

2010
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:27,456
We thought it would be Wolfgang halbig but it's not

2011
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
It's James Tracey

2012
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,760
Who is the initial

2013
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,808
Source of him being able to like

2014
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:33,344
I can talk about this now.

2015
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
This guy is

2016
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:40,256
He still wants to presented as I've known this for a long time

2017
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
I need that cover

2018
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:44,096
This scares me in terms of

2019
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:46,400
The investigation though just because

2020
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,424
I don't want

2021
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:48,960
To find out that the

2022
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:52,800
Six months are him s******* all over different

2023
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,568
People that he doesn't

2024
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:55,616
Piers Morgan still sucks

2025
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,384
And then six

2026
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,200
Slater there's somebody calls in

2027
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:02,016
Did you know that

2028
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,040
Sandy Hook we're crisis

2029
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,624
The whole thing

2030
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,744
Yeah there is

2031
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,280
These words

2032
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
Just don't work

2033
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,632
It would be frustrating

2034
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,192
Tremendously frustrating

2035
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:22,752
If it is a loss

2036
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
Like I cuz I

2037
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,360
I could see an outside chance that most

2038
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,920
Official for like at least a week is about.

2039
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,992
Easily see that

2040
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:38,624
Stories about Charlie Sheen doing that episode

2041
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,160
On that with Marty

2042
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,768
The WWE is about to introduce the

2043
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:47,584
Patriot character in early 2013

2044
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,888
So I know he's going to get sidetracked

2045
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,168
I do

2046
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,960
I do wonder how

2047
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,008
How much

2048
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:55,776
How

2049
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,824
Consistently he will view Sandy Hook

2050
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,616
As the primary thing that he

2051
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:01,920
When

2052
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
Because of his ego

2053
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
It's an open Quest

2054
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:12,160
I just want to know if he knows Emilio a

2055
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,512
You know Charlie Sheen are they

2056
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,168
April is the Boston bombing so like

2057
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:26,240
Coming down the pike

2058
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:31,616
Boston bomber

2059
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:34,688
Inspect for sure

2060
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:36,224
From the day

2061
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:45,184
Yeah it's whatever your frustration in whatever I'm worrying about being frustrated about

2062
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:47,744
Is possible

2063
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:49,792
So much

2064
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,816
That's going to happen

2065
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
Stretch

2066
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,632
Early 2013

2067
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:55,424
That this is going to be

2068
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:58,496
Sucks

2069
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,288
This is going to be drafted

2070
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,568
