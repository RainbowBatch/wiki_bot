Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,592
Just sit around to have novelty beverages in our mouths

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,384
And talk about

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,432
That's a weird start right there

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
I love having novelty beverage

6
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
Is it my mouth

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,112
Not a bad definition of what we do know I understand that it's just doesn't have a great

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:39,936
Mostly in my ears if I can be perfectly honest

12
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
We're thrilled with another episode hope you all had a wonderful Labor Day

13
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,432
Set a record

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
What's on Labor Day

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
To me is a more

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,088
David 911 or Memorial Day

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
Because this is the day to come

18
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648

Thousands of people who were

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,512
Murdered mercilessly at the

Let's start a revolution what was that

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,080
I don't think so

27
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:24,480
Revolution is a revolution

28
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040

00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
The 16th 2

68
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
To the 22nd

69
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,032
An out-of-context drop

70
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:24,800
From Alex Jones

71
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,408
Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean

72
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Great skin in episode 1

73
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,392
It wasn't because he freaking / Caribbean

74
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Oh boy

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,328
It was because it was ridiculous it was a stupid character

76
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
You aren't going to have

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,008
Caribbean Islanders a long time ago in a galaxy far far away

78
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
FairPoint

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
What's up

80
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Yeah

81
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
And somehow

82
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
You made me hate Jar Jar Binks

83
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:16,512
Yeah expertise with the guy

84
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
You're anyone who's there

85
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,751
Projecting a lot

86
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,799
Other than that Jar Jar Binks

87
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,103
I think he's being a little racy

88
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,759
At one point in this stretch of episode 3 going over at 5

89
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,063
Alex

90
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
At the time

91
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
About whether the new Star Wars was anti-white

92
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Because there was a black character

93
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,023
And it was

94
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,863
Arguing whether or not his anti-white trailer hitch come out

95
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
In a very ugly Circle.

96
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,983
It has been decided that the movie was anti-white

97
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
Stormtrooper character

98
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,223
One day get to that movie review

99
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,295
His statement on it was

100
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Literally

101
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
Every part of Star Wars is antifa

102
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:18,463
Somehow our dumbass political

103
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Bulshit Centrist Democrats

104
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
Trevor Noah can go f***

105
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,679
Himself off don't disagree

106
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
The guys who are fighting against fascism are the ones were fans of but when people actually fight against

107
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Some people like

108
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,615
Hold the f***

109
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
Is there spaceships

110
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,367
That caused a lot of property

111
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,647
That's a big issue

112
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
Yeah

113
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
Alex's

114
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
It might be

115
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,143
It might be a male

116
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
However

117
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
These Are Back In Ghostbusters territories sick of it

118
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,271
Strong female leads

119
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
But

120
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:20,159
He finally lands on it's not we just hate this black guy because he's a bad actor

121
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,559
How do you make

122
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
Just watch this trailer

123
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
That's it

124
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Let me get into this

125
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
If if he is underwater

126
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,575
Their armies clearly have underneath the water

127
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
I don't know

128
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
Isn't it

129
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Alex

130
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Star Wars

131
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
There's no doubt about that

132
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
16th east Arts out

133
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
The show

134
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,887
I am throughout a whole lot of the show angry it's something else that you might

135
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Nerd culture

136
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,727
That might surprise you quite a bit

137
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
Hispanic women

138
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,927
We support the Constitution

139
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,327
A Red Skull he was Hydro with a Nazis

140
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Cheerios

141
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Avengers

142
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:46,943
Here's the issue for everybody this is 0044 years ago

143
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Look up skull has working for him

144
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
Alex Jones

145
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Skull

146
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
Yes you do

147
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
Captain America

148
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
Sean.

149
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,991
Evil serpent group

150
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Ya think about that respect

151
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
It didn't really happen but it doesn't matter

152
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
So I just want to pause a second to teach

153
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:41,727
No cuz he's talking about Don Johnson killing it

154
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,895
Furious it fiction stuff because he thinks that other people will think it

155
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
It's real

156
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,039
Because his mind can't integrate everybody's brain works like

157
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,135
They're just so stupid

158
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
Is a depiction

159
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
Reality

160
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,303
Like if you're going to go for pesos

161
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,583
Chevrolet

162
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,399
The guy murdering innocent is

163
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,191
The bad guy

164
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Regardless

165
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,567
I mean of course if you go back to American history

166
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
Most people think that the Americans are there

167
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,175
Whenever they murdered

168
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,295
How did he

169
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,367
Copart

170
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
How dare you kill innocent

171
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Hispanic women

172
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
If you're saying that sarcastic

173
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
Don't you

174
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
Just him losing control of his

175
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:45,215
He's trying to

176
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:46,239
To get at is

177
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,287
Like it's not real

178
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,823
I think it's more of that

179
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Okay I think it's

180
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
I think it's the how dare you depict White

181
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
People murdering Hispanic

182
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,343
Novelization movie

183
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
How dare you do that

184
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
That seems obvious

185
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
I don't know book

186
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,327
It's this is a weird this is a weird f******

187
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
But throughout this

188
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Entire episode

189
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
16th east

190
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Combined

191
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
35 minutes

192
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Screaming about Red Skull

193
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,175
Pelvic Marvel has put him in the comic books

194
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,087
Working for Red Skull they're going to take off course

195
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,975
Parallels

196
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,791
There is right now

197
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
Bull Sturridge

198
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:51,263
Woodward for Red Skull discusses modern-day Red Skull

199
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
Accusation

200
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,103
Other people are

201
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Throwing around willy-nilly

202
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:02,015
That Russia has any culpability in Ukraine

203
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,599
Russia has to International military base

204
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Russia doesn't put fluoride in the water

205
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,463
Russia doesn't Force inoculate

206
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,839
Russia is a Marvel Comics

207
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Russia trying to stop

208
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,383
Islamic flow into Europe

209
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,575
Openly sharing George Soros wants to destroy America and Europe

210
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,903
Washers open

211
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
George Soros fund

212
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,399
Nazi collaborator

213
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,703
Almost

214
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,823
Runge MSNBC

215
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
And scores of other organization

216
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Free speech

217
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,575
Hoo-boy

218
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
If he doesn't like

219
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
White men

220
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,463
Running

221
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Networks wait till he hears about Rodger

222
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
I think he's a I think he has

223
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,399
Mixed feelings

224
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,959
About Rodger Ailes

225
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,775
That at the end there is really trouble

226
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
That list

227
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Together

228
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
Supposed allies I guess

229
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
The

230
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
George Soros and his team or against

231
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
World

232
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
The Russian government

233
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
So would you say that

234
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,351
Aligning himself with

235
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,167
He's okay

236
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,215
I think he's the coolest guy in the world

237
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,287
He pimps WorldNetDaily a bunch

238
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,223
Stillwrights over to Infowars

239
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:08,991
Yeah

240
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,343
I think it might be a downgrade

241
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,367
Zizek

242
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
Infowars eventually going to go down hard

243
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,743
Where's world problems

244
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
But it's

245
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,071
This is really troubling

246
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
This is really f****** awful

247
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,935
This whole time the grief you know

248
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
I think we've been wrestling ourselves with the idea whether or not we can be comfortable saying that Alex Jones really loves Russia problem

249
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
More than America

250
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:39,199
He loves Russia more than America

251
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:43,295
Look all Soros

252
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,135
Alex Jones

253
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Matt Drudge

254
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
The German government

255
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Japanese

256
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
Like during World War

257
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Yeah for sure

258
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,775
We even beat if you want to take a little bit more cautious

259
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,543
I would say

260
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,943
Definitely say without any exaggeration

261
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
Is Vicki

262
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
He's clearly seeing his narrative

263
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,039
In Russia

264
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
He's clearly sitting like you

265
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:23,231
Presenting Russia visit body mint of his ideas they don't fluoride ate the water

266
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Christianity

267
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,911
They do now towards keeping the radical islamist

268
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,239
4in screams about

269
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
How could you not be aligned with that

270
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
It's f***** up

271
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
Interesting about that is

272
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,663
He first starts with

273
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Russia only has

274
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
What's to

275
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,991
National basis

276
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Looking for

277
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
The same time though

278
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
He is

279
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Saying that Russia is

280
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,671
Keeping radical Islam

281
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
Out of Europe which is like

282
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
So you're saying that they key

283
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,071
All of Europe

284
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
Are you saying that

285
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
Keeping

286
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,423
European Russia

287
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,519
Cuz that seems more like

288
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
Never never recognizes that a lot of the stuff he's like cuz they keep encroaching

289
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:35,423
Pretty frequently about them just taking a farmhouse

290
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,727
Russia

291
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Yeah

292
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,287
Yeah I know

293
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,615
Yeah it seems like there

294
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,943
The same strategy that Israel uses on the Westbank

295
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,247
We live here now by

296
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,695
It's definitely feels a lot like a

297
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,743
Are you really going to attack us over 8

298
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,791
8 ft

299
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
Aggressive

300
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,519
I think it gets even worse than yours

301
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
Wants to say more great things about Russia

302
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:19,455
Russia in 1991

303
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Couldn't afford

304
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,487
George Soros gets up there

305
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
For Nazis

306
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
Police activity

307
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,319
I mean there's so many fun lies just didn't 35-second clip

308
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Even his

309
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Is regular narrative about doesn't have him

310
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,207
Helping invade Russia

311
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
Secret police

312
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Nah dude

313
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:10,911
Outlook regular lies are lies enough why are you a

314
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
Ramping it up

315
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
He's called to answer for why

316
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:21,151
Thesaurus was a Nazi collaborator the only answer he can ever give

317
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
And we've got over that

318
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
It doesn't say that he was a Nazi collaborator

319
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
It doesn't even

320
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
Come closer

321
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:32,415
Play secret police operations against its f****** Bazaar

322
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
This goes back to the

323
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,487
The gun free

324
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,535
The saying it was Bloomberg funded

325
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
Think it was CIA

326
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
You just making this s*** up

327
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
There's nothing behind

328
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,935
And then the other stuff

329
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
I mean it's just

330
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,495
It's just pathetic

331
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,639
Twisting a very pro-russian narrative

332
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,919
And even then

333
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,223
It's such a specific

334
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,063
Like knowing exactly

335
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
1991

336
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,391
They pulled their stuff away and you're like

337
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,439
You never know.

338
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Who wanted that information

339
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Go through your mouth

340
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Told you

341
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
Cuz he would never have

342
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,935
Never be able to pull it

343
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:22,847
Do you think he read anything about that

344
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Books on the American Civil War

345
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:35,647
The number of books he's read

346
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,535
We'll get back into that here in a little bit but for now Alex is done

347
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
Cuz

348
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
The 16th Alex is hidden

349
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
Actually ends up leaving

350
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Pretty classy

351
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,591
But before it does Alex is still mad about Marvel

352
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
You still mad about them depicting him as a servant of red

353
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,271
Adult wants to talk

354
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,879
He calls his audience

355
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
The action

356
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
It's a pretty absurd

357
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,863
Cover-more system or

358
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
We're on the March

359
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
Infowars life.com

360
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:38,623
Culture War

361
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:45,023
Roy Jenson

362
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
No one supports a hundred percent

363
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,103
Okay yep

364
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,895
Disney notorious

365
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,919
Chris

366
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:04,735
He was famous

367
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,759
Not for his anti

368
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,559
Yeah I do I think that's just an extension of Marvel

369
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,887
If this point

370
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,007
This episode I'm leaving out of town

371
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,311
Rambling about Captain America

372
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
I assure you it's not good

373
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:40,831
Clip form episode

374
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,183
No thanks

375
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,791
McDonald's Monsanto

376
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:54,143
Be torn apart we can agree without

377
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,703
McDonald's is like I would say so

378
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,359
Yeah I mean it's not the highest priority in the world

379
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
What's a dump

380
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
Producers

381
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
I do love

382
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,247
Is it going out to break it's a heartbreak

383
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,295
So you know you got that voice come again

384
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
Commercial

385
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,184
Until the exact moment

386
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,816
It might not happen

387
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,376

Values

392
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,248
No cuz they promote multiculturalism

393
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,296
You have all these different ethnicities

394
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Princesses

395
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,624
You know that's not traditional family

396
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,648
I don't know

397
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
Turn up my walk down the wrong road

398
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Yeah so far

399
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,424

Made a few bucks

404
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Okay

405
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
But like this

406
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
You're not the kind of guy that

407
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:21,184
Not the sort of demagogue who's going to sit around and issue commands to people and not do something

408
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,720
Himself

409
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
He's about Direct

410
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:28,864
About to start doing

411
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,296
And the border patrol shipping people

412
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,928
And completing the smuggling process it's just outrageous

413
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
Sparkly show today

414
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032

Guatemala

417
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,760
I can neither confirm nor deny that he followed through with his plan

418
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,856
It's a dumb plan to start with it's not great

419
00:23:54,624 --> 00:24:00,768
Who the f*** are you also are you what do you have a camera

420
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048

421
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,168
Doubt

422
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:11,008
You're f****** roided-out like crazy you're good

424
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,784
Recipe

425
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Concealed carry

426
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
I could spend a little while getting into

427
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:31,232
Like logic problem

428
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Aviv

429
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,584
The issues would be there

430
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
Number of issues

431
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
That he is wrong on

432
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
In that

433
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
1 likes

434
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984

436
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Already

437
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:49,408
That's wrong if you're if you're going with your metaphor for immigrants they don't

438
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Knock on the door

439
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
They go through it

440
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Tire proz

441
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Yeah

442
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,488
Difference like a whole folder

443

With a whole booklet of like here's all the s*** that I've got please give me food

444
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,888
And then the neighbor would be like

445
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,192
Okay

446
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,544
However I am going to need a multiple references

447
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Where is sandwich

448
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,992
Capable

449
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:25,760
Benefits from your knee

450
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,528
Neighbors

451
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,832
We will see you at

452
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,440
What's the most likely thing that would happen

453
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Is it he went and knocked on the door

454
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
Maybe like 10 your Alex Jones

455
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
And then they would reference

456
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
This next clip

457
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,592
Jesus and Mohammed

458
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,640
Believe me

459
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,224
By the way they didn't just tested I sprayed them with Gabe

460
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
The bladder

461
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,536
You think PCP

462
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
Some horse tranquilizer something

463
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
Gay bomb

464
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,416
What do you think baby

465
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
Break

466
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,312
Frog

467
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,616
Do you understand that

468
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
So

469
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
That's a classic Alex Jones

470
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
Yeah I remember that one will have to like redo the

471
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
And I'll have to say

472
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
This gay frogs

473
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
That's a gay bomb baby

474
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,872
So are the other thing is that the gay bomb

475
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,944
Is a theoretical weapon popularized

476
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
Theoretical weapon

477
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:37,344
Theoretical weapons and Iraq episode if I have call

478
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,440
And the idea of female hormones are pheromones

479
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
Battlefield

480
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,792
That's how I would become associated with other males

481
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
If you would end up wanting

482
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Tupac all the people in Moore

483
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
Are we sure our military isn't dumb

484
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Theoretical ideas

485
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,592
And sometimes these theoretical ideas that don't really work out

486
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
AR leak

487
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,408
At and that's when things get weird

488
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Because this is

489
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
. something that

490
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
Could successfully be done I don't know

491
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:11,392
A lot of projects are really just a

492
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,160
Like

493
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
The

494
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,328
Writers room of a sitcom had a couple of days off and I like it around

495
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:24,960
Let's just cut this clip

496
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,848
He's banging on his desk like a like a gorilla

497
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:37,760
Overall

498
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
I don't want to

499
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,320
The Frog

500
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:44,928
Papers everywhere

501
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Okay

502
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:53,888
Why why you're never

503
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,472
More

504
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
Apologize

505
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,384
He won't

506
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,416
Weather outlook for Northeast California record snow

507
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:23,072
Weather on the 9th

508
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,376
Children's lunch bags

509
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,216
Records

510
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,872
I just I just love the powerless moment as of like

511
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
I can't I can't go get those pages

512
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:43,040
Cuz I don't have a plan

513
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Not at all no

514
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
That's that's kind of

515
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Humanizing and pathetic

516
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Is ultimately

517
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:57,120
Pathetic my listen to of him and how much I have to engage with

518
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,680
I really do cherish the moment

519
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Screw things up for himself

520
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
Like I love the moments with you

521
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
But there's a problem that he has created

522
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,408
A bomb

523
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,944
Turn frogs gay

524
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,248
You probably faking that

525
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:19,392
Able just to make it look like he's even more mad over all of his headlines

526
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
He has to get someone to help him

527
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,000
That's a great like little narrative

528
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Silly

529
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:32,704
It's the Alex Jones Show

530
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
Shut up for him

531
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
Yeah him alone

532
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,360
And we are all metaphorically people have to pick up that paper

533
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
More or less

534
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
The socio dynamic

535
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,904
Part of this

536
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
We just have a Russian working

537
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,000
Name Daria

538
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,792
But every time

539
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,592
I figured off protest

540
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
I'm not making that accusation at all but it is

541
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
That's a wrap

542
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,624
This next clip we Alex Jones

543
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
Is Reno is a man

544
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
Who

545
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
Experiences in his life

546
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,512
In terms of getting him down to

547
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
This weird right wing

548
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Where's the

549
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Waco

550
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Was huge

551
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
And of course the Oklahoma City bombing

552
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,312
Was very big

553
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,128
Kentucky

554
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
I've done a bunch of look at

555
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,432
Two stuff that he says

556
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,296
He's all right about a lot of stuff but also don't

557
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
He's right about that is an interesting wrinkle

558
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,648
In the Oklahoma City argument remake

559
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,184
This is not an argument

560
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
He brings up very often we talked about Oklahoma City

561
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Weird

562
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Gay bomb

563
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:11,520
With their number one

564
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
While they persecute

565
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,344
I just know full well what

566
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Call swag

567
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
Probably

568
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:39,424
About to have a states rights

569
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,800
Oklahoma

570
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:57,856
Segal say

571
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
The lot of these are engineers

572
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
If you're go to

573
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,192
First piece of evidence

574
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Wdsf

575
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
I would

576
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,664
Even someone as dumb as Steven Seagal

577
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
But I can't imagine that's what you meant

578
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
What does noted

579
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
Patriot and

580
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,416
Martial artist hero band member of rose

581
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:39,072
Really yeah don't you remember I'm done I'm done everyone to die

582
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:45,472
That's not okay

583
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
Really

584
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:53,408
Because that's how bad Joe Arpaio as long as Joe Arpaio

585
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,088
Is what I got I got Hulk in the guy from Under Siege 2

586
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,112
Lubbock

587
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:04,928
Illegal immigrants

588
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,744
What's going on I got a law enforcement super team

589
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
Yeah

590
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
Is wildly speculative about the

591
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
Reason for the Oklahoma City bombing

592
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Based on everything I can find it is it

593
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,336
Correct Federal Building would stop

594
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
27 States getting together

595
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
To try and get out of the UN tornado we still have

596
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
A reasonable

597
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
I know this is

598
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,392
Is a tragedy

599
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
Let's deal with this let's take care of the victims

600
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,512
But we're still

601
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,352
I think that's how it would go with 27 States

602
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
Or Bandung

603
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
Gather over half

604
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,448
The country

605
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
Federal Building

606
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,336
Oklahoma City Oklahoma City

607
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
Twenty-seven other

608
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,384
States

609
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,504
Exactly

610
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
Why do you say very little

611
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
More than

612
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,256
I think I found a couple blog

613
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
That's not

614
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
Yeah but you know what

615
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Yeah

616
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,776
Little corroborated speculation

617
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,896
I spent I spent more of my Oklahoma City research time reading like Court transcript

618
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
People who were inside

619
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:35,296
Dream City and stuff like that

620
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
Russell Westbrook

621
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,000
Are part of a government that was a more useful

622
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
Use of my time

623
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
I am

624
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
I did not go to

625
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
Too deep into what Oklahoma was doing to get out of the UN

626
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
But

627
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,984
The stuff that I read it

628
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,080
This next clip

629
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
Commercial

630
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,272
Is when Alex Jones takes his supplements on the air

631
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,832
We're completely overrun

632
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,648
If you come over

633
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
What you got

634
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,488
Call

635
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,304
I got to pay the bills here also

636
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:33,920
It's just really bad

637
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Name some

638
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Lou Ferrigno

639
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,024
His work so well for him

640
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Maywood

641
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
The face he's making it

642
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Terrifying

643
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
2 Sports

644
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,224
Already said

645
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,064
Then he takes more

646
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,280
It doesn't lead to too much

647
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
He ends up going

648
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:29,216
Nuts

649
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:32,288
Put some of them almost a boar contemplatively

650
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:34,848
Pinterest doesn't really freak out too much

651
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,384
It's not like a a Trainwreck

652
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
That don't

653
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,088
I would do be very calm and stoic

654
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Splatoon

655
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
Choose wisdom over

Sanger

657
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Keep themselves level

658
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:01,216
Well I don't know if it's an advantage

659
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
In the UFC

660
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
The Ring 2

661
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,312
To tell your opponent more than you should

662
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:10,688
But to be a side effect of super male vitality

663
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:15,552
Different Strokes for different folks

664
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
Stroke

665
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:37,824
Chilling, talking about all this and I'll blow up

666
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
My kids are bad or something

667
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,296
That's true I agree with that last Prime

668
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,392
Yep the blowup

669
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,208
Once a week to make sure

670
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,024
I got a quota to therapy for me

671
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,352
Even if that is accurate than he's a mentally ill per

672
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
Be more than once

673
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,960
I mean clearly

674
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:10,336
There's no way that that clip isn't damning and illustrating that he knows what he's doing

675
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Fraudulent

676
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,128
So

677
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
If you are timing out

678
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
Fake the world

679
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
Bulshit gets about once a week

680
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:26,464
Like a lot of people dressed in the world

681
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:32,096
To deal with

682
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,936
Is getting really drunk is screaming about gay frogs

683
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Dan wants

684
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Alright

685
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
Well I'm saying most

686
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Just would love it

687
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
If it was

688
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:44,896
Now that's fair

689
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,504
I'm talking about the middle class

690
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,552
The Forgotten man

691
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
Yeah

692
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,392
I'm like that

693
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
Remember you was talking about planning

694
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Some stunts

695
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
He revisits the

696
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
The premise and tries to bring

697
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,072
Storm some more stunts

698
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:07,936
That's a good idea I think he noticed Hillary for prison

699
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,032
I'm sure it is becoming really successful

700
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,568
The jackass stuff

701
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,616
But go out there with the camera

702
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Through someone's house

703
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,736
I was like I'm a migraine let me and you'd also be like

704
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,296
Infowarsstore.com

705
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,880
Brainstorming

706
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Couple more stops

707
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,704
Amadeus

708
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,264
Alright

709
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,072
George Soros

710
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:13,728
That's a weird

711
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:14,496
Know if

712
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Migrants

713
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,544
Sleep online

714
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Cork tables

715
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,104
I don't know if

716
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,200
I don't know if that's going to be able strativentures real placard sleeping the mayor's house

717
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
Totally

718
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,136
I'm going to start pulling legal stance and then he just listen bunch of

719
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,976
Illegal things I feel like that's not a good idea

720
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,024
That's not how that works

721
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,096
I'm pretty sure if you were actually a migrant

722
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:46,496
You would be put in jail for that go kill somebody

723
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
If you if you just

724
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,104
Kidnap Hillary and put her in a prison that's

725
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Right

726
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,199
Yeah and then it's all branded Hillary for prison

727
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Hillary

728
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,503
Is now in prison

729
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,367
Prison prison Bonita was Joe Arpaio prison

730
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,439
Navigation

731
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,535
I believe that we have started to departo into the water of

732
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,095
It's a new series that I've been building up

733
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
In my head

734
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,911
Alex Jones

735
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,447
Okay

736
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
I think

737
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,519
Outside of

738
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Conservative

739
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,823
Which is too far

740
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Look

741
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,919
At this point

742
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,455
That's that's your part for the

743
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
Sovereign citizen

744
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,343
I don't believe so I don't think I don't think

745
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,367
You know enough about them

746
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
That's probably true

747
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,231
In this next clip

748
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:42,559
Towards the end of the show he gets a call from a sovereign citizen

749
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,887
Okay

750
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,471
Here is the beehive

751
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,263
Response

752
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:01,503
Diction and something that most Americans don't actually understand

753
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,855
The Constitution article 3 section 2 provides for three separate jurisdiction

754
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,159
Equity in Hamilton

755
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:14,047
We're common law common lies with the nation was founded upon that goes back to the Magna Carta

756
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
It's really simple

757
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:19,167
Don't injure don't harm others or their property and don't use for on your contract

758
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,287
Crimes committed under the common law require there to be a corpus delicti or an injured party

759
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:28,383
What is the jurisdiction of contract

760
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,991
And finally we have a prediction which is the Los Angeles area

761
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:38,623
Refuses to kill potatoes and ordered it's a criminal act even if there is no injured party

762
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Jurisdiction that the United States citizens are criminally prosecuted

763
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:53,215
If you were in the military and the. I was jurisdiction over the General Public

764
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
Add to be one of the dominant forms of law

765
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,687
Yeah he knows

766
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:09,087
And it's sticking to the colonists it was actually one of the Prime reasons behind Revolution

767
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,391
Every Courtney United States today the jurisdiction is

768
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,887
Off your front porches or from school

769
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:32,895
And what you can't do it you can't license attorney can't actually go into court and make this kind of jurisdictional

770
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:50,559
And I actually did that pretty recently to get a minor traffic and thrown out and it was a nose pretty rewarding

771
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,167
Turn officer didn't show up for court

772
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,983
Nope nope common law

773
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,639
I don't buy this system I want to read to you from the Southern Poverty Law Center there

774
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,687
On the

775
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,455
The sovereign

776
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,295
The Contemporary Sovereign belief system is based on a decades-old

777
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,063
Conspiracy theory

778
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:14,111
At some point in history

779
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:19,231
American government

780
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
Refer to as common law

781
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,071
Was secretly replaced by a new government

782
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
Admiralty law

783
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,911
The law of the sea and International,

784
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,703
Under common law

785
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,983
Or so they believe

786
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
The sovereign

787
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
Ozarks

788
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
The law of

789
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:39,711
Blobfish

790
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
The sovereigns would be Freeman

791
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,343
Under admiralty law

792
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
Secret government Force

793
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
The best interest in keeping them.

794
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,487
Don't believe this perfidious

795
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,071
Occurred during the Civil War While others blame the events of 1933

796
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,607
When the u.s. abandon the gold state

797
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,167
Either way they State their lives and livelihoods

798
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,519
Judges around the country government

799
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,823
But our emotions

800
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,151
Out of a treasonous loyalty malevolent government forces

801
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,199
Step that sounds

802
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,015
Everyday

803
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:14,783
Secret law

804
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,159
That's like Newsradio

805
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
I immediately find a favor of the

806
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
And then it goes back

807
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:26,047
The rest of this

808
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,655
Goes into the idea of that whenever you're born your corporate

809
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
Because your Capital admiralty law

810
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,895
In order to make you a slave and to create treasury account

811
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Sing your name

812
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:44,223
And if you go through a process called

813
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
Are you sending

814
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,831
All of your documents

815
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
Back to the government and we're now

816
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Your

817
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
Status as a corporate

818
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,463
Or whatever

819
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,535
You can access to all the money in the treasury

820
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
That makes sense

821
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,631
And you're free from any of these admiralty laws because you worth

822
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
The others

823
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,775
Sing that's really f***** up is that because they believe in this common law thing

824
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
That the founders set up

825
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,847
They don't believe in amendments

826
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,615
Most of them

827
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:20,319
They believe that every election that's been how

828
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,623
Held where women can vote is null and void

829
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,927
Toledo authority of the president

830
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,999
Okay be on because of all of these beliefs

831
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:30,047
It I mean it's just clear that they

832
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
Respect the authority of

833
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,703
Law enforcement officer

834
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,239
You are really selling

835
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Maybe they got a point

836
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,151
Certificate got a point

837
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,199
Now they are they are they are

838
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Really scary

839
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
As a whole

840
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:52,831
It's weird to me

841
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,623
I mean not

842
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,647
Idea of a

843
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
It just has a loophole

844
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,767
Oh man I hope nobody finds out otherwise they have

845
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,559
To all the money

846
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,959
I don't think all of them believe that but a large

847
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
Within the sovereign

848
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,591
Citizens there's a bunch of

849
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Related Group

850
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,663
It's like the three men on the land

851
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,503
If it's

852
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,319
Wild rabbit hole to go down

853
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,879
What where we fall on the

854
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
Stupid Orange

855
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Are these p

856
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Truly

857
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,631
People on the planet I think it's a really compelling an interesting way for mental illness

858
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:41,727
I think that there's probably a number of people who are a little bit

859
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
Obsessive

860
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
Maybe a little bit

861
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
Superman

862
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,823
And they get in

863
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
To reading

864
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,615
Court documents

865
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,663
I misinterpret a bunch of things

866
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
Reading Court.

867
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,039
Probably on the

868
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
Or me

869
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,903
Starting for the probably on the insane

870
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:05,535
Not them

871
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,839
Because I am fascinated by

872
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Ghetto friend group

873
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Stuff like that

874
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,447
Desperation

875
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,751
Enfranchisement that would make you want to

876
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,287
Be free

877
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,335
If you don't feel free sure

878
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,663
Put a lot of their victim is dependent on

879
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Everyone else not

880
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,735
That is a problem

881
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Spiritually on some level of feeling of like this

882
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
Human existence

883
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,903
Somehow isn't right

884
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,927
I understand that

885
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,743
Could be channeled into this

886
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Weird

887
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Conspiratorial

888
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
Life Plan

889
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:41,631
I don't support

890
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
Is giving them a lot

891
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Fair enough

892
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,727
But I get

893
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,031
The idea that Alex Jones

894
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
Some of this

895
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
That's weird to me that's not great

896
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:53,407
Cuz if he believes in all this common-law stuff

897
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
It's not a far leap to assume that

898
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
You also believe

899
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,527
In the corporate

900
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,855
He can just go to court

901
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,647
Not respect the authority

902
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,695
Or something like that

903
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,999
It seems very strange to me

904
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,047
If you did read about his test

905
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:12,351
Testimony in his

906
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,191
Feeling good he doesn't respect

907
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Do you know diesel

908
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,543
I don't know I don't have enough evidence

909
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:22,847
Auburn citizen

910
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,639
He sure seems conversant

911
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,687
To an extent that I am not

912
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,759
He's starting to show shades of it

913
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,319
So

914
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,623
What's the end of Friday

915
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:35,391
October 6th

916
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
No show on Saturday

917
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,975
Come back on Sunday the 8th

918
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
No Trump on

919
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
Nothing nothing

920
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,167
Oh yeah I forgot

921
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,215
I'm running out of

922
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,775
I don't know why because

923
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,247
That's what it's becoming clear

924
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
That's super

925
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,855
I feel like we started out the episode with those

926
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,159
Bethesda chocolates

927
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:11,487
Sopranos

928
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,047
On Sunday Alex Jones

929
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,679
1954 all over again

930
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
So Alex on Sunday

931
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
I have a new plan

932
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
He is going

933
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
I think

934
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,639
But he started to feel like

935
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,711
I'm not doing a good enough job of being

936
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,735
Pacific

937
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,807
I think you have a quiet moment

938
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,831
Or something like that

939
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,719
2 drips a super male Vitality got very contemplatively

940
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,535
I know that I'm making a good argument

941
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,863
But I fear I'm not being

942
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,935
Cific enough about what I'm talking about right

943
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,519
Considering the fact that we have

944
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,543
No idea what

945
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
He's talking about

946
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,663
Exegesis

947
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
So he comes in hot

948
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
On Sunday

949
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,039
With a new plan that is going to make everything clear

950
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,183
We're going to start profiling globalist

951
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:16,511
Restart profiling from my research who I believe

952
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,631
The owners

953
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,311
We're also going to look at the top managers

954
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Ma

955
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,919
Peter Sutherland

956
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,735
Goldman Sachs Europe

957
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,831
BP worldwide

958
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,487
Homogenic

959
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Use migration

960
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,399
This is the guy engineering the radical Islamic

961
00:52:54,655 --> 00:53:00,799
Influx right now

962
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,383
James Bond villain

963
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,175
So

964
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Not really

965
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,759
He's I mean

966
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,319
When I miss evolve

967
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,159
It's kind of all just a little portly but I think it's kind of petty to

968
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,951
Make Bruno appearance-based

969
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
Complaints about your Big Sur

970
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,047
Supervillains

971
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,351
Why are you starting

972
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:28,959
Also Crystal was a James Bond villain in the most

973
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,383
Number of BP

974
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,407
Do you know all this

975
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,015
You got a decent amount of his

976
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
Resume

977
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,087
Before we go any further

978
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
Provisionally

979
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
On the side of Alex

980
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
Guaranteeing the Peter Sutherland

981
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Is a month

982
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
Yeah

983
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
I mean he's not great

984
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
Sure

985
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,727
See there we go all of these

986
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,591
Anyone who is a billionaire a billionaire is a murderer

987
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
Fine

988
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,991
That's fine it's okay for maybe our boy Xavier

989
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,183
Every super rich person is awful until proven otherwise

990
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,743
The same time it's not the same as what Alex does

991
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,535
No that's not it like

992
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,327
It's not fair to conflate

993
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,375
Healthy distrust

994
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
A really rich people with

995
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,727
They're all a pedophile Network

996
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
Who want to

997
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
You know bringing migrants

998
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,823
To kill Christians

999
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,919
Bring back the gold I don't know

1000
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,503
I do have feeling go that the enemy of my enemy

1001
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,343
Team up with Alex against these guys

1002
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,415
Long as it's just me and Alex Morgan

1003
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:56,255
There's a lot more traffic

1004
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Avallac'h

1005
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,351
Not against

1006
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
Against

1007
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,215
Taking down the Russian oligarchs

1008
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,103
It seems like you should include them in their global

1009
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,943
I think he's

1010
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:19,039
I don't think he has any kind of ideological

1011
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,343
Bulshit

1012
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Like I said

1013
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
He comes in he's hot

1014
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
You is going to start doing this in order to

1015
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,975
Build his case

1016
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
Profile

1017
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Pacific global

1018
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:31,839
I can tell you I listen to about

1019
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,887
Two weeks more after this episode

1020
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
This is a one-off

1021
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:40,031
At this point. A series

1022
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,079
Of course

1023
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,383
Strangers just search

1024
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,175
Peter Sutherland

1025
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,503
Show you a picture of myself

1026
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,295
And just look at this

1027
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,831
Task

1028
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:57,439
It looks like a microwave

1029
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:01,791
Version of Mini-Me riding in the Sun

1030
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:06,911
A shiza

1031
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,727
Batman Returns

1032
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
Phenomenon

1033
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:18,175
And it is just popelli pedophile

1034
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
Disgusting

1035
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,759
The scene is slime sucker

1036
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:25,087
Going around you know what when I really go after Mr Sutherland

1037
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
Is the fact

1038
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
Of what he did to Ireland

1039
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,967
He's the one that. Ireland

1040
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,271
He's like the first man of Ireland

1041
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Bill Clinton

1042
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,695
He's on the screen

1043
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:10,143
He's the guy that took Ireland from England number one economically engine in

1044
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:12,191
Europe for 15 years

1045
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:18,591
Got them to sign onto the EU

1046
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:31,647
Where is green green umbrellas

1047
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,023
Glioma

1048
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:43,423
Sutherlands

1049
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,447
Poker for you

1050
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,751
No that's not a good actor

1051
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:57,759
Other reason for ever the number one economic driver

1052
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,807
Teen years running

1053
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,087
15 years running

1054
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
The greatest

1055
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:08,767
Economy

1056
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Yeah

1057
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,351
Nothing

1058
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,887
First of all Peter Sutherland

1059
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
From Ireland

1060
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,239
He is an Irishman so

1061
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,543
He was born

1062
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
E46

1063
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
Is Irish international business

1064
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,383
Former attorney

1065
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:31,039
Define gate party

1066
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:36,415
To go on is involved with Ireland

1067
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
Becoming part of

1068
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
Yeah that's what he said

1069
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
Classic

1070
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
Vague Alex

1071
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
Postulates

1072
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:48,959
It's all character assassination is all insulting your ugly

1073
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,031
Is a reanimated

1074
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:56,127
Thwart

1075
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:00,223
Give me what you close your eyes and think reanimated

1076
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
There's a cartoon War

1077
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,159
It's voice by TJ Miller in this

1078
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
And then it comes back as a zombie

1079
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,487
Herbert West

1080
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,815
Reanimated up now you've got a dead report walking

1081
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,887
I immediately went

1082
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,167
Zombie form of

1083
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
King Arthur

1084
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,983
If you recall he was called War

1085
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,591
I do not recall that because

1086
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Insane

1087
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Anyways

1088
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,711
Alex Gordon

1089
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
Alex is big

1090
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,319
Plan to profile specific globalist

1091
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,343
Ends up

1092
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,903
With him yelling about how ugly Peter Sutherland is

1093
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,183
I'm not being like

1094
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
Talk about his looks

1095
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:44,767
Ireland

1096
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,727
International body

1097
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,543
And so of course it's just like that's it

1098
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,383
And then he goes to commercial he comes back with nothing

1099
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,223
That's it would he be

1100
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,271
For the Soviet Union Oregon

1101
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,647
Cuz that is an international but I think it comes down

1102
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,463
Has Alex brushed up on his Russian impression

1103
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
Cuz if

1104
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:25,983
If you

1105
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
Maybe it's version

1106
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,359
I don't know

1107
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,735
Did not prepare at all

1108
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
Northern

1109
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,623
Come on man

1110
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
Come on man so instead

1111
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,279
Getting into more detail about Peter Sutherland

1112
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,071
You were even saying

1113
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
Knowing nothing about them

1114
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,655
There's plenty you could get into about the fact

1115
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,191
Bilderberg

1116
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:58,239
He did was there

1117
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,775
If you call

1118
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,079
Evil organization

1119
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,639
Secret sources in access to all these documents

1120
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,711
Have a dossier worse than that steel thing

1121
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:15,647
It's Sunday it's a slow news day

1122
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,439
Adidas entire two-hour show

1123
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
It's a shorter show on

1124
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,047
It's breaking down

1125
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,351
I hate Peter Sutherland here's why

1126
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
Instead he insulted look

1127
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Batman doesn't Irish accent

1128
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
He got him until

1129
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Great

1130
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,311
Yeah I don't care

1131
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:36,383
The great profile

1132
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,455
I think he thought that this is going to be like

1133
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
I think he felt like

1134
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,783
This profiling globalist

1135
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,551
Is going to be ahead

1136
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,087
And then he got it

1137
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
Message forgot

1138
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
Do the pro

1139
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
That seems like

1140
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,791
You know sometimes you get on stage with a new bit that you're going to do anything

1141
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,839
You've got a kill and then you get on stage and realize

1142
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,935
Peace out at all bailed

1143
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,007
Doing the accent

1144
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,823
Connect to profile more globalized

1145
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,479
Although Maybe

1146
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,271
Thesaurus into a dead horse

1147
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,831
Saving him for

1148
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
I don't know

1149
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:23,743
More about Peterson

1150
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,791
Instead of doing anything productive

1151
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Alex Jones gets

1152
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,887
Because there's a there's a

1153
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,655
The clip

1154
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
Hillary Clinton

1155
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,215
Talking about

1156
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
How

1157
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,567
In the Australia they had a gun buyback program

1158
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,359
That's right

1159
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,943
I am so this clip starts at 8

1160
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,735
Made there

1161
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Homicide rate

1162
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,855
You did it was a very sick

1163
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,671
Sometimes it's a good idea to look at

1164
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
Experiments that other

1165
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,999
Have tried

1166
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
Successful in urination

1167
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
That's

1168
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,887
Growing the entire world

1169
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,447
You sound dumb

1170
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,519
Hillary Clinton

1171
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,591
At the beginning of this clip

1172
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,639
Really.

1173
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
I know that I'm saying everyone's done but it is

1174
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
The first two were jokes

1175
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:24,927
Showtime they were able to

1176
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:38,495
And the real Crocodile Dundee

1177
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:42,591
Is 5 shot

1178
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
What did you just say

1179
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,247
Actually even wrong he said that he shot three cops

1180
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,647
I've done a lot of research

1181
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Working today

1182
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,535
Oh no I read a bunch of articles about this guy

1183
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,143
Didn't realize I don't know anything about the real Crocodile Dundee

1184
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:44,031
Real crocodile and then my

1185
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:44,799
Interest

1186
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,335
Ended right there as like

1187
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:51,455
Look up

1188
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
Disappointing that he didn't

1189
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:00,159
Turn off

1190
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,279
Rodney

1191
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,375
Dundee character is just a guy from the bush

1192
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:11,935
Loves animals

1193
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,239
Goodnight Kim give you a good one-liner

1194
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:19,359
Right Mountain Man archetype in Australia

1195
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,711
And he survived

1196
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
In the wilderness

1197
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
That's for a couple weeks

1198
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,575
Like sleeping in a tree

1199
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,695
That's on life

1200
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,487
Alright

1201
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,607
Taylor Swift

1202
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:42,911
Same character as Crocodile Dundee

1203
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,447
As portrayed by Paul Hogan

1204
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,079
Like a real Crocodile Dundee Rodney and sell

1205
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
Inspiration

1206
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,431
For the used the sort of quirky behaviors like

1207
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,991
You went to a hotel and insisted on sleeping in a sleeping bag

1208
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:01,087
Like these sorts of things that make the character what he is our

1209
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,367
Literally ripped for

1210
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:05,695
Little little character details that are

1211
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
Distinguish

1212
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:10,815
From story

1213
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
From

1214
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
Myra

1215
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,447
I was going to read this to you about what happened

1216
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,727
To Rodney answer

1217
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:24,127
Rodney was killed in August 1999 in south of the city of Darwin

1218
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:25,151
Australia

1219
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,711
He was the inspiration for the Paul Hogan character but

1220
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,807
To hear him tell it he got more last cut out of the profits of the movie

1221
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,087
That's almost certain

1222
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,743
Get paid anything

1223
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,279
Little but no matter what

1224
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,655
The early 1990s

1225
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,959
Using her super bad financial situation

1226
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:52,031
In 1992 he was convicted of stealing cattle in

1227
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
Assaulting a Rancher

1228
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,871
So

1229
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,663
Does have a criminal record

1230
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:02,015
Alex Jones

1231
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,879
Common law

1232
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:11,487
Second 1999

1233
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:18,143
Answer by Crocodile Dundee girlfriend

1234
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:22,239
Variety of

1235
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
Who kidnap their children

1236
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:28,127
History of killing young girls in bizarre ritual

1237
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:33,759
Children earliest they were adults

1238
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:35,039
When was 21

1239
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,087
And so she got

1240
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,671
The Illuminati or Freemasons

1241
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,695
I kidnap them

1242
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
And

1243
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:45,023
Let me just think about how similar this is to Alex Jones

1244
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,119
She f****** with him

1245
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:53,215
I am so sorry

1246
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Just like Frank

1247
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:59,871
It's official

1248
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,783
I just want to put a pin in it really emphasized that this idea to Freemason

1249
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,623
Kidnap their children

1250
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,439
Things to see from a couple of speed

1251
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,791
As opposed to out who does his own weird supplements

1252
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
Diane cell went off with a gun

1253
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
Trying to get his children

1254
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,519
Not good that evening he shot two men and Darwin while just shooting it some Caravan

1255
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,127
A reason I can't find an explanation

1256
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,175
So we don't know exactly why

1257
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:37,759
And I will quote now from the news

1258
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,063
Dave's Discount

1259
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
The quoting from The Herald Sun

1260
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,951
Ansul fire stick shot their Caravan on kentish Road

1261
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,999
Resident David Hodgdon jumping

1262
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,047
Double barrel shotgun

1263
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
I went to investigate.

1264
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
He lost an eye when

1265
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,679
I'll put a bullet through the windscreen of his truck

1266
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,239
Jesus

1267
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,055
The state of his mates face

1268
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,335
I grabbed the baseball bat

1269
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,639
Oh that's why

1270
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,455
You lied about them

1271
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:10,271
Sweet grab this dude Brian Williams grab the baseball bat

1272
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,415
This is already like

1273
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
Given me

1274
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,743
8 different bad decisions

1275
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,279
From everyone involved

1276
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,303
Already

1277
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,887
Down the forehead

1278
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,751
And that's when he blew my hand off that's a really

1279
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,359
Crazy

1280
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:37,663
Hilarious he was going on and on about

1281
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:42,271
Stealing his children and Freemasons and being a baby killer he was just mad

1282
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,647
And tell fired shots at the Williams house

1283
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Then he ran away

1284
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,487
His rifle in one hand Mr Hodgdon shotgun in the other

1285
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,935
He actually took away other people

1286
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,495
Who runs into the bush

1287
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
And tries to hide

1288
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,103
38

1289
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Google's worker

1290
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,527
Yeah I know I'm not sure

1291
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
Add some sort of

1292
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,135
Removals

1293
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,951
Was leaning on a cart

1294
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
The size of a baseball in his power

1295
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
Jesus

1296
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:30,911
So

1297
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:35,775
He's a cop car and he shoots this

1298
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,103
Shoot the base

1299
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:44,991
So I don't feel that this point are all Berkey it's murky but who cares

1300
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:49,087
He ends up killing a cop and then they kill him

1301
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,623
You up in his

1302
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,159
Trying to get out of the woods

1303
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,743
I guess he's still probably on a speed high right

1304
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Realize

1305
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
I just shot a guy's hand off

1306
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,607
I just shot it like there

1307
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,007
Didn't have his kid

1308
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,847
And so he ends up killing One Cop

1309
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,871
Shooting him not in the

1310
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:12,639
Beside

1311
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,919
And like bleeds out

1312
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,967
Gun battle

1313
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,735
Persist

1314
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,759
Do you know what the

1315
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
This story is

1316
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
What's up

1317
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,111
To get rid of Regulation

1318
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,159
Mentally ill

1319
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
From getting guns

1320
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,863
That even if he was even if he was like mentally ill I think they would still buy it

1321
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,399
Use the realtor

1322
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
Celebrity

1323
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:42,335
Paul Hogan murdering

1324
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,615
Poor people in a cup

1325
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:47,199
Jesus no no no no no

1326
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:58,463
Baseball-sized I think he survived

1327
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
Alright

1328
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:02,047
Don't be quoted on it

1329
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,095
I know at least

1330
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,191
Him down in a fire

1331
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,495
Sly

1332
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
About

1333
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,311
Crocodile the real Kraken

1334
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
But in fact

1335
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,407
The real Crocodile Dundee

1336
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:26,879
So long as it is black people who probably killed that cop with a stolen gun

1337
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,975
Of course and Alex's version of knocked on his door

1338
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,071
Such b*******

1339
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:41,727
Probably from some weird unsourced blog

1340
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:47,103
I don't know but if you look at reality he was on

1341
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:54,527
The coroner I believe this quote was very is no doubt that this man was in a phetamine psychosis

1342
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,719
Maisie Dobbs on this show

1343
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
Texas f******

1344
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,303
It seems intentionally wrong

1345
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
It seems like

1346
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:09,119
He doesn't care how wrong is

1347
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
He just doesn't like that it

1348
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
Is hero

1349
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
Paul Hogan

1350
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,007
Associated with this

1351
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:19,615
1999

1352
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,711
How am I going to spend there

1353
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,015
The f*** out of here

1354
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:26,783
You're done

1355
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,599
Open up

1356
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,159
What's going to be the rest

1357
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
October 18th

1358
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
No Trump

1359
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,743
Cranky butt

1360
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:37,791
What's fine for you

1361
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,679
So the rest of the show Alex tries to take phone

1362
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
Because

1363
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:49,823
Hilarious

1364
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:54,431
Alex gets Superman before he even lets him on air

1365
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
That doesn't

1366
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,479
Listen to the call

1367
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,271
Who's being very reasonable

1368
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,039
And just

1369
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,319
Freaks out at home

1370
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,903
Because one of his patent

1371
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:08,767
Just two days after the last one

1372
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,791
The must be in the position

1373
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,095
Mental illness and not intentional performing

1374
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,519
Jewish

1375
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
Masonic

1376
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Honda

1377
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,735
You're good

1378
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:55,871
Can you hear me

1379
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:10,719
No I'm not I'm not sure if you want

1380
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:33,503
Paranoid after waking up

1381
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,271
The first time

1382
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:36,575
Everything

1383
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,111
Everything

1384
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:51,167
Emergency Center

1385
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:04,223
Evil Society controllers with the idea of you being like an information

1386
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,855
The first time you and get your version of

1387
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,511
There's always danger version

1388
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,543
A spoonful of sugar help the medicine go down

1389
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,615
Just congratulate

1390
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,687
On discovering the truth

1391
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:48,511
I'm just sick of that question like I'm sick of people

1392
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:55,167
It's like Chinese water torture religious

1393
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:57,215
Boy I don't think

1394
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
Galax doesn't

1395
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:02,335
No cuz we different

1396
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:06,431
Does the color code of just made his

1397
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
Very reasonable point

1398
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:17,695
Do you know everything you thought was wrong is always true is wrong

1399
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:24,095
I want to reassure you that I'm on the right side

1400
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,263
Watch another show

1401
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,103
Trying to get where you calling from

1402
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,663
There are a lot of people that believe he's controlled opposition

1403
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
Necessarily think that

1404
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,735
Hi-Tech controls

1405
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,087
Experience I don't

1406
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,159
I don't see him as being what the people

1407
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,303
Much credibility

1408
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
At him up as a gatekeeper and what have you

1409
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
Now that doesn't make

1410
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:04,287
So that's one problem in that

1411
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,015
He gets himself rock-hard before he even gets into that call

1412
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:18,367
Screaming before he brings

1413
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
He wanted

1414
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:19,903
Somebody

1415
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
Against

1416
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,999
Yeah

1417
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
You heard the change

1418
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,351
I think it was

1419
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,167
I have no cardio

1420
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
He like

1421
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,751
He's a boxer who would like

1422
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,287
Tire out in the second round

1423
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,847
He's just not worked on his fundamentals

1424
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:41,919
You can scream for about 2 minutes

1425
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
I couldn't scream for 2 minutes

1426
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
Probably

1427
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:58,303
First Call

1428
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,071

The first call

1430
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,959
Very weird

1431
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:05,983
Quite a bit

1432
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:10,335
Pencils

1433
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,639
Thanks so much Alex

1434
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:19,039
I like to speak very briefly about 911 feedback in the news recently in the back and forth between us

1435
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Bush

1436
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
Very short prayer

1437
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
Almighty father

1438
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,255

Guidance

1443
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,727
Inspiration to a true

1444

Fries and stuff with

1445
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,799
Selfless Patriots

1446
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:41,823
From within

1447
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,359
The ranks of our military

Illegally

1453
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,439
Anymore Lee classified in

1454

Amen amen

1456
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,911
Minute

1457
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:11,775
That's a prayer to reveal Saudi Arabia

1458
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,872
That's a very strange

1459
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
Please

1460
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,432
Please grant me the strength

1461
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,760
To hate Saudi Arabia as much even though

1462
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
Quickly is our Ally

1463
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:25,856
I am done

1464
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,136
I mean

1465
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,976
Saudi Arabia was involved

1466
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,816
You could guess that from the fact that everyone was

1467
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:40,448
You could just be like a lot of

1468
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,776
Fiber formation

1469
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,056
I think is in the 28

1470

Yeah it's like

1476
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,744
The 28 pages is just

1477
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,280
All the proof that Global is

1478
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:09,120

You can believe it's the f******

1481
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,776
It seems like the red herring or whatever classical

1482
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,056
The suitcase

1483
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:22,944
If you were the United States government and you had perpetrated 911 you wouldn't be like well

1484
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:27,552
Will write it down

I'm sure they'll still Trust

1489
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,680
Is about where we drop off

1490
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,216
With the 18

1491
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,128
Very wet but I don't know I don't know what to do

1492
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,920
I don't know what to do anymore

1493
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:55,200
Why does

1494
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,784
I mean I understand it as a sort of meditative effect

1495
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:03,136
Please don't let me

1497
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
That would really

1498
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
Play Bob Meowth

1499
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:15,168
Is a little bit of what happened on there

1500
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,008
Alex Jones here in Chicago

1501
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080

1507
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,744
He's learned about that

1508
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,656

1521
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,912
Possibly

1522
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:25,056
No.

1523
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
Whatever

1524
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,384
He goes on a Long Jacket

1525
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,688
About how psychos like to attack women

1526
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
Children because they grow

1527
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,808
Make sense psychos get more out of it cuz mine are too strong

1528
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:38,368
Mountain strong to make scared

1529
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:42,208
So that's not internalized sexism at all

1530
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
Toxic mask

1531
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,048
Not at all he also says that he doesn't

1532
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
Make is good do their homework

1533
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,656
Cuz he encourages them to just be more manipulative

1534
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:57,824
Get things out of your f******

1535
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:01,664
On the show

1536
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,712
The only thing I regret not pulling

1537
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,016
But I felt like it was petty of me to do so

1538
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:10,112
Is IU goes on a long rant about how some ambassador's daughter

1539
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,696
Is sexually aroused by the idea of killing him

1540
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:18,048
Cuz you was on MSNBC talked about how much she hates Alex Jones

1541
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,352
Look at

1542
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,216
Not those words

1543
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:27,264
Bad you didn't want

1544
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:32,128
Super Bowl

1545
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,944
Interview with a guy named Martin on

1546
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:39,552
Michelle before butt

1547
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,832
Is a genie

1548
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
Season 8

1549
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:47,744
Algorithm

1550
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
Maybe or

1551
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,536
Computer program

1552
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:53,120
A couple of weird stock

1553
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,680
Around the world and economy

1554
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:58,752
Or falling out

1555
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:01,056
He is predicted a couple things in the past

1556
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,360
Have been borderline profeta

1557
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,664
I don't know if this is true

1558
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:09,760
I'm just going on what they say on the show I did not look into it

1559
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
Here's why

1560
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,880
Because he literally predict that the economic collapse of the dollar

1561
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,928
Has to happen by March twenty

1562
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:20,000
Did not happen

1563
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
Are you sure

1564
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,584
Okay I'm going to trust you on this

1565
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,984
The Koch brothers

1566
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,480
Oh I absolutely or libertarian

1567
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,576
The s*** right-wing billionaires

1568
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:48,672
Skylanders

1569
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,464
Ruin the Alexa

1570
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
Kenya

1571
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,000
Robux

1572
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,352
Officially screwed up

1573
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:57,632
Three countries

1574
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:01,472
Now

1575
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:05,056
What happened

1576
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,360
Every night

1577
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,968
Interesting the idea of that

1578
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:18,880
We're literally trying to overthrow other countries

1579
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,160
Mercer did

1580
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,720
Absolutely

1581
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,560
So we move on is a

1582
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,328
Super villain

1583
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,864
Like it's kind of amazing

1584
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
Like a

1585
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,704
If it weren't for the fact that it was destroying the world

1586
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,984
Would be kind of admirable to

1587
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,008
51 man

1588
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,872
It is impressive as much as

1589
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,896
Impression

1590
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,712
But beautiful

1591
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,480
Because the 20th

1592
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,760
I think is

1593
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,856
I don't even know how to put it

1594
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
Strongly enough

1595
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
Sorry I

1596
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:58,304
First birthday

1597
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,096
True endpoint

1598
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,192
Texas tip of wine when I start talking

1599
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,288
The true endpoint of unregulated

1600
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
Capitalism

1601
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
Can just sell

1602
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,408
Overthrow

1603
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,224
Like that's kind of insane

1604
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,576
All the Banana Republic

1605
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
You've gone over in

1606
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,648
Capitalism

1607
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:27,232
Destroy human life

1608
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:33,632
Blackwater making the argument

1609
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,032
Right

1610
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
The world's going to

1611
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,592
The second Sons

1612
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
In Game of Thrones

1613
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,432
Yeah

1614
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224
Got to go to the 20th

1615
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,272
Mercer

1616
01:27:55,904 --> 01:28:02,048
Alright

1617
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
Continue on

1618
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:08,448
I will offer you this next

1619
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:11,520
Where Alex Jones finally says something about Donald Trump

1620
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:17,920
Infowars.com

1621
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:24,320
911 Wisconsin

1622
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:33,280
Copper was Advanced knowledge

1623
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,912
Not to fly the day of 9/11

1624
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,824
Supply

1625
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:50,944
San Francisco Chronicle

1626
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,224
Bushnell

1627
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,320
And I would have National media

1628
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:59,392
I don't know what most specifically

1629
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,744
I know there were bombs and building 7 and his fellows

1630
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,304
Which even this just happened

1631
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,376
After years of them denying it

1632
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,680
Admitting at about 5 years ago

1633
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:22,176
Donald Trump is bringing 911

1634
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
To install

1635
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:27,040
Right that's such a such a

1636
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Weird

1637
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,624
Signal-to-noise ratio

1638
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,416
Intelligence

1639
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,768
What are

1640
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,048
Cease knew that

1641
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,936
Was, that's why I did

1642
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:48,032
Also knew that 10 million different attack

1643
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,824
Text we're possible in there still

1644
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:51,104
What's going on

1645
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,920
It's hard for and then you do it

1646
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:54,944
Intelligence agent

1647
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:56,224
Synthes have a weird

1648
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,504
Patient with each other

1649
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,272
So they don't nest

1650
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
Sara Lee

1651
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:00,832
Like there's

1652
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:02,880
There's a whole series of

1653
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,696
Comical errors that led

1654
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464
2000

1655
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
The people die

1656
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,768
Legates

1657
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,584
Exposed

1658
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,376
It's like somebody should be below

1659
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,680
For that

1660
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
And the lies

1661
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:25,408
I think that's probably the bigger

1662
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
Thousand

1663
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,504
But the half a million civilians died

1664
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,784
Probably worse

1665
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
Probably

1666
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
Defin

1667
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,744
Mathematical for a couple days

1668
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,560
And now that Trump has tried to clock out Jeb Bush

1669
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:54,592
And I love I love how much

1670
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,872
Much money he donated

1671
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,944
To all the

1672
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,248
I'm a big fan of him promising

1673
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
To donate

1674
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,552
$1000000

1675
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,344
Recovery Act

1676
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,672
Wait is it not going to be the first no money or

1677
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,208
Really going to happen

1678
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
Probably

1679
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,304
I like how he's going to release

1680
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,608
Going to do that

1681
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,680
There is a

1682
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:24,032
Wildfire going on in LA right now it's a f****** emergency

1683
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
I like him

1684
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:29,664
No there was no response biggest-ever in Iowa

1685
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,040
That's great it's great that we have to

1686
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,344
National f****** emergency

1687
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,112
He's going on

1688
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,000
The people at

1689
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,536
Arias Okolona

1690
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,376
Christian bulshit families like know who's a good idea

1691
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:50,400
F*** you

1692
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Fucktrump

1693
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,056
Really

1694
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:59,360
Really I'm still very very angry

1695
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
It's just let its

1696
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,040
Just so expected

1697
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,856
Like I'm in not at all surprised

1698
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,624
Yeah

1699
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,416
Normalization the man

1700
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
Furious

1701
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
It's like well of course

1702
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,960
All of this like repeated b*******.

1703
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
It's just such a

1704
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,824
Normal occurrence now to watch a man

1705
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
A month

1706
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,224
Dumb ways

1707
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
It is almost

1708
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Smokescreen

1709
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,808
For the monsters who are going to

1710
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,576
Carry this out

1711
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,344
But

1712
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:43,904
He called at Jab

1713
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
About his brother

1714
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,208
Alex is excited about

1715
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,744
Alright well then let's make

1716
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,816
He's pretty excited about it I don't know if it's enough

1717
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,352
Get him on board yet

1718
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,168
Lil weirdo

1719
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,192
Is that all

1720
01:32:56,448 --> 01:33:00,032
Can s*** because most presidential candidates

1721
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:05,152
Alex Jones is a weirdo I can see I can see no parallel.

1722
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:09,760
He's thrilled that someone is bringing his world into respectable to

1723
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
Stay on that topic very long

1724
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:20,512
He has other fish to fry on this October 20th show

1725
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
Namely

1726
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
Hitler

1727
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,656
Hitler was a bad guy but

1728
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:30,752
Yes set up by British

1729
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:33,312
Rudolph

1730
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,944
That's why he later parachuted

1731
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,016
Estate

1732
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,576
That's why they locked him up in the

1733
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:47,904
That's right the Vice President of Germany

1734
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,952
Same thing

1735
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:57,376
Jumped out and Skydive into Edward eh

1736
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,144
Palace

1737
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
Didn't do anything for

1738
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:08,384
Childish stuff works

1739
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
Is it

1740
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,480
I feel like

1741
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,760
It's not

1742
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,784
So full of s***

1743
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,808
Was it was it

1744
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,208
It was one of the royal family who had to

1745
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
Leave

1746
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
Because he was up

1747
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,216
Treaty also Rudolph have was going

1748
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,032
Not to meet with him he was going to meet with the Duke of Hamilton

1749
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:41,152
Lin-manuel this story is

1750
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,944
Super interesting and

1751
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
I don't know if enough people know about it

1752
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,552
But Alex Jones

1753
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,600
About it was

1754
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,880
Hundred percent setup

1755
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,672
There is no doubt about that

1756
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,952
But

1757
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,744
You wasn't set up the way Alex

1758
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,024
Hitler was

1759
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
41

1760
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,168
Rudolph have took a plane

1761
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,192
Influential

1762
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,032
He was carrying with him a proposal that he intended to deliver to Churchill

1763
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,592
That he hoped would create a truce between Germany and in

1764
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
He wanted to do this

1765
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:14,176
Because he knew that Hitler was about to attack

1766
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
Soviet Union

1767
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
Boy this would be real f****** dumb

1768
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,576
To be fighting in east and west

1769
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,904
I think that would probably be a disaster

1770
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,952
Smart yeah yeah

1771
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,000
The initial appearance of it is

1772
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
He was trying to

1773
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,304
To save Hitler from himself

1774
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
Create peace

1775
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
With the

1776
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,168
In order to attack

1777
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,496
I don't know about that

1778
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,800
That's a little bit of a dicey argument

1779
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,848
But

1780
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,896
This was set up by British intelligence

1781
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,920
For sure

1782
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:50,016
Does he got in touch with somebody and they recommended that he reach out to the

1783
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,112
So he sent a letter to the

1784
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,136
Set up a

1785
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:55,904
Soiree

1786
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,440
Where the two of them could

1787
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,232
Get a piece of cord going and get it

1788
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,328
But the letter that he was intercepted by MI6

1789
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Am I five

1790
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
The numbers

1791
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,448
Whatever the cat

1792
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,752
Intercepted by British intelligence

1793
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:13,312
And he doesn't hear back from his contact

1794
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,872
I'm going

1795
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,408
And we know

1796
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,968
You went from being smart

1797
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Do not be

1798
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,272
We know these things

1799
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,552
Because of letters that you wrote

1800
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Who was wife

1801
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,112
So a lot of this

1802
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:26,880
Double knot

1803
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,952
Well he left a letter for Hitler

1804
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:32,512
To explain I'm going to England

1805
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:34,560
And this is the reason I'm doing it

1806
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,120
So much right

1807
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,400
But I feel like I must

1808
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,032
I would be true if that was what was said

1809
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:51,968
I mean if you would take ethics out of monstrosity out of it just from a simple strategy point

1810
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:57,600
He could have saved Germany from losing the war

1811
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:58,880
Taters wind-up dis

1812
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,904
Destroying themselves

1813
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,720
It's reassuring in a little bit

1814
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,120
So

1815
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,424
Has contacted the Duke of Hamilton

1816
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,448
Because someone told him

1817
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,264
That he was a member of the opposition party in English

1818
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:18,592
Didn't want to have war with

1819
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,664
We thought he would be a sympathetic ear for all this

1820
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
He wasn't

1821
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,224
Hear that

1822
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,272
So hats goes over he flies

1823
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,808
Any does parachute out

1824
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:31,136
Bobby Lane

1825
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:42,656
I'll just I'll just lay it on his base no big deal it's almost like a parachute in the Wind

1826
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,216
It was only a state

1827
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,752
He lands on the guys

1828
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,520
Proper

1829
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,288
Somewhere

1830
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:52,640
Triple E founded by landscapers around

1831
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,408
I don't know

1832
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,712
I'm assuming with the landscaper thing

1833
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,600
That's like I said that's like from Hot Shots part Deux

1834
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:03,648
Some guy trimming a hedge is like

1835
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:12,096
Captured prisoner of war and

1836
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,144
Skis part of the Nuremberg trials

1837
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,448
And you get to Alameda

1838
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
Decide

1839
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,520
That based on the position that he had

1840
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
He absolutely

1841
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,384
Conspired to create a war

1842
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,688
Didn't necessarily commit crimes against

1843
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,456
Humanity

1844
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,992
Or any of the

1845
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,064
How you don't understand how those charge

1846
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:35,392
Are different I don't either but he ended up getting a life sentence

1847
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Instead of death

1848
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
Spandau prison

1849
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,864
Be something at the age of 93 committed suicide

1850
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,520
Story of

1851
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
But

1852
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,568
Publix

1853
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,104
When he went

1854
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
1841

1855
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,152
Hitler was Furious

1856
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,176
About this

1857
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,224
He took it as a personal betrayal

1858
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,784
Because you cheaply worried about the idea of what is

1859
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,320
Japan and Italy going

1860
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,880
I think if it looks like I

1861
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,696
Allowed someone to try and make peace with you

1862
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:14,304
We're not going to trust me anymore

1863
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,352
Put on this public face

1864
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,632
I like your youth

1865
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,400
This guy

1866
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:21,216
To the point where he's stripped of all his titles

1867
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,520
He was the deputy sure but that wasn't

1868
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,568
That's not the vice president that's like

1869
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:29,152
Hermann Goering was second

1870
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:36,832
But he you put out the stripped of his office and all of his titles

1871
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,136
And the order was given to shoot him on sight

1872
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,416
And so that

1873
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,440
Made everyone think

1874
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
That Hitler had nothing

1875
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,256
When in fact

1876
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:48,352
So some documents of come out that suggested Hitler

1877
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,888
That house was gone

1878
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,912
How to fly to Scotland

1879
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,472
Mission

1880
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,264
In order to have a bigger War

1881
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,800
Elsewhere but

1882
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,616
I wish you the best on this

1883
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,152
I shall

1884
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:01,920
Miss you everyday

1885
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,968
So true

1886
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:05,504
We are brothers

1887
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,528
Aah

1888
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,880
So the idea that

1889
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,672
The ideas

1890
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,208
Hitler did know about it

1891
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,232
Comes

1892
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
From

1893
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,048
Some documents that were written by

1894
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
Heather is a duden

1895
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,120
Which is I guess I didn't notice

1896
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,680
I guess it's basically just an administrative assistant

1897
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:27,520
Does nautical filter Spiegel

1898
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Oprah talks about the

1899
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,384
These documents

1900
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
Dubious

1901
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:38,016
It's one of the things that I

1902
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,112
Legitimate evidence

1903
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Chose

1904
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,976
And has probably together

1905
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:48,512
To stand

1906
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,536
With a

1907
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,072
Potential peace treaty

1908
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,632
Do not fighting

1909
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:58,496
While they took out or tried to take out

1910
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,264
Begin Again

1911
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:03,360
They needed the West not to attack on that front also

1912
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:08,224
But here's this from the article interest which brings us into why Alex Jones

1913
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:09,504
Might believe some of these married

1914
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,808
At the end of the war

1915
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,880
Became a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union

1916
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:15,648
Where you at

1917
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,672
Standby Soviet intelligence

1918
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
Legends about the event

1919
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
In the spring of 1941

1920
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:21,024
According to the story in

1921
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:22,304
Google

1922
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,072
I got I don't have it

1923
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,376
Google

1924
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:26,656
According to his research

1925
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,936
Copies of his

1926
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:29,984
Misra sent to Soviet dictator Joseph

1927
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,776
Stalin foreign minister

1928
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,800
Molotov

1929
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,592
And I've been with someone else

1930
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,616
The head of the intelligence

1931
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,920
I can't say Russian names on the

1932
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,688
Reply

1933
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,504
It's unclear whether what these men

1934
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:43,808
The truth or simply what they wanted pinched

1935
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,088
To say

1936
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,720
It is noticeable that they use the vocabulary more commonly found in Soviet propaganda

1937
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:54,816
The Cold War had already begun and pitch

1938
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,584
Statement

1939
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,608
Stop

1940
01:41:56,864 --> 01:42:00,960
Stated that the reason he wanted to go public with this information at this particular time

1941
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:01,984
Was that quote

1942
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:06,080
Reactionary circles in England and America are striving to unleash

1943
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,640
The adjutant statement ends with these words

1944
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,176
Quote the fact

1945
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,784
Confirm the England by promoting Hitler

1946
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,064
Against Soviet Russia

1947
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:17,088
Acted in accordance

1948
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,624
With an old principle of using

1949
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,904
Using foreign hands

1950
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
To remove

1951
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,952
The chestnuts from the fire

1952
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:26,048
The theory of a Russian British conspiracy correspond

1953
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:28,352
Do the interpretation favored by Stalin

1954
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:35,008
Who in this country in 22nd 1941 had believed that Hitler would not

1955
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
And what's

1956
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,080
Britain first

1957
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
But Stalin was wrong

1958
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,176
Let's look at that

1959
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:47,040
The idea that there was a conspiracy between

1960
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:50,624
Soviet

1961
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,184
Sylvia Browne

1962
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,280
This that's one of the reasons that

1963
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:00,096
If you are a doll

1964
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,120
Intelligent

1965
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
You realize that

1966
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,168
Doesn't work

1967
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,960
Unless you want someone

1968
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:05,728
To say what you

1969
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,312
Pacific Alco

1970
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,336
Reality

1971
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:14,432
What you do is the same dumb s*** that we did with the Germans

1972
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,248
Paper clips

1973
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
F****** give them whatever they

1974
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:22,880
You know a little bit of time on this

1975
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:25,440
What seems to be

1976
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,536
Alex will believe

1977
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,304
Any Russian

1978
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
He's the Holden

1979
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,888
Do Russian propaganda from the

1980
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,520
Yeah

1981
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,568
Embassy setup Hitler

1982
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,360
Crazy that the beginning of this

1983
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,640
All goes back to

1984
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,920
Russian intelligence

1985
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:51,296
Bananas to me that 100 years ago Russian intelligence

1986
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,088
Made Alex Jones happen

1987
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:57,184
And I think the fact that we're uncovering this might lead

1988
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:03,584
I hope so I think I'll live show my end with us getting Burger

1989
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,912
Hermann Hesse will actually

1990
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:12,032
Parachute in and murderous I'm fine with Hermann Hesse doing it Rudolph massimino

1991
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:16,384
I have a tattoo of Herman has a shoulder

1992
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,152
I love the man

1993
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Did not like North

1994
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,624
Goldman not a great book

1995
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,416
Siddhartha is fine

1996
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,440
Siddhartha's okay

1997
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
It's fine

1998
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,744
AB fine

1999
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:38,656
Welcome

2000
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,688
Okay

2001
01:44:53,248 --> 01:44:56,064
Interesting that Alex Jones believes such flimsy in order to

2002
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
Defend

2003
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,600
Hitler

2004
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
Hitler

2005
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,392
Of all people

2006
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,416
Blick

2007
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,464
What are you doing

2008
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,328
It's crazy that Marvel would have him supporting the Red Skull that's

2009
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,352
The first thing that I say

2010
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,008
Yeah that's fair

2011
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,824
Marvel should be offended by

2012
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,384
You're actually normalizing Alec

2013
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,920
Text Jones by having him support

2014
01:45:22,176 --> 01:45:23,200
Red Skull

2015
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:29,088
Interview with a gentleman by the name of Joel skousen

2016
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:33,952
I don't know his credit

2017
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,488
Albuquerque

2018
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:37,536
Primary narratives is it the government's

2019
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Straight up

2020
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,936
Government

2021
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:46,496
What are the conspiracy

2022
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:47,520
Like there's

2023
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,544
1 conspiracy

2024
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,848
Theory and that is that the United States

2025
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,616
Government

2026
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,896
Perpetrated 911

2027
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:55,968
That I will never not have a twinge

2028
01:45:56,224 --> 01:46:01,856
Like I don't know what it is about that one in particular because I don't give a s***

2029
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,904
Conspiracy theories like like JFK

2030
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,440
Like I don't care

2031
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:08,256
Chances are he was killed by

2032
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,792
Not in your lifetime

2033
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:13,120
Possible but at the same time like that's the big conspiracy

2034
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,168
You know that's always going to be

2035
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:17,216
Turning point of history of

2036
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,008
Did

2037
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,384
11

2038
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
Perpetrated by the US

2039
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,456
It is such a

2040
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,504
I think it's just a w

2041
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,832
I think it's just like

2042
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:35,648
I don't know what it is about what it's like

2043
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,208
Committed

2044
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:41,536
To be fair I don't believe that

2045
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:45,120
Unpack 9/11

2046
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,656
Too hard on the body

2047
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,800
Rules is whenever doing a 9/11

2048
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,080
There's just

2049
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:54,848
Too much

2050
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,640
There's too many theories

2051
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,456
A lot of them are pretty easy to but two debunked

2052
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:02,272
Impossible to Dubai

2053
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,808
Dumb right

2054
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:04,832
Lego

2055
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:08,416
But that's not dumb enough

2056
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,256
Like that's the amazing thing about Trump

2057
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,536
As bad as Trump is

2058
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,328
W was the worst

2059
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:17,888
Led to

2060
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,704
More destabilization

2061
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:22,240
It's written

2062
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:24,288
If he has tutoring he'll do way worse

2063
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,056
My God

2064
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:30,944
It's too late for all of w have eight years to do a lot of the white ship

2065
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,760
Fruit

2066
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,296
Fine but

2067
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,064
The true monster

2068
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:39,392
In the same way

2069
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:44,512
Kissinger was a true monster part of the function of that is that

2070
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:47,072
They were good at administrative s***

2071
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,888
Great middle manager

2072
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:50,912
Metaphorically

2073
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
Not metaphor

2074
01:47:53,984 --> 01:48:00,128
Not going to be able to implement

2075
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:02,176
Two cuz he's so bad at paperwork

2076
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,200
You surrounded by

2077
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,040
Unlike Debbie Wright who had

2078
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
In Cheney was

2079
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,344
Evil monster

2080
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,952
I have a hard time

2081
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:14,720
Like a

2082
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,744
Immediately

2083
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:19,584
Getting over my emotional reaction to 9/11 just missing

2084
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,400
Play because if you told me

2085
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
Did anything

2086
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,240
Regardless of how insane it was I'd have it

2087
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,008
A twinge of like

2088
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:28,032
He probably did

2089
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:32,384
I want to take every clip of everything Alex about the globalist

2090
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:40,320
Just for a moment it sound like I believe it's just like

2091
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:43,136
There's always that moment of like

2092
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:47,488
Like I wouldn't put it past

2093
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,280
To have committed nine

2094
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,352
Yeah I'm okay with us leaving it there

2095
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,912
Exactly where

2096
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:59,008
Joel skousen is on the show and

2097
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,544
He's a dick

2098
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,312
Site 11

2099
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:04,896
What we're not going to do much of that but I do want to forget

2100
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:09,504
Gaston who believe s*** like this

2101
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:18,208
So I think it has to do also with the satanic nature of this conspiracy

2102
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:22,816
No single person in Mafia evil

2103
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,864
Powerful person

2104
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:27,680
Started

2105
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:32,800
Two or three centuries ago and directed and keep it going past 20 or 30 years

2106
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:34,848
It has to be a revelatory

2107
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:41,248
A conspiracy or something

2108
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:45,856
In terms of destruction of Christianity

2109
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:51,232
The creation of a worldly secular society where there is conflict and hatred

2110
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:53,536
Devil

2111
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:59,168
Just wanted to show that

2112
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:04,288
Who's that be great if that's how half of our Clips ended with

2113
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:06,080
Alex Jones

2114
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,104
Some dumb s*** we're like

2115
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:17,600
Jeff the devil

2116
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:18,624
Chinese people

2117
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,648
Actually believe

2118
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
The devil

2119
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,256
Do people actually

2120
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,536
We believe the devil is

2121
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
I think these

2122
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,584
Some of these

2123
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,168
People do it's tough to tell who's authentic and who's doing it for

2124
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:37,056
Working across purposes score some other point

2125
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,104
I think it's Christianity

2126
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,920
But I think he's doing it in order to bolster his

2127
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:46,784
Is entirely

2128
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:52,928
Different yeah it's some sort of bizarre he believes in common law as opposed to law

2129
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,952
Yeah

2130
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,232
Common Christianity

2131
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:59,072
Proto Christianity perhaps

2132
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:05,472
He's like he doesn't really understand how to tell if something's fake and he's

2133
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:08,288
A trick by every single piece of Soviet propaganda

2134
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:10,848
It's really possible that he read a bunch of like

2135
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,664
The Lost Books of the Bible and forgotten books of Eden

2136
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:17,760
Or any of those gospels were written as literature

2137
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:21,856
Write a book about biblical figures

2138
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:26,720
I kind of find a hundred bucks

2139
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:30,048
Like in the same way like if you recall he had the

2140
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:30,816
6 hour long

2141
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,120
Right

2142
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:35,424
I find it more likely that he has

2143
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,728
What he thinks are revelation

2144
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,496
InStyle

2145
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,776
That's possible

2146
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,592
More likely to me what it is

2147
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
This is religion

2148
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,408
And that's why his scent

2149
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,176
Morality

2150
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:53,600
He believes it's God dictating it but it's really whatever he in his subconscious want to Will

2151
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:56,160
Whatever he wants to justify whatever it is

2152
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:59,488
It is prejudices are as religion

2153
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:04,096
That's not that's not

2154
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:06,144
Like unique to him

2155
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:12,544
Muslim funeral

2156
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:15,872
So Alex actually has this to say

2157
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:26,624
Commando salad

2158
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:29,184
But the new influxes are poor

2159
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:35,840
They are not assimilating

2160
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,144
It's a very chest out face out

2161
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,448
You better watch it attitude

2162
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,984
Is instilling in them

2163
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:44,544
Very destructive and then

2164
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,408
Totally uncomfortable

2165
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,200
With their whole lifestyle

2166
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:54,016
Teach your five-year-old how to have gay sex

2167
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,416
Angry as well and

2168
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:05,792
Every video in Europe

2169
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,424
Sea anchor in a Wes

2170
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
Batshit

2171
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:21,920
I noticed from your body language

2172
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:25,248
Alright Dad put down

2173
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,784
Understand

2174
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,064
Make your point

2175
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:29,344
Every f***

2176
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,392
Time you get this kind of bigot

2177
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,208
Preamble of

2178
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:36,000
The ones I met

2179
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,072
Like they're f******

2180
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,352
People

2181
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,656
And if you didn't

2182
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,728
Tiny little spot only ever interact

2183
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:46,752
Sing with white people

2184
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,776
Maybe you would f***

2185
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:52,640
Figure that s*** out of me insane that there's always that f***

2186
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:57,248
Story the news articles you read about Trump

2187
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,808
Wait a second

2188
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:02,112
The guy we know it's going to be deported

2189
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,648
Realize that was

2190
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,672
The possibility in this

2191
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,696
Because they're f******

2192
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:10,048
Stupid every single f****** water is f****** dumb

2193
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,328
And I'm done with this

2194
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,120
Well I don't want it

2195
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,656
Here's what's fascinating about

2196
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,192
All of these people do

2197
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:20,288
Composition fallacy

2198
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:22,592
While at the same time committing a composite

2199
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:27,712
So exactly what that is is you take a single example and University

2200
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:34,112
I don't know talk about you I would say guys with visible tattoos

2201
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:40,000
That would be wrong that's one example person one example

2202
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:44,096
Hours of operation

2203
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:46,656
Like that is wrong

2204
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:52,288
To do because there's nothing intrinsically but having visible tattoos that would make one want to scream

2205
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,312
Or more likely

2206
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,152
Of course the composition fallacy

2207
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:59,968
Is I know a good Muslim

2208
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,016
Are there for almost 10 good

2209
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:04,576
But they do still make it with the I'm

2210
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,856
Scared of Muslims

2211
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,392
Simple all about

2212
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:08,928
Edit

2213
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:11,488
It's fascinating to me because on the one hand

2214
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:15,584
Appropriate

2215
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,632
Skepticism

2216
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,424
+ 8

2217
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,216
Inappropriate

2218
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:21,984
And destruct

2219
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:24,032
Murderous logical file

2220
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:27,104
In the other you're not operating

2221
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,408
I'm a place of reason or logic

2222
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:30,176
Visceral

2223
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:34,784
You're trying to present as something that's rational reasonable

2224
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,832
And it comes from

2225
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,392
I don't know child

2226
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:45,280
Steers propaganda

2227
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:46,304
Sends me articles

2228
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,072
From

2229
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:48,096
The Spectator

2230
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,376
National Review

2231
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:50,400
Which is just

2232
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,704
Exact same s*** out

2233
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,240
Sounds yells about

2234
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,008
But

2235
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:57,056
Wrapped up in this

2236
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,104
Bulshit

2237
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,552
Learn how to use a tool

2238
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:11,392
I know it is it is

2239
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928
No you're still

2240
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,232
Well I suppose yeah I suppose it's something

2241
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,280
Really really

2242
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
Unsophisticated

2243
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:19,840
Faded

2244
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,632
Learning how to use language

2245
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:23,168
In such a way as to

2246
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:25,472
Masquerade as something that is

2247
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:31,872
Research but at the same time the National Review isn't making millions of dollars selling disaster Supply

2248
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:34,432
So maybe it's Alex who knows how to use a tool

2249
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:37,760
I'm not sure

2250
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:44,160
But anyway this next clip catering to a smaller and smaller

2251
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:45,184
The GOP witch

2252
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,976
People who think they care about being

2253
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:51,584
I have as a technicality

2254
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:58,240
This is just that every time this comes up we must point it out

2255
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,104
Then what was it

2256
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:06,176
Was that shooting

2257
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:08,224
Weeks back from where we are in the timeline

2258
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,184
But Alex Jones

2259
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,792
But it seems like every time it comes up

2260
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,328
Was it a false flag

2261
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:24,352
Like

2262
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,168
Haha

2263
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:29,216
Being a false flag

2264
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,800
It's still up in the air

2265
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,824
Is decided

2266
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:35,360
That called

2267
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:37,152
Dumb

2268
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:39,968
Took the other thing

2269
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,992
Brings that up at

2270
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:44,576
Because we are about to

2271
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,600
Meet Steve

2272
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,368
Pieczenik

2273
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:49,696
Steve pieczenik is a Gaston this episode

2274
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:54,816
Very long time

2275
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:01,984
He's come on because he needs Alex Jones

2276
01:58:02,240 --> 01:58:03,008
He needs to do it

2277
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:08,128
Behind the scenes

2278
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:10,432
To come on the show and reveal some information

2279
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:14,016
And pray that Alex gets on board cuz otherwise

2280
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:16,832
Whatever he's working towards in going to workout

2281
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:19,136
We're going to listen to

2282
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:21,696
He is

2283
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:23,232
Each one along the way

2284
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:25,024
But there's a couple of things that I need

2285
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,304
Point out ahead of time

2286
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,584
That are very important

2287
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,632
For you to listen for as we go along

2288
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,936
We talked about this already

2289
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,472
Steve pieczenik

2290
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:34,496
Is inside

2291
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,312
He is a psychic Warfare guy

2292
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,080
So you can trust

2293
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,872
That's great he's a doctor

2294
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:42,944
Like doctor group

2295
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Haha

2296
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:48,832
Exactly like

2297
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,368
Group Steve pieczenik

2298
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136
Truth

2299
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,416
All the time

2300
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:58,816
Never does he try and manipulate people life in order to ascertain

2301
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:03,936
Is way smarter and I think he is deployed

2302
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:04,960
Psychological warfare

2303
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:08,032
And they are one of the reasons that I think that is listen

2304
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,056
How many times

2305
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:11,104
Throughout the clips that we're going to be listening

2306
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,152
Flatters out

2307
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:16,480
And basically tells him the key is one of the reasons

2308
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:17,504
That a revolution

2309
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,272
Could be

2310
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:22,368
Sweet Leaf in the same way that's where we get the counter to

2311
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:26,720
We're going to get to it actually not really because

2312
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:27,488
The

2313
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,536
Hillary's emails has

2314
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,560
Look fully come out

2315
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,120
And that is why

2316
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:36,192
That's when he's going to adjust the narrative that he starts

2317
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:36,960
On this episode

2318
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,264
He hasn't really f***** up things

2319
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,312
At the same time

2320
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,592
Listen for the flattery

2321
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,384
Because that is like Warfare

2322
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,432
Is manipulating Alex

2323
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:48,480
Exactly how I he knows

2324
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,016
Vulnerable

2325
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,576
Dan I feel like you do

2326
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:58,976
My psych profile way wrong

2327
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,024
So in this first clip of

2328
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,328
Steve

2329
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:04,864
With mitzvah

2330
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,400
In Psych Warfare

2331
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,960
Can you repeat that again

2332
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
I work in intelligence

2333
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,544
Iran psyop separation

2334
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:16,384
I work very closely with the bushes I know Rodger Ailes

2335
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:21,248
So I know exactly what they trying to cover up and what they're doing it is not working

2336
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,296
Thanks to you Alex

2337
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:25,088
Thanks to the American public

2338
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:31,744
Are pulling apart for me to attack them in the United

2339
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,512
Fake Twitter

2340
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,560
Chad and the Bush family total

2341
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:37,632
So this is the beginning of his narrative

2342
02:00:37,888 --> 02:00:38,656
And that is that

2343
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:40,192
It's all about it

2344
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:42,496
Because the bush

2345
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:45,056
Crime family must pay for committing 90s

2346
02:00:45,824 --> 02:00:46,336
Ears

2347
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,128
That I have

2348
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,408
Especially about

2349
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,224
What

2350
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
Or not

2351
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,064
What's IHOP's

2352
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,832
Did he run

2353
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,368
It's never really clear

2354
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:03,488
Deeply involved in a lot of stuff apparently

2355
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:05,280
Like he's not like Jerome corsi

2356
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,816
Do we have any

2357
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:07,840
Any evidence

2358
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:11,680
I don't but I also have not dug too deep into it

2359
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,752
September 9th

2360
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:17,312
9 p.m. about it

2361
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,408
But I also think

2362
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:23,200
You no longer really is

2363
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,992
Yeah because if he does

2364
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,016
Of course

2365
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,552
He's not if he's going on Infowars

2366
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:31,904
The stuff that he's going to end up talking about is horseshit

2367
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:38,560
He would not go on Infowars and jeopardize them

2368
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,096
Bible Abbott

2369
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:43,680
Time though if you are doing those the

2370
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:44,960
Infowars

2371
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:46,496
Is a great place to go on

2372
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:49,056
In order to

2373
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:51,104
Strongly

2374
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,664
Describe various co-ops that he's engaged

2375
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:56,736
The siop is on Alex's audio

2376
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:58,272
Right

2377
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,040
The things that he

2378
02:01:59,296 --> 02:01:59,808
Claims

2379
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,344
Are actually the things he

2380
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:02,112
He's doing

2381
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:02,880
Right

2382
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:04,160
End goal is

2383
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,952
Get Alex Jones audience

2384
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,488
On the side I want them on

2385
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:09,280
Yeah

2386
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,584
Against

2387
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,888
Are you giving him

2388
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:14,912
Too much

2389
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:18,496
Credit I feel like

2390
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,776
-10

2391
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:20,544
Mason credit

2392
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,152
Rectum

2393
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:30,784
Him are the he's not really doing the thing behind the scene

2394
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,064
But he claims to be doing

2395
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,856
Right

2396
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,392
Incredible strategic game

2397
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:37,440
You'll see as these clips go on

2398
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:40,000
Just keep it in your head that the end goal

2399
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:40,768
Isn't what he

2400
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,792
He says it is

2401
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,584
It is to manipulate Alec

2402
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,864
To become a puppet

2403
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,424
To become a puppet for

2404
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,448
The Consortium

2405
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:51,776
That I believe is behind the scenes of

2406
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,056
Interested parties

2407
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:55,872
Perhaps the thing that Rodger Stone has discussed

2408
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:57,152
The 45 group

2409
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:59,712
The secret organization of trump supporters

2410
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:00,736
That apparently me

2411
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:03,552
Then talks about what they need to do

2412
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:08,672
Stone summary

2413
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:10,720
We just get together and we're like

2414
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,000
We love Trump right

2415
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,536
That's pretty much it

2416
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,072
That's pretty much what they do

2417
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,608
Right but even still

2418
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:19,936
I think a bunch of dudes getting together and talk about how much of the Trump

2419
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:21,984
Could I have a bunch of guys who

2420
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,592
Or maybe strategic of in nature and they're like

2421
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:29,664
Okay here's what we eat with our skill set

2422
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,736
Manipulate

2423
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:34,272
I do

2424
02:03:34,528 --> 02:03:35,040
Think

2425
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:37,344
It's so fast like this dawned on me today

2426
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:38,624
Because

2427
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:39,904
Rodger Stone isn't around

2428
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:42,208
Yes but we know he will be eventually

2429
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:45,280
It's fascinating to me that Alex Jones

2430
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:46,816
Is so

2431
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,584
Stupid

2432
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:49,888
Then he teams up with a guy

2433
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,936
Whoever admitted that you run

2434
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:53,472
Psych ward

2435
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:54,752
But it sure is him

2436
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:55,520
I'm not doing it

2437
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:57,056
REI

2438
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,336
SeaWorld

2439
02:03:58,592 --> 02:03:59,872
Most notorious rap

2440
02:04:00,128 --> 02:04:02,176
That f***** in Trenton Rogers

2441
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:08,832
The dirty trick master and a psych Warfare guy are the people

2442
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:11,904
Dumbass

2443
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,976
I can't believe I can't believe that way

2444
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:17,792
But it's

2445
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,352
Legitimate

2446
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:22,400
Oh yeah for sure anything

2447
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,680
Totally fine

2448
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:28,032
These are the guys I'm going to get a bed with the guys who manipulate everybody

2449
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:29,312
I mean it

2450
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,592
The same time though it has

2451
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:31,360
Tubi

2452
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:34,176
Intensely attractive

2453
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
To be like

2454
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:38,272
The psych Warfare

2455
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,344
He's obviously working

2456
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,112
Forum 8

2457
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:44,928
Which is exactly how psych Warfare

2458
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
Especially when you can

2459
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:49,024
Be it happening on the Shelf

2460
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,048
Gout

2461
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:52,608
Do you were able to do

2462
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,912
He's not even doing

2463
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:56,704
Good a job it's like he's

2464
02:04:57,216 --> 02:05:01,568
It's like he's just tossing off all of his psych Warfare skills and just being like

2465
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,432
Say what I want you to say like that sits

2466
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:08,480
Trying hard

2467
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:11,040
It is if you really look at it

2468
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:17,952
We're at 5 and we have three hundred more to go

2469
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:21,280
No I just think we're talking too much about Steve without actually listening

2470
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:26,144
I just don't want you to get to

2471
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,680
You need that

2472
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:29,984
Into this without water looks like

2473
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,288
Which is a pretty good down-home

2474
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:37,408
Great little little little

2475
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,992
How far is

2476
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,784
So in his neck

2477
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,832
Clip Steve

2478
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:46,624
Donald Trump

2479
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:48,672
Basically existing in the Publix

2480
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:52,768
Donald Trump

2481
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:59,168
Thank you very much the truth of the matter is this is one of the most that one of the most phenomenal American

2482
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:04,288
I never seen in the one we were waiting for Alex I thank you and I thank the audience

2483
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:09,664
Exito called alternative media which really became the mainstream media

2484
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:15,808
Reality is Trump had been monitoring this mainstream media for a long time I knew it he knew it

2485
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:19,904
Many of us had known that and in fact when we put his name up

2486
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,440
For the next president

2487
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:27,840
And basically ran with it and this is the true expression of the mineral majority

2488
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:29,888
And the fact that we are so tired

2489
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:34,240
Of the people who committed the crime at 9:11 that once Trump gets in my

2490
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:35,008
Fishing is

2491
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,800
Many of them will be arrested

2492
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:39,616
And that's what I think will happen in the long run

2493
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:43,456
I don't know Trump personally I do know his background I know a lot about is

2494
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,224
Character

2495
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:47,040
Is a man who will do exactly what he said

2496
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
If

2497
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,576
Steve pieczenik

2498
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:52,672
Is aware of trump pass

2499
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,976
He's aware

2500
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,768
Of all of his feelings

2501
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,304
He's aware of

2502
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,072
His

2503
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:00,352
Involvement with Russia

2504
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,144
Otherwise

2505
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,680
He knows about

2506
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,216
What does that tell you

2507
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,032
Just that what does that tell you

2508
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,056
The ideas

2509
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:09,824
He is saying

2510
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:11,872
Many of them will be a rest

2511
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,688
Stop

2512
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:19,808
Exactly if he is

2513
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:25,952
No they are

2514
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:29,280
Because we're going to talk more about Hitler

2515
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:30,816
Such as

2516
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:33,376
If you're not an idiot you know

2517
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:35,168
None of those people will be arrested

2518
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,448
Right you know that

2519
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,264
If you are an Alex Jones

2520
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:42,848
Listener Hillary for prison

2521
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:44,896
Yep so if you think

2522
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,688
If you think for a second

2523
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,992
That Trump is going to arrest

2524
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:50,784
You're dumb

2525
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,064
Falcon

2526
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
Well that's that

2527
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:56,160
You might start locking up animals

2528
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,208
That seems like

2529
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,256
At this point nothing is

2530
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:01,536
Is beyond ship moveset

2531
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:03,584
Nothing is beyond what could be happy

2532
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,376
But he

2533
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,656
Clearly doing that on

2534
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:11,776
Have you heard In that clip even insane I thank you

2535
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:12,800
Flattered

2536
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:18,176
Alex Jones we would not be able to do this without you you were so important to the team

2537
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:19,712
One of the most phenomenal

2538
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:21,504
Phenomenal American

2539
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:24,064
I'm so thrilled about what happened

2540
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:27,392
So many different times even though it's the exact same

2541
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,160
The Tappan

2542
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:32,000
And implies that there's a situation where him and

2543
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:36,096
Become

2544
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:39,424
I don't know what that is

2545
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:42,240
Russia

2546
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:46,080
Monitoring

2547
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:50,688
And that's where

2548
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:56,320
People say how great Trump is and then that's the end

2549
02:08:56,576 --> 02:09:02,720
Is probably accurate monitoring

2550
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,840
Said that maybe the group that

2551
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:09,120
He's talking about his Russia

2552
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:10,400
Because of its

2553
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:12,960
Next clip where the real problem

2554
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:18,592
Not only will we turn around and get rid of these people but Russia and effect watch what we were doing

2555
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:21,920
Putin wins from a tactical genius to a

2556
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:24,992
Chessboard genius and he understood that our military

2557
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,272
If not affect

2558
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:28,576
A successful combat mission

2559
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:30,880
And he saw that repeatedly in Iraq

2560
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:32,928
Dentist and Yemen Sudan

2561
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:36,768
With 14 months basically the intelligence

2562
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:39,584
He was going in and he told Obama

2563
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:45,984
He was going to sacrifice Russian men and women as well as airplanes in advanced technology to do the

2564
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:48,544
Dirty Work that we couldn't do that while we will

2565
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:52,640
Playing around not knowing what to do and having no strategy whatsoever and

2566
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,920
Syria and Iran

2567
02:09:54,176 --> 02:10:00,320
I suggested that the Russians, Dirty Work and returned

2568
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:02,368
I wish they would come back into the fold

2569
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:05,440
And be part of an alliance that would be quite strong

2570
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:07,488
And that's exactly what they're doing

2571
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,256
I don't

2572
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:11,328
Azshara sad did but I do know

2573
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,608
That he was there to protect

2574
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:19,008
Christian one of the issues that came up and I said it repeatedly Christians were being slaughtered all of

2575
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:23,104
The Middle East see I created Arcada

2576
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:27,712
Isis and all the other groups that was funded by Saudi Arabia pathan Dubai

2577
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:31,552
Iran

2578
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:33,600
Has no qualms with the Christian

2579
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:34,368
The Russian

2580
02:10:34,624 --> 02:10:39,232
Rappers fighting back

2581
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:42,048
Elements that are involved

2582
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:48,448
Serious

2583
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,728
Really has been

2584
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:53,568
Iran air

2585
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:54,848
It's pretty amazing

2586
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:58,944
Okay

2587
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:03,808
Classify

2588
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:05,600
Those statements

2589
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,648
Wildly pro-putin

2590
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:08,928
Because I would

2591
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,464
I would absolutely

2592
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,864
Appropriate

2593
02:11:17,376 --> 02:11:18,144
Yeah

2594
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,448
Doozies

2595
02:11:20,704 --> 02:11:22,496
People believe it's a good

2596
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:23,264
Sing

2597
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:24,544
That Putin

2598
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:26,080
Has far larger

2599
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,896
Overworld affair

2600
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:30,944
Or are they acting

2601
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:32,992
Some sort of naked self-interest

2602
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:34,528
Let it are they

2603
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:36,320
I toasted larger question is

2604
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,112
Do they think that they are the

2605
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:40,416
The good guys or are they Psychopaths

2606
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:43,488
To gain the highest advantage

2607
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,512
For that person

2608
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,560
I imagine it's on a case-by-case

2609
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,328
Basis

2610
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:49,888
But I was thinking probably they say

2611
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,656
Think they're doing the right

2612
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:54,752
I think there's probably a moral conviction on some level

2613
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:58,592
Trump has that believes

2614
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:01,152
But I don't know if he believes in the globalist

2615
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,176
But Alex

2616
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,968
Only does right

2617
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,528
Whether or not started as a real

2618
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,832
Narrative 8 definitely

2619
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,368
Deeply entrenched in him

2620
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:13,184
Yeah it is he believes that the globalist

2621
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:15,232
Russia is

2622
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:17,280
Defense against them

2623
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:18,560
I think he does think

2624
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:20,096
But siding with them is the right to

2625
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,632
Things to do

2626
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:23,424
But I think he doesn't think

2627
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:30,592
I think he has it in his head to Putin is just going to free people and then go back about his Mary business

2628
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:33,664
You know being lied about in the media

2629
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,224
Or whatever running Russia like a grape

2630
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:39,808
Free Christian defending country even more in

2631
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,576
Insane like

2632
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,624
What are the larger

2633
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,416
If you only listen

2634
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,536
Propaganda is a place

2635
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:51,072
Free Speech problem

2636
02:12:51,584 --> 02:12:55,424
Because that's not going to be reported

2637
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:56,704
On

2638
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:57,984
You know

2639
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,520
Whatever.

2640
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:01,312
Like any of these

2641
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:06,432
I like ultimately what we are

2642
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,968
Getting into

2643
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:10,016
Especially especially

2644
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:14,112
How far you can go

2645
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:14,880
With

2646
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,160
Christian

2647
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:18,720
Like that's kind of it

2648
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,768
I mean

2649
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,376
Trumps

2650
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,400
Largest

2651
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,448
Still supports

2652
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,240
Despite

2653
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:35,872
Right wing

2654
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:36,896
Christian

2655
02:13:37,408 --> 02:13:38,944
Let's go to the intersection with y

2656
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:41,760
The

2657
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,040
The Narrative always get

2658
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:43,808
It's back to

2659
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:45,856
Are the ones who

2660
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:47,392
At least with Alex

2661
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:48,160
Like

2662
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:50,464
All of the stuff in in the UK

2663
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:51,744
In so many different

2664
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:53,280
It is

2665
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,304
Who owns

2666
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,072
Is Christian

2667
02:13:55,328 --> 02:13:56,864
And it is almost

2668
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:57,888
Always turn

2669
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:58,912
Into a

2670
02:13:59,168 --> 02:13:59,936
To Louisville

2671
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
The very p

2672
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,008
People that

2673
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:04,032
Christ

2674
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:05,312
Was it big fan

2675
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:08,128
So

2676
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:10,944
So it's like all of this propaganda

2677
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,224
Wines of

2678
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:14,784
Utilizing the same tools that

2679
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,624
The Christian

2680
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,184
Jim's have used to Puck over everybody 4000

2681
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:22,464
Yeah I don't

2682
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:24,000
Disagree

2683
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,304
Whatever Whenever you get

2684
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,072
To somebody like

2685
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:27,840
Steve pieczenik

2686
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:28,864
Who has

2687
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:29,888
No really

2688
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:32,448
Regardless of whether or not

2689
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,728
Claims religion

2690
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:37,056
Anymore

2691
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,848
It doesn't seem like it

2692
02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:42,176
You can't possibly have a

2693
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:43,200
Morality

2694
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:46,016
If you are deliberately misleading

2695
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,296
A lunatic like

2696
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:49,856
Excite his

2697
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:51,648
White nationalist supporters

2698
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,952
A white

2699
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:55,744
Who is

2700
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,280
Beholding to

2701
02:14:57,536 --> 02:15:01,120
A white nationalist country

2702
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,656
Creating those uprising

2703
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:04,192
Things all around the world

2704
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,216
And finance

2705
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:07,520
Of having any sense

2706
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,800
Morality is

2707
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,824
Space beyond

2708
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:10,848
Beyond Reason

2709
02:15:11,104 --> 02:15:17,248
I mean

2710
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,272
He is

2711
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:23,392
He is a moral position and I also agree with yours

2712
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,160
I don't know

2713
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:28,256
Alright I can't say I don't I agree that it seems like

2714
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:31,840
If you are a rational enough person

2715
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:34,912
You can't possibly

2716
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,936
Or Alex Jones

2717
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:37,472
Just doing

2718
02:15:37,728 --> 02:15:40,288
The the only Bastion you have is

2719
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,568
F*** I'm an idiot

2720
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:44,384
Or something like that

2721
02:15:47,712 --> 02:15:49,504
Like like growing up

2722
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,552
Which this is

2723
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,576
Exact

2724
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:54,368
There is there is

2725
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,392
That's kind

2726
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:56,928
Reinforcing beliefs

2727
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:57,696
Wearing

2728
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:58,720
The

2729
02:15:58,976 --> 02:15:59,744
Emerald turn

2730
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:00,512
2 Morrell

2731
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:05,120
Because you're doing it for the cult sacrifice

2732
02:16:05,376 --> 02:16:05,888
Every

2733
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,424
Morality

2734
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,192
That you have

2735
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:09,216
So long as

2736
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:12,032
The cult is doing

2737
02:16:13,312 --> 02:16:15,104
Don't let go until I Crusades and stuff

2738
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,920
Hey Google

2739
02:16:18,176 --> 02:16:21,504
Done in the name of Christianity or Islam on either side

2740
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:22,272
But like

2741
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:25,088
Is the problem of religion

2742
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,952
I'm less interested in that

2743
02:16:30,208 --> 02:16:33,792
Okay I'm more interested in the fact

2744
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,632
But I

2745
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:40,192
I'm fascinated by the idea

2746
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:40,960
Steve pieczenik

2747
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:47,360
Text shows up takes credit for the idea of trump running for president

2748
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,152
Comes in with us

2749
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:50,688
Play Norah pro-putin

2750
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:53,248
Position smart enough

2751
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:54,528
Figure out what's going on and

2752
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,296
You slept in

2753
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:57,600
I believe that this is formative

2754
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:59,904
In terms of the idea of the secret

2755
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:05,280
And stuff like that we all probably coming from

2756
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:06,560
Don't

2757
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:08,352
Report what Assad

2758
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:11,168
Do know he was doing the

2759
02:17:11,424 --> 02:17:13,216
Best thing for everybody

2760
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:13,984
Christian

2761
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,640
Asad defending

2762
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:23,200
If there's one thing I know about it

2763
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:26,272
It is unwavering support for

2764
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:30,112
Next clip

2765
02:17:30,368 --> 02:17:30,880
You might think

2766
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:32,928
You know we've already got milk

2767
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:34,464
50

2768
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:36,768
Elf coming out of it

2769
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:39,328
Steve pieczenik discusses

2770
02:17:40,608 --> 02:17:42,912
Political presidential candidates

2771
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:45,472
Well Hillary's in a very serious problem

2772
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:47,520
Once again I want to thank your audience

2773
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:51,104
You what we did wasn't back to do a psyops on

2774
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:51,872
Hillary

2775
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:53,152
I would liquid

2776
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:55,968
Bernie Sanders

2777
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:58,528
Co-op Drake streamlab

2778
02:17:58,784 --> 02:18:00,320
Samantha bring biting in

2779
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:03,136
Go out to middle and then to break up in

2780
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:05,440
Fractionate her system

2781
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,464
Yeah

2782
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:11,072
Co-opting Hillary is co-opting the extreme left

2783
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,960
He performed asiop

2784
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:17,728
I don't know how

2785
02:18:18,240 --> 02:18:20,544
Bernie to run

2786
02:18:21,312 --> 02:18:21,824
I guess

2787
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:24,640
Take the extreme

2788
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,176
Didn't run

2789
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,200
If you don't recall

2790
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:30,784
He never entered the race op2

2791
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:37,184
In order to get the middle away from Hillary Clinton with only a sliver of the pie with with witch

2792
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:44,352
Genuinely believe the election was not legitimate

2793
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:46,144
It was

2794
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:46,912
It was

2795
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:47,680
Stolen

2796
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:52,288
Like we're past the point of

2797
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:53,568
That's literally What hap

2798
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:54,848
Russia

2799
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,920
The election for Donald Trump

2800
02:18:58,176 --> 02:18:59,712
It's coming out as like actual books

2801
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:05,600
Removing people right at 2

2802
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:08,416
Before they were ever allowed to vote

2803
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:10,464
Theme like lunacy

2804
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:11,232
Hillary

2805
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,000
Still warm

2806
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:13,024
The popular vote

2807
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:15,584
They're just they're just smart enough to pick

2808
02:19:15,840 --> 02:19:16,352
Pick the right state

2809
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:18,656
That's where

2810
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:19,680
You know what that's worth

2811
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:20,704
What's wrong

2812
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:27,872
Like the tactics versus

2813
02:19:29,920 --> 02:19:32,736
It is kind of

2814
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:34,016
The thing where you hit the spot

2815
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:34,784
What's that

2816
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:35,552
Take down the month

2817
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:38,112
It is next

2818
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:40,416
Basically takes credit for everyone running for

2819
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:43,744
He tricked everyone into running

2820
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,024
Clearly

2821
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:47,584
I kept saying how delusional are they

2822
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:53,984
Jam

2823
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,776
People in intelligence agencies

2824
02:19:56,032 --> 02:20:00,384
People suckered them and this is all that

2825
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:06,784
Because they're people like myself and others who've been in science operations and we suck

2826
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:14,976
This is been a 14-year operation it's not something that just came overnight and Jet was so stupid that he little

2827
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:16,000
Reiterated

2828
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:19,584
But his brother said and runs felt quoted about Pearl Harbor

2829
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:21,120
So they would suck

2830
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:27,776
And suck it in for a long time because people like myself and others and monitor them for a long. They've been worn

2831
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:29,056
Repeatedly for blog

2832
02:20:29,568 --> 02:20:33,152
And despite all that they went in because they are so delusional

2833
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:37,248
And in the business of manipulation of South delusional grandiose

2834
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:40,576
Paranoid people it's not hard to manipulate them

2835
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,648
What's Putin

2836
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,208
And he understood very quickly had a movie in

2837
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:48,512
A country that has no leadership

2838
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:51,072
No direction on the farm policy

2839
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:55,168
Extremely effective

2840
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:56,960
Rolling the ruble

2841
02:20:57,472 --> 02:21:02,592
Fidelity to make Russia a weak economy and to be able to monitor

2842
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:04,128
So there's a lot in that clip

2843
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:08,992
I'm really glad you caught that

2844
02:21:09,248 --> 02:21:10,528
We want them through blogs

2845
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:12,320
We want a boy which is faster

2846
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:15,648
I don't know what that means

2847
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:28,192
Well I guess Steve pieczenik probably has a Blog where he posted something cuz I kind of don't f*** around

2848
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,544
Text who are running

2849
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:33,312
Four offices

2850
02:21:33,568 --> 02:21:34,848
Are easily manipulated

2851
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:36,896
But logic

2852
02:21:37,152 --> 02:21:37,920
To the next step

2853
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:39,968
Who's Elsa paranoid

2854
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,296
I have been

2855
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:45,600
I've been performing acai up on you this

2856
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:48,160
Entire time I'm actually working for Alex Jones

2857
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:50,976
That's fine within the end of this investigation

2858
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:52,512
You will be an Alex Jones

2859
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:54,816
I don't I don't think that'll be true

2860
02:21:55,072 --> 02:21:59,168
I will warm you through blogs

2861
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:09,152
The idea that he will ever go up

2862
02:22:09,408 --> 02:22:09,920
NRS

2863
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:11,456
Information is beyond

2864
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,248
Beyond

2865
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:15,040
Reasonably media's good point

2866
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,600
Three or four policy position

2867
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:21,440
A reasonable but from where we are now we're already at

2868
02:22:23,744 --> 02:22:24,256
I don't know

2869
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:30,656
You almost got on board as him to take out Donald Sutherland Sutherland

2870
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:31,424
Alright

2871
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:32,960
I didn't like his choice

2872
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:34,496
To be in The Hunger Games

2873
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:35,264
Movies I didn't

2874
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,568
I think they were very good and I don't think Donald Sutherland

2875
02:22:43,456 --> 02:22:43,968
September 9th

2876
02:22:44,224 --> 02:22:48,576
The Hunger Games

2877
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:50,880
Oldies playlist

2878
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:55,232
Steve Barack Obama

2879
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,768
That are kind of interesting

2880
02:22:59,072 --> 02:22:59,840
He doesn't have a great

2881
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,888
Cuz it doesn't think highly of him

2882
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:06,752
Fake backstory

2883
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:08,800
For Barack Obama vets

2884
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:09,824
Is interesting

2885
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:12,128
It's not your run-of-the-mill birthstone

2886
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:19,296
Particularly the CIA at the time

2887
02:23:19,808 --> 02:23:20,576
Read him

2888
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:23,648
Forester damn people like Geitner

2889
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:27,232
Peter Geithner when Timothy said he didn't know if they lie

2890
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:30,304
The whole system like the pritzkers lied who was a

2891
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,584
Former

2892
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:35,936
Allies of Al Capone I mean the whole Chicago Mob Wives

2893
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:37,728
I already Emmanuel

2894
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:41,568
I ran Emmanuel the whole family lied

2895
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:45,920
So you have a product that comes out of Chicago out of a collusive Alamos

2896
02:23:46,432 --> 02:23:50,016
Paranoid but he himself is not qualified

2897
02:23:50,272 --> 02:23:52,832
Be any type of leader you never had it

2898
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:58,720
He was never capable of it but they thought having a black young man who had a Muslim name

2899
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:00,512
Wooden somehow change

2900
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:03,840
Perception of America it was a serious mistake

2901
02:24:04,352 --> 02:24:07,424
He learned all the technology that we know from DARPA

2902
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:12,288
Defense Advanced research projects came into power and didn't really know how to wield it

2903
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:13,568
Event started Falls

2904
02:24:13,824 --> 02:24:18,944
Blackfoot Newtown was an obvious false wagon then we have Oregon

2905
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:24,064
How many Asperger's mothers and kids can be shooting all those people

2906
02:24:24,320 --> 02:24:25,344
Even my special force

2907
02:24:27,648 --> 02:24:28,416
This is Willie

2908
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,976
Ridiculous as a man

2909
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:37,120
Who's totally alienated from what's going on I want to give a mental health label because I don't think he deserves it

2910
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:40,704
He has to have accountability as a man

2911
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:45,056
Was not qualified to do what he did was not qualified to be president

2912
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:50,944
And in fact indict the Democratic party so seriously that they were stupid enough

2913
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:52,480
And I know the people involved

2914
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:53,504
Some of the liberal

2915
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:58,368
Famous Congressman this was a great idea and I said it was a stupid idea

2916
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:01,952
Because he would have benchley fail and he would destroy our country

2917
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:02,976
Now

2918
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:05,024
Thanks to you and many others

2919
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:07,840
Turn this car around

2920
02:25:08,096 --> 02:25:09,376
And see what will happen

2921
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:11,936
Trump comes in and Ben Carson

2922
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:14,752
Now I will be very serious be your audience

2923
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:16,032
I have worn

2924
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:18,592
Both candidates

2925
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:19,872
Assassination

2926
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:23,456
And the reason that they both are able to

2927
02:25:23,712 --> 02:25:24,736
Manipulate

2928
02:25:24,992 --> 02:25:25,504
Emotion

2929
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:26,272
Sorry effect

2930
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:30,624
Emotion

2931
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:31,648
If the left

2932
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:32,672
Had

2933
02:25:32,928 --> 02:25:33,696
A Sirhan Sirhan

2934
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:41,888
If the good guys were the ones who got assassinated it was the bad guys instead

2935
02:25:42,144 --> 02:25:43,680
I don't know I do want to go down as line

2936
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,960
Do no ice

2937
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:46,240
Distant distant

2938
02:25:46,496 --> 02:25:47,008
Is

2939
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:50,848
Is my wild I mean I don't want to re-litigate like

2940
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:52,896
We can relive gate Obama's president

2941
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:54,432
A million times over

2942
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,200
What critical

2943
02:25:55,456 --> 02:25:55,968
But if there's

2944
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:57,760
One thing

2945
02:25:58,528 --> 02:25:59,296
It was a good

2946
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:02,112
Leader I would say so

2947
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:08,512
Just about everybody

2948
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:11,328
There's so much

2949
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:13,632
You can blame the train

2950
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:14,912
Set up

2951
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,680
Is the president

2952
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:17,472
You can blame all those things like not

2953
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:18,240
Full

2954
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:20,032
Like not being full-throated

2955
02:26:20,288 --> 02:26:20,800
Progressive

2956
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:24,384
Like you could blame for why we lost so many

2957
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,664
Governorship

2958
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:29,504
Legislators

2959
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:33,088
But as far as leading a country

2960
02:26:33,344 --> 02:26:36,160
Trigos I'll be goddamned if the rest of the world.

2961
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,184
Just look at Obama

2962
02:26:38,208 --> 02:26:38,976
Well this guy's f***

2963
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:41,024
Haha

2964
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:42,816
That mean except for Russia

2965
02:26:43,072 --> 02:26:44,608
Right

2966
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:48,192
Transitive

2967
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,824
Sections on them

2968
02:26:54,080 --> 02:26:56,384
In the same way that Hillary would have

2969
02:26:57,152 --> 02:27:00,992
Hillary would have gone

2970
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:02,016
Hillary Hayden

2971
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:07,136
Harley Putin hated Hillary

2972
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:12,512
The week we absolutely can't read litigate hypothetical present

2973
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:16,096
Right you know like what

2974
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:17,120
I think that this

2975
02:27:19,168 --> 02:27:25,056
Steve pieczenik has his backstory to go is like a lot of people blame Obama

2976
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:27,104
For losing all of the

2977
02:27:27,616 --> 02:27:28,896
State legislators

2978
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:31,200
If you're going to blame anybody

2979
02:27:31,456 --> 02:27:33,248
I would blame the Democratic Party

2980
02:27:33,504 --> 02:27:35,552
The infrastructure because apparently

2981
02:27:35,808 --> 02:27:36,832
We can't even get

2982
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:37,856
Nazis

2983
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:42,720
Somehow the center of the democratic party is still like

2984
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:43,744
Antifas bad

2985
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:48,352
Like they still haven't even got that the Nazis are murdering people

2986
02:27:48,608 --> 02:27:49,632
And that maybe

2987
02:27:49,888 --> 02:27:50,656
A large

2988
02:27:50,912 --> 02:27:52,448
Majority of the country

2989
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,216
Is against

2990
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:56,032
Nothing there on the blaming and

2991
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:03,456
If you blame Obama for this s*** you're a got urine stay

2992
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:04,224
Your f******

2993
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:10,624
I think what was happening more is that history is repeating itself

2994
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:13,440
Fictionalized version of History

2995
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,208
Is it it's repeating

2996
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:15,488
In the same

2997
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:19,328
Rewriting history the same way Alex

2998
02:28:19,584 --> 02:28:24,192
But a lot of people have it in their head that during the Civil Rights Movement

2999
02:28:24,448 --> 02:28:25,984
Everyone was fighting

3000
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,008
Which banana

3001
02:28:27,264 --> 02:28:29,824
Because everyone doesn't want to cop to the fact

3002
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:33,664
It's a very good chance that your grandpa was not on board with it

3003
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:46,464
It was obviously a majority of people obviously and the

3004
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,608
Was there a dictator's in the terror

3005
02:28:52,864 --> 02:28:58,496
I can't take another right

3006
02:28:58,752 --> 02:29:04,896
Force Martin Luther King Jr to kill himself

3007
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:08,480
History is repeating itself we have fascistic

3008
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:10,272
Right-wing people rising

3009
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:12,320
Been online

3010
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:14,624
Organizing for years

3011
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:17,184
But they're coming into the public

3012
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:20,768
Are people who are trying to fight back against it

3013
02:29:22,304 --> 02:29:23,072
Of course

3014
02:29:23,584 --> 02:29:27,936
The widespread perception whether it's Republican or Democrat

3015
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:29,728
Is there a problem to

3016
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:32,800
Even if you in 20 years from now

3017
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:33,824
God willing

3018
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:36,896
We will be back this fascism

3019
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:45,088
I said God willing everyone will pretend that they were on FIFA seems like a very

3020
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:45,856
Broad

3021
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:48,672
I am I am 100% on board

3022
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:54,048
At this point is right

3023
02:29:54,304 --> 02:29:58,912
100% of the time

3024
02:29:59,168 --> 02:30:00,704
2

3025
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:03,008
Who are on the side of fighting back

3026
02:30:04,288 --> 02:30:04,800
That we're seeing

3027
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:07,872
Everything to everyone will

3028
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:10,432
Pretend

3029
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:16,832
And we will again forget now they only almost always a very unpopular group doing the right thing

3030
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:20,928
I think the bigger

3031
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:22,720
The will be that we've got

3032
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,376
Like 20 years from now

3033
02:30:29,632 --> 02:30:31,424
Twenty years from now Trevor Noah has

3034
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:32,448
The career I would

3035
02:30:33,728 --> 02:30:34,240
Furious

3036
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:37,056
Years from now if he has a career I'd be here

3037
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:39,360
Tomorrow if he has a career

3038
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:45,760
Like parties Neville Chamberlain absolutely that would be

3039
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:48,832
Spock on The Tonight Show

3040
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:49,600
No

3041
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:53,696
She went over to

3042
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:55,744
Noah

3043
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:57,536
No the other the new one

3044
02:30:57,792 --> 02:31:00,096
O'Fallon

3045
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:04,704
Neville Chamberlain

3046
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:15,456
I think you and your audience

3047
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:17,248
Formulate

3048
02:31:18,784 --> 02:31:20,832
Alex is not going to pick up on the fact that

3049
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:23,136
Steve is using those terms

3050
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:24,672
And using that strategy into

3051
02:31:24,928 --> 02:31:26,464
Intentionally to get under his ego

3052
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,512
No

3053
02:31:28,768 --> 02:31:30,048
Alex Jones

3054
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:32,096
Alex will interpret

3055
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:41,312
Must be really smart all these things I've already been flirting with

3056
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:43,872
I must be on the right track with Ray

3057
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:45,664
Well enough

3058
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:48,480
Singing matching dip

3059
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:50,528
So he'll have in one sentence

3060
02:31:51,808 --> 02:31:52,320
Something that

3061
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:53,088
Alex

3062
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:54,624
And in the same sentence

3063
02:31:55,136 --> 02:31:55,648
Something that hehe

3064
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:59,232
Conflating the two together

3065
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:01,536
Of course if you hate this thing and I

3066
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,560
I hate this thing

3067
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:06,656
I hate Obama

3068
02:32:07,168 --> 02:32:08,192
Yeah exactly

3069
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:11,776
Exactly

3070
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:14,848
It is one of those things where

3071
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:22,272
But

3072
02:32:22,528 --> 02:32:23,808
Because one more clip

3073
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:25,344
Before we get out of here and move on to

3074
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,112
To the next day

3075
02:32:26,368 --> 02:32:28,160
I get out of October 20th

3076
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:30,208
This is just a summation

3077
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:36,864
Go to where he's at

3078
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,912
Able to do more once I'm re-elected

3079
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:41,472
That was back prior to 2008

3080
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:44,800
Horseshoes me idea last election

3081
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:48,640
What do you think that was really about. 2%

3082
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:55,040
Never really been our enemy

3083
02:32:55,552 --> 02:33:00,160
Changing the Soviet Union I made it very clear to all of us officials

3084
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:05,536
That we didn't do anything to take down Russia Russia has been a formidable Ally of ours

3085
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:10,400
It is always work with us and in fact it has a much more serious problem

3086
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:12,192
Aslam and terrorism

3087
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:14,240
Because of Central Asia

3088
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:17,312
That's the least three things

3089
02:33:19,104 --> 02:33:20,128
It's quite not true

3090
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:22,176
Yeah no that's

3091
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:24,224
I mean we have teamed up from time to time

3092
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:29,088
Atlee true position

3093
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:30,880
Has been that Russia is our Ally.

3094
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:36,000
You know how that's true power was like immediately after

3095
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:38,816
To the end of WWII

3096
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:43,168
With Russia coronavirus gotten with them

3097
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:44,448
Trust but verify

3098
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:46,496
That's sort of been like the best

3099
02:33:46,752 --> 02:33:47,520
Position we've ever had

3100
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:49,824
I mean the most

3101
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:50,592
Close to French

3102
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:52,128
That is that

3103
02:33:52,384 --> 02:33:54,432
Even then giving the relationship a lot of credit

3104
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:55,200
Fine

3105
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:55,968
I don't care

3106
02:33:56,224 --> 02:33:59,552
Meijer

3107
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:00,320
Steve believe

3108
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:02,624
Our closest relationship with Russia has been like

3109
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:03,648
F*** you

3110
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:04,928
Alright f*** you

3111
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:08,256
YouTube

3112
02:34:14,144 --> 02:34:14,656
So

3113
02:34:14,912 --> 02:34:18,240
If we want to put a button on October 20th

3114
02:34:18,752 --> 02:34:19,520
We have the

3115
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:22,336
The first appearance in our investigation of Steve pieczenik

3116
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:24,640
He comes in with a robust

3117
02:34:24,896 --> 02:34:25,408
Narrative

3118
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:28,224
Putin is a good guy

3119
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:33,856
Is a very good guy you probably the only good guy on the world

3120
02:34:34,112 --> 02:34:34,624
The globalist

3121
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:37,184
Extension

3122
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:42,560
I and some other unnamed people have gotten together and got Donald Trump to run

3123
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:45,120
Also conflating those two

3124
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:47,680
Donald Trump is some sort of a savior

3125
02:34:51,264 --> 02:34:52,800
Incredibly

3126
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,360
Bafflingly f*****-up

3127
02:34:56,640 --> 02:35:02,016
It follows the trends that we're seeing as this investigation goes on that the coupling of

3128
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:03,552
Support of Putin and

3129
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:04,320
Russia

3130
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:06,624
Inexorably entwine

3131
02:35:06,880 --> 02:35:07,904
With support

3132
02:35:08,672 --> 02:35:09,696
Even for Alex Jones

3133
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,488
Nowadays

3134
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:12,768
In 2017

3135
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:13,792
Pretend

3136
02:35:15,328 --> 02:35:19,168
We see

3137
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:21,472
Definitive evidence

3138
02:35:21,728 --> 02:35:22,496
View loves Russia

3139
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:26,080
Even before he supported Trump

3140
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:34,528
That's where

3141
02:35:36,064 --> 02:35:36,576
The difference

3142
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:37,856
Inciting War

3143
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:39,392
Knowingly

3144
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,416
Atrocities

3145
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:43,232
Yeah is with these guys

3146
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:45,024
With pechenik

3147
02:35:45,536 --> 02:35:46,304
What is the

3148
02:35:48,096 --> 02:35:48,608
Him

3149
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:49,632
Effectively

3150
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:50,400
Play supporting

3151
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:51,424
And then

3152
02:35:52,192 --> 02:35:52,704
And him

3153
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:53,984
Mystikal

3154
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,008
Supporting Trump

3155
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:58,848
Well you see what I'm saying

3156
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:00,384
Conscious

3157
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:02,688
Are so many of these

3158
02:36:03,712 --> 02:36:04,224
There

3159
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,016
Complete and utter traitorous

3160
02:36:08,064 --> 02:36:10,880
For now because in the same way that The Sovereign citizen

3161
02:36:11,136 --> 02:36:16,256
Pledge allegiance to the Constitution or whatever but the federal government

3162
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,048
There is

3163
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:21,376
Christianity

3164
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:25,472
With Christian

3165
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,752
Glitterbug churches

3166
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:29,824
America just not the federal government

3167
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:32,128
It's this weird game of the playing guitar

3168
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:33,408
I'm not a traitor

3169
02:36:33,664 --> 02:36:36,992
I support America but America has been taken over by global it

3170
02:36:37,248 --> 02:36:39,808
Yeah

3171
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:42,368
Supporting America I have to support

3172
02:36:42,624 --> 02:36:43,648
The enemies of America

3173
02:36:45,952 --> 02:36:46,464
And that's

3174
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:47,232
Cockamamie

3175
02:36:47,488 --> 02:36:48,512
Rat that's nonsense

3176
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:49,792
That is

3177
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:52,352
Just like Joel Osteen

3178
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:54,144
And I'm a Christian but I'm talking to

3179
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:54,912
I help anybody

3180
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:56,192
Until

3181
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:59,776
Well even

3182
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:01,312
That was great

3183
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:07,712
A church baby

3184
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:14,112
It doesn't get any more Clips keeps flying around

3185
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:16,160
Online

3186
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:23,840
A frog

3187
02:37:26,400 --> 02:37:29,216
He's been back for a while selling like

3188
02:37:29,472 --> 02:37:30,752
Survival food

3189
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:31,776
He has his own church

3190
02:37:32,032 --> 02:37:33,824
It's another scam just like Alex

3191
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:37,152
But people have been really clowning on him pretty hard on the internet

3192
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:38,432
Cuz he has a

3193
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:40,224
Everyone still watch this

3194
02:37:42,528 --> 02:37:45,856
Let's sing about his survival

3195
02:37:46,112 --> 02:37:46,624
86

3196
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:47,392
It's

3197
02:37:47,648 --> 02:37:51,744
Next level like anyone watching this taking it seriously I don't understand

3198
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:58,144
Obvious fraud spiritualist movement in the early 1900s

3199
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,960
Who would just go around

3200
02:38:01,472 --> 02:38:02,496
And have these rallies

3201
02:38:03,008 --> 02:38:03,520
20000

3202
02:38:04,032 --> 02:38:05,568
We don't

3203
02:38:05,824 --> 02:38:07,360
We don't talk about it all

3204
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:08,384
Especially not Christian

3205
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,432
Eli's and scams

3206
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:14,528
Tent Revival

3207
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:17,088
Anyways watch Gravity Falls

3208
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:17,856
There's great stuff

3209
02:38:18,112 --> 02:38:21,184
To the 21st and 22nd

3210
02:38:21,440 --> 02:38:22,976
I'm going to

3211
02:38:23,232 --> 02:38:25,024
The meat of this episode is really the idea that

3212
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:25,792
Steve pieczenik

3213
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:27,584
Just shown up

3214
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:28,864
On the 21st

3215
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:32,192
But the day after Steve pieczenik

3216
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:34,240
A psychic Warfare expert

3217
02:38:34,752 --> 02:38:36,288
Comes on to Alex Jones Show

3218
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,920
Very prone position

3219
02:38:42,432 --> 02:38:44,224
Alex Jones mentioned someone

3220
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,504
But he will defend

3221
02:38:46,528 --> 02:38:47,040
In the coming month

3222
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:47,808
Samsung Gear

3223
02:38:48,064 --> 02:38:49,088
For the first time ever

3224
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:55,744
Prosecution lawyer for criticizing Muslims

3225
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:57,536
And present and more

3226
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,072
Backpage

3227
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:05,728
So he calls Armory Lipan which indicates

3228
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:07,776
The Narrative you got to get on board with

3229
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:11,872
Got some orders that she was in trouble was because she's

3230
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:15,968
I was going to court

3231
02:39:16,224 --> 02:39:18,272
What she was saying that Muslims were occupied

3232
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:19,040
Parts of speech

3233
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:21,600
And the reason that that is

3234
02:39:21,856 --> 02:39:23,392
What I thought you didn't bring that up

3235
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:26,720
But the reason that trouble is they take occupation

3236
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:28,512
Very seriously in France

3237
02:39:28,768 --> 02:39:31,840
I can't think of any reason why

3238
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:41,312
Seriously

3239
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:44,128
He was talking uncapitalized occupation

3240
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:46,176
The occupation that happened

3241
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:49,760
Occupation as we all know

3242
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:50,528
This is under Admiral

3243
02:39:51,808 --> 02:39:53,088
So if you capitalize

3244
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:58,720
It was Irish people talking about the troubles

3245
02:39:58,976 --> 02:40:00,000
Capital T

3246
02:40:01,536 --> 02:40:02,048
So

3247
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:06,400
Which is my favorite you guys remember

3248
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:10,752
The treble clef phraseology

3249
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:14,592
What's the other things like of Israel called it

3250
02:40:14,848 --> 02:40:16,640
The bummer

3251
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:19,968
The Ono

3252
02:40:20,224 --> 02:40:22,272
So the other thing is that

3253
02:40:22,528 --> 02:40:25,600
Cuz of History being what it is we now know that

3254
02:40:25,856 --> 02:40:27,904
Really get in trouble for that

3255
02:40:28,416 --> 02:40:30,464
But you should have been

3256
02:40:30,720 --> 02:40:31,232
Big deal

3257
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:33,536
Because you can't make light of that sort of

3258
02:40:35,072 --> 02:40:36,864
Your history

3259
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:39,168
Germany call something alcoholic

3260
02:40:41,216 --> 02:40:41,984
You couldn't do that

3261
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:44,544
Without getting into hold on

3262
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,080
You're trying to complete things

3263
02:40:46,336 --> 02:40:47,360
Very unfair

3264
02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:51,456
The soft Association in people's mind

3265
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:53,504
We're Nazis

3266
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:56,320
Of course that's what you was doing and it was 100

3267
02:40:56,576 --> 02:40:57,600
Percent the right thing to do

3268
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:00,160
To give her the old

3269
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:01,184
Hey cut it out

3270
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:02,720
Alex

3271
02:41:03,488 --> 02:41:07,584
Starts defending her on the next episode after Steve pieczenik

3272
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:09,120
And as we all know

3273
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:11,424
Putin was very strongly behind

3274
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:15,264
I can't think of any reason why he was fun

3275
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:16,288
That's so

3276
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:17,824
Very wild

3277
02:41:18,848 --> 02:41:19,616
It is

3278
02:41:19,872 --> 02:41:22,176
To argue with that

3279
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:23,200
Putin is a

3280
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,992
Seems great

3281
02:41:25,248 --> 02:41:27,040
He's really good at it

3282
02:41:27,296 --> 02:41:28,320
Either that or it

3283
02:41:28,576 --> 02:41:31,136
It's just everybody is so dumb

3284
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:32,416
Least dumb person

3285
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:33,952
Seems like a genius

3286
02:41:34,464 --> 02:41:39,072
Do you know anybody who's a little bit it's easier to make

3287
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:39,840
Brilliant

3288
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:40,864
Strategic move

3289
02:41:42,656 --> 02:41:43,168
Right

3290
02:41:43,424 --> 02:41:45,472
Yeah I mean is in the toilet

3291
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,496
And when you have

3292
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:49,312
History of very competent

3293
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:50,080
Secret police

3294
02:41:50,592 --> 02:41:53,664
It like that you've had years to develop tactics

3295
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,272
Comfort

3296
02:41:58,784 --> 02:42:02,112
And windows the secret police

3297
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:03,648
Trees come from tradition

3298
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:06,720
Not having to worry about things being Africa lore legal

3299
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:08,768
I think that you're able to

3300
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:17,216
Yeah so has nothing to lose as how he's a secret

3301
02:42:17,984 --> 02:42:18,496
What

3302
02:42:19,008 --> 02:42:20,544
Hundred billionaire Lake

3303
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:24,384
The idea that we have a Forbes list of richest man and

3304
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,408
Putin isn't

3305
02:42:25,664 --> 02:42:26,432
Number one on the

3306
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:27,968
Is pretty

3307
02:42:28,224 --> 02:42:33,088
Insane like in terms of another step removed from that

3308
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:38,720
They're probably don't know about

3309
02:42:39,232 --> 02:42:41,792
But

3310
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:44,352
We know that the Mercers are billionaires

3311
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:50,240
Almost everybody

3312
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:52,288
Which is why

3313
02:42:54,592 --> 02:42:56,384
French Revolution 2.0

3314
02:42:56,640 --> 02:43:00,480
Vivilore

3315
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:02,784
For all over again

3316
02:43:04,064 --> 02:43:04,576
Support

3317
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:10,464
Actually understand what

3318
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,232
Situationist

3319
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:13,536
But it's really interesting

3320
02:43:13,792 --> 02:43:14,560
50 bulldog

3321
02:43:14,816 --> 02:43:16,352
He says this

3322
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:17,120
Supportive

3323
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:17,888
It's crazy

3324
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:19,424
Advent does this

3325
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:23,264
He immediately I just pause the clip I haven't yet

3326
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,544
He then launches in

3327
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:25,312
To this

3328
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,128
I think he's trying to

3329
02:43:28,384 --> 02:43:29,152
Castigate

3330
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:30,432
Political correctness

3331
02:43:30,944 --> 02:43:34,016
Put on the other end of this clip I want explain why that's stupid

3332
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:45,280
Welcome to the next level of Oppression

3333
02:43:45,536 --> 02:43:48,608
Time

3334
02:43:49,888 --> 02:43:53,728
In a murder or a hit-and-run or a carjacking

3335
02:43:54,752 --> 02:44:00,640
A white male

3336
02:44:01,408 --> 02:44:04,224
A man

3337
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:08,064
He was driving a Ford Chevy

3338
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:09,088
So probably awake

3339
02:44:10,112 --> 02:44:12,160
Then you know what was the quote minorities

3340
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:18,560
And this is an unspoken rule on information

3341
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:21,120
The police

3342
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:23,936
Concert on one subject

3343
02:44:24,192 --> 02:44:26,240
Then I can Segway into every other

3344
02:44:27,776 --> 02:44:31,104
I think that there's a lot of problems

3345
02:44:31,360 --> 02:44:32,640
But there's a lot of problems

3346
02:44:32,896 --> 02:44:33,408
Even with

3347
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:34,176
Just that

3348
02:44:34,432 --> 02:44:35,456
Like that state

3349
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:38,016
Because the idea that when you don't

3350
02:44:38,272 --> 02:44:39,296
Hear someone's race

3351
02:44:39,552 --> 02:44:42,112
Crime report

3352
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:43,904
Is a function of racism

3353
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:48,000
That's how we have

3354
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:52,864
Then NAB has to be specifically called out that it's a white person

3355
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:54,912
Most people won't say radical Islam

3356
02:44:56,192 --> 02:44:57,216
So then the other thing

3357
02:44:58,752 --> 02:44:59,264
Hurricane Harvey

3358
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:02,080
Radical

3359
02:45:02,848 --> 02:45:06,176
Nope there's a hurricane

3360
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:09,248
That when there's looting it's black people and when it's

3361
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:14,368
Scavenging or something like that

3362
02:45:14,624 --> 02:45:15,136
Anguilla

3363
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:17,696
F****** every single person over

3364
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:18,464
Its capital is

3365
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:19,232
Right

3366
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:22,816
Two games to be playing don't even work the way

3367
02:45:23,328 --> 02:45:24,352
Pretending Lee do

3368
02:45:24,864 --> 02:45:26,144
This idea

3369
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:27,680
Political correctness

3370
02:45:27,936 --> 02:45:30,496
Is attacking white people

3371
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,032
That's right away

3372
02:45:32,288 --> 02:45:33,824
There's hundreds of examples

3373
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,896
Is the place that he's totally wrong

3374
02:45:37,152 --> 02:45:37,664
Stomach

3375
02:45:37,920 --> 02:45:41,760
Thing where

3376
02:45:42,272 --> 02:45:42,784
Is

3377
02:45:45,856 --> 02:45:47,136
The same thing

3378
02:45:47,392 --> 02:45:50,976
Like if a white person came up to him it was like I need money can you help me out that's

3379
02:45:51,232 --> 02:45:51,744
Panhandling

3380
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:53,536
You have a black person does it is a bug

3381
02:45:55,072 --> 02:45:55,584
Same thing

3382
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:57,120
He does this all the time

3383
02:45:57,376 --> 02:45:58,144
And then blame

3384
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,704
PC culture for something that doesn't

3385
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,264
It's so weird

3386
02:46:04,031 --> 02:46:04,799
And is that

3387
02:46:05,055 --> 02:46:05,823
Is how he wants

3388
02:46:06,079 --> 02:46:07,871
To talk about Le Pain lawsuit

3389
02:46:08,639 --> 02:46:09,919
Text stupid

3390
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:15,039
Do I want to have something to eat

3391
02:46:15,295 --> 02:46:16,063
You're right on all counts

3392
02:46:16,319 --> 02:46:18,623
Next

3393
02:46:20,927 --> 02:46:21,439
We're getting back

3394
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:23,487
How can we get back

3395
02:46:23,999 --> 02:46:29,631
Hitler why do we always have to go back to how it wasn't that bad of a guy clips

3396
02:46:29,887 --> 02:46:31,679
They're very weird

3397
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:32,703
First one

3398
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:37,823
I love the news I'm going to provide for you on the other hand the only thing I have

3399
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:39,359
To say about your

3400
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,663
Previous rant

3401
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:43,455
It is not weird

3402
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:44,735
It is a miracle

3403
02:46:46,527 --> 02:46:47,039
Normal

3404
02:46:47,295 --> 02:46:48,575
For us

3405
02:46:48,831 --> 02:46:52,159
It is weird for these idiots

3406
02:46:52,415 --> 02:46:53,951
Use race

3407
02:46:54,207 --> 02:46:55,999
It is the most normal thing

3408
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:56,767
What it is

3409
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:59,327
Is wrong that's not the weird part

3410
02:46:59,839 --> 02:47:01,375
What's the weird part is

3411
02:47:02,143 --> 02:47:02,911
Strategies

3412
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:05,471
Cuz it's so

3413
02:47:05,983 --> 02:47:06,495
Wrong

3414
02:47:07,519 --> 02:47:08,031
Factual

3415
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:09,823
And it's so Steve

3416
02:47:10,591 --> 02:47:11,359
Look at it.

3417
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:12,127
It doesn't

3418
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:17,503
I mean

3419
02:47:17,759 --> 02:47:19,295
Effective

3420
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:20,575
Through this kind of

3421
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:23,135
Is something that the

3422
02:47:23,903 --> 02:47:24,927
Right-wing is

3423
02:47:25,183 --> 02:47:25,951
Simply incapable

3424
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:29,279
Kind of not able to do it

3425
02:47:29,535 --> 02:47:31,583
Because of the white spheres and

3426
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:33,631
Christians are under attack

3427
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:36,447
Absolutely

3428
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:37,983
Any any

3429
02:47:38,239 --> 02:47:39,263
Beliefs they have

3430
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:40,543
So long as

3431
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:41,823
White people are fine

3432
02:47:42,079 --> 02:47:42,591
Yeah

3433
02:47:42,847 --> 02:47:44,639
Even though white people are already

3434
02:47:49,503 --> 02:47:50,271
Defend

3435
02:47:50,527 --> 02:47:52,319
Grits

3436
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:53,087
Oh God

3437
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:56,415
Basically

3438
02:47:56,671 --> 02:48:00,511
A week later

3439
02:48:00,767 --> 02:48:03,071
Is true that the g l

3440
02:48:03,327 --> 02:48:05,375
Islamic movement in

3441
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:06,143
Hellboy

3442
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:12,543
Was a Nazi went to Germany

3443
02:48:13,055 --> 02:48:16,127
Encouraged Hitler to kill all the Jews

3444
02:48:16,895 --> 02:48:17,919
And so

3445
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:20,479
Merkel

3446
02:48:20,991 --> 02:48:23,807
Muslims have no part in killing Jews

3447
02:48:24,319 --> 02:48:25,855
It's all Germans fault

3448
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:28,927
I guess modern

3449
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:37,375
That responsibility

3450
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:41,983
Israel prime minister Netanyahu

3451
02:48:42,239 --> 02:48:44,031
Muslim Elder

3452
02:48:44,799 --> 02:48:47,359
Add convince Hitler.

3453
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:55,807
Others really Nazi secret that there is a love affair with the Nazis

3454
02:48:59,647 --> 02:49:01,951
What's the left hand America

3455
02:49:02,463 --> 02:49:06,559
Because it is

3456
02:49:12,191 --> 02:49:13,727
Safari trophy

3457
02:49:14,239 --> 02:49:17,055
Bring up the Renaissance

3458
02:49:17,311 --> 02:49:19,359
So far in this investigation

3459
02:49:19,615 --> 02:49:23,711
2.0 I don't know it's not but it's just he doesn't have brought up too much at this point

3460
02:49:23,967 --> 02:49:25,503
These

3461
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:26,527
Narrative

3462
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:28,575
Lumos from things

3463
02:49:28,831 --> 02:49:29,343
Netanyahu

3464
02:49:29,599 --> 02:49:31,391
Netanyahu

3465
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:34,207
Hitler didn't want to exterminate the Jews at the time

3466
02:49:34,463 --> 02:49:34,975
Time of the meeting

3467
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:35,999
Between the most

3468
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:38,303
He wanted to

3469
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:40,095
Expel the Jews Netanyahu said

3470
02:49:40,351 --> 02:49:40,863
Speech

3471
02:49:41,119 --> 02:49:41,631
And

3472
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:46,751
Amin al-husseini Hitler

3473
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:47,775
52

3474
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:48,799
Palestine

3475
02:49:49,311 --> 02:49:50,079
Continue the prime

3476
02:49:50,591 --> 02:49:52,383
So what should I do with them Hitler

3477
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,687
According to Netanyahu quote

3478
02:49:54,943 --> 02:49:56,223
He

3479
02:49:56,479 --> 02:49:56,991
Burnsville

3480
02:49:57,759 --> 02:49:58,527
So that

3481
02:49:58,783 --> 02:49:59,551
Is a narrative

3482
02:49:59,807 --> 02:50:02,623
That comes out of a guy who's running

3483
02:50:02,879 --> 02:50:04,159
80 Park Heights

3484
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:08,767
Or at least expel all Palestinians

3485
02:50:09,023 --> 02:50:11,071
Israel was such a good idea

3486
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:12,863
DIA

3487
02:50:13,887 --> 02:50:14,911
Man it happen

3488
02:50:15,423 --> 02:50:21,567
Interesting

3489
02:50:26,943 --> 02:50:27,711
About the connection

3490
02:50:27,967 --> 02:50:30,527
Between Mufti Haj Amin al-husseini

3491
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:32,063
He said

3492
02:50:32,319 --> 02:50:38,463
Did not mean to claim was Hitler in November

3493
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:41,279
Solution by themselves

3494
02:50:44,351 --> 02:50:49,983
He was like Facebook let me make sure a far lesser number of people will see this yes

3495
02:50:50,239 --> 02:50:51,519
Did prime minister wrote that

3496
02:50:51,775 --> 02:50:54,079
The decision to move from a policy of

3497
02:50:54,335 --> 02:50:55,871
The final solution was made by the Nazis

3498
02:50:56,383 --> 02:50:58,175
I was not the outside influence

3499
02:50:59,711 --> 02:51:00,223
So

3500
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:01,247
Do you like

3501
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:02,527
Guilt complex

3502
02:51:02,783 --> 02:51:03,295
Overcome

3503
02:51:03,551 --> 02:51:04,319
Committing a genocide

3504
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:05,087
Side is a

3505
02:51:05,599 --> 02:51:06,111
Better things

3506
02:51:09,183 --> 02:51:11,487
I mean if you got to choose one

3507
02:51:11,743 --> 02:51:12,255
Look

3508
02:51:13,535 --> 02:51:16,095
It's almost admirable that the German

3509
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:16,863
People

3510
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:19,167
Cuz America does not

3511
02:51:19,423 --> 02:51:21,215
Care about the many genocides

3512
02:51:24,287 --> 02:51:27,103
A genocider on our $20 bill

3513
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:30,943
Right like it seems like it would be nice if we had more guilt over that

3514
02:51:31,455 --> 02:51:34,783
It would be nice if our genocides were recognized

3515
02:51:35,039 --> 02:51:36,319
Instead of celebrate

3516
02:51:36,831 --> 02:51:38,367
Right that's my position

3517
02:51:38,879 --> 02:51:39,903
I know that's controversy

3518
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:43,487
I think your position

3519
02:51:47,583 --> 02:51:48,863
He's clearly

3520
02:51:50,399 --> 02:51:51,167
Without saying

3521
02:51:51,679 --> 02:51:52,703
Netanyahu's

3522
02:51:54,239 --> 02:51:54,751
Well exactly

3523
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:01,919
Alex Jones

3524
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:05,759
Party-starter

3525
02:52:06,271 --> 02:52:11,391
No that's Darren Carter the party

3526
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:13,951
Alex Jones makes another

3527
02:52:14,207 --> 02:52:15,999
Bogus wild Claim about Hitler

3528
02:52:16,255 --> 02:52:19,583
Hitler was going to work to when he took over Russia

3529
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:22,143
Southern Russia the new Israel

3530
02:52:22,655 --> 02:52:27,263
That makes Dan Hitler was Hitler

3531
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:30,847
What she saw as their Homeland that's why he met with the grand

3532
02:52:32,895 --> 02:52:35,967
Who said no we don't want them here to just chill

3533
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:39,039
And the last few years of World War II

3534
02:52:39,551 --> 02:52:42,111
Hitler

3535
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:52,095
Decide to go to the final solution till Hitler

3536
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:57,215
A battle of

3537
02:52:58,239 --> 02:52:59,007
Leningrad

3538
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:01,311
Stalingrad

3539
02:53:10,015 --> 02:53:13,343
Shifted

3540
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:28,191
Wrong in Hollywood

3541
02:53:32,543 --> 02:53:37,919
Great great guy

3542
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:48,415
What year was the complete out of control

3543
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:51,999
Good save

3544
02:53:56,607 --> 02:53:58,143
In terms of the move already talked

3545
02:54:00,703 --> 02:54:01,727
Yahoo of that argument

3546
02:54:02,751 --> 02:54:03,263
Also

3547
02:54:03,519 --> 02:54:04,543
The

3548
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:05,823
Debunk that he walked

3549
02:54:06,335 --> 02:54:07,871
Mallory Square

3550
02:54:08,127 --> 02:54:08,639
Okay

3551
02:54:08,895 --> 02:54:09,407
Not debunked

3552
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:11,199
Yeah

3553
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:15,807
I know also the siege of Leningrad took place on 8th of September

3554
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:17,343
941

3555
02:54:17,855 --> 02:54:18,367
That's what it began

3556
02:54:20,927 --> 02:54:22,207
Was open from 1940

3557
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:23,999
So

3558
02:54:24,255 --> 02:54:29,119
I believe there was probably a whole bunch of stuff going on before the siege of Leningrad

3559
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:30,655
My guess

3560
02:54:31,167 --> 02:54:31,935
I whip my

3561
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:33,727
I just bought with wasn't the only

3562
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:34,751
I just don't

3563
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:41,151
Like isn't that crazy how white

3564
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:42,175
People are so ugh

3565
02:54:43,455 --> 02:54:44,991
With making Hitler

3566
02:54:45,247 --> 02:54:46,271
Not as bad

3567
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:49,599
Like I everybody agrees Hitler was

3568
02:54:49,855 --> 02:54:52,671
A shame complex

3569
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:53,695
Except for Alex

3570
02:54:53,951 --> 02:54:55,743
Under duress

3571
02:54:57,535 --> 02:55:00,095
He's crazy

3572
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:01,887
Why is it that we can't

3573
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,167
Giselle be like genocide

3574
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:06,751
He's in the midst of

3575
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:08,543
Committed

3576
02:55:10,335 --> 02:55:12,127
Hear about Hitler

3577
02:55:12,383 --> 02:55:13,919
But apartheid is great

3578
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:15,967
Same reason we have this

3579
02:55:17,759 --> 02:55:18,783
Why is anyone again

3580
02:55:19,039 --> 02:55:20,319
Chisholm

3581
02:55:21,599 --> 02:55:24,671
I don't know it's the same it's the same historical

3582
02:55:25,695 --> 02:55:27,743
Might be

3583
02:55:27,999 --> 02:55:28,511
Every night

3584
02:55:28,767 --> 02:55:29,791
10

3585
02:55:30,047 --> 02:55:31,839
Jordan

3586
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:41,567
You're the Funplex

3587
02:55:41,823 --> 02:55:42,335
Is nut

3588
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:45,407
The other thing I wanted to say was

3589
02:55:46,687 --> 02:55:50,015
Our people were I don't know if his older redundant but

3590
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:56,415
That the bushes I bought 200,000 acres in Paraguay if it's been a couple years ago

3591
02:55:56,927 --> 02:55:58,207
Military

3592
02:55:58,975 --> 02:55:59,999
It's a fact

3593
02:56:00,255 --> 02:56:00,767
What I know

3594
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:05,631
The facts from what I know

3595
02:56:05,887 --> 02:56:07,935
Serious news media

3596
02:56:09,983 --> 02:56:12,543
Pictures.

3597
02:56:20,223 --> 02:56:21,759
What happened

3598
02:56:28,415 --> 02:56:29,951
Fake dead body

3599
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:36,351
Mythical globulus Bland

3600
02:56:36,607 --> 02:56:37,887
You f****** brushes if setup

3601
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:44,543
I don't doubt that the bushes have plots of land various most rich people have

3602
02:56:44,799 --> 02:56:46,591
Spots

3603
02:56:46,847 --> 02:56:50,431
Yeah I believe that that's obvious

3604
02:56:50,687 --> 02:56:52,991
I don't know.

3605
02:56:53,759 --> 02:56:56,319
Hi do I kind of look

3606
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:58,111
Dick Cheney

3607
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:02,719
I believe that is pop

3608
02:57:02,975 --> 02:57:03,743
Will someone killed Kenny

3609
02:57:04,255 --> 02:57:05,023
Imprisonment

3610
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:10,143
Suicide

3611
02:57:10,911 --> 02:57:11,423
Not so sure

3612
02:57:11,935 --> 02:57:14,751
So on this

3613
02:57:15,519 --> 02:57:16,031
In prison

3614
02:57:17,823 --> 02:57:18,335
Where's Wallace

3615
02:57:18,847 --> 02:57:22,943
Where's Wallace

3616
02:57:23,711 --> 02:57:27,039
Alex Jones also has a interview with the

3617
02:57:27,807 --> 02:57:28,575
Ronald

3618
02:57:29,087 --> 02:57:29,599
Ron Paul

3619
02:57:29,855 --> 02:57:30,367
Comes on

3620
02:57:30,879 --> 02:57:32,159
Mary talk

3621
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:32,927
Alright

3622
02:57:33,183 --> 02:57:35,231
This promises to be fun

3623
02:57:36,767 --> 02:57:40,095
What's the point of Ron Paul

3624
02:57:41,887 --> 02:57:47,519
I mean he just talks about in this next year we will find out if Alex Jones supports Trump

3625
02:57:48,031 --> 02:57:50,079
In this conversation with Ron Paul

3626
02:57:52,895 --> 02:57:54,431
He makes a little bit of sense

3627
02:57:58,271 --> 02:58:01,599
It's the same danger with with most

3628
02:58:01,855 --> 02:58:02,367
Third party

3629
02:58:02,879 --> 02:58:04,415
It's like a lacrosse

3630
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:05,439
Like occasionally

3631
02:58:05,695 --> 02:58:07,999
Ross Perot

3632
02:58:08,255 --> 02:58:09,791
Ross Perot

3633
02:58:10,047 --> 02:58:16,191
Yeah that's right

3634
02:58:16,447 --> 02:58:18,239
New York on July

3635
02:58:18,495 --> 02:58:19,007
Alright

3636
02:58:19,263 --> 02:58:21,567
What what's next

3637
02:58:30,271 --> 02:58:31,295
Finally get to find out

3638
02:58:31,807 --> 02:58:32,575
If Alex Jones

3639
02:58:32,831 --> 02:58:33,599
Supports Trump

3640
02:58:33,855 --> 02:58:38,719
Cam one final question on the election

3641
02:58:42,815 --> 02:58:44,095
I don't flip flop

3642
02:58:44,351 --> 02:58:45,631
Yeah like the other candidates

3643
02:58:46,143 --> 02:58:49,983
Obviously a lot of what Donald Trump has to shave for a populace to Prairie

3644
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:52,287
Constitutional in some cases but

3645
02:58:52,543 --> 02:58:56,127
He said things about me loving Hillary in the past

3646
02:58:56,383 --> 02:58:57,663
I don't really trust

3647
02:58:57,919 --> 02:58:59,455
In the final equation but

3648
02:58:59,711 --> 02:59:01,759
What is yours Donald Trump

3649
02:59:02,015 --> 02:59:04,575
Overall The Final Countdown

3650
02:59:04,831 --> 02:59:07,135
Healthy for the debate or do you think she's on helping

3651
02:59:07,647 --> 02:59:09,951
Guarantee

3652
02:59:10,207 --> 02:59:13,535
That the American people win be sucked in it makes him president

3653
02:59:26,335 --> 02:59:29,151
Play Whittier is a powerful Dragon

3654
02:59:34,271 --> 02:59:37,599
At the same time he doesn't get pushed around with the media

3655
02:59:37,855 --> 02:59:40,415
I think

3656
02:59:40,671 --> 02:59:41,439
I think

3657
02:59:41,695 --> 02:59:42,975
Trouble is coming

3658
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:46,303
And he would have his word

3659
02:59:51,423 --> 02:59:55,519
I'm not looking for

3660
02:59:55,775 --> 03:00:00,895
I don't want to tell people what to do

3661
03:00:01,151 --> 03:00:04,735
I want to deliver the Liberty

3662
03:00:04,991 --> 03:00:11,135
And local people take care of these problems but I don't think I don't think Donald Trump would respond to that as

3663
03:00:24,191 --> 03:00:26,495
Get on a big white horse

3664
03:00:29,823 --> 03:00:32,895
Chose the backlash against teleprompter

3665
03:00:33,151 --> 03:00:34,943
Politics

3666
03:00:37,247 --> 03:00:41,855
Exactly what the

3667
03:00:42,111 --> 03:00:44,159
Words

3668
03:00:45,695 --> 03:00:46,975
Now from Alex

3669
03:00:47,231 --> 03:00:52,095
That's exactly what the country doesn't need

3670
03:00:52,351 --> 03:00:53,119
Now Alex Jones

3671
03:00:53,375 --> 03:00:54,143
A couple of things

3672
03:00:54,399 --> 03:00:54,911
Better fun

3673
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:57,471
Ron Paul is totally right

3674
03:00:57,727 --> 03:00:58,751
Incense

3675
03:00:59,263 --> 03:01:02,847
I would be okay with this if there be no way

3676
03:01:03,103 --> 03:01:04,639
Hilarious

3677
03:01:04,895 --> 03:01:11,039
I hate your brother was on charge on 9/11

3678
03:01:11,295 --> 03:01:17,439
You dick

3679
03:01:17,695 --> 03:01:18,463
Spanish

3680
03:01:21,791 --> 03:01:22,303
Reasonable

3681
03:01:22,815 --> 03:01:24,863
Especially because he is making it clear that

3682
03:01:25,119 --> 03:01:28,191
I don't think you'd be a good president

3683
03:01:28,447 --> 03:01:29,727
Of libertarianism

3684
03:01:29,983 --> 03:01:30,495
Alex

3685
03:01:32,799 --> 03:01:33,311
Supposedly

3686
03:01:33,567 --> 03:01:34,847
Now he's fine with a little

3687
03:01:36,639 --> 03:01:37,663
Time goes on

3688
03:01:38,175 --> 03:01:39,455
We need to start looking

3689
03:01:40,479 --> 03:01:40,991
Is

3690
03:01:41,503 --> 03:01:43,551
Rand Paul is clearly who he loves

3691
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:45,087
Rand Paul

3692
03:01:45,343 --> 03:01:46,111
Also

3693
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:46,879
Supports Rush

3694
03:01:48,159 --> 03:01:48,671
Really

3695
03:01:48,927 --> 03:01:51,743
Rand Paul was one of the only people who did not vote

3696
03:01:51,999 --> 03:01:52,767
For sanction

3697
03:01:57,631 --> 03:01:58,911
Right before puberty

3698
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:03,007
That is true but also

3699
03:02:03,263 --> 03:02:06,335
What's up with that Ron Paul is a frequent guest on Ark

3700
03:02:07,359 --> 03:02:07,871
Really

3701
03:02:08,127 --> 03:02:09,407
Yes true

3702
03:02:09,663 --> 03:02:10,687
Yeah

3703
03:02:10,943 --> 03:02:11,455
It's very true

3704
03:02:12,223 --> 03:02:16,575
That alone. It's not like damning or anything like that

3705
03:02:16,831 --> 03:02:18,367
Your case though especially when

3706
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:24,767
We're starting to realize that all of this does seem to be more about Russia absolute

3707
03:02:25,023 --> 03:02:26,559
We can get to the point where we have

3708
03:02:26,815 --> 03:02:28,607
Hey psychic Warfare guy that Alex Jones

3709
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:30,399
Respect and thanks isn't f****** with him

3710
03:02:30,655 --> 03:02:33,727
Come on the show and talk about a Ruck is great

3711
03:02:33,983 --> 03:02:38,335
And eventually

3712
03:02:41,919 --> 03:02:43,199
He is this is our guy

3713
03:02:44,223 --> 03:02:45,759
Still saying maybe Ben Carson

3714
03:02:46,271 --> 03:02:47,039
You'll be okay

3715
03:02:48,063 --> 03:02:48,831
Insane

3716
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:51,391
Yeah from his

3717
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:53,183
Housing and Urban Development

3718
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:54,975
In hindsight

3719
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:56,511
The

3720
03:02:56,767 --> 03:02:57,279
No

3721
03:02:58,559 --> 03:03:02,655
Is B like that you'd be like those are my two

3722
03:03:05,215 --> 03:03:07,007
All of this seems to be about Russia

3723
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:10,335
And his love of

3724
03:03:11,103 --> 03:03:14,431
Bobby also is involved with Russia

3725
03:03:21,855 --> 03:03:22,367
I don't know anymore

3726
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:23,903
I just don't know

3727
03:03:24,415 --> 03:03:25,439
I just don't know what to do

3728
03:03:25,695 --> 03:03:26,463
I just wish

3729
03:03:28,255 --> 03:03:28,767
Happening

3730
03:03:29,023 --> 03:03:29,791
Everybody

3731
03:03:30,047 --> 03:03:30,815
Destroying

3732
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:33,119
Ha

3733
03:03:33,375 --> 03:03:33,887
Sriracha

3734
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:34,911
Flea market

3735
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:37,471
It's not and it seems like everyone who's being

3736
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:38,239
Tricked

3737
03:03:38,495 --> 03:03:40,799
Is being tricked in the direction Russia wants

3738
03:03:41,055 --> 03:03:41,567
People to be pretty

3739
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:44,383
That seems to be a very common theme

3740
03:03:44,639 --> 03:03:47,199
Or they're clearly

3741
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:47,967
Fricano's in your

3742
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:50,015
Like it

3743
03:03:50,271 --> 03:03:50,783
Most likely

3744
03:03:56,927 --> 03:03:58,719
Either either there

3745
03:04:00,767 --> 03:04:02,303
Patient their bought-and-paid-for biology

3746
03:04:06,143 --> 03:04:08,959
For people like Julian Assange

3747
03:04:10,239 --> 03:04:11,519
Bought by the oligarchs

3748
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:13,567
And the people are

3749
03:04:14,847 --> 03:04:17,151
Just lost his mind ideological

3750
03:04:17,407 --> 03:04:18,943
Find

3751
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:21,503
I don't think he has anything other than he's just

3752
03:04:21,759 --> 03:04:22,271
Insane person

3753
03:04:23,039 --> 03:04:24,319
It's possible

3754
03:04:24,575 --> 03:04:26,623
Trapped in one room for how long

3755
03:04:28,415 --> 03:04:29,439
I don't know

3756
03:04:29,695 --> 03:04:30,463
I don't like

3757
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:31,743
Literal

3758
03:04:31,999 --> 03:04:32,511
That

3759
03:04:33,023 --> 03:04:35,583
Like not one

3760
03:04:37,119 --> 03:04:40,447
The point is they proven that that kind of isolation will make

3761
03:04:40,959 --> 03:04:41,727
Sprite

3762
03:04:41,983 --> 03:04:43,263
So I'm sure it's on

3763
03:04:43,775 --> 03:04:46,847
It regarded like he's always been a complete and utter peace

3764
03:04:48,127 --> 03:04:50,687
But I'm sure it's some point

3765
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:52,735
He had lost

3766
03:04:52,991 --> 03:04:55,039
Information should be free and now it's just

3767
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:59,903
Super villain in his constant

3768
03:05:00,159 --> 03:05:02,719
Oral also

3769
03:05:02,975 --> 03:05:04,767
Of course you're going to join with Russia

3770
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:07,327
Because it's the only other places like

3771
03:05:07,583 --> 03:05:11,167
Megalomania is great

3772
03:05:11,423 --> 03:05:12,959
Also another thing that bears

3773
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:13,727
Just pointing out

3774
03:05:13,983 --> 03:05:15,263
Is in 2017

3775
03:05:15,519 --> 03:05:16,031
In the last

3776
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:17,823
On Alex Jones Show

3777
03:05:18,079 --> 03:05:19,103
He's had as a guest

3778
03:05:21,407 --> 03:05:22,943
For the second time within a month

3779
03:05:23,199 --> 03:05:25,247
Not good and a guy named Charles Johnson

3780
03:05:25,759 --> 03:05:27,295
Who's a journalist

3781
03:05:28,831 --> 03:05:29,599
He is a hack

3782
03:05:30,879 --> 03:05:37,023
Pimps for Russia recently photographed outside of the Ecuadorian Embassy

3783
03:05:37,279 --> 03:05:38,815
Meeting with Julian Assange

3784
03:05:39,071 --> 03:05:45,215
Other person who is there who is the most

3785
03:05:45,471 --> 03:05:49,823
Pro Russia senator

3786
03:05:50,079 --> 03:05:50,847
Constantly

3787
03:05:51,103 --> 03:05:52,127
Trying to

3788
03:05:52,639 --> 03:05:53,919
Pitch pro-russia possess

3789
03:05:54,687 --> 03:05:55,199
Athens

3790
03:05:56,991 --> 03:05:57,759
Real

3791
03:05:58,271 --> 03:06:00,831
Those people

3792
03:06:01,087 --> 03:06:03,135
It makes sense if you look critically

3793
03:06:03,391 --> 03:06:04,671
He was doing in the election

3794
03:06:04,927 --> 03:06:06,207
It's not about Trump

3795
03:06:06,463 --> 03:06:08,511
It never has been about dropped about Russia

3796
03:06:09,023 --> 03:06:09,791
Cool thing is

3797
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:11,839
It's a diversion

3798
03:06:12,095 --> 03:06:13,631
Trump is a diversion

3799
03:06:13,887 --> 03:06:14,911
And that's what I'm learning

3800
03:06:15,167 --> 03:06:16,703
Is that makes this investigation

3801
03:06:17,215 --> 03:06:18,751
Really unsatisfying

3802
03:06:19,007 --> 03:06:20,031
That really scary

3803
03:06:20,543 --> 03:06:21,055
Fuct

3804
03:06:21,311 --> 03:06:24,127
Internet

3805
03:06:24,383 --> 03:06:27,455
Is crazy didn't even bother because we may be witnessing a

3806
03:06:27,711 --> 03:06:28,223
Conspiracy

3807
03:06:30,015 --> 03:06:30,527
In public

3808
03:06:30,783 --> 03:06:31,807
Yeah in public

3809
03:06:34,111 --> 03:06:34,879
Yeah

3810
03:06:35,135 --> 03:06:37,951
But the reasons

3811
03:06:38,207 --> 03:06:38,975
How many people

3812
03:06:39,743 --> 03:06:40,767
Like there's so many

3813
03:06:41,535 --> 03:06:43,327
Hundreds of millions of people in the United

3814
03:06:44,863 --> 03:06:45,631
Who just don't

3815
03:06:45,887 --> 03:06:46,911
No or don't

3816
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:47,935
Care to find out

3817
03:06:48,191 --> 03:06:51,263
Yeah like this is this is truly one of

3818
03:06:51,775 --> 03:06:52,287
Great

3819
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:54,847
Military maneuvers

3820
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:56,383
In in history

3821
03:06:57,151 --> 03:06:59,967
Like to have completely compromised

3822
03:07:01,247 --> 03:07:02,015
Tire Republic

3823
03:07:05,855 --> 03:07:07,647
At every level

3824
03:07:08,927 --> 03:07:10,975
Now own it almost

3825
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:12,511
Entirely

3826
03:07:15,583 --> 03:07:16,095
Because

3827
03:07:16,607 --> 03:07:17,631
If you control it

3828
03:07:18,655 --> 03:07:19,935
So

3829
03:07:20,191 --> 03:07:21,727
Complete crippling chaos

3830
03:07:24,287 --> 03:07:25,567
What more sanctions

3831
03:07:25,823 --> 03:07:27,615
We're already

3832
03:07:27,871 --> 03:07:29,919
Non economy

3833
03:07:30,175 --> 03:07:32,223
All the people

3834
03:07:32,735 --> 03:07:34,271
Continuous power

3835
03:07:34,527 --> 03:07:36,319
Not really as affected by the sanction

3836
03:07:39,647 --> 03:07:40,415
But to the extent

3837
03:07:40,671 --> 03:07:43,487
He still has hundreds of billions of dollars and the oligarch

3838
03:07:43,743 --> 03:07:45,535
Makeup history

3839
03:07:45,791 --> 03:07:50,655
Hugely rich is trickle down to

3840
03:07:50,911 --> 03:07:54,751
To punish the citizens who already

3841
03:07:55,007 --> 03:07:56,543
Trickle down economics

3842
03:07:57,311 --> 03:08:00,639
If you are.

3843
03:08:00,895 --> 03:08:05,503
Yeah it always goes in the bottom

3844
03:08:06,015 --> 03:08:08,319
I think that might be

3845
03:08:10,623 --> 03:08:12,927
So we've discovered I think

3846
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:13,951
And I

3847
03:08:14,207 --> 03:08:14,719
I've listened

3848
03:08:14,975 --> 03:08:16,255
The next couple episodes

3849
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:19,071
The next bike week or so

3850
03:08:20,351 --> 03:08:20,863
We're going to see

3851
03:08:21,119 --> 03:08:22,143
Steve is develop even more

3852
03:08:22,399 --> 03:08:22,911
But

3853
03:08:23,679 --> 03:08:24,447
Because

3854
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:26,495
David Knight takes over

3855
03:08:26,751 --> 03:08:27,519
For the next bike

3856
03:08:27,775 --> 03:08:29,823
4 days or so I want to walk

3857
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:30,591
You through

3858
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:31,871
October 9th

3859
03:08:32,895 --> 03:08:34,687
October 22nd is the last day

3860
03:08:34,943 --> 03:08:36,479
For Alex Jones disappears Misty

3861
03:08:39,039 --> 03:08:40,063
Is having some secretive mean

3862
03:08:40,575 --> 03:08:42,623
I think he's going down

3863
03:08:43,135 --> 03:08:43,903
Or something like that

3864
03:08:44,159 --> 03:08:46,463
Steve might have set something up I don't know

3865
03:08:46,975 --> 03:08:49,023
But it's very weird that you have this

3866
03:08:49,279 --> 03:08:49,791
Introduction

3867
03:08:51,583 --> 03:08:52,351
And then

3868
03:08:52,607 --> 03:08:55,679
You start supporting lapel

3869
03:08:55,935 --> 03:08:57,471
Disappear on a trip

3870
03:08:57,727 --> 03:08:58,239
Now

3871
03:08:59,775 --> 03:09:01,311
In order to

3872
03:09:01,567 --> 03:09:02,079
To just

3873
03:09:02,335 --> 03:09:03,871
Ensure that

3874
03:09:04,127 --> 03:09:05,919
We don't get too far down this

3875
03:09:06,175 --> 03:09:08,991
Rabbit-hole Alex Jones

3876
03:09:09,503 --> 03:09:11,039
Hair dye

3877
03:09:11,551 --> 03:09:13,343
Frequently

3878
03:09:14,111 --> 03:09:15,391
This if it is

3879
03:09:15,903 --> 03:09:16,671
Timing-wise

3880
03:09:16,927 --> 03:09:17,695
Very suspicious

3881
03:09:18,463 --> 03:09:20,767
However he does leave a lot so I'm not

3882
03:09:21,023 --> 03:09:24,863
I'm not willing to jump on that call this true

3883
03:09:25,887 --> 03:09:26,399
That's fair

3884
03:09:26,911 --> 03:09:29,471
We just got tired from carrying Russia's water

3885
03:09:29,727 --> 03:09:31,007
Persolog

3886
03:09:32,287 --> 03:09:37,151
The most is a long commercial for the alexapure water system

3887
03:09:37,407 --> 03:09:39,711
He's going to introduce into the Infowars store

3888
03:09:39,967 --> 03:09:42,015
Another day

3889
03:09:42,527 --> 03:09:45,855
I think he would have laughed cuz this show is uninspired and boring

3890
03:09:46,111 --> 03:09:47,647
There is not much going on

3891
03:09:47,903 --> 03:09:52,511
All he does is trying retcon the idea was going to run for president

3892
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:54,303
SoundCloud

3893
03:09:54,559 --> 03:09:56,863
That news comes out that he's not running

3894
03:09:57,119 --> 03:10:00,191
Reclaim it

3895
03:10:02,239 --> 03:10:02,751
Afraid of Hillary

3896
03:10:03,263 --> 03:10:06,591
No matter what your narrative is going to fly

3897
03:10:08,895 --> 03:10:09,919
3 drop

3898
03:10:10,943 --> 03:10:11,455
That are just

3899
03:10:11,711 --> 03:10:14,783
Fun from October 23rd or 22nd

3900
03:10:15,039 --> 03:10:17,087
It's good that we're just going to run through

3901
03:10:18,623 --> 03:10:21,183
I just fun because I think we

3902
03:10:21,439 --> 03:10:23,231
I've gotten too serious

3903
03:10:23,487 --> 03:10:25,023
The first one

3904
03:10:36,799 --> 03:10:40,127
I need a break

3905
03:10:43,199 --> 03:10:46,271
Separate no reason to explain why

3906
03:10:46,527 --> 03:10:50,623
That's a that's a continuation of his I'm going to go knock on people's doors and knobs

3907
03:10:50,879 --> 03:10:54,719
Give birth

3908
03:10:54,975 --> 03:10:55,487
Corsair

3909
03:10:57,279 --> 03:11:02,655
I need the phone number

3910
03:11:02,911 --> 03:11:04,191
That's not pathetic at all

3911
03:11:05,215 --> 03:11:07,007
Yeah

3912
03:11:10,847 --> 03:11:12,895
Desperate

3913
03:11:19,807 --> 03:11:22,111
Out of context

3914
03:11:22,367 --> 03:11:23,903
Possibly wrestling with

3915
03:11:24,415 --> 03:11:27,999
Will inevitably be his demise but has not been yet

3916
03:11:28,767 --> 03:11:29,535
We had

3917
03:11:33,119 --> 03:11:36,959
A lot of folks here

3918
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:44,383
But look at what he's told us over the years it's turned out to basically be true

3919
03:11:51,807 --> 03:11:56,415
George W Bush's involved

3920
03:11:57,951 --> 03:12:02,559
Relations advising them

3921
03:12:03,071 --> 03:12:06,399
Just Jeb Bush up so they can

3922
03:12:06,655 --> 03:12:11,007
Hahaha your psychological warfare

3923
03:12:14,335 --> 03:12:16,127
Just going to win

3924
03:12:16,639 --> 03:12:17,407
We're going to be positive

3925
03:12:25,599 --> 03:12:28,415
Resistance at that level

3926
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:31,743
What he's saying is true and is being listened to

3927
03:12:33,023 --> 03:12:36,095
Broadcast is a format for that to happen

3928
03:12:38,655 --> 03:12:39,423
That's pathetic

3929
03:12:40,191 --> 03:12:41,471
That's incredibly sad

3930
03:12:41,983 --> 03:12:42,751
Cuz he's even

3931
03:12:43,007 --> 03:12:48,127
Saying it on the show his lies and manipulates reply to everyone

3932
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:52,223
Right

3933
03:12:52,735 --> 03:12:54,783
Because

3934
03:12:58,111 --> 03:12:59,135
I listen to

3935
03:12:59,391 --> 03:12:59,903
Steve

3936
03:13:00,159 --> 03:13:03,231
I bet nobody else

3937
03:13:03,743 --> 03:13:05,791
No answer he's never told anybody else

3938
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:07,583
I'm not f****** with you

3939
03:13:11,167 --> 03:13:11,679
You see

3940
03:13:11,935 --> 03:13:13,471
Immediately how

3941
03:13:13,727 --> 03:13:14,239
Comment

3942
03:13:15,263 --> 03:13:16,543
And how you can help

3943
03:13:17,055 --> 03:13:18,335
Exactly

3944
03:13:19,615 --> 03:13:20,127
You can

3945
03:13:21,407 --> 03:13:22,687
Like I like everybody

3946
03:13:22,943 --> 03:13:24,223
Every single person

3947
03:13:24,735 --> 03:13:26,015
Imagine that they would

3948
03:13:26,271 --> 03:13:27,295
Never be taken in by a

3949
03:13:29,087 --> 03:13:29,599
Until they do

3950
03:13:29,855 --> 03:13:30,623
And they are

3951
03:13:30,879 --> 03:13:31,903
We're all alike

3952
03:13:32,671 --> 03:13:34,719
I want to believe that I wouldn't

3953
03:13:34,975 --> 03:13:35,487
Be taken in by a

3954
03:13:36,511 --> 03:13:40,607
Simply because of doing this dumb f****** show

3955
03:13:40,863 --> 03:13:41,375
No I'm sorry

3956
03:13:41,631 --> 03:13:42,143
I'm sorry

3957
03:13:47,775 --> 03:13:49,311
Tire deal is skepta

3958
03:13:51,359 --> 03:13:52,127
The same time you see

3959
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:54,431
People like Louise Mensch

3960
03:13:56,735 --> 03:13:57,503
See all these

3961
03:13:57,759 --> 03:13:58,271
Different Kahneman

3962
03:13:58,527 --> 03:13:59,551
And it doesn't matter what

3963
03:13:59,807 --> 03:14:00,831

3964
03:14:01,599 --> 03:14:02,111
Plenty of

3965
03:14:02,367 --> 03:14:03,135
People can be calm

3966
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:04,671
Just by being told

3967
03:14:04,927 --> 03:14:05,439
That what

3968
03:14:05,695 --> 03:14:06,463
They already think

3969
03:14:07,743 --> 03:14:10,815
It's like it's like a

3970
03:14:11,071 --> 03:14:12,095
Where's like

3971
03:14:12,607 --> 03:14:15,679
You were born under this sign and that means that

3972
03:14:16,191 --> 03:14:19,519
You're a good person and you like going out but sometimes he likes

3973
03:14:19,775 --> 03:14:22,591
Like I already know that

3974
03:14:22,847 --> 03:14:23,615
The trail Beyond

3975
03:14:23,871 --> 03:14:24,895
At 2 I think the

3976
03:14:25,151 --> 03:14:27,199
The connection between Louise Mensch

3977
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:28,223
And Alex Jones

3978
03:14:32,319 --> 03:14:35,135
The line that they feed you that you want to hear also involved

3979
03:14:35,391 --> 03:14:35,903
In action

3980
03:14:37,695 --> 03:14:40,767
Narrative

3981
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:41,535
To do with

3982
03:14:41,791 --> 03:14:43,839
Haters already sealed indictments

3983
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:46,143
He's already been impeached

3984
03:14:46,655 --> 03:14:48,959
Iraq

3985
03:14:49,215 --> 03:14:50,495
The only real

3986
03:14:51,263 --> 03:14:54,335
Functional outcome of that is all taken care of

3987
03:14:54,591 --> 03:14:55,615
Right and to ascertain

3988
03:14:55,871 --> 03:14:57,919
Does the same thing

3989
03:14:58,175 --> 03:15:00,223
Like we've got these people like

3990
03:15:00,479 --> 03:15:06,111
We're working at on the inside it's all a counter-coup

3991
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:07,647
I mean he's not there yet

3992
03:15:07,903 --> 03:15:09,695
But you'll be there

3993
03:15:09,951 --> 03:15:13,279
And the only thing he needs to scream and get action about is not

3994
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:14,303
It's not doing it

3995
03:15:16,863 --> 03:15:20,447
Give me money and he'll take care of his much does

3996
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:21,215
Take money

3997
03:15:21,471 --> 03:15:22,495
From people but at the same time

3998
03:15:22,751 --> 03:15:23,263
She doesn't

3999
03:15:23,519 --> 03:15:26,591
She's not as overt as Alex

4000
03:15:27,103 --> 03:15:28,127
Could be the beginning

4001
03:15:28,383 --> 03:15:29,919
Open Alex Jones like

4002
03:15:30,175 --> 03:15:33,759
Probably

4003
03:15:34,271 --> 03:15:34,783
Lies

4004
03:15:37,855 --> 03:15:38,623
That is kind of

4005
03:15:38,879 --> 03:15:39,647
Really good point

4006
03:15:40,159 --> 03:15:40,671
That

4007
03:15:40,927 --> 03:15:41,439
I hadn't thought of

4008
03:15:43,231 --> 03:15:44,511
Fight

4009
03:15:44,767 --> 03:15:46,559
One thing that I hate getting

4010
03:15:47,327 --> 03:15:48,351
It's from the Mueller.

4011
03:15:49,119 --> 03:15:51,423
Like you made a good point and

4012
03:15:51,935 --> 03:15:52,703
Any kind of

4013
03:15:53,471 --> 03:15:54,495
Made me realize why I thought

4014
03:15:55,007 --> 03:15:56,799
I don't care what Mueller's doing

4015
03:15:57,055 --> 03:16:02,175
He's got like a year before anything is going to f****** happen I get there

4016
03:16:02,431 --> 03:16:03,199
He's f****** stupid

4017
03:16:03,455 --> 03:16:03,967
Penang people

4018
03:16:04,479 --> 03:16:05,503
But until something

4019
03:16:06,015 --> 03:16:06,527
Happened

4020
03:16:06,783 --> 03:16:07,551
Who gives a f***

4021
03:16:08,319 --> 03:16:09,599
I guess we have to fight him

4022
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:12,159
Now everywhere

4023
03:16:12,415 --> 03:16:15,231
I think so

4024
03:16:15,487 --> 03:16:16,767
Bueller doesn't get his

4025
03:16:17,023 --> 03:16:17,791
Evanston

4026
03:16:18,047 --> 03:16:19,071
47

4027
03:16:19,327 --> 03:16:22,143
That means every f****** DACA recipient

4028
03:16:22,399 --> 03:16:23,423
Is already gone

4029
03:16:23,935 --> 03:16:26,239
Smile but that's that

4030
03:16:26,495 --> 03:16:29,823
But you know

4031
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:36,223
First comes in a little bit interested in your entrance music is that

4032
03:16:38,527 --> 03:16:43,135
I think it's reasonable to be dismissive of these like

4033
03:16:43,391 --> 03:16:44,415
Attention-grabbing

4034
03:16:44,671 --> 03:16:49,023
New things in Mueller's investigation

4035
03:16:49,279 --> 03:16:50,815
Discounting the entirety of

4036
03:16:51,327 --> 03:16:52,095
The goal

4037
03:16:52,351 --> 03:16:56,191
I think is to look for investigations

4038
03:16:57,727 --> 03:16:58,239
But at the

4039
03:16:58,751 --> 03:17:00,799
But at the same time and not let

4040
03:17:01,055 --> 03:17:01,567
This

4041
03:17:01,823 --> 03:17:02,847
Image of

4042
03:17:03,103 --> 03:17:06,431
Some DSX Machina come

4043
03:17:06,687 --> 03:17:08,991
Down the road that we have no control over

4044
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:12,831
Stop us from taking direct action

4045
03:17:13,087 --> 03:17:13,599
To be a problem

4046
03:17:13,855 --> 03:17:14,623
In the immediate

4047
03:17:15,903 --> 03:17:17,439
All that stuff like with DACA

4048
03:17:17,695 --> 03:17:21,535
There isn't anything in his investigation that's going to be involved

4049
03:17:22,047 --> 03:17:24,095
Right takes people calling senators

4050
03:17:24,351 --> 03:17:25,887
That takes people getting on the street

4051
03:17:26,399 --> 03:17:26,911
So you have

4052
03:17:27,167 --> 03:17:28,191
Do those things

4053
03:17:28,447 --> 03:17:31,775
Complacent with the idea he's going to get impeached eventually

4054
03:17:32,031 --> 03:17:33,055
You have to balance it

4055
03:17:33,311 --> 03:17:34,335
He is going to get impeached

4056
03:17:34,591 --> 03:17:35,103
Eventually

4057
03:17:35,359 --> 03:17:37,407
Each time

4058
03:17:37,663 --> 03:17:38,687
There is something

4059
03:17:39,199 --> 03:17:39,967
Tries to

4060
03:17:41,759 --> 03:17:42,783
Has a

4061
03:17:43,039 --> 03:17:45,087
4% approval rating in Brazil

4062
03:17:45,343 --> 03:17:45,855
He is

4063
03:17:46,111 --> 03:17:47,135
Caught on tape

4064
03:17:47,647 --> 03:17:49,951
Committing a crime by offering bribes

4065
03:17:50,207 --> 03:17:51,999
Well and what happened

4066
03:17:53,023 --> 03:17:54,815
F*** off

4067
03:17:55,071 --> 03:17:55,839
We're not Brazil

4068
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:57,375
And we're not Kenya

4069
03:17:57,631 --> 03:17:58,143
There

4070
03:17:58,399 --> 03:17:59,167
Vera Wang

4071
03:17:59,679 --> 03:18:03,263
Different countries work different ways that's true true

4072
03:18:03,519 --> 03:18:04,031
Hopefully

4073
03:18:04,287 --> 03:18:07,103
You know is it

4074
03:18:07,359 --> 03:18:12,991
But that's not a precedent for our court for their idea is

4075
03:18:14,015 --> 03:18:15,807
I think we're all learning in a very

4076
03:18:17,599 --> 03:18:19,135
Is on

4077
03:18:23,743 --> 03:18:24,767
I think

4078
03:18:26,303 --> 03:18:28,863
Yeah it is a bad

4079
03:18:33,471 --> 03:18:33,983
Vision 2000

4080
03:18:40,383 --> 03:18:40,895
I know what I was going to

4081
03:18:43,455 --> 03:18:47,295
The thing is the lesson that we're learning the very hard way is that are

4082
03:18:47,551 --> 03:18:48,063
Institution

4083
03:18:48,319 --> 03:18:48,831
Don't save us

4084
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:50,111
Tradition

4085
03:18:50,367 --> 03:18:51,135
Zariel in Leicester

4086
03:18:52,159 --> 03:18:52,927
Right

4087
03:18:53,183 --> 03:18:55,999
The things that are being pushed that are against arvo

4088
03:18:56,511 --> 03:18:57,023
Against

4089
03:18:57,279 --> 03:18:57,791
American

4090
03:18:58,047 --> 03:18:58,815
Principles

4091
03:18:59,071 --> 03:18:59,583
It is

4092
03:18:59,839 --> 03:19:00,863
Behoove

4093
03:19:02,143 --> 03:19:02,655
Takacs

4094
03:19:02,911 --> 03:19:03,423
Shinto

4095
03:19:03,679 --> 03:19:04,191
Keep

4096
03:19:04,959 --> 03:19:05,471
Fighting

4097
03:19:06,495 --> 03:19:07,519
I don't know

4098
03:19:08,031 --> 03:19:08,543
I like

4099
03:19:10,335 --> 03:19:11,359
I don't know what you can do

4100
03:19:11,871 --> 03:19:18,015
I don't know you can tweet tweet we can do this.

4101
03:19:18,527 --> 03:19:20,319
You have to do those things

4102
03:19:20,575 --> 03:19:21,599
Cuz without them

4103
03:19:22,111 --> 03:19:22,879
There's nothing

4104
03:19:23,391 --> 03:19:27,743
There's nothing complete demolition of

4105
03:19:28,255 --> 03:19:31,839
Olive olive

4106
03:19:32,095 --> 03:19:32,607
Non-white

4107
03:19:32,863 --> 03:19:38,495
All the games that was made

4108
03:19:38,751 --> 03:19:40,031
Society

4109
03:19:40,543 --> 03:19:41,567
The times of

4110
03:19:42,335 --> 03:19:42,847
Upton

4111
03:19:43,103 --> 03:19:43,871
Sinclair

4112
03:19:44,127 --> 03:19:46,687
Like all the stuff

4113
03:19:46,943 --> 03:19:47,455
Is we don't want to work

4114
03:19:49,503 --> 03:19:50,015
If we don't

4115
03:19:50,271 --> 03:19:50,783
Act

4116
03:19:51,039 --> 03:19:51,551
We will

4117
03:19:52,319 --> 03:19:53,599
And

4118
03:19:53,855 --> 03:19:59,999
Mueller's investigation probably will turn up something by dark shape

4119
03:20:01,791 --> 03:20:03,583
Certain point somebody

4120
03:20:04,095 --> 03:20:05,119
Haitian like one of the lower level

4121
03:20:05,375 --> 03:20:05,887
People

4122
03:20:06,143 --> 03:20:06,655
Is going to catch

4123
03:20:06,911 --> 03:20:07,679
When that nothing is

4124
03:20:07,935 --> 03:20:08,447
Is going to happen to me

4125
03:20:09,727 --> 03:20:10,495
I know all the real show

4126
03:20:15,615 --> 03:20:16,127
And just

4127
03:20:16,383 --> 03:20:17,151
F****** people up

4128
03:20:17,919 --> 03:20:18,687
And maybe that's how

4129
03:20:19,455 --> 03:20:20,223
I don't know

4130
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:21,503
But we'll see what happens

4131
03:20:22,783 --> 03:20:23,807
Will we see what happen

4132
03:20:24,319 --> 03:20:29,951
Who knows where we live long enough to see what happened we will live long enough to be a North mom

4133
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:33,535
This Saturday September 9th

4134
03:20:33,791 --> 03:20:35,839

That you're going to come to a three and a half hour podcast
