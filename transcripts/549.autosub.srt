00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,079
About this breaking news

125
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,663
So the well-produced version of it isn't going to come out for like 45 minutes or so

126
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
And Alex is going to have to come in and I'll do it on some

127
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
I'm struggling here

128
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
If I understand correctly

129
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
Alex is going to give us a thing

130
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
That he already knew

131
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
In the past

132
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
Yeah but yeah

133
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047

134
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:34,143

Airnow exactly

138
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
So important

139
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:50,015
You cannot possibly wait one more hour we have to get into live programming

140
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,951
This is Infowars goddamnit we can't wait another 45 minutes for this

141
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
Feel like if it was as important as you think she could have kept it tight

142
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,167
They get a special report together

143
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
Also great Victory Rush has been dead for

144
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,287
For two months and Alex is already spilling his aesthetic

145
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,847
I think it's a good idea

146
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,199
Feel it up I do like that clearly wasn't Alex's choice though cuz he

147
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:24,575
He calls it out

148
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,183
Oggy cartoon ruined Volusia that they weren't stealing there is a secret hero on the

Swear the more music we here at the right time the more I'm like somebody is watch

150
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
No he rainbow too long and that special report that he tried to shoot but we don't really know what this means is that so important

151
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,263
So let's say let's see if he

152
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
Get to do it once we go

153
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
A lot of this

154
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639

Force.com

163
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,551
Okay so I guess the news so far is that Sam Montoya is a really good guy

164
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,903
And the Galaxy starting to innovate noise you can make it show impressively unprofessional

165
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,951
Kind of incredible it really is

166
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
It really is so far we have spent

167
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,815
It's far more time talking about his daughters than we have

168
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,095
The breaking news that he had to

169
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,631

00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
This is

172
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:49,823

173
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103

188
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
The story that Alex is trying not

189
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,711
The cover is that Sam his cameraman got arrested and charged for his actions on January 6th

190
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
The capital Shore

191
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,295
Alex doesn't want to just say that so instead

192
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,367
Here he is just reiterating it's a good guy

193
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,743
He's trying to come up with every possible dogs you can think of an order to not deal with the reality here

194
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
That clip was less than a minute and hear a list of

195
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:20,959
The qualifiers that Alex is trying to bake into the story before even telling the audience give me a list

196
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:26,335
Sam is a good guy

197
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:32,735
The capital on his own never seen him before in my life

198
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
Force

199
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,831
The capital of Dominica cording to what Alex

200
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Claim the same told him

201
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
Frankly I'm pretty sure he's a ghost

202
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,951
5 Sam was the first to get

203
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
Footage of Ashley Babbitt being shot

204
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,047
I don't think this is true

205
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:52,191
And if you watch Sam's livestream from that day you'll see him trying to negotiate with John Sullivan AKA Jaden Acts

206
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,239
Who captured footage of the shooting

207
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,263
Get the footage

208
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
For some reason it's nefarious that we don't know the name of the officer who shot but we do know the name of the officer who shot

209
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Minnesota

210
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:12,671
I have no idea what that has to do with anything that has nothing to do with anything but it's always a good idea to Django the keys of races

211
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,999
Is it my way from the very real problems

212
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
Dealing with ya

213
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:22,143
His primary motivation in telling me stories to make sure the audience knows that's a good guy

214
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
Wasn't wrong to do it

215
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Fairly certain

216
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Even told the audience that Sam got arrested

217
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:37,759
We already have multiple claims that Alex had nothing to do with this s***

218
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
This whole thing is a simulation I put the world on trial

219
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
This is f****** shadowgate

220
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,023
Greg I've never heard of anything no idea what

221
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,071
Please talk about good guy

222
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,399
Speaking of shadowgate I realize that the Matt gaetz thing

223
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
It could be the Gator game

224
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
It sure does I don't lie

225
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:05,663
Like that I think we're in a situation similar to that I imagine it took Joel Greenberg exactly

226
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
5 Seconds

227
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
To give up Matt gaetz

228
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,575
I think I think it might have been even less than that the FBI went to his door and he was like

229
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,879
Y'all want Matt gaetz

230
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,439
I'll give them to you Sam Portnoy is not

231
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,719
Protecting Alec

232
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,743
Likes in this circle

233
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
Mia and me and a friend had this joke

234
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,351
That we would always tell each other like we would

235
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,911
Smoke together weird

236
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,447
Bouncinbooty sitting around passing

237
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,495
Back and forth and having fun

238
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,311
Always do is like

239
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:37,407
Tell each other about how we were going to rat each other house

240
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:43,551
Republican

241
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
Absolutely

242
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Artifact over each other

243
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
That's that's how I feel like

244
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:57,887
Matt gaetz nobody never even

245
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
Finally get to the park here at this episode

246
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:06,335
Special breaking news where we find out that you got a ride

247
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
Sam is a wreck

248
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Long story short

249
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
Late for that

250
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,319
I got a call.

251
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
FBI was 30 people that raised his apartment

252
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,415
Pier in Austin

253
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,559
Employees

254
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,095
Rob

255
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,399
Cool

256
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Rap beat

257
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,847
Samogon in

258
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,343
But he's okay

259
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Not only was Sam arrested

260
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
30 f

261
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,631
Bi agents came to get him another before staff have been harassed

262
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
Max's totally free

263
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,031
I've been trying but I can't find any proof that the arrest went down the way that Alex

264
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
Has claimed

265
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
He's shown a picture of

266
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:14,431
That is a hole punched in it but I don't know if that was from police ramming it or a random person

267
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
I'm kicking it I have no idea

268
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
Iceberg Jaden X or John Sullivan

269
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
That's what I was going to be out

270
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
His main defense

271
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,647
Sunday longer special report that he rambled too long.

272
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:28,767
How much is the side of the John Sullivan led the attack on the capital with

273
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
News by CNN scot-free

274
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
That's definitely

275
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
Sullivan has been released with conditions

276
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
But he's definitely still facing

277
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
It's a very serious charges

278
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Is and they have not been

279
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Been dropped

280
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
The brain is just

281
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Yeah I know that's

282
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:46,687
It's yet

283
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
System you can you can get out while awaiting trial

284
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,295
CNN did not pay Sullivant

285
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
To be applicable

286
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,719
How it goes on to repeat the figure $70,000 is the amount that Sullivan was paid but this is just a misrepresentation of the facts

287
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
CNN and NBC

288
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:04,607
Both bought his footage from inside the capitol each for $35,000

289
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,935
There wasn't a pre-existing contractor agreement it was just

290
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
CNN and NBC acting

291
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,007
Exactly the way

292
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,055
Did Alex's Caravans Sam did

293
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
When he tried to get

294
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
The footage from cell phone

295
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Sullivan inside the capitol

296
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,943
So yet but I do I don't know

297
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
According to CNN's spokesperson

298
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,879
CNN was contacted by a reputable agent regarding an eyewitness video from the Capitol Hill riot

299
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,719
The company entered into a one-week agreement for use of 44 seconds of

300
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Picante

301
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Which is attributed to the witness on air

302
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,583
What his role in the event was later called in

303
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
The question the company informed

304
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Amstaff to seize all use of the video

305
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
Strategy is going to be the point of John Sullivan in pretended Sullivan instigated the riots that you paid by CNN.

306
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,663
Deuce out an idea isn't facing any consequences

307
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
Your poor Sam the cameraman is getting arrested just for being in the hood

308
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Reporter

309
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
It's all nonsense

310
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
But it's about the only angle you can

311
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,903
Can take your the Titans the feelings of aggrievement correctly

312
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,183
And you can profit off of

313
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Yeah

314
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,351
I mean I can't even really think of it because you don't want to turn Sam into a person

315
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,119
Accusation

316
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Too much

317
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:16,287
You know you don't want to turn in my out as long as people give him hold on

318
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:21,663
I mean like you do want to make him a victim if I could make it really all about your

319
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,063
And we are dealing with a world-class making about himself

320
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,927
I wonder if that's what you behold next episode

321
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,535
Anyway here's the last clip from Alex's

322
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,303
Breaking in

323
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Into the War Room

324
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,191
Coming up soon again

325
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,519
Where the country is all showing on WhatsApp

326
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
It's not a detailed report and we're not going to listen to it cuz

327
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,919
It's just longer but about the same

328
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,503
Stop yelling about dropping

329
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,039
So now let us jump

330
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
April 14th

331
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Cuz I wanted to see how Alex is coping with the situation sure one of his employees just got arrested what's the new story

332
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
Things that I think is really into

333
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,839
First thing is that

334
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,423
We've been aware that Alex had that cameraman who was

335
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
Inside

336
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
Like we do on the

337
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:23,615
It wasn't really much of a secret around it and they release the footage of him

338
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,431
Yelling infowars.com while he went into

339
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,991
Well that's because the FBI

340
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
Is just full of great investor

341
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
Well I actually kind of figured they probably were aware of this and it just didn't rise to the level of someone they would want to charge

342
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,535
Like that actually kind of surprising that there was a charge

343
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,375
I don't think he's going to get in any trouble I think you'll be probably released

344
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Maybe if life on the wrist

345
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Who knows

346
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,519
It is kind of surprising to me that they they did end up charging

347
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
But I'm not

348
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,055
Surprised

349
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,103
To hear that you know

350
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
That they're cooked

351
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,455
Anyway Alex

352
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,247
I just don't

353
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
I didn't know how

354
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Was going to land

355
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,367
Outside of those pretty sure he's going to make it by himself

356
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
You know John bowne

357
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Has been a long-time boring voicemail

358
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Special Report

359
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Yes he does

360
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,983
How to play those special reports generally in the first six minutes of the show go out on the raid

361
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:28,383
Your vegetables out of the way a lot of stations are their own soda station identification

362
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
Stuff at the top of the hour

363
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,735
This is kind of no man

364
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:37,087
Play some John bowne reports there with his dumb boring voice

365
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
But there is a

366
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
There's a guy who's been really Making Waves

367
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,951
Haha

368
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,231
You never heard of

369
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
He's another guy who's got these special reports

370
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,911
But he does another little video maker in Austin at the Infowars

371
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
And he I think he's making a run

372
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
The crown of the weird voice

373
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
Special Report

374
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Immediately following the death of Nikola Tesla

375
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:10,367
Engineer with the National Defense research Committee of the office of scientific research and development

376
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:16,767
Emily President Donald Trump's uncle was called

377
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Officially concluded

378
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:29,567
Speculative and did not include workable methods

379
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Tesla's papers disappeared but his work most definitely quietly continued

380
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,575
I hear that B driving music behind you

381
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
About how Tesla's work is that the underpinning for Jurassic technology

382
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Confirm hidden from

383
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,839
The public I didn't know what was going on but I was

384
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Excited

385
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:59,263
I always liked this is how the shows started this special report that is weird really more interested

386
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,871
Hidden Tesla than I am and whatever other b******* they're going to Sprouts

387
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
So Greg Reese

388
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:09,247
He wants to blow some Minds talking about some of this

389
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,647
Physics stuff in wireless energy serious stuff figured out

390
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:22,048
Steve Bruce diplomas spinning ball experiment from 1970s

391
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
Repeat two steel balls are repeatedly launched with equal force

392
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
The other is not the spinning ball consistently flies higher and Falls faster than the other

393
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,504
This is in direct violation of both Newton's Laws is relativity

394
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,112
Really

395
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,304
Major league baseball pitcher throw a curveball you know one of those things that's on TV during the summer

396
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,936
162 X is amazing

397
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,776
Plenty of explanations for why this phenomenon can be seen in different rates

398
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,384
Tissues that there's no difference

399
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,432
For these objects when you try to conduct these

400
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,712
Experiments in a vacuum

401
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
Do you know like if you didn't have other forces at play

402
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,880
Then they would travel to same speed whether they were spending or not but because

403
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,976
And nature in the world and other forces that come

404
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
To bear on the object

405
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Not stupid

406
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
The force the gris-gris is ignoring here is called the Meg

407
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
That's a fact

408
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,056
The reason why pictures can throw bending pictures or why tennis players I'd spin

409
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,664
The spinning object in the air exerts a force on the air that it's traveling through and in the process

410
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
A path of motion is effect

411
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,272
Is it a well-understood phenomenon

412
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Completely compatible with Nutella

413
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,624
I guess Gregory's didn't really look into this

414
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
This before deciding

415
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,952
Spinning balls or somehow they

416
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:59,328
Very hard to research the American baseball

417
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,728
Stores that you can find countless videos of people doing this like dropping

418
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
Things from really high heights

419
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,800
It's because it is really cool

420
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Be cool to look at

421
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,456
Anyway so this spinning for stuff that no one

422
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
Explain Tesla

423
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,088
Maybe but we don't know John Trump didn't look at

424
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:23,904
John Trump

425
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,928
Trump's uncle

426
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:30,560
He's involved in the cover-up to know that Bruce DePalma is interesting

427
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Nope

428
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,864
I also don't think that's

429
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
Apparently

430
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
The

431
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Creates this

432
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
Electrical force or whatever

433
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
We're going to use this

434
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Horse somehow

435
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Sure

436
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
To create UFO

437
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:53,600
These patents look very similar to what whistleblowers claim production for years

438
00:23:53,856 --> 00:24:00,000
Manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin Skunk Works the same UFO lightcraft whistle

439
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,864
The Blower's claim are being prepared to stay alien invasion

440
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
So we got a fake alien invasion

441
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,936
I'm coming

442
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,472
Proven

443
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
These

444
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:12,032
Spitting

445
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
Knuckleball Dam

446
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,712
It's a it was an interesting Special Report

447
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
I think that the music really does a lot of work

448
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:27,136
I think I think I think

449
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
Greg

450
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,184
To think our greatest science

451
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,512
They're going to use of split-finger fastball to develop

452
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
UFO

453
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
Yeah that's that's

454
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
So pretty fun also I would question

455
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,632
Turn what this has to

456
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,656
To do with the globalist

457
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
Plans

458
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,984
I don't know how a false flag alien invasion

459
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
15 with e

460
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,824
Larger schemes

461
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,408
Yeah we're supposed to be afraid of

462
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,528
Play BB and kill all of the people with kind of mixer by 11 for the UFO

463
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
That would just be like

464
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
Hey look we're going

465
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,648
I'll do the Superbowl weapon thing

466
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
But let's have a little fun

467
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,512
I mean you know what I will give it up to the devil

468
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
Innocent it does seem like

469
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:10,912
He's got a lot of plans up in the air at the same time and if he's juggling that many plans

470
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,728
That's a talent of itself

471
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:16,544
You know I think

472
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
Did stand-up you know sometimes you to have somebody who's like I'm going to start my own clothing line going

473
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,272
Start a video blog

474
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,880
What you got yourself a lot of plans

475
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,952
You're not going to do any of those maybe that's

476
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
Species of the Devils running into the old Volkswagen

477
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,632
You didn't even kill leave

478
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,424
You know what was the boy

479
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,448
Now

480
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Stupid

481
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
Also what

482
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
What do you think

483
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
You should be more afraid of

484
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,640
Extermination or world

485
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,200
Depends

486
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
Cuz I kind

487
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:01,088
Cervix cervix because I feel like in Alex's scheme now with the devil's Bland

488
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,904
World government is not a necessary step

489
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,696
Towards exterminations true

490
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,280
That is true so I don't know why the devil would

491
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,072
Need to push for that anymore

492
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,352
Well if you had okay

493
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Okay so it's the devil

494
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,424
Hanes world government

495
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,240
He's gotten through the loophole that God said

496
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,776
Keeps him from limiting

497
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,360
Human free will maybe

498
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,432
I don't know

499
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
And he just

500
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
Gets to exterminate people

501
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,112
I don't know man this is what happens on Gregory

502
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,208
Starts the show problem with with both I guess

503
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,000
UFOs Anza Bible

504
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
Comes in

505
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:44,352
Breaks things off with like

506
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,888
Some real serious

507
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Head lice

508
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,984
Let me tell you what we got for you

509
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,544
Everyone is starting to

510
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Call out South use a fraud

511
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,360
Mainstream news

512
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Worcester now confirming is where

513
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Covid-19

514
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Absolutely huge

515
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:14,304
Version 2 and version 3

516
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Super deadly version

517
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,376
It was just a drill

518
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,192
So Alex is just talkin about a washing

519
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
10 times headline that doesn't prove

520
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
The clams that are in the head

521
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,824
Speculated about Medline

522
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,664
Yeah that's all that is I was pretty disappointed he doesn't talk about it

523
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Waze later

524
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,784
The CIA Woodruff

525
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,552
Fused

526
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Confirm that it

527
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Wasn't

528
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,392
Creating a lab

529
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,464
So people have taken that as speculation

530
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Badger

531
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Probably

532
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:50,400
Intuit I guess it all along it's not

533
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Polluted as a

534
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,008
The possibility but we're not the most likely possibility

535
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,056
And there is not evidence

536
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
That it was

537
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Right that's the issue

538
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
There are a lot of issues

539
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,176
Anyway

540
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,200
And I do trust

541
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:11,392
I didn't know whether or not we were going to get into the same issue early

542
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,672
We're late I didn't know

543
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
I turns out

544
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,000
Dive Right In

545
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304

One of our

Coming up

548
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:29,568
The media is just an actor say oh my God we're so close to arresting Jones

549
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176

00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:39,296
We want Jones in jail he masterminded

552
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,624
Capital Tax

553
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,696
And now they're just

554
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Fixing

555
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
The intelligence to

556
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
Go in line with all of that

557
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,168
So I guess this is the first instance of him making it all about himself

558
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
Immediately

559
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
Today they got

560
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:02,592
Sam which is actually about me as always

561
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:09,504
I would be happy about this virus a.m.

562
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Insult

563
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
So Alex gets to talking about his charge

564
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,880
TS2 with charger

565
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,416
Any might be a little bit off

566
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
Infowars reporter Sam

567
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,744
Arrested for

568
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
January 6th

569
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Chapel riot

570
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,264
Making Wild utterances

571
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,592
Wasn't charged with making loud other ince's

572
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,896
The charging documents Republic in East Mesa

573
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,664
5 charges

574
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
1

575
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,480
Entering and remaining in a restrict

576
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:44,832
The building sounds like it did that to disorderly or disruptive conduct in to restrict

577
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
The building almost there

578
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,696
Three violent entry and disorderly conduct in a capitol building

579
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,464
4

580
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,304
Competing Passage through the capitol grounds or Capitol building

581
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
Bia map of mob in front of the door

582
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
5 / 8

583
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,424
Menstrating are picketing in a capital bill

584
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
I could be wrong but I don't think it's a going to get in any real trouble about this unless there's some kind of information that the state has

585
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:11,200
But I'm not privy to like where he was in Greater coordination with people than we know

586
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
I don't know

587
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
Unless that's the case I would guess he's going to get a slap on the wrist and maybe not even that

588
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,928
What are the charges about disorderly conduct and violent entry is described like this

589
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
In the filing

590
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,464
Quote

591
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,352
To willfully and knowingly otter loud threatening and abusive language or engage a disorderly or disruptive conduct

592
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,632
At any place on the ground

593
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
Or in the Capitol building with the intent

594
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
Impede disrupt

595
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,752
Disturb the order the conduct of a session of Congress

596
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,776
Or either house

597
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Congress

598
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
Or the orderly conduct

599
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,616
In that building of

600
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Overhearing before already.

601
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,664
Deliberation

602
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
A committee of Congress

603
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
Or either house

604
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
You can't go in there and

605
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Scream go f***

606
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
F*** yourself

607
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,880
But framing that isn't getting charged for loud other inches is

608
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,952
Fun because it makes it seem like a government's trying to punish a

609
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,792
Super yelling go f*** you

610
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Yourself to Nancy Pelosi

611
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
That's not quite as the context

612
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:02,912
Text of it

613
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
Is making loud utterances

614
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Vickers 5 charger

615
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,848
The documents are right there

616
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
Stop playing games

617
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:15,712
But look man everybody's trying to jam Alex up

618
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
What is the part of it

619
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:21,088
They had all the major mainstream media Wall Street Journal New York

620
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,440
Most people in offer money lie about it

621
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,512
Cowboys

622
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,816
They have done Facebook scam searches

623
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
On any

624
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,192
People take selfies

625
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
Restaurant

626
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,544
These women will get a call

627
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
From The Wall Street Journal

628
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Betty wants to photo

629
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Okay will do

630
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
So

631
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Thousands of

632
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,232
Call by The Savage

633
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,280
Criminal operators of just

634
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,072
The actual left

635
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,120
Intelligence agency crime Lord

636
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,472
They control the FBI and order the FBI

637
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,264
TuneIn going reverse engineering

638
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,104
So these media entities the mainstream media are essentially leftist

639
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,872
Crime Lord

640
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,272
They run the FBI right here comes up with his stuff and then

641
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,600
They reverse-engineer investigation through the FBI

642
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,136
I2i Jam someone up

643
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
I think I think the Alex

644
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
Is used to people he knows

645
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,024
Like Jacob Wohl

646
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:37,120
And James O'Keefe operating like this with attorneys

647
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Traps

648
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
And that's the news that we're doing even though we are the ones doing it and they are

649
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:48,128
Because those people that are in his fear do this stuff

650
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Did he think

651
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
Did everybody does

652
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,528
And I think that he thinks that's how media and news operate

653
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,832
Which is

654
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,880
One of the big things that we can

655
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,416
Can see is a problem with

656
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
Jacob Glanville

657
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
The elk

658
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
There

659
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Because that

660
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
Undermines confidence in any and all media Outlet

661
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
If you are

662
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:11,424
So brazenly corrupt about it

663
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Yeah and and if

664
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,240
People have it in their mind to it

665
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,008
Equate the two

666
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,312
The

667
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,080
The people on

668
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
Are in anyway and elegance to the media journalism is lying

669
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:31,136
Your way into buildings to surreptitiously record people and then edit together

670
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:31,904
Misleadingly

671
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
That's what people believe

672
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
That's great

673
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:36,768
That's good

674
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
That's good for the 4th

675
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Thestatebank

676
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:42,400
An article about Matt gaetz the Gator game

677
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,704
And

678
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,544
Well Alex actually read this article

679
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
Attended

680
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,688
Party for drugs

681
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:58,784
Maybe some huge party in Miami or a big hotel suite party

682
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,392
And the women went to the media to say he was really nice and he didn't give us money

683
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,464
And we didn't even see him using drugs woman said I song Take a

684
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Who won

685
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,048
But he was really nice and the women were all 2530

686
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
The end of the article

687
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
Another woman's I'm getting offered money to say

688
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,544
He's a smart guy

689
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,616
He's admitted he's a party animal Hailey's for drug legalization

690
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:35,648
That is the doesn't need to go down like this

691
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:42,048
It's unnecessary you involving yourself in the story will be like that's fine there's no way out

692
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:47,424
Places involved with his math game story if you wouldn't keep involving yourself of the booze

693
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,240
I'm an alcoholic

694
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
So the actual headliner this again

695
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:59,712
Story is in payments after late-night parties with Gates another

696
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:06,112
Does seem like a different headline than the one that I like really really different

697
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,464
These parties of gates behaving

698
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
Like a frat type of party boy

699
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,584
Sometimes taking pills she believe we're recreational drug

700
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,656
Bills

701
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
Ever believed to be recreational drugs whatever

702
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:26,080
Alright the article mentions these women being paid by Joel Greenberg but not directly ever by Gates

703
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,104
And they quote

704
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,664
Never saw anyone at the party who appeared

705
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
The underage

706
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,016
Additionally the women disputed the characterizations of what they were aware of

707
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
Happening as being

708
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
Sex trafficking

709
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
Could just need sex work

710
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,696
Yeah I don't know why I like I said Alec

711
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Even like

712
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:43,744
Just

713
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
Touch the story get into at all without like

714
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
Some some personal things about himself

715
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Very weird

716
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
Yeah it is it is

717
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Feeling a little

718
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
A little like

719
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,824
Oh no my son is in trouble I I kind of I gotta protect

720
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
To this poor idiot

721
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
It's very weird

722
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,664
Yeah I wouldn't

723
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
Do that no

724
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
I would do anything else

725
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,576
But get involved and then tell everyone I'm an alcoholic on it

726
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,904
Speaking of things you would or would not do

727
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
Sure if you were Alex's lawyer

728
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
Did you tell him to say publicly about the whole Sam issue I would tell him prob

729
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
Probably to say something along the lines of

730
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:28,800
We don't believe these charges are accurate and we are fighting against these my lawyer has advised me to say nothing

731
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:29,568
Beyond that

732
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,176
If you were Alex's lawyer and you advised him not to say anything

733
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
You probably wouldn't want to hear this

734
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,624
My lawyers I would not talk about this

735
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
Closest

736
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm not going to sit there

737
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
I'm going to put out a million-dollar bounty

738
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,424
Set the record straight

739
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,824
My lawyer told me alright alright here we go

740
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:08,736
Shoot that shoot that shotgun bulshit out us here comes Alex

741
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,064
Here's the story he's going to be sticking to it I'm trying to kind of freaking sister

742
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Fully

743
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Carnival atmosphere

744
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,304
I told Harrison Smith

745
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
NexTrip

746
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
We're all there

747
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,408
He's a good guy and said well I'm going to go with them

748
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,688
People

749
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
Pasta

750
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,344
Find out later he's in the capital that day I got the

751
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
So

752
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
Alex said Sam couldn't go

753
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
Alex says you are

754
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,016
Sam can't go to need to stay here and

755
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,880
Road to us while we're there I know it's going to be a carnival that you got to work

756
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,464
Yeah Sam says f*** that imma go talk to Mike Lindell

757
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
And apparently goes to the

758
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
The capital with Mike Lindell

759
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
Let my pillow peep

760
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
Okay

761
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,912
You are so then

762
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,008
Everybody that works for Infowars I assume is now an independent contractor

763
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:40,896
Completely unaware that Sam has gone with a My Pillow People

764
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,456
Finds out

765
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:47,808
Sam is in Washington DC when he finds out that he has footage

766
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:51,136
Correct of the woman being shot at the same time

767
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,232
Sam was along with Tyler Hanson at the

768
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Time

769
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
Who was burning a black lives

770
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Matter flag

771
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,168
Troyer the night before shared a hotel room with Owen you would think

772
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:03,936
Mitre

773
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Text messages

774
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
Or maybe

775
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:12,640
Sam was there when they burn the Black Butterfly or seems like it might have been hanging out

776
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,480
Yeah that's really cool bird in the black black lives matter flag

777
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,504
Kind of puts it out of

778
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,904
Carnival atmosphere it or into bloodthirsty mob atmosphere I don't believe for a f****** second that they were

779
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,976
Worthington awareness that he was there in DC it's it's ridiculous

780
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:32,864
Just now I don't know what it means that he went with the Pillow People

781
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
Mike Lindell that's who you like that

782
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:40,288
You should go see the My Pillow People they're the ones in Fort Worth

783
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
Mad that he didn't give me the footage

784
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,688
I wish you'd give me the footage but I'll tell her this moment when I

785
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,224
Definitely

786
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
B o a

787
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,016

6 * 7

789
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Alex

790
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112

00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,000
Bro

Gonzo

794
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Hey buddy

795
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,704
It's all good look up with the My Pillow People now it's all good man

796
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
Gemini Sam

797
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,568
Talk to you soon

798
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,552
We'll see

799
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
Here we are

800
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,856
Couple months three months later

801
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
DC what's the name

802
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
Unfolding

803
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
Soap

804
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
I really don't think

805
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
The people on the right

806
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
Really understand what unfolded on January 6th

807
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,216
And if they do they are lying about it

808
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,288
Well I think one of the problems is that you know

809
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,336
The ripples of the

810
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,104
Fake s***

811
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,920
That they came up with to make excuses about it

812
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:52,736
It's taking a while to catch up with the reality of

813
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
You know Reality Tea

814
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
Keeping on exist

815
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
Yeah it keeps going

816
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Whether you like it

817
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Alex heard

818
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Sam got arrested

819
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,488
And even though

820
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
He told him he was going to be in trouble on the 7th

821
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
Right Alex then

822
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Last night

823
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
In 2021 last night

824
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
He interrogated people

825
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,104
Heading forward Studios what was Sam up to the f*** out

826
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,152
Interrogation

827
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:22,688
People here last night

828
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Messages

829
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
Sherlock

830
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Well he told me was going with my pillow

831
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Akwaboah

832
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Okay

833
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,144
Usually when facing legal troubles

834
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,544
I really want to check the messages and make sure I'm telling the truth

835
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,407
I've literally no control over anything

836
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,943
Nobody knows what I'm doing

837
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
I don't know what everybody's doing

838
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:00,575
This is an anarchist outfit legally no one was

839
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:07,231
I have never met any of these people talk to Sam

840
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:08,511
On January 7th

841
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
Amman in April

842
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,095
He's interrogating people

843
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:17,471
And checking messages about something that he clearly knows what happened has no idea

844
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,287
Hey Stan I don't underestimate podcast

845
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,079
Navigate Sam's involvement

846
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,431
The piano app serialized

847
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,247
Yeah if it look dude

848
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
I mean

849
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
This story doesn't

850
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,343
No it does

851
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
But

852
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Who cares

853
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,279
Low-level

854
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,583
Family Guy been there three years

855
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
And sure enough

856
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
Went on his own volition when I don't say that

857
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
To lie Beyond even

858
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
What's wrong

859
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,599
It really sounds like Alex is trying to be like I didn't have anything to do with this s***

860
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,671
Story that Avon barksdale's lawyers tell

861
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:15,071
My client has never been anywhere near drugs he's never seen any of these people before I don't know

862
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,167
Businessman and a large character in

863
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:25,567
Community quite frankly Bode is second screen

864
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:31,967
I would tell you he was only a mid-level manager he didn't have much going on selling drugs on his own and even if he wasn't

865
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,671
But he wasn't any good to hear that

866
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,463
I would be real unhappy

867
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,327
Here I am in prison for Infowars and Alex

868
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,447
Yeah I think we're going to see a little bit of a shadow gate fall out of this was

869
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,543
Unfortunately Sam has been let go

870
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:00,639
If I were Alex I will be going out of my way to

871
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,479
Say everything positive about this guy

872
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:10,367
350 you know what Rodger Stone said about Trump when he got hurt

873
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
The nicest things anyone has ever said

874
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,231
Oh my God

875
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
He prayed for

876
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:24,447
Look at it the other way Trump said nice things about Rodger when Rodger got arrested

877
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,519
Anyway

878
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
What's with the lawyer from

879
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,591
The wire Wynn

880
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:36,223
So Sam got jammed up because one of his family members

881
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,503
Tipped off

882
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
The

883
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Enforcement

884
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,623
That's a family member

885
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,463
I guess they weren't watching Infowars

886
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,791
It's not something I would recommend

887
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,631
But Alex is all over the place talking about like

888
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
I was this close and I said you don't see a nice guy

889
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
I'm not going to I'm not going to

890
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,847
Even though

891
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,687
Family member we know who it is

892
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Family dinners because he's

893
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
Big Trump supporter

894
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:24,095
Videos

895
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Andre shop

896
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:36,127
This is all over the place man it's weird

897
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,967
Yeah a more important person somebody not on the second

898
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:46,367
Can string would be getting a nice little defense fun boost we're setting something up to help him instead Sam just gets a nice

899
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,207
Obviously we hope he's doing well

900
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,863
He will definitely be working here when he gets out of jail 100% I will not be firing a video

901
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:02,495
But again it's important to remember that what's

902
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,847
At stake here and what's real about this story is not

903
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
It doesn't even involve

904
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
Alex

905
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Course

906
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,111
Capital

907
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
Presidential

908
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Media

909
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Pass

910
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,615
It's all a fraud in a hub obviously

911
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
For non-violent offenders

912
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Wow

913
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
It was a lot for them to have a

914
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,671
The goal of sherbet

915
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,487
Alex can't process this story accepted as it being

916
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
Part of an elaborate plan to get him

917
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,631
If I were Sam I would be a bit worried about how my arrest was being used as a prop

918
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
To justify Alex

919
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:04,959
Is completely out of control narcissist

920
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,007
I want to take this circlet piece by piece

921
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Okay

922
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:13,151
The first little piece here is that Alex is claiming that Sam just said America standing up

923
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
That is not true

924
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,735
Quotes from the charging dock

925
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,759
Okay

926
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,551
We've had enough we're not going to take you

927
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,831
Your f****** vaccines

928
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,647
We're not going to take all your b******* people are standing up

929
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,951
That sounds like something he might say

930
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,791
Here we are the US Capitol in Washington DC in the Capitol building

931
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,631
He's been officially it is officially been stormed by Trump supporters

932
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:36,959
Again the US Capitol building in Washington DC has officially been

933
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:41,567
Storm by Trump supporters and here we are taking are the people's house back

934
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,151
I wouldn't want that anywhere where people would have that on

935
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,455
Recording I especially wouldn't want

936
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:51,551
To say be recording myself while I was saying those things

937
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:58,207
It's not in the list of quotes in the charging document but my favorite quote from Sam's livestream was when he was walking in entering the

938
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Capitol building

939
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,279
Hey doesn't plug for Infowars store

940
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,911
It seems weird like maybe if he was there with my pillow he should have plugged them but ever heard

941
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,311
I didn't send him down there but it's also a one-way Street

942
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
Second string

943
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
That's brutal

944
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,063
Pieces that Alex is claiming that Sam had a press pass

945
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,855
That is also not true

946
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,647
Document

947
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
The directors

948
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,719
Congressional press galleries within the Senate press office

949
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,071
Cuz didn't name check on Samuel Christopher Montoya and confirm that no one by that name

950
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,167
Has Congressional press credentials as an individual or via any other organizations

951
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
I have no idea what Alex is trying

952
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
To claim but there's no way that Sam had a press pass to be where he was

953
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,919
That's complete bull s*** and there also wasn't any other like mainstream media

954
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Videos that have come out of in that there were played on other outlets or things

955
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
People purchase

956
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,159
From the folks were there legally inside

957
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
The middle of this

958
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Bloodthirsty mob

959
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
That hate

960
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
The media

961
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,119
I have one of those hats with a little card in it

962
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:13,727
Real Outlets it really feels like Alex

963
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,775
Is heightening this to a point of absurdity

964
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:22,431
This is my area of interest in what I cover and honestly I don't think I care nearly as much about the arrest as I do about Al

965
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,199
Alex's respond

966
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
It's complete

967
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
Someplace sensationalization

968
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,623
Where Alex is trying to walk this interesting line where he has nothing to do with actions

969
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,183
Consequences that are coming to say Marcy

970
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
Secretly an attack

971
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
On him

972
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,279
This is how a narcissistic mind would interpret

973
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,303
Something like this

974
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
A Galaxy's blameless

975
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,399
And all negative consequences are secretly applaud again

976
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,959
And if I was a

977
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
I realized

978
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,495
This is a plot

979
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,775
And I am being you

980
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
I would immediately go Oh he's a vicious narcissist Ono

981
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,759
I think that he was anything but that who would help me out in my hour of need

982
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
No but I mean look

983
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
It's all about getting out

984
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:07,487
How much calcium show there are now hundreds of news articles proliferating like mushrooms

985
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,823
USS Pearl Harbor

986
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Pearl Harbor

987
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,223
Again Alex is making this all about him

988
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:28,991
Self

989
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:32,063
I failed to find any mainstream media articles that fit the

990
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,599
Nobody's talking about it again

991
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
If he actually means random tweet

992
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,975
When he says media articles then there's nothing I can really do about that

993
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,511
It's just the delusions of a liar

994
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
Also about that Pearl Harbor

995
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,399
This is just Alex misrepresenting comments made by Chuck Schumer after

996
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Storming

997
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,263
It's very very difficult to put into words what has transpired today

998
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,311
I've never lived through or even imagine

999
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,847
An experience like the one we've

1000
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Just witnessed in this capital

1001
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:01,247
President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7th 1941 is a day that will live in infamy

1002
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,807
Unfortunately we can now add January 6th

1003
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
2021

1004
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
To that very short list of dates in American history

1005
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,671
They will live forever in a

1006
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:13,023
Alex is taking this and twisted it into Schumer saying that the storming of the capital was worse than

1007
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Temporal

1008
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
But he said no such

1009
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,655
Interesting Lee there was a recent comment about Pearl Harbor

1010
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,935
That you might find interesting

1011
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Quote

1012
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,335
We went through the worst attack we've ever had in our country this is the worst attack we've ever had

1013
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
This is worst

1014
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
Then Pearl Harbor is worse than the World Trade Center

1015
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
There's never been an attack

1016
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
Like this

1017
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,271
I'm going to go with

1018
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,111
Paul Ryan about something 10 years ago

1019
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,207
No it was Trump talking about covid-19 in May of last year

1020
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:48,607
I'd like Alex's comments on that I'd like to see what he thinks about Trump saying the covid-19 is worse than Pearl Harbor at 9:11

1021
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,887
You know you don't need to worry about

1022
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
The things that Trump says

1023
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,935
About the Bible

1024
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,959
To give right right right

1025
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
How does this

1026
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
This vibe

1027
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Right

1028
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
Sure Sam

1029
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,455
I'm so so Alex

1030
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,247
Has nothing to do with this

1031
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:09,599
However Sam was there the night before with Owen

1032
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,951
Well I don't know I got actually I'm not a hundred percent sure Sam was there the night

1033
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767
When was in the capital

1034
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:23,167
Tyler Hansen was there as well that the singer was with other was sharing a hotel room

1035
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,983
Black lives matter flag

1036
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,031
It seems like there is a very

1037
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,823
Clear associate

1038
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
Chain

1039
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
Sorry about Sarah

1040
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,319
Announce that this Vibe it's like it's unfair

1041
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,647
Like other people protest at the Capitol and they don't get arrested

1042
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,231
I don't need to say that I didn't send standing there

1043
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:54,655
And I needed that cabin all hearings

1044
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,703
Congress people on the elevators

1045
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,519
Walk the elevators at all that stuff

1046
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,055
And nothing happened to those p

1047
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,807
They don't all deserve to then be indicted

1048
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,599
When the police officers wave

1049
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,719
What's the second time Alex has gotten his name wrong

1050
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Motel

1051
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:25,119
The guy who is a good guy

1052
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,423
Play If I was a sandwich

1053
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Racking my brain

1054
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:35,871
10% that the unrelated to any crime

1055
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,711
Fox one time it was Alex

1056
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,575
As for the Kavanaugh protesters it feels like no one got arrested there to Alex

1057
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Because he doesn't care

1058
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,671
Right

1059
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,279
In reality you can find articles about Mass arrests took place around the Kavanaugh hearings

1060
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,839
CNN article on October 5th

1061
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,655
2018 about 293 people being arrested

1062
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,215
Police for unlawful demonstration

1063
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,519
Motherjones article list the arrests

1064
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,079
So at cavanal protest and if you add them all up

1065
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:09,151
Not including the group one from that CNN article you end up with

1066
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
662 arrests

1067
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
The Kavanaugh protest

1068
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
That's a ton

1069
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,575
And the main difference between then and now is that he's a

1070
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,855
The Kavanaugh protesters

1071
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,391
Didn't try to take over the fuc

1072
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:21,695
In capital how many people did they kill

1073
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:26,815
Alex pretends that don't got arrested protesting Kavanaugh because if he acknowledged

1074
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,119
They did he'd either have to argue that they shouldn't

1075
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,167
Have and then be defending evil left

1076
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,007
Or he'd have to accept that there were consequences for people's action

1077
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,103
Concurrently Sam is experiencing what a lot of others before him have

1078
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,759
It was a risk that he either knowingly or unknowingly accepted when he decided to film himself going into the capitol with a bunch of lunatic

1079
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:50,367
And recognizing that Dynamic is a big threat to Alex's entire pitch about how they're all victim

1080
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Yeah the right has

1081
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:52,671
No idea

1082
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
What it means

1083
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,719
To actually protest

1084
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
No like they just

1085
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
They just don't

1086
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:03,679
Get that don't like the idea about accepting consequences that you put yourself

1087
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:05,727
Shelf in these situations

1088
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Yeah

1089
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,055
Accepting that something will happen to you

1090
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,591
In order to

1091
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,663
Stand beside Acosta people

1092
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
The cause was

1093
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,223
Is important enough

1094
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
That you risk

1095
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,295
Whatever consequences May Come

1096
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,855
80 legal to occupy

1097
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
This space and sit

1098
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
In the capital

1099
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:26,975
And

1100
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,999
You do that

1101
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
Knowing that the consequence

1102
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:33,119
Could be that you get arrested because he will bring attention to whatever

1103
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,143
Cause

1104
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
You are there protests

1105
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,239
Whatever they

1106
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
F****** want yeah

1107
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,335
Yeah it's so bizarre for people who are

1108
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
I just

1109
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
So if

1110
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
Interested in personal responsibility

1111
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Do not understand

1112
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
This dynamic

1113
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,271
Oh well it's not

1114
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,087
Bizarre people who are really interested in personal response

1115
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,391
Possibility are usually really interested in

1116
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
Other

1117
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Yeah baby

1118
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:00,255
So I might down for this because it was

1119
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
So weird

1120
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,119
But another defensive Sam is that he's got a lot of hats

1121
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,143
Is wearing hats

1122
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,959
He was wearing a Maga hat when he was there literally

1123
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:13,055
Because also wearing a journalist hat and also just like hey I'm cool guy

1124
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
He got really really dramatic footage

1125
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,807
Because he was operating as a journalist there and try to stay well

1126
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,855
He's not a journalist when he's

1127
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,927
Everybody can wear

1128
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:33,791
To be out playing golf

1129
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:37,631
You can be a Star Wars premiere

1130
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,823
I'm guessing that Alex is referencing Gary Player

1131
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:52,223
But man that the weird pool for him to make as an example of somebody wearing two hats

1132
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:56,831
80s come on man just

1133
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
Hellboy

1134
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:02,975
I think it was on Alex's mind because Trump gave Gary Player

1135
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,535
Medal of freedom Road ever

1136
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:09,631
Victorville

1137
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,911
There's a slight difference

1138
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:14,495
Between a golfer giving a unpopular opinion

1139
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,591
Or you making some kind of a political comment when you're on a red carpet

1140
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,383
I think the writer little different

1141
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,711
In the middle of inactive

1142
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
Participant

1143
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
In the storming of

1144
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
Have the capital but you're a journalist because you have a camera

1145
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:33,695
Yeah they like to pretend that it wasn't a massive bloodthirsty attempt to take over the entire country hope

1146
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,487
Hopefully triggering Trump to in

1147
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,559
Institute martial law so you have everything under your

1148
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,095
Control the circumcenter

1149
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:40,863
To deal with that

1150
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:47,519
What the circumstances are a little bit weird to me because it's not analogous to someone had like a movie premiere saying something political

1151
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
The reason that I

1152
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,847
Could be really funny

1153
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
Is there still gold was let's say

1154
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
Storming the capitol

1155
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,271
They were wearing like Godzilla vs. Kong merch

1156
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:02,623
They argued they were just do it for motion

1157
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:07,231
Have a marketing major also I am attempting over there

1158
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:13,631
I think I remember that whenever they stormed the Bastille came out with

1159
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Copies of his book at

1160
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,191
He's like just while I'm here

1161
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,727
Where is there going

1162
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,287
Bmore Free Press attention than it is storming

1163
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,591
You want to get the word out about your movie

1164
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
That's the place

1165
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:28,223
Says it has anybody ever said no press is bad press my friend cuz that's the truth

1166
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,551
I don't think it is argument holds up

1167
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,831
In my mind

1168
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,623
That he's wearing two hats

1169
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
Legitimate advertising strategy

1170
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,535
F****** Disney is like okay here's what we do

1171
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,839
We're going to storm the United States capitol

1172
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,935
And then after we've done all this damage we're going to remove our shirts all at once

1173
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,055
And it's going to be the next Pocahontas movie everyone's going to blame soybomb

1174
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,663
So I got this real sense

1175
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,455
It's kind of a normal son

1176
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Answer get in situations like

1177
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Obviously making this all about himself

1178
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Duct

1179
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
But

1180
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Hello

1181
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,927
Talk anymore I Really Got A Feeling

1182
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,743
Kind of felt like he is mad

1183
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,511
It's not him

1184
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,119
It seems like he wishes it was him who got arrested

1185
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,471
Disrupting would be blocking him blocking the door

1186
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
Shutting down the hearing

1187
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,335
Quickly eyes talking about when he went to Congress and yelled

1188
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
Did Sundar pichai

1189
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,407
I don't believe you should do that

1190
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,527
Angry also because

1191
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,855
R45

1192
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Angry hours

1193
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
And they said my name at least 67 time

1194
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Congress people

1195
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:44,511
Bring me up the back row

1196
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,815
When Rodger Stone going there's the Russian

1197
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
There's a spice right there

1198
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,655
Fire trash

1199
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,775
You know it you're the globalist butcher in this country

1200
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,383
I did

1201
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,151
Was

1202
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,199
Ten times more aggressive than Sam

1203
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,783
I deserve to be indicted

1204
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Or what happen

1205
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,903
Fraud

1206
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,951
Stall application of it's a fraud

1207
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:20,351
It's garbage but please arrest me please I want to be a martyr it would get me so much of

1208
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:23,423
Secondary attention is not good enough

1209
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,983
What is this what is this just a second

1210
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:32,383
Considering cameraman that's getting the rest of my name into a martyr that lead to movement worse

1211
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:39,295
Confidently knowing he won't be arrested or inconvenienced in any way

1212
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:43,391
So we get now to that Washington Post

1213
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
Washington Times

1214
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:50,559
Headline but Alex was talking about earlier in the episode

1215
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,143
Is dr. fauci the father of the pandemic

1216
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,191
Credible Washington Times article

1217
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,471
Just yesterday

1218
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,895
They had hundreds of groups funding it but

1219
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,455
His program was Obama continuing under

1220
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
2 years before

1221
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:12,063
Covid-19

1222
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:17,951
Intuit

1223
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
That's the fact

1224
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
Those are the facts

1225
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,863
Exitos

1226
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,191
I think that makes Trump look worse

1227
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:32,543
Incredibly stupid if any of that were true which it's not

1228
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
That would make Trump like

1229
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
A willing

1230
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
Participant

1231
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:41,247
Biowarfare guess cuz it's not him just letting the program

1232
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:46,367
Continue it's him being like I got off this program and then a couple years later than being like

1233
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:51,743
Come on let's kill everybody

1234
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,791
Real bad yeah yeah

1235
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,863
So we know from looking at past episodes of Alex

1236
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
The show that

1237
01:01:57,887 --> 01:02:00,191
When I first learned about Anthony fauci

1238
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
Towards the beginning of the

1239
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:07,871
Man among men

1240
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,711
He's going to test personally the fight

1241
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:16,319
Cuz he was Alex thought she was saying stuff that work for his

1242
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
Conspiracies

1243
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
On the bus

1244
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,207
Also we know from listening to pass

1245
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Episodes

1246
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,511
Steve pieczenik

1247
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
Used to think

1248
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:28,863
She was one of the best in the business true

1249
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,495
Cuz they went together now

1250
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,519
That is true

1251
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,127
Right turns out we have a new villain bags

1252
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Story

1253
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
Copies in shark

1254
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,759
He's been involved by a weapon attack

1255
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,439
Kelsey is the guy that runs the operational program

1256
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
For 40 years at least

1257
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,119
A week before I'm uh

1258
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,215
Dirty mouth

1259
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,287
Get out of the un's dirty mouth the whl's murderer

1260
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,615
He's the one

1261
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
Okay

1262
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
Look at us

1263
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,855
So dumb

1264
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
Can we date

1265
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,463
So fat she's been running bio-weapon attacks for like

1266
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,255
40 years

1267
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:34,143
Steve pieczenik the great Insider who knows everything and is overthrown country right equally

1268
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,447
The Forrest Gump of world history

1269
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,775
Thought he was a great guy until like

1270
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,127
Just now I know I would say that's a genic. He was a great guy

1271
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
Until he was the

1272
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,687
First person to be

1273
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Kid with covid

1274
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,247
He cured himself

1275
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,807
So once he got infected easy realize

1276
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Fauci

1277
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,671
Had been lying to him the whole time he even since he was young I don't buy it

1278
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,719
He was actually recruited into this program

1279
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,511
Woody was 0 years old he was

1280
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
Is grown in a lab dance

1281
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,327
Since he was

1282
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,119
0 and a half years old

1283
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,911
He was also exactly five foot eight

1284
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
I think I proved it

1285
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
That sounds right

1286
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:16,127
Yeah I feel like the more and more you try to

1287
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:19,199
Parody what Alex is talking about

1288
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,223
Yeah it's a

1289
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:24,319
It's not far off enough to actually really funny

1290
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,879
Far I can go

1291
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,671
Comic book territory

1292
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
So Alex

1293
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:35,839
Complaining about this article really dealing with it at all but the headlines fun for a picture

1294
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
Another Hadley

1295
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,311
I continued dog from that

1296
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,711
And does it continue on from the continuation perhaps ride contacts for this headline

1297
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,015
Is the first line of a meme post

1298
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,599
It's been going around on message boards and Facebook since at least early December

1299
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,671
He was initially attributed to an anonymous doctor but sent

1300
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,231
Has been claimed to have been written by dr. Rob Oswald

1301
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:07,583
A virologist an immunologist at Cornell University's Department of molecular medicine

1302
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,679
Cornell is out of its mind

1303
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,447
How about dinner

1304
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,519
Right that he doesn't agree with the sentiment

1305
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,823
More easily when you pretend to someone effects for

1306
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,615
Forties in a particular feel the same something

1307
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,943
As opposed to some random idiot on the internet

1308
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,527
Tristan said that this is what Alex is covering it is stack of news

1309
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:31,647
This is something that passed the test which should be printed off and covered on this program which is just

1310
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:36,511
Pathetic. Oh my God it's not even

1311
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,791
It's not even new

1312
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,583
New memes are just old

1313
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,631
Memes waiting to be reused

1314
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,399
Straight

1315
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,543
Something else was getting reused as Norm talking Patty really

1316
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
Nor Pac-Man

1317
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,407
Lawyer extraordinaire guy who had to sit

1318
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,223
Silently and awkwardly while Alex put a bounty out on

1319
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,503
Is a Sandy Hook

1320
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:02,623
Enemies there's got to be it. I think at this point Pat has has to be in it for the stories

1321
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
You know like

1322
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,183
20 years from now he

1323
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
Sitting at a bar

1324
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:06,975
Just been like

1325
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,255
I could tell you Tales

1326
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,839
And I suspect that maybe he's flown too close to the Sun

1327
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:12,607
With Alex

1328
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,167
Might realize

1329
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,215
It might be starting to realize like a

1330
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,127
Thing that he's trying to write like you know how some some strippers

1331
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:28,735
Or sex workers of the like they like I do this and then the read a book and they go on Oprah

1332
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,807
Ignore bad is going to do it I don't know cuz the

1333
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,855
Boars that I hear norms

1334
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:37,951
The more I feel like he's being more willing to say Infowars

1335
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:44,351
He stopped before it seemed like he had a little bit of restraint

1336
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:48,191
National he seems like a real f****** s***

1337
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,007
Introduces him

1338
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Also gets

1339
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,823
Sam's name wrong

1340
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Again

1341
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
I wanted to get Norm

1342
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
Criminal lawyer and constitutional lawyer

1343
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:01,247
And also does work for us

1344
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,271
On the 1st Amendment

1345
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
Issue

1346
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:06,111
He doesn't know all the facts

1347
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,183
Limited

1348
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Songs about

1349
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,743
With our Infowars

1350
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Wow

1351
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Sam

1352
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,399
You got to listen to

1353
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,167
Broadcast

1354
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:26,591
I'm just going to change things for you this broadcast put you on a path to a better life trying to do you dirty

1355
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:30,431
Funny things about Norms appearance here on the show is that

1356
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,711
You get a real sense

1357
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,503
But he's kind of trying to reassure Alex

1358
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
What's that like

1359
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,063
Your clean your good man

1360
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,367
What I know and mr. montoya's k

1361
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Cases that he was arrest

1362
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
Induct on the capital that day

1363
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:42,975
I understand.

1364
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:46,047
Federal authorities may or may not be aware of that

1365
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:47,839
Mayor may not have

1366
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
From all the cons

1367
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
What he was doing that day

1368
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
Question that will have

1369
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
To be sorted out in a court of law

1370
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,335
You obviously my pore

1371
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,615
Primary concern is you

1372
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,919
I do not believe there are facts

1373
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Excitation

1374
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,479
Tom 2 warranty

1375
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Further

1376
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,319
Nation of you or and much less than an arrest

1377
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,343
I'm a p

1378
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
When the time comes

1379
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,415
Ithaca

1380
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:16,767
I don't know it's from everything I can see publicly-available

1381
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
Probably right

1382
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
He was

1383
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,167
Promoting Infowars while he was live streaming going in

1384
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
To the Capitol

1385
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,471
Who's

1386
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:30,335
To say if Alex asked him to do that door he's even aware that he was doing that

1387
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Tubi

1388
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
But it is interesting

1389
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,247
He's going to have to go to court

1390
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
You're cool

1391
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,551
Hey buddy

1392
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,623
My primary concern is you

1393
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,647
He doesn't pay me

1394
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
You do

1395
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,999
And let me tell you something right now you keep saying what you're saying

1396
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
You never met the guy

1397
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,815
A good night

1398
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
Get to talkin

1399
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,447
About the shooting of Dante Ray

1400
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,727
Is Minneapolis

1401
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
Minnesota

1402
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:01,567
Yeah sure I want to get my lawyer buddy on

1403
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
To do that

1404
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:04,127
If it takes

1405
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Saturn

1406
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
For the

1407
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,831
Let's talk about this is just now breaking we know the name of the female police officer who said

1408
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
And then

1409
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
Keyshot until Dante write

1410
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,207
He's in the middle of rioting

1411
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:18,975
Easter

1412
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,279
For armed robbery

1413
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,583
The city's burning the police station shot up

1414
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,655
Employees filing she accidentally shooting

1415
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,471
In the fog of War that's what happens I'm not glad it happened

1416
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,775
But he's a frog waving guns around on the internet

1417
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,359
You know all this

1418
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Somebody

1419
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
Probably one person got killed

1420
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,735
Alex is making up almost all of the details

1421
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:46,623
He was pulled over for having expired tags

1422
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,439
Plates and having a hanging air freshener

1423
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
The boxes mirror

1424
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:56,095
You wasn't playing with the police though does appear that he's trying to get back into his car before he was shot

1425
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,423
There was a misdemeanor warrant for Wright's arrest

1426
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:03,775
The body was unrelated to an aggravated robbery charge you gotten in December 2019

1427
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,055
It had to do with missing

1428
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,639
The court date for a misdemeanor of carrying a pistol without a permit

1429
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,919
Something Alex should not think

1430
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:13,759
Conversation to have about the shooting

1431
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:18,879
It's literally impossible to deal with any of the real underlying issues if you're like Alex and you insist on creating a

1432
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,159
Completely fictional version

1433
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,695
Events to tell your audio

1434
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,279
It's important to understand that Alex does this all the time

1435
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,815
Real events become sticks

1436
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Chat with hesitation

1437
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,655
Tons of details and subplots that are real

1438
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:33,215
And it's critical to understand how he uses

1439
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,263
Fictional augmentation of real story

1440
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,567
Because it's one of the easiest ways to

1441
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
Duffy is biased

1442
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,943
When is the black man who's killed Astoria supplemented with all sorts of

1443
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,967
Extenuating

1444
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,247
Stances and details

1445
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,783
The make it's so sad

1446
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,319
But the guy kymatica

1447
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:52,671
We seen this play out over and over again recently with George Floyd and Ahmad Arbor

1448
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
The opposite is done when it's a white person who's killed

1449
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,047
Abby's also grotesquely in the case of

1450
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:58,815
Kate steinle

1451
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,935
In reality and immigrant found a gun wrapped in a rag that he didn't even realize with a gun

1452
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:05,983
He picked it up the gun discharged

1453
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,799
In a ricocheting bullet accidentally and tragically hip

1454
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,567
It's dynamite

1455
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:12,383
Alex's retelling of the story became Mateo where

1456
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,687
This immigrant sauce steinle with her dad

1457
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,503
Who the Immigrant thought was her older boyfriend and the Immigrant was

1458
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,271
Jealous

1459
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,111
That you was with he was with someone so beautiful he couldn't have her so he killed her

1460
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,903
These strategies are in touch

1461
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
Because reality is not what the real

1462
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,535
What the real is this white supremacist ideology and archetype

1463
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:33,375
You can try to justify by using real life events a tragedy this prop

1464
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
And you see that

1465
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,191
That's very teriyaki

1466
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
I mean

1467
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,543
One of the things that I think is really

1468
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,847
Important whenever we're talking about Alex Jones

1469
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,151
Stand things that he does

1470
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Oftentimes

1471
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:48,735
It's it's less important to look at what

1472
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,551
Is being done as like the structure of why

1473
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
These things are being

1474
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:55,903
Alex is creating side

1475
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
Stories

1476
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
Sim details

1477
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
About the story of the shooting

1478
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:02,559
In order to make it more palatable for his audience

1479
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
Any does the reverse

1480
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,887
Wipers

1481
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
Who is been shot

1482
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,447
It's just very obvious

1483
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,215
Whenever

1484
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
You know

1485
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,799
Alex said something like we're how am I racist

1486
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,847
This is this is the key Grandpa

1487
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,639
This strategy and this tactic

1488
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,175
Is

1489
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
Fingerprint

1490
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
88

1491
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,295
Immediately obvious simply because

1492
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:25,087
His argument even if he says it

1493
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
It's not okay for the cops to kill p

1494
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:31,743
His argument always boils down to it's more okay for the cops to kill black people than white

1495
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,583
His behavior is behavior dictates

1496
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Has to be

1497
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,655
Tripped out in his

1498
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
Situation so

1499
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,215
There you go you're a racist

1500
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,775
Piece of s*** Alex is taking issue 2 with

1501
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:48,383
The fact that the name of the police officer in Minnesota was released

1502
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,663
And that the author

1503
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
Professor who

1504
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,991
Shot Ashley in the capital

1505
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,271
Has not been really

1506
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,039
Sure

1507
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
And then normal

1508
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,343
X in

1509
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:00,671
Gus's closes investigation the death of Ashley Babbitt

1510
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,535
Investigation like

1511
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
Social Security

1512
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
CIA

1513
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,447
They close investigation with another person's name

1514
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
President here

1515
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,567
Norma what do you think's going on here

1516
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
No idea

1517
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,383
I mean a nest

1518
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:21,919
It's not transparent

1519
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
I know that had she been black

1520
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,015
And there were no charges no Transpo

1521
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,063
Guaranteed there might be more riots industry

1522
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
And then we'd be

1523
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,367
Talking about the need for a soap

1524
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Called racial reckon

1525
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,183
Are you a lawyer

1526
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Did

1527
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:41,119
Man that's cool a dorm

1528
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,399
The bar is not as hard

1529
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,447
Pool Norm

1530
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,983
Jesus Christ

1531
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,263
Wow

1532
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,567
A racial Reckoning

1533
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:56,223
Yeah I'm saying that the reason that no one is concerned with who the capitol police officer

1534
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:58,271
I don't even know if I'm going to allow that

1535
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,319
Yeah stipulation to stand

1536
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:04,671
I'll be saying that to be with everyone would be up in arms if it was a black person who got

1537
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Wow

1538
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:07,999
This guy's a lawyer

1539
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:09,535
Nope

1540
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,327
Nope

1541
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,607
If there's ghosts

1542
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,631
To the neighborhood

1543
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,983
Neighborhood

1544
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
I would call the Ghostbusters

1545
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
That is correct

1546
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,591
Who would other people call

1547
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,895
There's a wrestling in your house

1548
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:27,455
Good night maybe the house burglary who'd you call

1549
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,991
I would still Call the Ghostbusters

1550
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,271
Those proton packs

1551
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,807
Can powerful

1552
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
Do they affect people

1553
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:36,671
I don't know I've never I mean if you cross them they'll make something come

1554
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
The life I guess

1555
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,607
You and Norm

1556
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:51,007
Calling the police is essentially attempted murder at this

1557
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
I'll tell you something if I hear Russell

1558
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,895
The door tonight in somebody's trying to enter my home

1559
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,943
I'm calling 911 I'm not

1560
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Call in blacklight

1561
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:00,479
S'matter

1562
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:03,551
That's the kind of statement that I hear in my only response is

1563
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
Okay

1564
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
Alright

1565
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
Alright man

1566
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:07,903
Yeah

1567
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:08,927
Cool

1568
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:14,047
You call black lives matter someone breaking in your house they're not a police organization

1569
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,351
Irishtown

1570
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
I just don't know

1571
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,423
Are you really going to use that as

1572
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
The thing that the

1573
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,727
Acceptable to say

1574
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
It's really bizarre

1575
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Because

1576
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:28,895
I think I think we might be dealing with enormous trying

1577
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:29,919
To get into a second

1578
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:36,319
Line of work he's looking for that Millie Weaver slot that opened up I think he's trying to get into stand up

1579
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,599
Oh no

1580
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,647
Try my debut at stand-up

1581
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,207

And I buy ended my wrist

1583

And we're at a point where

1592
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
Sort of humor

1593
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,479
It isn't necessarily

1594
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Farcical any longer

1595
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,039

Girls meets rury

1623
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,231
It's the right okay so I need Wilkinson

1624
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,767
What is the protector

1625
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:23,583

So if a racial Reckoning occurs

1639
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,727

1644
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,879
I don't understand what it's for your light man and you need

1645
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,927
What do I need to tell you

1646
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:26,047
The world is changing Dan without this woke Insurance could be left

1647
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:29,887
I think a better way to tell this bit if she waited normal

1648
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,167
Wants to do it would be

1649
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,215
Something like a protection racket

1650
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,287
You know it's not insurance it's Insurance like the mob

1651
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
What kind of Russia

1652
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,895
I mean isn't that like more the vybes drink

1653
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:49,855
You said the n-word if you play if you don't pay your woke dues and I'll come and get you or something like that

1654
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:55,231
He's trying to do it would make sense I don't understand

1655
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:59,327
I mean I think it protects you from being Dogpile down for being a racist

1656
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:00,351
Sza said how

1657
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:05,983
Well if you get dumped over being racist there's a potential loss of income or of course open

1658
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Your pay

1659
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,895
Mario mod

1660
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Bright

1661
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:20,063
Eyelid whenever you get dog piles on for being the races position you harvest company comes around school

1662
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:25,439
Find out this guy gets a free rental car we cover those

1663
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:31,583
I meant but do they have to be like it's cool it's cool stop the dog pile or whatever

1664
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,399
That implies a imply

1665
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,959
That the people who are doing the dogpiling

1666
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:40,031
Rite Aid for the

1667
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:45,151
If you hold as a record Insurance Company

1668
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
Runs the world

1669
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,759
Yeah this place could use some work

1670
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:55,647
His delivery could use some work telling people a stand-up joke outside of

1671
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,463
The context of a comedy club is a bad idea it is

1672
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,279
Yeah song from Bad stand-up B

1673
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,071
Stu biblical analogy

1674
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:06,143
I heard you say before the brakes

1675
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Itasca

1676
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,215
Listeners to go to the Gospel of John

1677
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,775
The story of the

1678
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
The chick man

1679
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
You just want to

1680
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,128
There was a man laying beside the

1681
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:20,736
Newsela

1682
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:23,552
He was begging for somebody to move him so that he could be touched

1683
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,600
By the water Jesus said why are you here

1684
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,440
Wannabe into the waters he said that every time the waters move others beat me there

1685
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,464
Jesus wept

1686
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,768
Did the manatee didn't create an affirmative action plan

1687
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,304
Create a

1688
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,864
Program for a racial or disabled Reckoning

1689
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
He look at the man and said words

1690
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
Did I don't think we

1691
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,216
Often enough to one another

1692
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,032
Bed and walk

1693
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
And the man did

1694
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:51,712
The Power Within himself to take care of his own situation has I believe we all do but my view is the next

1695
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:54,016
For something on account of your skin color

1696
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:59,136
You're working on a Thursday night in mid April 2021

1697
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:06,048
Almost glad that he got cut off by the break and we don't know what he suggested you tell people

1698
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
That's good

1699
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,632
So when you are alone

1700
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,496
You do realize that other people do not have the

1701
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:17,312
Capacity within themselves to defeat the law

1702
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,384
Does that make sense

1703
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
Take your bed and walk

1704
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,736
I feel like that's at

1705
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:29,344
You are advocating any at all personal responsibility

1706
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,184
And also I just don't see Jesus being a man

1707
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
You can't walk in

1708
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,840
I'm thinking this requires a top-down structural change I think the whole point of

1709
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
Jesus was

1710
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:45,216
Time to stop the whole thing about Jesus is that he did miracles

1711
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,520
Isn't it

1712
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,592
People got healed by Tasha

1713
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:54,688
Periodically

1714
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:58,272
He was always covered in what are you alright

1715
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:00,832
What's left out of the Bible that Jesus was a very wet man

1716
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
I would say

1717
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
Oh yeah

1718
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
That

1719
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:09,536
Basically with Norm is doing here is using a biblical story where

1720
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
To get the message

1721
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:12,608
Across two people to

1722
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,424
Stop complaining hey you know what

1723
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,752
I think if you ever see if I saw

1724
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:19,520
A Slave

1725
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:20,800
Obviously

1726
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Play I would go up to

1727
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:27,968
To this would be like hey we need some structural changes here because I'm a slave

1728
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,272
Look at him and I would say get your bed and move

1729
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
See

1730
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,856
Everybody has it within themselves

1731
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,440
To solve their own problems no doubt about that

1732
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
Your stick

1733
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,488
And get the f***

1734
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,768
Is what Jesus

1735
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,560
Jesus said

1736
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,656
By the time that Norm is on hand to Alex's talking about a story about

1737
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:49,728
Patrice colors one of the co-founders of black lives matter

1738
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,824
Apparently of some attention is come to the fact that

1739
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,848
The cheese bought some houses

1740
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,896
I recently and Alex

1741
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Vista CA

1742
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:03,296
Blacklivesmatter

1743
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,648
10.6 billion black lives matter cause last year

1744
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,184
Prednisone do investigator

1745
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,952
I mean

1746
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,256
Do you moved into all white

1747
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,936
White supremacy

1748
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,240
White supremacy

1749
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:25,056
Call Rouses in the most white bread

1750
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:27,616
Because she's trying to recall

1751
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
Colonized

1752
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,200
The continent that was stolen from Native Americans into

1753
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,480
Can fit her neighbors

1754
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,272
By showing that we're here and we met her

1755
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:41,952
Oh boy

1756
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:48,352
Hey

1757
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:51,424
Forever is what you might as well just said

1758
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
Kind of saying like

1759
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,240
If this person so worried about whites

1760
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
Supremacy

1761
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,312
Bolivar all white neighborhoods alone

1762
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,360
That does seem like nuts

1763
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:04,992
It does seem like the point he's trying to make as if you're worried about white supremacy you should leave our country

1764
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:09,856
Patrice colors have released a statement on Instagram about

1765
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
Assertive

1766
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,440
Questioning of her her money tour

1767
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:19,328
And she said that she has a number of different careers in Revenue sources but they quote I do not receive a salary or benefit

1768
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,376
It's from black lives matter Global Network Foundation

1769
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:26,496
She didn't say that investigating her or questioning her is white supremacy

1770
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,776
She did say quote

1771
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:31,104
This effort to discredit and harass me and my family is not noon or is it

1772
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
Unacceptable

1773
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,176
It's taken away from where the focus should be

1774
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
Ending white suit

1775
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,480
Damn that's Pinterest

1776
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,504
Dubai Alex to say hi

1777
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,552
It's white supremacy that invest

1778
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,392
Norm takes off

1779
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,232
I think that was one of his worst

1780
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,864
That was one of the most blatantly racist things I've heard Norm say

1781
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,168
Yeah I mean the stand-up bit alone

1782
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,704
Yeah that way

1783
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,728
Like maybe

1784
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:01,568
Third on the list

1785
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,592
Comes back and

1786
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,128
He decides he's going to take matters in

1787
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
It was on hand

1788
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,456
About this whole thing about the

1789
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:11,296
Non releasing of the name of the cop see if he wasn't such a

1790
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:16,416
It's such a bad lawyer I would say Norm pattis should be there for that no normal to get out of there

1791
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,256
Responsibility

1792
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
To release

1793
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:21,792
The name is

1794
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:27,680
Reno

1795
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:31,776
You know everything

1796
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Information

1797
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,664
I believe the public has a right to know

1798
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
Okay I believe that

1799
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:40,736
Yeah

1800
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:45,088
Yeah I would say generally speaking if you just have a hunch

1801
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:49,696
That somebody is a person of interest in this case

1802
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,256
Report that

1803
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,560
Here's what happens a lot whenever

1804
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:58,400
Somebody reports the name of somebody accused of murder and says

1805
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,192
As best we know this is the purse

1806
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,240
A lot of times it's not

1807
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Can you really

1808
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
F***** up there live

1809
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:05,824
Yeah it's

1810
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,456
It's something that you can't really take back never they can't really predict what the audience's response

1811
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,760
To your

1812
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:16,064
Shity reporting will be totally

1813
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,856
I don't know what you expect people to

1814
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
To do even

1815
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,416
If you are correct

1816
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:27,072
I don't want anyone to go after this person what else could people do you give them the name

1817
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,608
I don't understand

1818
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:36,032
The people have a right to know exactly the person I totally don't want you to Target I am however giving you the name

1819
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:41,152
Strangely enough I'm going to read off the address as well but I don't want people to bother this person

1820
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,432
Listen at all

1821
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,456
I am

1822
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
Getting a sin

1823
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,016
But Alex is pissed off

1824
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,296
That he's not being

1825
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:52,928
Oppressed like his buddy Sam and so he's going to throw a wild curveball

1826
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:58,816
And try and dock somebody and see if it gets him in trouble so he can be the real victim

1827
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:00,864
And also he wants to

1828
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
To be clear

1829
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
This is

1830
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
Just because he believes that

1831
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,216
The capitol officer is black

1832
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,776
And yeah that makes

1833
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,056
Stomach

1834
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:11,872
Okay that's what he did

1835
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,992
I know is

1836
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:18,784
We know every white cop

1837
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,064
That kills a black

1838
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,648
I want a black person kills a white person we

1839
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,416
Don't

1840
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,208
About it

1841
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,328
Holyshit

1842
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
I would say like

1843
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
Demos

1844
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:37,984
Emperor of motives are being expressed here in terms of

1845
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,032
Alex wanting to save this person to me

1846
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,568
Very much open

1847
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
That's

1848
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:45,664
That's one of those things where it's like

1849
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:46,944
You can

1850
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:48,224
Not say that

1851
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:49,248
Yes

1852
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:55,648
You can you cannot say this person's name because you can't prove that it is the right person

1853
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:56,672
To single them out

1854
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,208
Second you cannot

1855
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,512
Say on air that you're really just pissed off

1856
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,280
Are they race

1857
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,304
Issue

1858
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:09,472
Your white aggrievement is a is a racist anyways I expect

1859
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,568
It gets racist more

1860
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
I guess

1861
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:19,456
So when a white police officer or a police officer shoots a white person

1862
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:22,784
Person person

1863
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,368
But when a black man

1864
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,696
White woman it's never open is

1865
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,232
Because

1866
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,256
Only whites

1867
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,096
Exposing

1868
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,984
We're not listen

1869
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:47,360
We're not saying insert the only reason we would be saying this

1870
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:49,408
We're not saying it because of that

1871
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,784
We're definitely not saying it because the only reason anyone could say this

1872
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,344
Outrageous

1873
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,136
Now we're not saying it because of this

1874
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,208
The only possible reason we could have for saying

1875
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,488
Jennifer differ

1876
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,024
Alright

1877
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,560
Galax wanted

1878
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,864
This to

1879
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,680
Blow up pot maybe get him in a little bit of trouble

1880
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,472
Seems like the one that much trouble

1881
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,288
So you have the Fall Guy he's never met before

1882
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,664
He has a fall-guy it happens to be the guy who was in the capital with sales

1883
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
Tyler Hansen

1884
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,576
Pretty good investigative journalist over the years

1885
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:33,184
And Michelle before he and others

1886
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,976
Which

1887
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Boss monster

1888
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,912
You don't normally see that do you like some citizenship

1889
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
Reminder backyard

1890
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,336
Sometimes you don't

1891
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,384
Sometimes names aren't released

1892
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,664
Yeah

1893
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,224
You know I don't know

1894
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
The sound

1895
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
Evolution

1896
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,368
Fast moving vehicle

1897
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,160
The mint meant to carry

1898
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,440
A bunch of people

1899
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,976
Yeah

1900
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,024
The Tyler should be hearing right now

1901
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:12,864
Cuz it's covid

1902
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:13,632
Rocket

1903
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:19,264
Trouble don't worry I'm just repeating what Tyler Hansen told me

1904
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:25,920
Also also the guy who burned the black lives matter flag with Owen Shroyer

1905
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,504
Very good in school.

1906
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,808
Pretty good pretty good

1907
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
He's a pretty good advantage

1908
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,368
Paint sprayer

1909
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,696
Kind of so f***** up that it's like if I have to

1910
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,464
Explain to you

1911
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:39,744
The difference

1912
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,280
Between

1913
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,328
Running down

1914
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,888
And chasing a child and shooting them

1915
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
Or

1916
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,728
F****** choking a man to do

1917
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:51,776
Versus

1918
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,568
A mob of

1919
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
People

1920
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,872
Storming the f******

1921
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
Capitol building

1922
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:57,664
Trying to

1923
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,200
Tear Down the Walls

1924
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,248
Running with people with

1925
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
Guns and God damn

1926
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,600
Everything if you can't see the difference

1927
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,368
Between bat

1928
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,160
Type of shooting and not

1929
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
There's no point

1930
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
Talking

1931
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:16,608
Intentionally obtuse you don't for me to communicate with you if you don't

1932
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,632
See the difference

1933
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,192
Assuming that

1934
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,216
The person

1935
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:24,032
Who was the police officer in the capital was black

1936
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:25,824
Trying to play

1937
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,104
Pretend event V

1938
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,640
Relevant difference

1939
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
Between those two issues

1940
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,456
Is a racial one

1941
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,528
Statues

1942
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
Absolutely absurd

1943
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:38,112
But it's whatever was want to do because it helps

1944
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:43,232
With the white agreement if you will that

1945
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
So Alex

1946
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,840
Is going to name this guy I don't believe it and just because

1947
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,400
I looked into it you can find it being like

1948
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,168
I like

1949
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,704
It all goes back to

1950
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,240
Two-timer handsome

1951
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:58,080
He tweeted it out it's out there it's public so it's not like

1952
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,152
You're not that I couldn't really find

1953
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:03,456
Easily I might believe it

1954
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,248
Rush because I don't want to add to this

1955
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,272
Sure but

1956
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:09,088
Just for the sake of demonstrating that Alex is

1957
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,136
Completely under

1958
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,160
Confidently

1959
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:14,464
Not knowing at all if he's correct

1960
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,536
Naming someone as a shooter

1961
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,168
Not the officer

1962
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,264
I sure you

1963
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
The foyer

1964
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:30,080
Now that's my lawyer to do it

1965
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,872
Avascular 24u

1966
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,408
Because we have a right as depressed

1967
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:37,760
Right2know

1968
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,552
Taylor Hanson

1969
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,320
Twitter

1970
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,088
So again

1971
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,416
Handsome said

1972
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
This name

1973
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,256
But I'm not saying granny of those insert reason

1974
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:54,656
Way larger platform than Taylor Hanson

1975
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:58,752
I reported but I'm also going to say that maybe it's not the guy

1976
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,056
If it's not him maybe

1977
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:05,664
He could call them and correct me about it

1978
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,712
You accused of things

1979
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:14,112
We're just asking questions and if these people would come forward and tell us the answers we wouldn't need to ask anymore questions

1980
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:20,768
What is it definitely not something we're saying in bad faith you've never heard this before

1981
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,792
Say something

1982
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
Similar to this

1983
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,864
A bad face

1984
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,144
Claiming that Bill Gates

1985
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:30,240
He's in the Council of twelve or whatever because he posted on Aaron Bill Gates

1986
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:33,312
Dakota Lee if he waving wasn't in the Council of twelve he would have

1987
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
Call

1988
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,384
Incredibly deferential

1989
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,688
Because he's powerful and I am a coward

1990
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,736
This is not how it works

1991
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,600
I like the idea that he does California foyer

1992
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:48,416
Like whatever

1993
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,720
Towhee

1994
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,280
He understands that that's something that

1995
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,816
You might be able to do

1996
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
Meniscus

1997
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
Because

1998
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,400
The investigation has closed

1999
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,960
And so there may not be a legitimate law enforcement

2000
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
The reason

2001
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,336
Not release the name of the person short

2002
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:08,384
Now if you do that

2003
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,432
You could report the name

2004
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Exactly

2005
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
You can't do

2006
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,016
This

2007
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,808
And then be like hey

2008
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,344
If he's not the person

2009
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,624
He should tell us

2010
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,648
Meanwhile damaged

2011
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:26,048
But done by me saying that the person

2012
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:30,400
We're never going to do confirm this later on

2013
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,960
With a foia request request something that we

2014
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:34,496
Do so often

2015
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,288
I pronounce it correct

2016
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:42,432
Like I said it's clear that his entire premise here is that he's just mad

2017
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,456
That the white

2018
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,248
Cops game shop reveal

2019
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:50,880
Can we do Nokia

2020
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:52,160
Potter

2021
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:52,928
Black Warehouse

2022
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,464
Police station burned down

2023
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,232
That's okay

2024
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,536
Candlelight download she deserves

2025
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,584
So there you go

2026
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,888
I mean it's just too obvious

2027
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:07,776
That's like what is animating this and what what motivated him to behave in the ways he is

2028
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Like

2029
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,360
But without that motive

2030
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,152
Did this behavior is unacceptable

2031
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,200
Having this

2032
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,504
Kind of a reckless irresponsible

2033
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,040
You're going on

2034
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:23,136
While it's being so obviously motivated

2035
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:25,952
Buy feelings of white identity

2036
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,256
Security +

2037
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:29,792
Hood

2038
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:34,400
It's multiple layers of unacceptable

2039
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,424
I can't believe

2040
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,704
He's this transparent

2041
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,984
Yeah I mean

2042
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,824
It is kind of a truth that if you cling to White

2043
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,872
Miss eventually that's the only thing you're going to have

2044
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:48,480
Like clinging to the color of your skin as something important

2045
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
Is going to push

2046
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
Everybody out of your life

2047
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:51,808
Eventually

2048
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
Or it's only going to unite you with other people who are

2049
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
Clinging to White

2050
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:00,256
And they'll tell you until you find a difference between years

2051
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,840
Exact until it's time to shut them out for not being

2052
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,936
For colored hair

2053
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,032
I think it many ways it comes down to two

2054
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:15,616
Just like having a mentality that is so entirely based on exclusion

2055
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,152
Yeah he's going to exclude

2056
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
Yeah and it's going to

2057
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
It's going to

2058
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,760
It's going to go that way

2059
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,088
Now at this point

2060
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:25,856
Alex Costa

2061
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,904
Owen Shroyer Who's down by the border

2062
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,208
Trying to get more footage

2063
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Stopping

2064
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Smugglers

2065
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,536
I guess that's where I would want to be

2066
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:39,424
Bi would be what I would want to be near the u.s. Mexico border if I was Owen Shroyer

2067
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,704
Now just like

2068
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,056
I'll take a little step over here and now I'm not in trouble.

2069
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,872
Come and get me

2070
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:51,200
Extradite me for this

2071
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:55,040
I didn't care for any of that

2072
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
I'm not going to

2073
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,600
Play This Dance Now

2074
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,648
I got really mad

2075
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,696
I got really mad

2076
01:37:01,952 --> 01:37:02,464
It Alex

2077
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,744
1

2078
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,768
Because of how

2079
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
Disgusting this

2080
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
Display has been

2081
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,400
For most of this episode from the first hour

2082
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,704
Then I got really excited about

2083
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:13,728
Any just f******

2084
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:14,496
Teased me

2085
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:17,312
And then separately I mixed into my sax and I can't

2086
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
You guys

2087
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,640
Get me the

2088
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
Do John Hopkins

2089
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
Documentary Jamie White Road

2090
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,528
I got the document but I can't

2091
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,184
Polygon 2021

2092
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,256
Mobiletron stimulation of coming cyber pandemic

2093
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
Freakonomics

2094
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,328
This is the blueprint

2095
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:41,888
John Hopkins is like the main horses

2096
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:46,240
All the global sugar tester drills at Greek Mayweather

2097
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
Top of their field

2098
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,920
Computer science

2099
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,224
Psychology

2100
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,088
You got a headache

2101
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,160
You have to hit that you literally have

2102
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,440
The hit that many didn't

2103
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:07,744
That's the most important story I've ever heard

2104
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:12,096
Cyber polygon 20-20-20 one I got to know

2105
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:17,216
So great the great reset it happening and it's through this a polygon 2021

2106
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:22,080
Play found the documents and everything and then I was never brought it up so I don't get to talk about it

2107
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Anyway

2108
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,128
I thought someday soon

2109
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,480
We will talk about I want to talk about it

2110
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:33,856
I think the struggles with his like I got really excited there's primary documents here it is actually

2111
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,160
Something interesting maybe we can talk about

2112
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,720
But I'm not going to bump things Alex doesn't even

2113
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:45,120
Get to yeah that's not fair that's not fair you

2114
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,144
Vague

2115
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:49,216
Anyway what we talked about cyber polygon

2116
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:55,104
A very excited to say about it

2117
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:58,176
It's always good to be one step ahead of the

2118
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,456
Roadrunner

2119
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:01,504
Unsatisfying though cuz

2120
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,832
I'm listening to this b******* about Sam

2121
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:09,696
And then Alexander getting racist as hell I hadn't like

2122
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:13,792
At least I've got cyber polygon to look forward to and then it doesn't happen

2123
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:15,840
Oh man well s***

2124
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
I

2125
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,400
I'm telling you

2126
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:23,008
I think second string Sam should have been on the second string for this episode

2127
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:29,152
Should have been cyber polygon 2021 all day more time on that been trying to

2128
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:35,552
To make Sam's arrest about himself seem like it

2129
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:36,832
I think

2130
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,856
I think this is

2131
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,648
Yeah one of the first times that we've had an

2132
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,464
Active Infowars employee get arrested

2133
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:45,280
And so that's kind of interesting that was one of the reasons why I was

2134
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,816
Like we got a we got to get into the

2135
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,352
Millie Weaver got arrested

2136
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,168
Did but she was I think that was unrelated

2137
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,216
Totally unrelated

2138
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:56,288
Is not law

2139
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,080
Honestly never met her before

2140
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,360
Bing

2141
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,128
You too tired

2142
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
Pretty quick

2143
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:05,760
Very quick and then like Joe Biggs got arrested but he's a former employee

2144
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:08,320
Rodger Stone

2145
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,880
You know he's he's Rogers

2146
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,184
What is a lot of immigrant

2147
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:21,376
All right but they can work it in for

2148
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,472
I don't want it back

2149
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,800
Another episode hopefully covering cyber polygons

2150
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,616
Who got something to do we got to do something with that

2151
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:33,920
He's from now on

2152
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:38,016
Eventually we'll get the trailer polygon

2153
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:42,624
But until then

2154
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,440
Twitter is ethnography that go to bed Jordan

2155
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:47,488
We are busy

2156
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,328
You could please find a local charity or bail Fund in your area to help

2157
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,352
People are doing

2158
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:59,264
Arrest for loud

2159
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Utterances

2160
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Alex

2161
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,688
Birthstone colors

2162
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,480
I love your work
