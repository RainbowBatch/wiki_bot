1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Goddamn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
Hotel room far away from talking about Alex Jones

6
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,216
What's up

7
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
How do you feel about your desk cuz mine's broken

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,592
OU in your hotel yet

9
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
No I did not walked in there broken

10
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,784
Hey I don't buy it

11
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:33,440
Fair enough but what you write about for today by breaks a Jordan is the good people at Nora bar

12
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
How did Evan Louisville Kentucky Louisville or some people pronounce it if you're ever out there the best karaoke

13
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:46,240
A bar that side of the Mississippi Heroes of the day I swear to God you don't even know

14
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
We had

15
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,896
The more technical problems going to put out an episode yesterday Thursday Friday

16
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
We have two heads

17
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,224
Fun stuff to talk about bud

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
I could not get it done

19
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,808
Really f***** up it was

20
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
It was looking good

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
For a minute

22
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
Emma and it all just fell apart it is a proposal to call this a war because we did win

23
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:14,912
A lot of battles battles

24
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:21,312
Sometimes were we were so close and that those battles over the appearance and feeling that we had

25
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,872
Goodwin those battles overthrow Charles

26
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Then I get it

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
Like the war ended with

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,040
He's not wrong attorney

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Proprietor of rebar

30
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,488
Be not help Ranger John

31
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
And he helped us out hooked it up and now we've got our

32
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,096
Equipment all set up and I'm not touching

33
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Goddamn

34
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,824
Honestly think we should move a little bit further away but I could be in the other room

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,944
Worried that there's going to be some kind of a like electromagnetic field that I give off the

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,808
Personal 11 Cruise outside they're putting out of the MP

37
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
If you are in Louisville

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,424
Anyway what's your bright you know there's no bright spot brighter than finally getting to do this show.

39
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
William

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
We are

41
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Recorded almost

42
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:28,128
Central shows yeah pretty close is been a little bit like edging

43
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
Butts

44
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
Like if edging was with knives you know like it really really hurts and now to be here talking to you

45
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
You

46
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,160
Spectacular and knowing that we have a thing in front of us

47
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Yes

48
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,560
Jordan today. Here's the old six that we find ourselves in

49
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Quite honestly I forgot to get to walk shout-outs and I think I'm not going to don't worry no offense we have been

50
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Jumping through a lot of hurdles

51
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:55,520
Spoiler alert

52
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,896
It's almost midnight till what time it is in you don't want to know when we had

53
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
You don't want to have any idea no no keep that to keep that s*** far away from you and let me deal with it

54
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:11,392
Let's Pretend so Jordans today we are going to be talking about

55
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Alex is war

56
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,488
The new documentary that has come out

57
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
Comes out today

58
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:22,911
What how did you possibly see it on some people have accused me of being a witch and let's just say that

59
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
Did you see in your crystal ball and watch it from a discharge gave me a vision of this documentary when I was four

60
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,687
It's raining right

61
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,039
I'm helping him support So bolsonaro regime

62
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:45,439
I'm watching of this thing and

63
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
On this bad boy

64
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,047
The comes out today

65
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
Accurate 100% I assume well here's my first thought

66
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,679
Oolong

67
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,543
It's 2 hours and 11 minutes

68
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Max Rim that baby up Max actually if you're doing the theatrical release these people sit and watch Alex with that

69
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,991
Long I was well

70
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
I will let me tell you this right now Dan

71
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
When I was in the courtroom today

72
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
People watch Alex's show for a full hour

73
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
How did you think they did

74
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,743
I was watching the stream of that

75
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
And they I mean

76
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:28,703
Your tweets about one of the jurors who was writing notes

77
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,567
When I saw him when I saw him writing

78
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:39,967
So diligently he like really cared and then it one moment you could see him stop and you're like yep

79
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,551
We've all gotten a realized I don't need

80
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
Weird

81
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
This

82
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
This is going to be something and I will say actually interesting Lee contacts drop from

83
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,959
Documentary of some of my feelings about this documentary fairly well

84
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
It's always something

85
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Pretty close to to my feelings I think you are

86
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,527
Is that a deepfake Shallowford

87
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,111
So like I said this thing is too long

88
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,903
There's a lot of problem

89
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
But

90
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:27,327
In advance of this documentary coming out there no one to bring this up there have been some people who have maybe Sho'nuff

91
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
You too many of their car

92
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
And discussing this documentary

93
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
Some of these cards have been a little difficult to interpret they were

94
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
But they were shown all the same

95
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,359
Glenn Greenwald who agreed to do an embarrassing Q&A event

96
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,663
At the premiere of this film where he interviewed Alex

97
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
As a promotional event

98
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:43,967
For the movie

99
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,623
We're going to cover that Q&A on our next episode so I'll leave some of my more specific thoughts on the side for a moment

100
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
And then you had Matt Taibbi

101
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Who posted it

102
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,279
Diculous post on his substack where he appeared to just want to scold people

103
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
You think this documentary is bad

104
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:05,727
I honestly don't know his full argument because apparently the full thing is behind a paywall and he can f*** right off with

105
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
But you get the point

106
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Just from the free version

107
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,151
This is one of the more particularly pathetic passages in that

108
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,783
Pre Trump era it was understood reporters weren't supposed to avoid ugly or scary topic

109
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
We were supposed to Dive Right In

110
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,415
And they didn't the non-judgmental manner of doctors figure them out

111
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:31,071
That was the job but somewhere along the line it became too taboo to ask the usual why questions about the likes of

112
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,167
Or Fortune Surfers or the subject of Moyers new movie

113
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
Alex is war Alex Jones

114
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
And a while you were reading.

115
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,759
A scolding people who aren't engaging enough with monsters tell ubm's his free section with this

116
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Quote

117
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
Journalists now aren't supposed to look too closely at their motivations

118
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
And most don't

119
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,231
Wearing in in curiosity like a badge of honor

120
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Moyer look

121
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,423
Referring to Alex Lee Boyer director of this documentary

122
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:10,495
Years ago where are we

123
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
To put capitalism

124
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
And I was like man

125
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,407
This guy's got some thoughts and much like Glenn Greenwald

126
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
He shoot himself in his mouth

127
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,623
Haven't watch this documentary I can tell you that if Taibbi isn't getting paid to write that he either hasn't seen this film or

128
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,927
He's one of the stupidest assholes on substack

129
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,743
And that is a deep roster of stupid assholes

130
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
We'll see through this exploration that this is not a documentary that asks why at any point antiques

131
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,935
Even a concern

132
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,519
The why is entirely constructed by the subject of the film

133
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Alex himself

134
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
When you have somebody who's a huge liar and the reason he's divisive is because he's a hateful liar who lies all the time

135
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,575
It's kind of irresponsible to produce a documentary about them that skirts the issue almost entirely

136
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,695
And if it's even addressed at all it would just be Alex saying I'm not a liar which is been taken is

137
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,511
There are no dissenting voices

138
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,375
There is no other side presented at all outside of random people on the street yelling at Alex

139
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:15,775
In short Snippets of TV host to making fun of him which actually aren't included to provide any sense of balance their there

140
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
To inflate

141
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
The image of Alex's Noble

142
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
Kyusha this documentary sucks

143
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,711
I will save that right off the top of your and I make no bones about it

144
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
I'm not trying to

145
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Pretend

146
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,271
To be a

147
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
How you be a neutral Observer here's what we need to do we need to bottle you up for another few like before

148
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:39,071
For our next episode we need to make it impossible for you to record anything so that you're all of your Fury and

149
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,095
Passion and rage

150
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,655
Goes into writing about Matt Taibbi bulshit

151
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,263
Man you are a f****** Dynamo by I don't want to

152
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,663
Go that direction understand intimately

153
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,687
Albert like this

154
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
These supposed

155
00:09:55,967 --> 00:10:02,111
Freethinkers like taibian Glenn Greenwald congratulate themselves for Having the courage to support this film is des

156
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Disgusting

157
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:09,279
Zeidman's gold people for not engaging with what is pure and simple and exercising whitewashing and rehabilitating the image of a

158
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,631
Strategically released at the time of his Sandy Hook trial's beginning

159
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Is an inexcusable activator malice

160
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
Or intense delusion

161
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:22,335
I can accept that it's possible that they think this film presents a very nuanced picture of Ali

162
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,687
And then maybe they are acting out of a place of severely ill will

163
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
But I have to say if that's the case

164
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,087
Then they're guilty of the very thing there scolding everybody else about

165
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:35,647
Not engaging with difficult subjects

166
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
The only way to think that this documentary

167
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Experience days

168
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
Just showing Alex as he is

169
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
Would be if you have done zero investigation on him

170
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
It's simply except the frame and gets put in front of you on Quest

171
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Running late

172
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
Having spent more than my fair share of time researching the topic

173
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
I can say with absolute confidence that Greenwald and Taibbi and anybody else who's not a full-on infowarrior or right-wing

174
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,223
Xalatan says that this documentary

175
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Does a complicated unfair picture of Alex

176
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
They're a coward who's afraid to look at Alex's he actually is

177
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,135
Or they've been tricked

178
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:13,023
Book these people who are trying to rehabilitate Alex's image and make fun and portraits of him more mainstream

179
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
Using whatever credibility they have

180
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
In some

181
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:23,775
Perverted exercise of like oh you guys just can't handle dealing with this person who

182
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,079
Google you're afraid of

183
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,663
He's saying things that are dangerous to your your worldview

184
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,431
F*** off

185
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,735
Don't 700 episodes on the cloud

186
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Let it be known

187
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
That this

188
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
Will go down as one of the most

189
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,415
Righteously Furious weeks

190
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,719
Of any human beings

191
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
In the history of the world between you mean Mark Etc

192
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
This s*** is

193
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:55,775
How are we in this room janumet did you hear that the fire department was called earlier today

194
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,687
Oh I was taking a nap and I was woken up by them saying everyone can come back in the building

195
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
And I was like you know what this is because I'm

196
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
If I were Alex I would say that it was Alex in the info Warriors trying to smoke

197
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
Side of the building

198
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
McGee said about Chantilly Virginia when he was staying at that hotel pretended that is under attack

199
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,679
I'm going to sell

200
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,215
Say to myself

201
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
Neighbors 2

202
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,799
Want to say that

203
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,431
That incident where Alex pretended that the globalist

204
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,759
I'm going to make a lot of points of things that aren't in heat

205
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,855
Also the time that he went bullhorn Bilderberg

206
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
And I Canada

207
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,535
Nope not in that they play that no

208
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
I know

209
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,655
Here is the beginning of the film and it starts with a One-Shot

210
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Alex

211
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
Staring at the camera a much younger man

212
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,007
Hello

213
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Imallexx

214
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,567
Number radio and television

215
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,663
And for many years I've been exposing

216
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
The criminal act

217
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
Other Global Elite

218
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,527
Also known as the New World Order

219
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
My research has

220
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Stop

221
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,647
Militarization of police

222
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,183
The attack on America

223
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
National

224
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Destruction of private property

225
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
The family

226
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,095
All of these

227
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Institutions

228
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Destroyed

229
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Before

230
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Established

231
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
And create their ultimate dream

232
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
A1 world

233
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Government

234
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
Documentary begins with the clip that was originally the intro for Alex's film Dark Secrets inside bohemian

235
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
Grove

236
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:44,319
It's kind of fitting because although Alex probably shot to prominence mostly through his 911

237
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
Conspiracy activity

238
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:50,207
One of his earliest publicity stunts that he pulled was the whole charade of Bohemian Grove

239
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:53,535
And what is this documentary Alex's War but another

240
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Publicity stunt

241
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
There's a thematic resonance that may not have intended that is made by putting this clip at the start of this

242
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:08,383
It links Alex's bulshit from his early career to the b******* he's in the middle of trying to pass off and sell you as

243
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
As you watch this documentary

244
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
In the same way that he intentionally lied about the circumstances of his troops

245
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:18,367
To The Grove in order to manufacture a false reality that affirms his worldview

246
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:24,767
This documentary is literally nothing other than Alex Lee Moyer allowing Alex to use her to do that again

247
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,351
Present-day holy dishonest portrait that creates a false reality

248
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:33,471
Alex's idiotic worldview is affirmed and shown to have been right all along

249
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
Based on literally everything of his documentary

250
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,359
Can very confidently say that this is not what Moyer was going for

251
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
But it's interesting

252
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
If you want to overanalyze it like a lit major

253
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,647
What would you call it like the incidental irony

254
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
Stan's wherein you know

255
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
If you were making one movie

256
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
You could play this clip

257
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:01,119
But if you were making a movie about that movie you would play that clip and then play like a

258
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,911
Cut over it where it's like

259
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,959
Wrong

260
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:11,359
Yeah yeah

261
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
In this film that kind of have that

262
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
That feeling to it

263
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
You didn't mean this but it's

264
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,855
That there's an accidental thing here that's being coming across

265
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
A little bit like

266
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,231
A little bit late works you watch you watch the documentary about

267
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Cheap Trick

268
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
You know and it's like it's so cool that they're alive and then you watched

269
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
The Behind the Music in this like

270
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,167
They did a lot of drugs in there all day

271
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,519
You know it's like that kind of feeling oh no

272
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,543
And then things

273
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,687
So the documentary itself starts with some Glamour Shots

274
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
Basically of Owen Shroyer at

275
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
The steel rallies in November

276
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,623
ABC

277
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,463
And does people yelling at him and what have you in it so it's a good time

278
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,559
4 Million Man March Madness

279
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Business ain't opening to Swan Lake

280
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Did you know that

281
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
Dog begins with a bunch of shots of Owen dramatically yelling into a bullhorn World surrounded by a

282
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,695
Haunted security security in the courtroom

283
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
Interspersed are shots of people yelling at the Trump fans more less meant to signify the threat of antifa I guess

284
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,703
Justify the ridiculous amount of bodyguards every Infowars person has

285
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Panera Pub

286
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,311
Also this is where the film introduces

287
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,335
It's framing device

288
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:24,479
The film begins with footage from DC from the Stop & steal protest that happened in November 2020

289
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,807
Would you may recall is the endpoint of Owen stupid Caravan

290
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,439
This is presented as 72 days until the election which will be how all of this is understood

291
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,559
The documentary is I'm sorry not 72 days till the election inauguration

292
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
This documentary is a countdown to the point when Biden is set to be sworn in with the flashbacks to point of Alex's career

293
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,287
Ronan in order to I guess pad the runtime

294
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:54,687
Or something

295
00:17:54,943 --> 00:18:01,087
One and two ecos without saying with their huge chunks of Alex's career that are complete

296
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
Completely ignored by the

297
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:06,719
This film for instance there's no mention of his highly disgraceful Boston bombing coverage

298
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,791
There's nothing about Jade Helm there's nothing about Y2K

299
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
These things are countless others

300
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:17,215
Aren't included because if they were mentioned it would detract from the illusion that this film is trying to construct

301
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,263
X

302
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,895
Like about Sandy Hook are meant to be seen as the rare occasions when he's met well but got something wrong

303
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:29,503
Looking at the broader picture of Alex's career with to easily reveal a different pattern

304
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:33,087
Which really doesn't serve more or this documentaries purpose

305
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,671
Through this you see lies that Alex is presenting

306
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:39,231
And they're being delivered by Moyer with

307
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:43,327
Literally no pushback and no other perspective being presented at all

308
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
At other points there are instances of

309
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
Full on deceitful framing that isn't

310
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,263
Entirely the product and how more decided to edit this film

311
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
They are intentional choices that could have been made by the director or could not have it was they were making the film

312
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,943
It was up to them

313
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,343
I'm going to do my best to be sure to delineate the differences between these types of deception because

314
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,951
It's important to recognize how this product is actually alive that Moyer and Alex are

315
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Collaborating on

316
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
Creative

317
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
Whether or not there's actually

318
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
Make me look like I've got a giant dick

319
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
It doesn't matter

320
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,871
Creating that through both of their right

321
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,687
Alex through lying and Moyer through

322
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Directions

323
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
Yeah but here's the thing

324
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:36,063
Alex is just doing what he always

325
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:42,463
Does he's a narcissistic liar so what would you expect him to do other than to lie to create a heroic masala

326
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Ology about himself

327
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:50,143
Moyer on the other hand is pretending to be a documentarian and almost everything in this film is alive that she's tell

328
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,215
Going through framing for a live at she's letting Alex tell

329
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,775
In choosing 2% without any question or any

330
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Suggestion even of any doubt

331
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:03,455
She is an Essence responsible for all of the dishonesty in this documentary either through intentional choices

332
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Or negligent filmmaking

333
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,087
And I think that will be borne out through the process of our conversation here today

334
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,879
So I'm I'm hearing

335
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,415
That maybe

336
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Is not a good cat

337
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:21,375
No I don't think so I don't know I don't know all that much about her

338
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Other than tubing on Infowars a bit

339
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,471
She made that a couple times just like

340
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,007
About her documentaries

341
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:32,127
She on this show that that should alone by itself be like

342
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,431
Oh well then this lady is a month

343
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,735
Western Wear like well we got to find some other credits

344
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
The Brute fuse bad

345
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,159
Yeah she made that incel documentary

346
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
She was there at the Greenwald kubaneh

347
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
And

348
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,839
Hung her head looking at her lap most of Alex's interview perfect

349
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
Anyway so it goes on to complain

350
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,703
A little bit

351
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Just dramatic

352
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
I had been here since

353
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,687
Since the fake pandemic

354
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,647
Everything shut down everything's locked down

355
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Businesses reported up

356
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Can't even go get breakfast

357
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Pinata wear face mask

358
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
Quarantine

359
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,800
What a communist country would look like

360
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Socks

361
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,688
What the Democrats to turn America into Italian

362
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,624
Weird

363
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,744
Doesn't want is a country where his access to luxury and Leisure Commodities isn't anyway restrict

364
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:58,400
He is essentially translated that into being with Communism is so when there's a temporary shutdown of some businesses because

365
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,216
Cuz there's an active it's killing thousands of people a day

366
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,800
The only way of experiencing that is to say communism

367
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,896
He can't go to the water park so America Has Fallen tomorrow or something

368
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Which is weird cuz I kind of had the APA

369
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Experience most of the liquor

370
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,528
Liquor stores didn't deliver booze until after the

371
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,112
The pandemic so now I feel like you know there were some pause

372
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,904
I'm not saying there were no

373
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,232
Smooth

374
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
If they say

375
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
Praise God for small beer

376
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
So it's important to understand that a lot of the understanding that alexanian floors ideology has of Concepts like ominous

377
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,288
More freedom are painfully superficial and they often revolve around appearance

378
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Princeton's Alex

379
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:42,176
Constantly talks about the police taping but police and black ski mask

380
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,224
Switches anaesthetic characteristic

381
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
He doesn't

382
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,600
Reno tacos frequently about what behaviors would be associated with the police state like

383
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:53,696
Police determining law and acted with impunity to mete out Justice because

384
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,024
They'll be way too complicated and what it actually does happen

385
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
He's generally in favor of it

386
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,960
He doesn't usually have a problem

387
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:11,360
By maritime law are allowed to kill and execute anybody who'd

388
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
It makes

389
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
If you think

390
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Real

391
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,712
Not soft

392
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:19,552
What about if you think realsoft about it.

393
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,576
The optic

394
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,208
When is describing could easily exist in a capitalist country there is nothing that would be stopping that

395
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
At the core of the point that's being made is I don't like the bad and scary thing and then they're just naming that thing coming

396
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,144
When is Amore in Alex's case

397
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,424
Multaq martial law

398
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,824
They're basically just signifiers for like

399
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,384
The sign that had whatever on it doesn't matter

400
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,152
Yogurt

401
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,296
I think it's pretty bold of this documentary to start out with Owen complaining about

402
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Emma continues

403
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,088
But I do take it

404
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,696
Tacoma d.c.

405
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Fernanda

406
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Troy

407
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,816
Destroy monuments

408
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Destroyed

409
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
Bartender

410
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
Churches

411
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,984
And then when we come to town the group of people who have never burned

412
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,056
Never looted never ride it never done any criminal activity

413
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
They shut down the whole city

414
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,176
January 6th

415
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,456
We can't go into Park

416
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
But the last

417
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
Solution destroys they get full access all of it

418
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
They get to put their product Capital as follows

419
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,976
America loading Patriots come to town and they shut this city down so

420
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,280
Pretty pathetic in DC I'm not going to lie

421
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:37,120
Tell me he's talking he's talking about like the left destroying churches in like

422
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:43,520
Bright around this point I believe is when his buddy Enrique tarrio is spilling black lives matter Banner from

423
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Church and burning it

424
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,848
Yeah and getting arrested

425
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:50,176
So it should be proud boys

426
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,504
Pick are pictured in this documentary with Infowars personality

427
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,040
It's wall-to-wall

428
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
In the first 10 minutes alone Owen a scene with the head of the proud boys Enrique tarrio and Rob do as a chat with

429
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
Ahead of The Oath Keepers Stewart Road

430
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
Lumi calls brother

431
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
You know the wire had a lot of

432
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Former convict

433
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
In the show

434
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,472
It's interesting that this documentary has a lot of

435
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Future condo

436
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:18,336
And not presented as

437
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,128
Dicey weirdos

438
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:23,712
Stereo and Stewart Road

439
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:30,112
Is our leaders of groups or participated in organized planning prior to January 6th and stamp charges to dishes

440
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,208
Put their actions attempted to stop a certification to the 2020 election

441
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:40,352
I don't think any left-wing Grupo in can name has done anything close to that level of rioting

442
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
And the leaders of both of those groups are his

443
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:43,936
Friends

444
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:49,312
Yeah that's going to be tough to argue around calm the f*** down

445
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
These groups do all kinds of Street violence and destruction

446
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,480
Super inconvenient for the Infowars narrative so it's never happened before

447
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:59,808
Anytime a right-wing or militia group has done something it

448
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,832
Either been purely

449
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,440
Self defense against the left who actually the real problem

450
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:12,096
Reality has to be constructed this way because if you don't do this then you'd have to distance yourself from these groups and marginalized

451
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,656
The violent wing of the movement that you've constructed

452
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
How much would never do that because he needs these group

453
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:23,872
He needs them to continue to engage in Street violence and hostile intimidation and they need folks like him and Owen to Justice

454
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,152
The fire to their audiences

455
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,712
By pretending it's only the last that ever Act

456
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Text that way

457
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,784
And this is only considering the group

458
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,624
That are literally in this documentary and Friends of the subjects

459
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:40,256
You could Branson's up to all sorts of far more militant right-wing groups from the Patriot front caught up

460
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
Down the line

461
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
You and you'd wind up with the picture that the right has a substantially greater problem with organized rioting and violet

462
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,984
Worse than any leftist community

463
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,520
For the Specter of a

464
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,312
FIFA could ever be saddled with

465
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:57,152
Well what you're forgetting is the absolutely violent left

466
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,992
This group it came about whenever Crayola

467
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
Put

468
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
The the peach

469
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,600
Cran as

470
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,672
Skin tone antifa

471
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,304
Granteva yeah I'm going to I'm going to live with that one I'm going to call home that's by

472
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
My friends and family are going to know about that one

473
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,264
To change the mood I should tell you that there was a guy who was walking behind oh and it just point it was wearing the Trump flag as a shot

474
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,032
Fantastic

475
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
So

476
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,616
That's fine

477
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,712
Scott's 20 and being interviewed in a black

478
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Cowboy hat

479
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,784
In a hotel room

480
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,904
I don't know about we live in a great world

481
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
I don't know much

482
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,976
About cowboy hat sizing

483
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
But it feels too big

484
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,072
Stupid I'm not a neck

485
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
Expert

486
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,912
Chemically neutral

487
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Prospective you say

488
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,496
Can you sing covermade is corrupt

489
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Lights 90%

490
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
People are dying

491
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,592
Do you think

492
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
That mainstream media's

493
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Again

494
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Happy birthday

495
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
But green

496
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,248
Saddle you can convince people

497
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Chianti music

498
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,088
Otherwise Alex Jones will differ

499
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
Retired

500
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Retired

501
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
He would have said that the new thing that replaced the mainstream media was lying to them

502
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:46,208
If you got Miss wish in 2008 and Ron Paul have been elected president he would have done his whole deep State thing back then

503
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,768
Finding Traders everywhere in the Paul cabinet

504
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,400
I suspect the reason Owen laughed when he said Alex would have retired Longo's cuz he knows that's not true

505
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,168
Portable chair

506
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,240
Yeah you hear the music swelling there and because

507
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:03,872
This is the point in the documentary about 7 minutes and where we see present-day Alex for the first time

508
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
This is a choice

509
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
This is a hero shot

510
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:12,064
With the triumphant Crescendo and Alex being flanked by tons of people Marching In d.c.

511
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,672
This is a decision that boiler made as a director to introduce Alex this way

512
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,768
It's almost like he has arrived was like

513
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Let's put

514
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Patton in front of this giant American flag the director had trouble idea that that would make people think

515
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:30,752
Oh this is a patriotic mat

516
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,312
Yeah no clue

517
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
Yeah I would say

518
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
Not too great not great for

519
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,480
So this is Alex's second

520
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
The first was an intro to him as a

521
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Concept

522
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
With the clip

523
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,392
Of Alex from darkseeker

524
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,536
This is meant to instill the message that he's been talking about the same thing for his whole career and he's been prophetic about all this

525
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,304
Stop

526
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,608
The second doesn't enter to him as a person

527
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Evie exist

528
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,680
Hitman Vindicated

529
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
Leading agile

530
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,032
Crowd no longer the outskirt Outkast on the

531
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
The fringes of society

532
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,128
I have to stress this of these are filmmaking choices

533
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,224
This is how Blair wants the audience to see Alex as he's introduced

534
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,832
And that would be totally fine if this film question that presentation at any point

535
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
But it really doesn't

536
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
Right

537
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,160
This

538
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
His glorification

539
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,512
Right Right Alright problem

540
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,584
I mean it doesn't get more

541
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,144
How how do you live with

542
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,728
Yourself is a question that I've been asking a lot like

543
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,544
As I've watched shitball make argue

544
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:43,200
Forever now

545
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Wonders

546
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Who's at

547
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
How many times have I said there's no bottom

548
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
How many times

549
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
And yet I look at his brazenness and I think there's no way that's

550
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,816
You know and so with this kind of s*** it's such the same thing there's no

551
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Wait

552
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
This is real

553
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Yep we're living in fake town

554
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
It's a good thing you brought up something to head to do the trial because we

555
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:13,152
You will have a trial update on except

556
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,480
This documentary is

557
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
Today

558
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,808
So we have

559
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
Owen

560
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Introduced

561
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,136
Talkin we have Alex

562
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Triumphant

563
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Man

564
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,232
Leading a charge on the street

565
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,792
And then we get another character and that is

566
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,840
The man with the Kangol hat

567
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
Rob do I was hoping for Aragorn

568
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
Nobody has

569
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,008
You have to be able to

570
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
Adapt very quickly to Everton

571
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
I did an interview with couple guys

572
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,272
At one point is

573
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Infowars

574
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,136
They're like very kind of

575
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
Apologetic

576
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Annabelle

577
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
You going to crowd

578
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,656
I'll show you the most popular

579
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,448
He's the most

580
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
People know who I am

581
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
Bigger

582
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,432
More

583
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Fedex.com

584
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
How you get up

585
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
You're going to get moved on the field

586
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
And that's what he does

587
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,024
I think I was probably does carry the ball about 4 yards everyday but the problem is it for a really long time he's been

588
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,048
Not heading towards

589
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:38,656
The endzone he's been like going for yards toward the sideline of any changes Direct

590
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
Again

591
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,752
He's been out of bounds for a really long time is what I'm saying

592
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
Oh yeah Rob's metaphor is stupid

593
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,640
Answers Rob do himself shown here in his trademark Kangol hat

594
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,968
He got this job through Craigslist which is fun but invite

595
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,992
Experience most of the

596
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,320
The talent on Infowars get their job through winning a contest

597
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,392
Like Willy Wonka for bulshit

598
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
I guess

599
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:07,072
Behind the scenes folks are all just answered the wrong vaguely worded Craigslist ad that doesn't say Infowars on it so you can trick people

600
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,352
Belinda possibly working there

601
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:15,008
Cuz most people wouldn't do that you know my aunt was on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire did you know that damn I ever said that before

602
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
I didn't know that

603
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
To do the questioning part

604
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,408
But she did describe to me constantly the

605
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,200
Experience of like

606
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:27,040
Answering Who Wants To Be A Millionaire questions as the audition

607
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,368
I meant getting the audition and then so on and so forth

608
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,928
That was a more complex

609
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:38,304
And difficult process than becoming an Infowars

610
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,864
What I mean is

611
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,144
Is fun is they like

612
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,984
Rob do you got his job the same way I almost got

613
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,800
Scammed on a clerical opening

614
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,200
And I answered an ad for a histology lab assistant to my position

615
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
In 2009 and I'm still getting him right right right

616
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,952
Going to be my roommate but only if I sent him a couple thousand dollars because

617
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Is he needed

618
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,608
Money to move in with me and he couldn't afford it at the time but it when he got there he would have paid me twice

619
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,376
As much so

620
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
You know I almost thought about

621
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
But I don't think it was true

622
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:16,960
Probably not

623
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,008
So here's where Alex comes in in earnest

624
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
Speaking to the camera

625
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Laying out the

626
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
No no

627
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
Everything

628
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
That's the way the universe works

629
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:35,904
There are

630
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,184
Eating forces

631
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
That bar

632
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,744
Trying to dominate

633
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
And everything

634
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
The general public doesn't realize her under

635
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Cremation

636
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Operates

637
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
In the info

638
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
We call ourselves

639
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
He's a performance

640
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:09,696
So this is as close as you get to any kind of counter point being made at all is just a little little

641
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Slivers of

642
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
TV host

643
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,096
That Alex is like so look there's

644
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,888
War around information

645
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,936
That's how we got our name

646
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:20,960
Isn't that cute

647
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,288
Everything's it reminds me of the whole movies

648
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:28,384
The thing between Brendan and Coach mcguirk weighs like

649
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Everything is a prison

650
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,968
Brandon Brandon everything's a prison

651
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
School

652
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Prison

653
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
Our Lives

654
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Prison

655
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
Friends like this conversation

656
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
Prison

657
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:45,792
My buddy Ryan back and I started comedy together

658
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
Columbia and

659
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,728
Always remember is that I had to believe that LOL comedy is essentially an argument

660
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:59,872
Or a flight

661
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
So many good sketches kind of involved people having an argument

662
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Trying to make this point to Ryan

663
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:12,928
We ended up in an argument though Bike by pauses.

664
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,792
All you have to do is show them Monty Python

665
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
Dead bird sketch

666
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
And you're like this is,

667
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,120
That's what

668
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
Is tonight is the only sketch

669
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,472
Ever existed the only one

670
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,008
So these clips

671
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
The TV host

672
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,544
Continue

673
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,360
On his website Infowars

674
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:33,664
House what many would say our offense

675
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Paranoia for

676
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Somebody who's traffic

677
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,296
Some of the

678
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Tickets

679
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,624
Extensive

680
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
Clown

681
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
Animaniacs

682
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,472
Media person

683
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:03,872
Hundreds and hundreds

684
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
TV reports

685
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Every major

686
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
National program you

687
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,504
Publication

688
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:14,880
Your mom

689
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
That's when you're over the target

690
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah I mean this

691
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
This is

692
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:23,328
An ocean that is going on challenge that all of these people are making these criticisms of Alex

693
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,656
Because he's over the target when in reality most of those clips

694
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,192
That he played where people making

695
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,496
Accurate points about him

696
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
Yeah it's it's like

697
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:39,456
It's just that notion of like you know they laugh at you and then you're right you know that that goes at Gandhi

698
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:45,856
Laugh at you then they're like watch out for this dude and then they murder you or whatever

699
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:53,280
Sometimes people are saying that you suck and you're being an a******

700
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:59,680
Because you suck and you're an a****** Alex is sarcastically saying something that somebody else's

701
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,472
Said that's absolutely accurate

702
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
Oh Alex Jones is a racist and you like you can say it sarcastically but still Drew

703
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:11,712
It doesn't really affect my feeling or whether or not

704
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,504
Exist otherwise we all die too

705
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,040
Well

706
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,856
Alex has a thought on that

707
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:22,720
This was maybe my favorite part of the documentary

708
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,816
Fairly early are they show Alex behind

709
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
He's doing his show

710
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,912
Automatic goes to commercial

711
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
This is all

712
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,264
It's no 100%

713
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
This is so fake

714
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,104
Rockview comes running in

715
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:45,504
No Doubt

716
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Did I've ever seen

717
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
Galatians

718
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
BMO

719
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
It's the one by

720
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
Violence

721
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
Artifacts of protein

722
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
He's about to f***

723
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,848
What's that laughing

724
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:48,736
Well we got to go get them oh my God this mRNA

725
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,552
You're telling me a text protein only

726
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
You f****** s*** roll man

727
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Man

728
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
Wow Unsolved Mysteries is like

729
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
That is the

730
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:58,976
The greatest

731
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,024
Re-creation anyone's ever

732
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
It's a fun fantasy

733
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:09,984
Open unit even if it were real it's not productive and I don't see anything getting done

734
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,776
But there's no way I believe

735
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
That this happened

736
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,872
You know what I feel like I feel like watch this show as much as I have

737
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
He is

738
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,664
Like

739
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,504
Drinking or sweating during the breaks

740
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,904
Right he's not doing any like more information on these stories I'm about to rip about

741
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,304
I hate to bring this up because I don't have specifics and I don't remember names and I really don't even remember where it's from

742
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,352
However this documentary does

743
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,984
And it is one where the documentarian gets really close with a bunch of people who committed genocide

744
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,544
And then later over time he gets so close

745
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,896
But eventually the people who committed that genocide agree to reenact

746
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
The genocide they committed on film

747
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Right

748
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
That is what this documentary should be not like

749
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,880
Have you ever considered genocide is awesome

750
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,184
What about that

751
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,744
Yeah there's some editorial choices that I take some

752
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,560
Serious issues with

753
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:12,960
The revision of Rob do running and it's so f****** funny is yelling at me another name of that.

754
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
No I'm not

755
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,288
I don't remember either exactly

756
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
So I

757
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:19,872
I take some issue with this

758
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Alex

759
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,712
Start discussing his earlier years now this is the

760
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,248
The portrait of a man

761
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,088
He brings up some of his reading history

762
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
And I think that this is actually like

763
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
Fairly accurate at the end

764
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:34,720
The river

765
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Where we jumped it before

766
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
You recognize Where You Are

767
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
High School

768
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,568
Osborn a small town

769
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
Reading comic book store

770
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
678 years old

771
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,511
What's fun but as soon as I was reading Julius Caesar

772
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
It was like this

773
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,655
What is Julius Caesar

774
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
When was everything from

775
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
All formed

776
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,919
Keep didn't know what it meant

777
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,711
He just kept looking at it

778
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
This is Alex's work process

779
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,111
Yeah you know what I mean I don't think there is a more real

780
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:37,183
Sort of explanation of Alex's information base then

781
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,487
I read science fiction and comic books

782
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
And I really love them

783
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,071
And then I saw smarter books and I stared at the

784
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,911
So I skimmed them

785
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,215
And then I pretended this is

786
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983
You know

787
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:56,383
Reading it is very similar to what I did I read the Sandman comics and then I look

788
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
Looks at hieroglyphic

789
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,455
Fixing I was like well clearly I understand them now

790
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,295
Listen to that album by hieroglyphics

791
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:08,159
They now know how to read that

792
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
OVO amazing

793
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
I can't remember any other members

794
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,399
Anyway Alex had some more books that he read

795
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
There's a fee

796
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,287
I got really stuck

797
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
I totaled or the death's-head

798
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
That twice

799
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Kissinger

800
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,135
Timeline

801
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
Encyclopedia

802
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
The occult

803
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Cover to cover

804
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
12

805
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
By Gary Allan

806
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Pretty much accurate

807
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:59,615
So you may notice that Alexandra really like books about World War I books

808
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,407
You probably think about that

809
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:05,247
More importantly he's very clear here that he read none dare call it

810
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:08,319
Conspiracy at age 12 which he knew was accurate

811
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:12,159
Because he'd already read all this other material which raises the question

812
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
What other material

813
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:17,535
He was a child reading all these history books it didn't actually understand

814
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,679
He was skimming s*** and then he read none dare and decided this comported with his studied worldview so it must be true

815
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
I would suggest this is all bulshit

816
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:30,847
And the reality is that none dare resonated with Alex because he was brought up in an insane John Birch

817
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
Society household

818
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:36,735
In the book Matched up with what his dad had taught him was true when he was much younger

819
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,831
Another important point to bring up yours that Alex is saying that he read that book

820
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
12

821
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,463
He definitely didn't read Carroll Quigley tragedy and hope before that point

822
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,839
Which is why he approaches quickly book solely through the lens that he internalized from none dare call it conspiracy

823
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,215
You'd already consumed the John Birch Society propaganda prior to seeing the actual book

824
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,799
And I strongly suspect that he's never actually even read tragedy and Hope

825
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
It's really long long we talked about it extensively and that's longer than the amount of time he's attempted to

826
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,551
I do believe that he's read compulsively about Nazis will say this

827
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
I will say this

828
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
In that clip

829
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,647
If you'll

830
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
The only person

831
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
Read the only author whose work he's red

832
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
Who has not

833
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:29,727
Been party to or actively committed a genocide was none dare call it a conspiracy

834
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:36,895
I mean I think that Gary Allan was pretty in support of Apartheid

835
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,735
Have the power to do it you know like haeringer

836
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:45,599
Genocide Hitler the road

837
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,927
Vision government's rule true but nobody was like

838
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,767
Let's make him an international sex symbol for no reason

839
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
Do you know what I'm saying

840
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,607
Yeah that's true I'll give you that much

841
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
So

842
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,399
Alex

843
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,167
Like he just read the

844
00:45:59,423 --> 00:45:59,935
These books got

845
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,959
Got this

846
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983

Expanding

848
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,871
People in his life who helped them peek behind the curtain

849
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,831
Stuff without a central South America after

850
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
Vietnam

851
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:29,119
I actually think that is true I think his uncle was now I don't I don't think I don't think you're wrong that's what he's funny about it

852
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,143
Yeah

853
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
My mom that had friends that were

854
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
San Francisco

855
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,799

856
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615

857
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,175
My dad and Friends

858
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
Cashless Society the plan to bring up the

859
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,575
Family at all this

860
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
Grew up seeing autumn

861
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:54,463
Behind the scenes

862
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,047
You could refute this clip by confronting Alex with his own words

863
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,119
Or with other pieces of information that are publicly available

864
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:06,495
For instance you could say that Alex's dad didn't have a friend that was in the John Birch Society

865
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,103
His daddy been a member himself since College in a given speeches at JBS events

866
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:15,967
It wasn't background noise that was the operatic score of his childhood

867
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:20,831
Or you could bring up various versions of this stuff that he's pulled on his show over the years

868
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,159
Like what his dad actually a CIA dentists

869
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,255
What about the part where his dad was the smartest boy in Texas in the global

870
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,303
Just tried to recruit him into their depopulation

871
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,095
Conspiracy when he was 18

872
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:38,751
These are things that I was bringing up in this documentary because this is a forum where he's kind of wanting to be taken seriously and that's

873
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Sound like a guys making s*** up all the time

874
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
Because he knows that there's a

875
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
The chance that people who don't

876
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
Already like him will listen or watch room

877
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:51,807
Of these book

878
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:56,159
Books from the John Birch Society and also John Williams wrote The Imperial March

879
00:47:56,415 --> 00:48:02,559
For the John Birch Society and I read all the science fiction books that I should have blurred with his number of society books

880
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:08,703
Just turned it all into

881
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,519
Some people would say

882
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
So Alex gets further into his life

883
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Those younger life

884
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
And there's there's just

885
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Straight up

Shelbyville drugs

903
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,879
Because

904
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
It doesn't sound real

905
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,183
I bet it was

906
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,999
Alex tells that story all the f****** Spotify

907
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:10,399
He's one of the very few stories about his younger years that he tells constantly in mainstream Outlets because it allows him to protect himself is

908
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
Somebody who

909
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:12,447
Sniffing out corruption

910
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
From the youngest of Ages

911
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
Here's the thing though

912
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:22,687
On his show he tells stories about the super-rich people all worshipping the devil and then trying to lure him to join

913
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:26,015
Them in Satanism by offering him sex with their daughter

914
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:31,391
There was a real serious devil worshipping problem in Rockwall that Alex was on the wrong side of

915
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:36,767
They wanted to recruit him desperately because Satan had communicated to them that I was going to be very important

916
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,047
Forgot the plans in the future

917
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,911
We notice from Alex is telling of his Youth and this raises an important question was that

918
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
Did Alex tell the documentary crew this

919
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:51,871
If he did that it's safe to assume that he was self-censoring because he knew that if he said that s*** he would look like a lunatic

920
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,735
He did say that stuff and we're decided not to include it

921
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:02,623
That means that she's censoring her own subject to protect him from appeared to be as insane as he actually is

922
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:08,255
I can see it going either way but the fact that this aspect of our to self mythology isn't the dress deer is it

923
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Itself inactive

924
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,047
Censorship

925
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,655
Obscuring the reality that Alex creates absurd fantasy stories about himself

926
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,471
To satisfy his narcissism and amuse his audience

927
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,775
Keep them impressed with his exploits

928
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:21,055
Write this b*******

929
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:25,919
Alex's story if you allow that

930
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:30,015
To stand right question it is somewhat

931
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,087
The central problem of our era

932
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,391
With Alex Jones which is that

933
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
The we can get the

934
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Distracted by the effect

935
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
We can get distracted by the

936
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Cause

937
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
We can get distracted by the effect

938
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,143
Before the cause that led to the effect

939
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
But the reality is that the

940
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
Cause before all three of those

941
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,335
Please everyone involved is insane and we're all wasting our time with the others

942
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,431
If that makes sense to you it does I mean like

943
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,711
Yeah it's

944
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,551
It doesn't not resonate it's convoluted sure it's not great

945
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:04,319
Yeah

946
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,879
But I would still some more stories about his younger days

947
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:10,975
He's also hit very familiar themes that we've heard before

948
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,999
Dallas Cowboys

949
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Fight

950
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,863
Extremely vile

951
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,399
Extremely Loud

952
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
Shot

953
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,031
Travels

954
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,895
Cars

955
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,919
Change the movie

956
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,735
Episode Alice was crazy

957
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:39,391
Rebel Without a Cause

958
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,463
You better learn to kick some ass

959
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
Fighting

960
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,447
I got quite a few times

961
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,727
I would support judges

962
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,287
Hospital

963
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
Dinnerly bad

964
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
And those words

965
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
Because

966
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,159
Victim

967
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:20,095
Wright also doesn't match various versions of Alex's violent fighting years that we've heard from various

968
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
Sources including Alex himself

969
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,727
For one thing Alex's story has always been that he uncovered a conspiracy

970
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:29,311
A secret drug-dealing gang within the Rockwall Police Department

971
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:31,103
And because of that the cops threatened

972
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,895
Kill Alex if he didn't leave town

973
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:37,759
This is why is dad moved them to Austin according to his consistent telling of it in the past

974
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
Why so different now

975
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,463
Possibly because his other stories completely absurd and no one outside of his audience would ever believe it for a second

976
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:51,839
Possibly because Alex knows that this documentary is meant to region ton indoctrinated audience

977
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,167
It'll be bad for business if he scared them off of his normal bulshit

978
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:01,055
Allowing that to stand on question is not up to the job of making this documentary

979
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,431
Either through negligence or biased she's allowing Alex to contradict himself and not address

980
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
That's bad filmmaking it's bad storytelling and because the audience isn't made aware of this glaring credibility problem

981
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,111
Alex has

982
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:17,951
It's an act of sanitizing and presenting Alex inaccurate

983
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:20,255
And it's dangerous because the audience

984
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
It could be

985
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:23,327
Susceptible to that can you imagine

986
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,631
If in the Glenn Greenwald

987
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,911
Qna Glenn was like

988
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
Alex

989
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,239
Tell us about the time that you was a

990
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,263
The fifteen-year-old

991
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,823
Uncovered a drug-dealing ring

992
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,895
Within the police department of your hometown

993
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:43,295
Tell us more about that in the documentary

994
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:49,695
What are the greatest stories I think I've ever heard and it's a part of your whole knitology about being a guy who's not afraid to stay

995
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:56,095
Stand up to power at a young age

996
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
That's what

997
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,703
Turn him onto the idea that power is corrupt and all this stuff yep

998
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,519
And now you just left Rockwall cuz he got in a few fights

999
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,567
The f*** is going on here

1000
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:10,943
Also Alex Memorial probably should have asked Alex about all the people he claims to have killed

1001
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
Couldn't hurt to ask about how he constantly talks on air about how is mostly black people attacking him when he was younger because he was white

1002
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:22,207
Any of this stuff would be super relevant to presenting Alex accurately because

1003
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:25,279
The awareness that he constantly lies about himself

1004
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:30,911
Is very relevant to a documentary where the main source of information about Alex is Alex himself

1005
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:34,751
By not addressing his credit a credibility problem in any way

1006
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,823
Alex is allowed to be seen as a credible narrator

1007
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
Which is a choice

1008
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,127
That motor is making

1009
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,663
How about how she directed the film

1010
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,199
Maybe because

1011
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,295
She wants to lie for Alex or maybe because it's easier maybe she's lazy

1012
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,855
I'm surprised they didn't have the quote where Alex says

1013
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
Is that no black person has ever

1014
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,975
Experience racism from white people more

1015
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Then he is

1016
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
Experience racism from black people

1017
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,095
Surprised that didn't make it to the

1018
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
To the documentary that one seems really

1019
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,703
Like foundational you know these dreams

1020
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
Dissonant depictions of his younger years may seem like water.

1021
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,919
Down versions of the stories he always tells right

1022
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
Kind of mint

1023
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:21,599
Trick people into thinking that he does not have complete bulshit artist maybe you can listen to him and it's not

1024
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:26,463
Not really is not really as insane as people say it is currently this

1025
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:31,071
Documentary feels like a massage for Alex with a happy ending

1026
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,935
I think I'm putting it delicately and and mildly

1027
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
Far more than that it

1028
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,007
It's filthy

1029
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:45,407
It's the first time I've been mild to you it's like it's like a month at a hedonistic swingers real

1030
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:49,247
Resort

1031
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,575
Fehlig unfailing you god dammit

1032
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,415
Oh no

1033
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:00,511
Goddamnit Bohemian Grove

1034
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,327
So Alex Goes To Georgia cuz he was looking

1035
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,423
How it went down to Georgia looking for an election to see you

1036
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:13,823
So when he went he went to Georgia I wasn't on his regular show

1037
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,407
And water things that happened was he went to the Olympic rings statue

1038
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,991
Shoot a little video about it all out

1039
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
Downtown Atlanta Georgia

1040
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
Sandra

1041
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Bye

1042
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,679
Hitler absolutely did not design the Olympic rings

1043
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:44,031
They were designed in June 1914 by a French dude named Baron

1044
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,311
Pierre de coubertin

1045
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:51,967
The reason Alex is confused is because Leni Riefenstahl made a documentary about the 1936 Olympics that involve going

1046
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:56,831
Going through Greece and making a prop that look like an ancient object resembling the ring Sim

1047
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:02,207
It's 1984 Robert Barney Sports historian found it

1048
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,279
They mistook it for an actual Olympics

1049
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,839
Symbol not knowing it was a Nazi propaganda film

1050
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:15,007
So the association with the design and the Nazis of the product of one mistake and sports historian

1051
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,031
Propaganda film

1052
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,335
I'm willing to bet that Alex got it from the ladder

1053
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,615
Pienso Que

1054
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
Kind of just making up the part about Hitler designer

1055
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
That's

1056
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:24,223
Silly

1057
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
I'm sorry but

1058
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,271
If I told you

1059
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,087
Third degree of the Olympic side would you agree

1060
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,671
Also I believe that that Olympic

1061
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:39,071
People is there because of the bombing of the Atlanta Olympics

1062
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:45,727
So I also not a documentary about the Atlanta bombing

1063
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,007
Of a relatively

1064
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,079
Long f****** movie too long

1065
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,895
Yeah so this is my second favorite part of the documentary

1066
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,223
I'll explain the guy on the street front-loaded it

1067
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
They might

1068
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
So

1069
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,623
Guy on the street outside the Olympic rings

1070
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
And

1071
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:08,255
This guy is chill as hell he seems pretty cool and Alex tries to

1072
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,559
I don't know what point you're trying to make here

1073
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
You don't hear yet

1074
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
But we've

1075
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,487
Okay make it answer

1076
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
Everything holder

1077
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
Good

1078
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,911
It's hard to assess what Alex wants to say but based on the words he's using I think I get it

1079
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,983
He's arguing that Hitler designed as a logo but it doesn't

1080
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:27,615
Stanford Nazism so even though it has a bad history it's now good so we shouldn't tear it down

1081
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:34,015
This is actually him talking about the statues of Confederate generals the people wanted to take down but he's making a convoluted

1082
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Good point

1083
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
1

1084
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
He doesn't think the Confederacy was bad

1085
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
So the history of those statues isn't bad

1086
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Alex

1087
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,863
In what way is something like a Confederate generals statue become a symbol of something good where is in the past

1088
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,887
It was bad

1089
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,911
I don't know how like

1090
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,447
Bedford Forrest

1091
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,007
Has now become a symbol of something good

1092
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,799
Well well well

1093
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
Burnside

1094
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,383
Now we got sideburns

1095
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
Confederate general

1096
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,527
No idea but I'm going for okay I don't know if you want I don't remember

1097
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
Ambrose Burnside suicide he was on

1098
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,623
I'm going for it

1099
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:14,207
Also third problem Hitler didn't design you

1100
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:20,095
That's really the Big Brother favorite my favorite part of that clip is just the

1101
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:20,863
Cleat

1102
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,399
And perfect logic

1103
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,703
Of the person responding to it where it's like

1104
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,239
Hitler design this flag

1105
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,007
Sweet

1106
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
Bad flag let's get rid of

1107
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,359
Oh we taking it back and now it's a good thing

1108
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Sweet

1109
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:35,967
That's awesome it's a good thing let's keep it up so you don't want to keep it

1110
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,503
Man I'm confused

1111
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,783
Figure your s*** out

1112
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,599
Okay

1113
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,719
Goodnight

1114
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
You don't like

1115
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:51,071
You also want to keep it man figure your s*** out and then

1116
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,887
Come back to me

1117
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:59,775
Volkswagen was founded by the German Labour front which was a Nazi organization back in 1937

1118
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:06,175
The existing labor unions have been raided their leaders killed and they were taken over by Nazi groups and belabor front began

1119
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:12,831
Hitler absolutely did not design the first Volkswagen cars although he may have made some suggestions as to

1120
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,855
Little design features

1121
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:17,439
I don't care who designed the logo because you know he has that artist

1122
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,719
The past and also

1123
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,535
The original design is way different than it looks now

1124
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:25,375
It's a notably missing be lines around it that look like a swastika

1125
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,935
Swastika.

1126
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,519
So it's hard to say if Hitler invented highways

1127
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
Because I don't know what Alex means by Highway

1128
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,919
Using some definitions if a really stupid client that Alex is making

1129
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:43,039
Like there were highways like the ones we understand that predate Nazi Germany so that point doesn't stand

1130
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:47,135
I think I was just misunderstanding that Hitler was involved

1131
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,183
With the construction of the Autobahn

1132
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,975
Hitler created the Pony Express

1133
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
That's what your middle or invented mail

1134
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
Cool

1135
01:01:55,327 --> 01:02:00,191
Maybe I should have done a better job of reading all those Nazi books he loved his kid

1136
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,847
Superbad

1137
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
So Allie Alexander is here in Georgia

1138
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,159
Holly Alexander in a movie

1139
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:26,559
Purporting to be positive or they'll kind of have to because he was a big part of Alex's trip to Georgia

1140
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
Troy.

1141
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,679
So you're going to include Georgia at all it's going to be hard.

1142
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,751
Well olly Alexander

1143
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,055
Coordinator

1144
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
Stop steel movement

1145
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,151
Together

1146
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:42,943
Critical juncture

1147
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,503
Tell folks all over doing

1148
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
High Noon

1149
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
At the Georgia state capitol Alex

1150
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Patriots

1151
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,463
A marching and we're telling

1152
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Stop

1153
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,535
Certify

1154
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,327
Kind of like you did

1155
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,095
236

1156
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:04,191
Yeah stop doing certified

1157
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,471
2 affidavit

1158
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:10,591
So while they're in the Statehouse they are in Georgia

1159
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,383
Somebody else who's along

1160
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,407
With

1161
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,175
Alex

1162
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
And Allie

1163
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,223
Has an idea

1164
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,575
And that is essentially like 8 we're already inside let's just not leave

1165
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:25,183
Aan idea that his

1166
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,463
Has never been tried

1167
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,863
Before a protest history

1168
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,215
Is it ever happens it's a peaceful noncompliance

1169
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,007
Here's the valley has to say

1170
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,407
We're inside

1171
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
Let's not leave

1172
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
Listen to me.

1173
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
Jacob all the ideas

1174
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
Decide to fly

1175
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,375
Listen to me

1176
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
Stop Steel

1177
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
Official GameStop certification

1178
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,823
I'm just talking out loud

1179
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,063
Fascinating for two reasons

1180
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:29,183
The first is that what Ally is saying is that you don't get a say in what the plan is

1181
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,255
He's the brains of you hillbillies are the bodies

1182
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:35,327
This isn't the life there's no democratization of ideas

1183
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:39,423
It's a hierarchical system or Ally calls the shots and you follow

1184
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,447
That sucks

1185
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:45,311
And I can't believe that didn't piss this guy off and it's funny to watch Alex try to smooth things over

1186
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,335
I mean

1187
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
You know

1188
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,151
It just doesn't get better than being like

1189
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:52,991
If we let the hillbilly set the rules we're going to lose

1190
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
Is the country I don't know if

1191
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
If you know

1192
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:56,831
Cool

1193
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:57,855
Dior

1194
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:04,511
Leading no but that's a lie I hear he's an elitist with that like

1195
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:09,375
Better than all of those people very people that he pretends

1196
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:14,495
He's supporting overalls are slightly cleaner obviously I'm of higher status

1197
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,543
Second thing

1198
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:21,919
So weird that is documentary really tries not to point out that Nick Fuentes is right there with Alex and Ali

1199
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:26,271
No Spotlight on the Holocaust denier buddy that you brought along to Georgia

1200
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:30,367
No shout-out for him no scream time let's just pretend he's not there

1201
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,951
That's another editorial choice that motor is making

1202
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:37,791
Because recognizing that Fuentes was traveling with Ally and Alex

1203
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:40,095
Is way too much for this documentary driving

1204
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,655
Explain tween on indoctrinated audio

1205
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:47,775
It's inconvenient to the portrait of Alex's it's just ignored

1206
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:53,663
Be at the little baby Nazi isn't there

1207
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,015
Explain to me how they could fit that in in a 7000 hour documentary

1208
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:02,111
There's no way there's no way you just it said look

1209
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
Even Avengers had to cut

1210
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,303
Some stuff yeah I know you know what you do make a good point because they needed to fit in important things like this from Florida

1211
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
Bucket list

1212
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,711
You got five kids that says you shouldn't have any

1213
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Oxy Udonis

1214
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:37,183
He peed on the Georgia Guidestones would not be happy with that

1215
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,511
Alexandra pissed on the Georgia Guidestones

1216
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,583
Oh my God

1217
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,375
Of course

1218
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:52,287
Alex's urine mixed things explode

1219
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:58,175
We don't have evidence that somebody else blew it up but we do have evidence

1220
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,199
Alex

1221
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:02,271
Heat on it I believe there was a car that they sell.

1222
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
Alright

1223
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:07,903
Alright so your point is fair maybe someone else just ignited

1224
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,951
Exactly. Then accelerate

1225
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:15,327
He tried to smoke a cigarette a little bit too close went up big night the night before

1226
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
Bottle whiskey

1227
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:20,959
Alex Reeves from the side one of the

1228
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,983
Guidestones

1229
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519
This is in a foreign language

1230
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,567
This probably isn't defensive

1231
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,847
I mean it is

1232
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,895
What

1233
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:34,015
I don't actually know who he's trying to offend

1234
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,415
You're right

1235
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
My mom

1236
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,447
Tupac Makaveli

1237
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:10,367
Their plan is called the Great reset

1238
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
Operation

1239
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
Agenda

1240
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
20

1241
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
Public um playing

1242
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,071
In the name of world peace of stopping hunger

1243
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,863
Practice shutdown the world economy

1244
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,655
And will cause massive

1245
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Depopulation

1246
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
This is

1247
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
The most

1248
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
Dart

1249
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,031
Savannah Cardiology

1250
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
Ever B

1251
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,967
Here's an interesting question of a documentary filmmaker could have asked

1252
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:42,879
Hey you're saying this agenda 2030 thing is the blueprint for how the globalists are going to kill everyone but isn't that exactly what you

1253
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,439
You said for like the last 20 years about Agenda 21

1254
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:51,071
Is it possible that the whole thing was b******* and then in 2021 you know Agenda 21

1255
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:55,167
I came around you needed a new thing to pretend was the plan to kill everyone

1256
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:59,519
Inquiring minds journalism all of that I mean I guess you could just say

1257
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:04,127
Alexei all this s*** unquestioned event agenda21 never

1258
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,663
Comes up that's another option

1259
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,711
Yeah well I do feel like

1260
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,735
The direct

1261
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,015
You can get away with this

1262
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,551
Mainly because

1263
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,599
The first

1264
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,135
Peoples that I

1265
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,671
Think should be offended by Alex

1266
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,439
His impression

1267
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
Are All Star Trek aliens

1268
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
And then we get to regular human people

1269
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:27,935
Do you know like there's a bunch of different alien races in Star Trek that would listen to that and be like

1270
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,519
This is unacceptable Behavior we got to get to Captain

1271
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,311
Singkarak we got to deal with this quick

1272
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,335
Because

1273
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,359
Is this is f***** up

1274
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:38,687
Yeah I don't I don't know I don't know what Alex was on there

1275
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
About but

1276
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,991
Don't

1277
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Not good

1278
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,783
Not good

1279
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,135
Alex gets into talking now but his early media days

1280
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,439
Embark on another flashback

1281
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
And

1282
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
Here's some bolts

1283
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,023
And it was very classical liberal

1284
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,351
By that I didn't know if I was Republican or Democrat

1285
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,167
Things I liked about both parties

1286
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,727
The average real liberal

1287
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,799
Like new law health food and was anti-war

1288
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,127
What's free speech and seemed really inform it cool

1289
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:12,479
For a while I want that job

1290
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,087
What's the temperature

1291
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,695
TV

1292
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,255
They're like rock and roll shows

1293
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
What Christian shows like

1294
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,119
Old ladies doing exercise shows it was and it was everything

1295
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
Like we don't care what your speech

1296
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,447
10

1297
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
I saw it was local poker

1298
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,055
They were talking about New World Order

1299
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,591
World government

1300
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:46,783
So some people might think it's shity for you to bring up that abortions

1301
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,903
I hope they don't accept that attract what I would say to that

1302
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:57,535
It doesn't come up Alex doesn't bring it up normally I would say personal business

1303
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:02,143
Whatever no big deal listening to Alex that he is presented that as a

1304
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
A pivotal moment in his life

1305
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:10,079
Yep when he realized he needed to get his s*** together and fight the globalists after his dad told him stop killing my grandkids so

1306
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:13,663
That should be a moment that is a

1307
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
Impactful enough nature

1308
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,015
That it should come up in the retelling of his

1309
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:18,783
His wife

1310
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:24,671
They're based on the details that he's given here and it doesn't it's suspicious enough that you are going to argue

1311
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:29,791
Do to me that a man can tell the same story for 20 years about his Origins

1312
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
About abortion and s***

1313
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:33,119
And then gets

1314
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,471
To go into a documentary and just to Omit that as though it never happened

1315
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,519
And that he doesn't have to deal with it

1316
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
Then

1317
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:42,079
We don't get

1318
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:42,847
To talk anymore

1319
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
Weird

1320
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:50,015
So it wasn't the classical liberal any he didn't have like he liked the life when he was

1321
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:53,343
Younger

1322
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:57,183
And if he had complaints about the right-wing they weren't far right in

1323
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:04,351
This documentary is allowing Alex to present himself this way on question because it doesn't work for their purposes to treat him

1324
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,143
Extreme right-wing ideologue

1325
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,679
From early on in life

1326
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:13,055
It's far more attractive to presentable somewhere that's kind of in the middle and licked all sorts of political ideas pretty

1327
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,847
Who's driven towards the right by the

1328
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,943
Stream fanatic on the left or no longer Free Speech they don't like health food

1329
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,735
Above the left-right paradigm

1330
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:27,135
This is a decision that boiler is making because she wants to make her subject more attractive to a non-exclusively

1331
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,671
Extreme right-wing audio

1332
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:31,231
It's a deception by omission

1333
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,535
And allowing Alex 2% things on

1334
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Challenge

1335
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,887
I mean look here's the here's the bottom line 2

1336
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,679
She has every right to do that

1337
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:44,287
If you want to make a documentary that is a puff piece nonsense b*******

1338
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,823
Indoctrination

1339
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,407
Whitewashing and sanitization

1340
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:52,479
Of Alex Jones

1341
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,783
But I'm not going to put up with it for a f****** second

1342
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,063
Right that's fine

1343
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
I can do this

1344
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,647
Go to pretend that this is some kind of a like

1345
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,927
Middle-of-the-road on

1346
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,719
Just let him tell his story thing

1347
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Is nonsense

1348
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,279
Right now

1349
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,559
I agree with

1350
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,863
But honestly stip

1351
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:09,887
Bulate that

1352
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,703
She can do this in the world that we live in now

1353
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
And not one that is good

1354
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:21,151
And well we don't need to argue about what the limits of good or bad are on

1355
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,431
Feature etcetera

1356
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
I think we can both agree that

1357
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,759
This is bad

1358
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,295
Sylveon

1359
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,319
Yeah yeah

1360
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:34,975
You're going to see it you see here another editorial choice that I think is really glaring and that is the swelling music accompanying

1361
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,815
Alex's decision to get into covering conspiracy theories on the New World Order

1362
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,935
You can hear the feelings it's intended to to be a laid there

1363
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,239
The clouds are parting and Alex sees his

1364
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,007
Half

1365
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:50,079
That's not something that's being conveyed by Alex's words

1366
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:55,455
It's being stressed by the musical choices and directorial decisions that Moyer is making

1367
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,015
Because that's how she wants the audience to see Alex

1368
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:04,671
There is a moment in a new hope that I hope every single human being on this planet remembers where

1369
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,695
Luke Skywalker

1370
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:12,095
Is on Tatooine and he looks at the two suns setting and the swelling John Williams music play

1371
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,887
Plays to a point that

1372
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,471
If you're not inspired by It Go fuc yourself

1373
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,007
That is what she's trying to do here

1374
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
Alex is not Luke Skywalker

1375
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:26,943
Also based on your misspeaking I just thought of a socialist Star Wars characters Luke Skywalker

1376
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:33,087
Somebody who else has a bit of a worker comes in now

1377
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
He's a former friend of Alex

1378
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
I guess they're still fresh

1379
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Pecos Way Back

1380
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,743
We are descendants from Davy Crockett

1381
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,559
This is myself in my wife

1382
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,119
And if you go all the way over

1383
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,447
My 4th great-grandfather was

1384
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
Nathan

1385
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:50,751
Ethan Crockett which is

1386
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,287
Is the brother of Davy Crockett

1387
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,871
In my 5th great-grandfather was his father

1388
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
Man lot of Davy Crockett

1389
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,711
Who is Mike Hansen

1390
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,551
Very few non-current Infowars employees who's allowed to

1391
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,831
Speak in this documentary

1392
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:10,207
He was Alex's original cameraman way back and was a long for their fake infiltration of Bohemian Grove

1393
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,303
There's a reason he's included as a talking head in this film and other folks

1394
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,839
Art and that's because Alex

1395
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
It's still

1396
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
Very beloved

1397
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,935
To Mike Anthony loves Alex

1398
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:22,239
He has a huge room full of

1399
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:26,847
Pictures of Alex and archives of all their stuff including the shirt and shoes that he wore

1400
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:28,383
When they went into the Grove

1401
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:35,295
Full disclosure I want those tapes that he has but the difference is that I want to create an archive of Alex's career that could be used by Reese

1402
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,855
Deconstruct Alex's body of work

1403
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,415
Mike has a giant shrine

1404
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:46,559
Priebe know it in a Bill and Ted situation

1405
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,911
You are George Carlin coming back from a perfect Society being like okay

1406
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
If I get this s***

1407
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,495
And take it back to the future

1408
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:57,055
Then we will have a successful world

1409
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:03,967
So Mike is in the spelling because he's a voice that can say that Alex is not only great now he's always been great and I would

1410
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,247
No because I was there

1411
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:11,391
Including this voice and not other voices of people who were there and are now critical of Alex's an editorial choice

1412
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,159
On Moyers

1413
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
Part

1414
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:19,327
She doesn't speak to other people who are there when they went to the Grove like Jon Ronson or Alex's ex-wife who didn't go into the Grove

1415
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,119
With them but was along for the trip

1416
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,191
The selection of voices that are allowed in this film

1417
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:26,751
Is curated to create a particular image of Alex

1418
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:30,847
And people who are actually critical of him and know it would threaten that image

1419
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
So they don't take

1420
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
And that

1421
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Is her choice

1422
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
Yep

1423
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,551
Clips of Alex from early early on in his life

1424
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,415
And this one is weird I don't know this is a weird thing to keep in

1425
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:46,463
Yeah it's Alex Jones baby

1426
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,279
Serious

1427
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303
Today

1428
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,839
We're talking about how they got us

1429
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,607
The body

1430
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
Bobby Front Page News at Fuzzy's

1431
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,191
Seller said something race

1432
01:16:56,703 --> 01:16:57,727
Even though he's an old

1433
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:58,751
Fat rice

1434
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:00,543
Who cares about old fat race

1435
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,823
Something about an awesome

1436
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,591
Man

1437
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
Asian

1438
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
African American

1439
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,663
He's worth probably hundred million dollars

1440
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,735
American

1441
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,271
Bro

1442
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:17,439
Strange disease earliest video of Alex's minimizing racism

1443
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,463
Hey

1444
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,255
Who Among Us

1445
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,791
Cannot go back in

1446
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
In time

1447
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:23,839
20 years

1448
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,143
And say to themselves that yes

1449
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,495
This is a country divided and it should be okay to be racist towards tigerwood

1450
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,031
Who Among Us

1451
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Right

1452
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:33,823
This is

1453
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,663
Years before Obama allowed us to be racist towards the president

1454
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:44,319
So it's so weird to look like oh 1997 was Alex doing saying racism is not a problem

1455
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,415
The country is divided 1997

1456
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,463
I don't know if anybody's ever heard that

1457
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
Sure

1458
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,535
Right now

1459
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:58,399
We're here at the Alfred

1460
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,679
4 p.m. building

1461
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
In Oklahoma City

1462
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:01,727
The site

1463
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
April 19th

1464
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,031
1995

1465
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,055
Bombing

1466
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,591
And there's a lot question

1467
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
A lot of fun and

1468
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Answer questions

1469
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,455
Like why is the media ignored

1470
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
Seismograph

1471
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,551
Report from the University of Oklahoma

1472
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
Logical survey that show

1473
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Two distinct

1474
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,367
Explosion pack

1475
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:20,159
Why have they ignored

1476
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:23,999
The first one reports people on the ground as what

1477
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,815
And I'm not sitting here claiming to have the answers

1478
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
But I know this

1479
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,375
They don't want you to know

1480
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,655
They're keeping something

1481
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,423
From you

1482
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,983
They've done at 8

1483
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,263
Intimidation of witnesses

1484
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,543
The covering up evidence

1485
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,383
This is Charity at work

1486
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,663
One way or another

1487
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
Either

1488
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,967
Exploding this terrible tragedy

1489
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,551
Or they were actively engaged in

1490
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
Yes

1491
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
Federal

1492
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:56,255
This clip is just Alex being Alex man he's got a conclusion and he's going to accept whatever have cooked pieces of information you can find

1493
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Find a justifier

1494
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:03,935
We talked about how the two explosions and seismograph thing is bulshit back on an episode about Bill Cooper so I'm not going to get into it here book

1495
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:05,215
Working with Alex's doing

1496
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:11,871
He's got an inaccurate piece of information he doesn't fully understand and he's using that lack of knowledge on his part to insist there

1497
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
Must be a

1498
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Conspiracy

1499
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,943
Because of this inquiry

1500
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
Direct information there to possibility

1501
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:21,087
Either the government did this or they're covering up who did because they let it happen

1502
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,647
There isn't a third possibility to him

1503
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,439
Never considers it mats

1504
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:29,535
There's almost always the correct one that's what he doesn't know what he's talking about and he's wrong

1505
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,351
Yeah this is the same s*** with this Sandy Hooks.

1506
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,703
Hold it was based on incorrect information that he decided to accept his true

1507
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:41,311
So he could claim there were anomalies with the shooting that would justify him calling it a false flag

1508
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:43,615
You can pretend that the government has used in mass shootings

1509
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,383
Pushkin

1510
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
Control

1511
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:48,223
He's kind of a one-trick pony and that one trick is being wrong

1512
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,247
Yeah

1513
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:52,831
Behaving flimsy justifications to rationalize being wrong

1514
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,599
Yeah

1515
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,623
Man

1516
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
You're right

1517
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:03,071
Sometimes it sometimes it would be nice if I had something insightful or funny to say but sometimes

1518
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:03,839
It's just like

1519
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Yeah

1520
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:11,263
Let's hear the truth happened about that what a weird thing to have late

1521
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:14,336
You know I think that on one level

1522
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,920
Hey it more competent hands in a actually

1523
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,712
Well put-together documentary

1524
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
I have stuff like this

1525
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,552
And you could juxtaposer

1526
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
With stuff about Sandy Hook

1527
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,880
And you could make the point

1528
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,440
Even without grilling Alex too hard

1529
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,000
This is the same s*** that he does all the

1530
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
The times

1531
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
That documentary

1532
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
This one does not do this

1533
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:41,216
That is not that documentary The behavior that he's displaying in Oklahoma City is

1534
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,496
Looked at as

1535
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,544
Good

1536
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,872
I mean a softball interview

1537
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,408
Proves Alex is a month

1538
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:55,808
It is only a tee-ball documentary that allows Alex to exist the way he does

1539
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,624
Yep

1540
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,440
I was like what

1541
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:07,072
People documentary second now that you get it it's

1542
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:13,216
Super good right yeah yeah it is late the way you were saying it made sense to me I got the price you were trying to

1543
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
T-ball

1544
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,056
Mike

1545
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,104
Anson had some words about Alex

1546
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:22,176
Wasn't very popular back then

1547
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,456
You were out there is

1548
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,480
Pharisees

1549
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,784
But Alex made it

1550
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,064
More popular because

1551
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,088
He was well

1552
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
Spoken

1553
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
Professional

1554
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,440
He was found like the Dan Rather

1555
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:37,280
Conspiracy theory world

1556
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
People

1557
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,376
People information

1558
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,800
So weird how this documentary doesn't even mention the existence of Bill Cooper

1559
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:55,456
It's not just kind of pretending that Alex didn't completely idolized him and pretending that he wasn't

1560
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,760
Figure in the anti-government conspiracy world

1561
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:02,112
Bill was already the conspiracy Dan Rather

1562
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:08,256
Alex is a big deal that's fair enough but it's a little much to pretend he was this much of a trailblazer

1563
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,816
Recognizing the Bill Cooper existed

1564
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,864
Hertz the ability to create the image

1565
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
That this film wants to paint

1566
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
And that is that Alex

1567
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,984
Entirely went his own way and created this

1568
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,800
This whole thing out of his desire to tell truth

1569
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,848
In Alex's War

1570
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:27,200
Alright are you swallowing in Bill Cooper's wake

1571
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,736
It is

1572
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,552
Yeah I mean they didn't bring up father Coughlin

1573
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:37,952
They didn't say that Lord haha They didn't say that like Wolf Blitzer was the Dan Rather of

1574
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:43,072
Of not being Edward Armour Road they didn't say all of those things there's no Keith Olbermann

1575
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,096
City Hall

1576
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:51,520
There's always talk about whenever people say that he's a racist and that is like

1577
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,288
Clan

1578
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:57,408
Right where I really interesting

1579
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
When

1580
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,712
We were rebuilding it

1581
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,784
The Ku Klux Klan come down to Waco

1582
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,168
And Alex and Ian

1583
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,960
Bullhorn

1584
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:38,368
Guess what Alex was Bullhorn in the clan but it was really more about being defensive about Waco

1585
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,160
Disagreement

1586
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,720
With the clan so much as like a

1587
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:49,120
I want more attention than the clay and I have baselessly decided that you're all fed

1588
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,704
But like really that contact is actually fairly important

1589
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:59,104
When they came to Waco when he was trying to be the guy who's rebuilding the Davidian Church

1590
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,224
He's not bull horny McLamb no other times he's bull Horning

1591
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:10,624
Anyone who takes attention from him and it's the Klan is the people who take the attention

1592
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,416
Anybody who might

1593
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:15,232
Attract a right-wing Patriot audience

1594
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
That could steal

1595
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
Yes yes

1596
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:26,496
What you might call a power struggle right

1597
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:32,128
There's often audience because they're trying to take my

1598
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
Yes

1599
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:37,248
So I will get Alex and the present-day here talkin a little bit

1600
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,528
And this is just so f******

1601
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,296
Can stupid

1602
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:40,576
The general public are like

1603
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,440
Babies inside the womb

1604
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,744
I don't even know what's going on in the outside world

1605
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,536
Inside their mother

1606
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,584
What's going on

1607
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,608
Mad scientist

1608
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,400
Trying to steal the future

1609
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,680
Probably before they're even born

1610
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:58,240
I'm outside I got out

1611
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,800
I'm not totally blind

1612
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,080
And I'm powerless

1613
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:02,848
Stop

1614
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,896
Even though I can tell people was coming next

1615
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,712
It doesn't matter that people just still

1616
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,016
They can't deal with the magnitude of

1617
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,808
Understand

1618
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,672
Yeah these people they put shadow puppets

1619
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:21,024
That's how it works but also the allegory of the

1620
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,304
So that's

1621
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,096
That's cool

1622
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,400
Yeah you know but

1623
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,728
I'm real proud of him for having

1624
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:30,752
Kind of

1625
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:35,104
Almost learned a thing about the past that maybe he can relate

1626
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:40,480
A little bit one of the most basic philosophical

1627
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,040
Maybe your first class

1628
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:46,624
If your school block you don't expect

1629
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,696
To know the first principles of philosophy

1630
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Fine

1631
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,768
Fair enough that is true

1632
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,584
So there's more of the past

1633
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,192
Things about Alex going to Bohemian Grove

1634
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
Alex

1635
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,776
Of context

1636
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,568
Deadpool costumes

Million listeners

1639
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
Alex place

1640
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,736
Bohemian Grove

1641

Pitmasters

1642
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,808
To control the world's government

1643
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
Thanks the media

1644
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,880
And the United Nations

1645
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,696
The clip of Jon Ronson

1646
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:23,744
From the secret rulers of the world

1647
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
Displayed I'm not talking to himself

1648
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:27,328
Right there is

1649
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,352
Video

1650
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,144
That shows like b-roll

1651
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:34,496
Shows of his interview on C-Span

1652
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,056
Lied about what happened to provide growth

1653
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:43,456
Play the audio of it at all right there's no dissenting opinion everything is

1654
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,992
Just reinforcing Alex's

1655
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:48,832
Perception even if there are things that are very clear indication

1656
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,136
That you should have access

1657
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,416
To the information

1658
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:55,744
Get makes you responsible for

1659
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,024
Pushing back on this other.

1660
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Right

1661
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
It's fun that the jet

1662
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,608
Text position of

1663
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,400
John and Alex

1664
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
Makes you think that the British

1665
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,728
117

1666
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:12,640
But then Piers Morgan comes in later and do it

1667
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:15,968
It's not a bad

1668
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,272
Navigate to 2001

1669
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,320
Hello ladies

1670
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,088
Gentleman

1671
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
So glad

1672
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
Join us

1673
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,416
Jay

1674
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:26,464
For this

1675
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,744
Wednesday July

1676
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,768
25th two

1677
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
Broadcast

1678
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
Open the glow

1679
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,008
The globalist want to bring down and they will use terrorism

1680
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,544
As a pretext to get it done

1681
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:42,592
So this is his prediction

1682
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,872
911 show

1683
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:50,528
Yeah and this documentary is pretending a Bill Cooper doesn't exist so there's no reason to explain that Alex just stole this prediction from Bill

1684
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,112
This whole section of the film is a really long greatest hits

1685
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,416
It's of Alex's career that's meant to paint him as a

1686
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
True Renegade

1687
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,720
Going against popular

1688
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,744
Need to tell the truth

1689
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
About these tragic events

1690
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:04,608
It covers things like OKC Waco and 911

1691
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:11,008
But it's just surface-level s*** like Alex saying this thing is a false flag and then Alex in the present-day was a boy that sure was a

1692
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
False flag

1693
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
It's meaningless

1694
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:17,408
It doesn't talk at all about the details of stuff like how Alex up the EU did 9/11

1695
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,016
Then we have Bohemian Grove in there but you don't really have any mention of reims

1696
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:24,064
I'm going on C-Span discussing how Alex

1697
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,880
Submitted to in the day he was lying to his audience about everything

1698
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,160
It even worse

1699
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:32,512
This documentary just ignores so much of Alex's career that doesn't fit it's mold

1700
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:34,304
Like what about Y2K

1701
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,608
Three larger what about the Boston bomb

1702
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:39,424
That was part of his career and

1703
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
He got it

1704
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
Completely wrong

1705
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:47,872
That was an event where he managed to send Dad but dondi to disrupt a press conference at the authorities were holding to inform the public

1706
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,896
Book about the situation

1707
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:52,480
While the bombers were still unknown and on the loose

1708
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:56,576
The public was living in fear in patandi was just yelling Infowars.

1709
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
Cam at the police were trying to

1710
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
Call the pub

1711
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:04,768
You can make an argument that his coverage of the Boston bombings in like the top five point of his career that

1712
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,792
Bear mentioning

1713
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,328
Hazel Mission here is glare

1714
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,632
And the reason is because it doesn't fit

1715
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
Do you really get to Hero

1716
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,960
Play Bedford hero

1717
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,264
The selection of what to cover and what not

1718
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,800
The cover is an editorial choice

1719
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:17,824
Whitmoyer is making

1720
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:24,224
Because these things are at the building blocks of Alex's mythology where is things like him being an idiot in gleefully

1721
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,552
Exploiting a terrorized City isn't necessarily good optic

1722
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,880
Sandy Hook will come up because it has two

1723
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:35,488
Yeah but it's presented as more or less the exception that proves the rule and even

1724
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
More

1725
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,072
But poorly presented and we'll get to that later

1726
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,888
It's like the one blemish on his otherwise spotless record

1727
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,704
Do you know Alex actually is human

1728
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:51,104
Despite all evidence to the contrary Japanese concept of the flaw that makes something perfect

1729
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,664
Yes every mundala

1730
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,712
Of course of course

1731
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,992
Is Roth naturally

1732
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:01,344
From the past all of these like Oklahoma City

1733
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,160
Waco 911 and

1734
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
Some of them is

1735
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:11,328
Mildly interesting but not really at Stephanie's gone over head nod

1736
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:17,728
So what's your point of addressing it interesting and unique situation

1737
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
Once again

1738
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,032
No one has seen this

1739
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:24,384
Or the people who haven't seen this or unfamiliar with Alex

1740
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,176
Have no idea what's going on

1741
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,712
And most of our listeners

1742
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
Would be in

1743
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:31,040
Incredibly bored by us telling that

1744
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,064
Regular people

1745
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:34,112
Insane information

1746
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,672
Basically the

1747
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:37,440
V

1748
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,720
Points of

1749
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,512
These things from the past are

1750
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,560
Presenting Alex's

1751
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,632
Activities surrounding these topics in the most generous and

1752
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,656
Thoroughly

1753
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
So

1754
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
Get back to the present

1755
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240
What do you know

1756
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,264
Alex is a

1757
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
F****** hero

1758
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600
Call Priscilla

1759
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:36,320
Much of the discussion of the past is framed as things Alex did being on Pop

1760
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:37,856
He got fired

1761
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,880
Recovering her Waco

1762
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:43,744
The stories here recovering 911 is a false flag

1763
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:47,072
Punished for telling the truth but he kept soldiering forward

1764
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,704
It's important to understand that framing is a critical piece of this documentaries editing choices because

1765
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
When you now Flash

1766
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,824
Back to the fall of 2020 and Alex's at the stop the steel rally

1767
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,896
He's having everyone yelled at they love him and all this witch

1768
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,176
Is meant to be experienced

1769
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,200
In contrast

1770
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,992
With how he was treated in the past

1771
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:09,088
This is visually telling the audience that Alex was right all along

1772
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,880
And though he suffered hardships

1773
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,696
At the end of that road the people realized he was right

1774
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:20,096
This is b******* and it's not the impression you would get if his tour throughout his career treated his career accurately

1775
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,888
Did not like an embarrassing puppy

1776
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:25,984
If you saw him fumbling around and saying horrible racist s*** or

1777
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:30,336
Insinuating for months that the bath party were being reinstalled in a rock or arguing that the

1778
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,872
The EU did 9/11

1779
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:36,736
We're doing in same s*** about Obama's birth certificate or is Ebola bullshiter

1780
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,040
Pizzagate for slandering the head of Chobani

1781
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:44,416
Or have you thought that Obama was a secret Muslim trying to use FEMA to turn the us into a caliphate under Sharia law

1782
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:46,976
For all the times you can sister the Ron Paul is going to win

1783
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
The GOP Primary

1784
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:51,328
Then you wouldn't see that's mascot to the present day

1785
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
Disabled

1786
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,984
If you understood the clear picture of his career you might see the people yelling out. They love him is

1787
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,544
Pitiable people's been sucked in by a con man

1788
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,360
But because this documentary only seems to care about

1789
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,920
Representing Alex is a really solid information guy

1790
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:12,320
You see the people flocking to him it's meant to look like they finally come around and recognize that Alex is great

1791
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,600
This is a choice

1792
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:15,136
Made by the editing

1793
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,672
His being gone by Moyer

1794
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,256
There's a reason that the discussion of Sandy Hook is separated

1795
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,792
From all of this pasta

1796
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
Because

1797
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,376
That's not supposed to be seen as actually part of this

1798
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,912
No no absolutely not

1799
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:27,680
That was

1800
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,960
That was a blip

1801
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
That was a

1802
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
Worst

1803
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:36,896
Rick listen Okay do you remember how that one time the United

1804
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:39,456
It States was running these drills

1805
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,224
Right

1806
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:46,112
And they didn't notify Russia of it and these drills would be very similar to ones that you would do

1807
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
If you are launching a nuclear attack

1808
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:53,024
And Russia because they didn't know that the United States was about to or was not

1809
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,864
Going to launch a nuclear attack and only knew that these drills were happening

1810
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,168
Decided that what they needed to do

1811
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
With launching

1812
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:02,240
An actual real nuclear attack

1813
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,312
And it was only because of the efforts of 1

1814
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,848
Heroic man

1815
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,920
That they did not shoot those f****** missiles right

1816
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,200
Do you remember that

1817
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
Nobody even remembers it

1818
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,808
Not that important

1819
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
So Alex

1820
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,160
Presentation of him

1821
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928
Sucks

1822
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:21,952
It stinks

1823
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,280
And it would not really be possible to achieve

1824
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:28,352
Eve without very intentional choices being made

1825
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,400
Absolute being presented

1826
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,472
No I mean what how

1827
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:36,800
How is it that we have trouble

1828
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:39,104
Will sleeping at night Dan how is it that both of us

1829
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:44,480
Caffeine alcohol on your part

1830
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,040
Dental in Balance Shore

1831
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,624
I don't know Patrick

1832
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:56,768
Here in the fall of 2020 and Mike Flynn is giving a speech

1833
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:02,144
Speech speech where Trump flew over in a helicopter

1834
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,424
Bucked up

1835
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,752
When human rights

1836
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:11,360
McCall's by the media like I've been raked over the coals by the media but my mom says

1837
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:14,432
Sticks and Stones can break my bones but names will never hurt me

1838
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,016
Ensenada

1839
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,832
Before the media

1840
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,880
The New York store

1841
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,184
Service to this country

1842
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,992
Oh I'm sorry that was a different quote

1843
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,320
Was so close

1844
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:00,768
Next president of the United States is Donald Trump

1845
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,520
The visuals of this are terrifying

1846
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:17,920
People are looking up at the sky is Trump flies over in the helicopter there's a shot of Mike Lindell looking up like

1847
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
He's going to cry

1848
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,504
There's this beautiful operatic music

1849
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,808
Indicating an almost religious experience

1850
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,856
The people are having a looking up to the heaven

1851
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:30,208
Moyer toes to play that music underneath his video which gives a very pretty

1852
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:34,304
Nuclear tone essentially the people who view Trump is there saved

1853
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,584
But

1854
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
This documentary doesn't give you

1855
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,168
You any reason to think that's a bad thing

1856
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:45,312
The subject of this film is the biggest Trump supporter in the world who cried on air about how we die for Trump

1857
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:48,896
There's no voice in this film that's critical of Trumps of the music

1858
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:52,480
Doesn't really come off as heightening or highlighting something that

1859
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,016
Is being commented on

1860
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
It kind of just

1861
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:57,600
B and the film is treating like

1862
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,624
It's bats okay

1863
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,904
Yeah this is

1864
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:03,232
Really disturbing I mean the scene itself is disturbing

1865
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:06,816
And then the directorial choices that are made here

1866
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,120
Presented in a way that I find

1867
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:09,888
Under

1868
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:16,544
Yeah yeah I remember watching Apocalypse Now I hate that I'm making so many movie references but we

1869
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:22,944
We are talking about

1870
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,344
We are discussing a movie and we are discussing a person who's making a movie and a person

1871
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,648
He's making a movie like you would make a Hollywood

1872
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,440
And so

1873
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:37,792
If I was discussing the scene in Apocalypse Now where someone were to say

1874
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:42,656
I love the smell of napalm in the morning and I were to play the Benny

1875
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,448
Hill theme song or

1876
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:47,008
My town

1877
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:53,408
That's alright that's our theme song for the week

1878
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,712
Play Feels Like It

1879
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,088
It also hasn't been a week dad's Fair

1880
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:07,488
So Alex is at this rally where everyone is culturally looking up at the sky at Trump flying over and there's a moment that

1881
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,280
Really disturbing

1882
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:11,584
It's a woman who's trying to climb over a fence

1883
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,888
To get a picture without

1884
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,736
That clip suffers from the same problem as the last one

1885
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:06,112
Inside this field there's no reason to think it's weird for someone to be comparing Alex to John the

1886
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:11,744
This film is essentially justifying that conclusion by choosing to show what it shows

1887
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:17,632
A woman climbing over a fence to take a selfie with Alex and compared to John the Baptist should be a shocking image

1888
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,424
But it should be troubling but in the

1889
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,960
Context of this documentary

1890
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,520
If you accept the story as Moyer is telling it

1891
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,080
Why wouldn't you think that Alex is John the Baptist

1892
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:31,200
He's basically been right his entire career and persecuted for telling the truth about what was coming

1893
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,224
Because that proof

1894
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:33,760
Threaten the power structure

1895
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,808
This documentary allows Alex

1896
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:40,672
To bring themselves so unquestioningly that it makes sense that this woman views Alex's way

1897
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:43,232
Honestly it would almost be weirder if she didn't

1898
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,024
That's f***** up

1899
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:48,352
So when we leave now taking in

1900
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
A bit of Alex

1901
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,168
Hero in the present

1902
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,216
Vindicated for all the past

1903
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
I all the past

1904
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,520
Turmoil in trouble

1905
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,312
And now we jump back to the

1906
01:39:57,824 --> 01:40:02,176
And we get we we pick up here where Alex is

1907
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:05,248
Discussing you showed up at like

1908
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,272
A convention

1909
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:12,672
Ain't talkin about how like none of these candidates are good

1910
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,720
We're going to leave it at that

1911
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
Thanks very much

1912
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,768
We'll be back with more dingleberry

1913
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,304
A few minutes

1914
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:24,448
Of course the floor is empty but they're here and let's beat we be accused of not hearing all voices we cut you off a moment ago this

1915
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
Texas radio talk

1916
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,056
Infowars.com

1917
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:30,592
Candidates are cousins

1918
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,688
This is Claire the military-industrial

1919
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,224
Was intimately involved

1920
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
The commission

1921
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,040
Complete fraud

1922
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
We're losing our

1923
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
Both parties are

1924
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
We don't wait

1925
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
Troy giving up Liberty

1926
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
Only gives us tyranny

1927
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,024
It does not give us accurate

1928
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:50,048
But everybody

1929
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,584
Wakes up to this

1930
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:52,608
And realized

1931
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
And Constitution

1932
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,216
Everybody should investigate

1933
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:57,984
911

1934
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:59,520
And find out who's really behind it

1935
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,824
Reichstag

1936
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,408
Thank you for the planet.

1937
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
Alex

1938
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,272
Going to be a crocheted that's going

1939
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,064
Or do you want to be

1940
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:20,000
Multiple jobs

1941
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
We're looking for

1942
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
Somebody

1943
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:26,144
Control

1944
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,168
Gear

1945
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:29,984
And

1946
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,008
What do this

1947
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,544
Refuse Fox News

1948
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,592
Right before Glenn Beck

1949
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,152
They would have article

1950
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,480
Fox News with fox

1951
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,064
Flashing back to the past

1952
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,856
Again but it's important to understand what

1953
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,880
Track where on

1954
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:53,536
This is the track that leads to him supporting Trump which has to be contextualized by pointing out Alex's Renegade individual

1955
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:55,072
Melody throughout his political career

1956
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,888
Here is talking about a bush and carry both suck

1957
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,448
You know it doesn't want to be a part of Fox News

1958
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,240
They conveniently ignore is

1959
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:06,336
Constant support for Ron Paul's candidacies because why provide context when you can

1960
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,896
Just pretend that Trump was Alex's first love

1961
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,712
This is the section where Sandy Hook

1962
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:18,112
Come up because this documentary wants Alex's coverage of Sandy Hook to be understood in a very specific way

1963
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:19,392
Which will discuss when we get the

1964
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
Also

1965
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,232
If Alex has ever taken one of those job offers at Fox

1966
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:26,816
He would have lasted about as long as Michael Savage did it MSNBC

1967
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,864
Ship can so fast

1968
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:31,936
He can't play ball

1969
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,728
If you do you want

1970
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
To say with

1971
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,824
With the 20th of 20 hindsight

1972
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:39,616
That he knew

1973
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
What was

1974
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:42,944
What was happening

1975
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
Is that

1976
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:44,992
He

1977
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,016
Spoke

1978
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,552
In short sentences

1979
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,832
Confidently

1980
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,112
Loudly and quick

1981
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:56,512
And nobody knew with that time that that's all you needed to do to dominate the entire American conch

1982
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,304
I would argue that sometimes

1983
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,840
It was also run on

1984
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:06,496
Well you are not wrong to give the appearance of like an overabundance

1985
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:13,152
Really just killing time until you figure out what the next sentence here's what I'll say I'll say and I want to try and describe it

1986
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
This way like

1987
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
Back then

1988
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
If you were to take her

1989
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
His words

1990
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,624
You could put it into like guitar tablature and you would have

1991
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:25,440
Clearer idea of why people enjoyed it

1992
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,488
Then you would if you listen to his words

1993
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,024
Do you know what I'm saying yeah

1994
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,864
Yeah it might be more rhythmic

1995
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,400
Jack Byrne

1996
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:40,288
Exactly tabs

1997
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,056
Definite

1998
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:44,640
Call and response history to it

1999
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,432
Is the history of bat

2000
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:50,784
Baptist preaching of effective

2001
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,552
Of course

2002
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:56,928
Of course so at this point Alex's rejected these deals from from

2003
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,720
Fox News he doesn't want to support

2004
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,256
Buschur Carey's salute

2005
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,280
He's a rogue

2006
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,816
Just like us not

2007
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,096
Advertising for

2008
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,936
He's out in the wild no one he's no one's

2009
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,240
Person

2010
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,800
But he's also in Waking Life

2011
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:15,360
And so here's a little

2012
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,384
It's going to be

2013
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,968
Pure something

2014
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,000
Creativity

2015
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
I don't care about Hollywood

2016
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
My goal was

2017
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,424
The band movies my goal was to

2018
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,704
Embraced by all that

2019
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:41,728
So I mean like

2020
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,776
No mention of Star-Lord

2021
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:52,224
Yeah you were supposed to get there you would have gotten paid before then

2022
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,760
How does it not coming up

2023
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,040
More than Chris Pratt

2024
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:58,624
This is just meant to be like this rejection of

2025
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,184
Of the the mainstream or whatever

2026
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:05,024
There's a world where Alex shows up in Jurassic world like

2027
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,560
Dial is a Raptors

2028
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,352
A blue you and I are friends

2029
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,632
Now come on now

2030
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,912
Blue Raptor

2031
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,192
Everybody blue

2032
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:20,128
I do remember the other rappers named I did

2033
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,968
Open new watch the first of the new ones

2034
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:24,992
I was curious

2035
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,272
Yesterday it was fine

2036
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,808
So

2037
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,344
Alex doesn't like Hollywood

2038
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,880
Gates West Coast

2039
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
Cool

2040
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:34,976
Charlie Sheen was the only

2041
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:37,792
Party

2042
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:40,864
Creepy

2043
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,168
Week

2044
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:44,960
Spiders

2045
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:51,104
My soul

2046
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
Truly on the planet

2047
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
It resides

2048
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:54,944
Onalaska

2049
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,088
He might have just been jet lag

2050
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,136
And then also like

2051
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,672
You shouldn't be saying if there's a devil

2052
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:06,976
I mean

2053
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:11,328
If there's a devil should never come mere Alex

2054
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:13,120
Yeah pretty stupid

2055
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:13,888
Text my heart

2056
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
Because that's

2057
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,448
Fundamental to his exact

2058
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,496
Existence

2059
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:20,544
That is fair

2060
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:26,944
You know it's almost like

2061
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,992
Controlled by the Christian devil

2062
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:29,760
Feel like

2063
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,064
If your fundamental issue with the globalist

2064
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,344
Is that they are

2065
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,136
Controlled by the literal Christian

2066
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
Skin devil

2067
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,720
That should also be the centerpiece of your duck

2068
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:45,888
Does that seem feel like I'm not being crazy no no you're totally right

2069
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,912
Shockingly little

2070
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:50,240
Interval variable is the cause of all of my problems

2071
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:56,640
No certainly not that very little of his religious fundamentalism at all

2072
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:59,712
News coverage and Topix

2073
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:02,016
Praying on air

2074
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,576
You know the thing that he doesn't do

2075
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:05,600
Liberal

2076
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,672
I forgot it was our fault they loved a lie

2077
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,952
Back window bush

2078
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,232
Correct

2079
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,256
Oh no

2080
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,792
It's fair to say that

2081
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,072
The Liberals

2082
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:23,776
Nothing you hear the background that belly of the Beast they played the video of him the Rogue and running around in their push mask

2083
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:26,080
So that was what that was Fighter video

2084
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:29,664
Did the crazy guy in Austin

2085
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,016
And that Obama came in

2086
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:42,464
Then at the end there is the Obama Joker thing

2087
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,304
Classic radio hits

2088
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:52,704
Blanca

2089
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:55,264
That's available in Street Fighter 11 I think

2090
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:58,592
Welder

2091
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,920
Continuing this Narrative of persecution

2092
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,968
Chad sticking to his guns

2093
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,016
I am behaving like a principal

2094
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,064
Like I was the same

2095
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:14,464
Liberals loved me because I thought I hated George Bush but I also write it up, and then they stopped

2096
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,024
Above it right

2097
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:20,352
And so you have this path that is being walked

2098
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,168
And they flash a clip Up

2099
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,472
Of Alex talking

2100
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
About

2101
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,800
The operational lockstep document

2102
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:34,944
Back in 2010

2103
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:38,272
You want both know he wasn't I do know that he was

2104
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,368
I mean I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful

2105
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,464
And I hope that you pay attention to

2106
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,536
Because I've had chills

2107
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,328
Since last night

2108
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:52,864
This just confirms

2109
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,632
Everything else

2110
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,656
We've already research

2111
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:59,264
Yeah but he's covering the document that is now known as operation locks

2112
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:02,592
It wasn't known as that in 2010

2113
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:06,944
The video that's used in the documentary doesn't come from the original show

2114
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:07,968
But Alex did

2115
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:13,600
The graphics that uses are similar to those in this little Sizzle video that Alex put together on his website

2116
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,880
In the Alex Jones

2117
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,416
Prediction section

2118
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:19,232
It's meant to show that Alex Jones is right about everything

2119
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:25,888
That's not great to imagine that instead of using primary sources might rely on a propaganda video made by

2120
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:26,912
Infowars

2121
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:30,496
Designed specifically to pretend that I was predicted covid over a decade ago

2122
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,288
I probably wouldn't do that

2123
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:38,688
I don't I don't know why I would just use the raw video of Alex from 2010 cuz it's available obviously

2124
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,480
Okay I'm going to tell you this

2125
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,272
We all watch

2126
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
But there was a point

2127
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,368
At which

2128
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,904
The defenses lawyer

2129
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,440
Argue

2130
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
That

2131
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,744
The plaintiffs

2132
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,280
Making them look

2133
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,048
Dumb

2134
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,096
Was in fact

2135
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,376
A sanction

2136
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,144
By the court

2137
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,168
Wow right

2138
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:00,704
Now the podiatrist

2139
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,984
It's an interesting

2140
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,544
To the judge and the judge said back

2141
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,360
The only person who's making you look dumb as you

2142
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:11,712
Yeah the only person who can make you look down as you have your choice

2143
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,760
It feels like we're here

2144
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,552
Does that make

2145
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:22,208
Yeah yeah yeah the only person who can make this documentary as bad as it is a person who made this documentary and I have some

2146
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,048
Choice word two hours worth of

2147
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,352
So Alex is talking

2148
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,376
Asus motherboard

2149
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:33,216
Open 22

2150
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:35,008
And no one's allowed to go outside

2151
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,152
They're going to 0 to a trillion miles an hour

2152
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:42,944
We were in the war

2153
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:47,296
Trillium Eisenhower's not possible

2154
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,880
That's where my study of his

2155
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:53,696
Aaron's

2156
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:55,744
Because whatever it is or tune into it

2157
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,768
Beyond by now

2158
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:03,936
Alex is very frequently talked about our God is giving his visions of everything that's going to happen and that he's a psychic

2159
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:09,312
I'm going to guess that he didn't say that because he doesn't want people who don't already like him to know that he's that nut

2160
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:12,384
Also this is a more recent thing but it's

2161
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:16,224
It's still part of this descent into the past based on him predicting covid back in 20

2162
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,576
We're still on that track of Alex being a renegade who has no team

2163
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,392
Who the Liberals like because he was criticizing push and then

2164
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,440
They stopped liking him when he attacked Obama

2165
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:28,000
That's the main theme of the section that were in

2166
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:31,328
Or the river that were in as Alex would that would put

2167
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,888
I am

2168
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,936
Frustrated by the

2169
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,984
General Vibe I'm getting that

2170
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,032
This documentary is Menton

2171
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,080
Entirely to rehab Alex

2172
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:44,384
His previous five years of being a

2173
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,176
Far-right

2174
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:49,504
Jobs into returning to some sort of

2175
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:52,832
Pre obama-era above the left eye

2176
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,880
Bright Peregrine paradigm

2177
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,160
Version of himself

2178
01:51:56,416 --> 01:52:02,560
Is that what I'm hearing ball I mean I think that's probably one of the goals they would like to explore

2179
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:08,192
I think whatever positive interpretation that becomes of Alex after this is what they're going for

2180
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:12,032
That would be a defensive for me to ascribe to them intent

2181
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,056
Because that would suggest

2182
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:19,456
Competence on some level

2183
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:24,576
As good as holding him broke is what it is

2184
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:29,440
He just wants to be good so it's so can go to heaven

2185
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,232
Alright I'm so pasta politics

2186
01:52:36,608 --> 01:52:37,120
Kid Perfect

2187
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:38,656
Willie

2188
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,680
Freaked out loud

2189
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,728
Trying to do

2190
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,360
Not really.

2191
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,664
My wife was God

2192
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:50,944
And I want to get out of the

2193
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,184
Fathoms to get real bad

2194
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,768
But you were lying lying

2195
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:07,840
I told my son 3 years ago

2196
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:12,448
Unfollow me shutdown song

2197
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:19,360
Is isan everything's over the there's no going to college and that's why I spent your education fund on taking the trip to California evil is

2198
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,408
Place on Earth so I can do mushrooms with Mike Tyson

2199
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:24,224
Can you talk about that's all

2200
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,552
The f*** out of here with this overly dramatic nonsense

2201
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:28,320
Slug

2202
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:31,648
He tried to smoke his son because he

2203
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,440
He thought his son was a toad

2204
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,976
After smoking toad

2205
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,000
What happened

2206
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
He was just licking

2207
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:42,400
What does we have found out that's just not how you get high off

2208
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:45,472
Alex's on

2209
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:50,336
So we're through this past of Alex's

2210
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:51,360
Political

2211
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:57,504
Rebellious misses your life and so we get now to the point where he yells at Piers Morgan

2212
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:58,784
Pierce

2213
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:06,720
Why don't you come to America

2214
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:21,312
Do you understand

2215
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:26,176
Suspicious Anna tab Center this is the subsequent

2216
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:31,552
Time when Alex showed up at a Morgan event

2217
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:36,928
Not interested in talking to a man I bet there's no recording of that and there's no way to hear any evidence

2218
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:43,328
I wish I had the time to go through all the archive because

2219
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:45,120
Listen to our show

2220
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:47,168
Bath or

2221
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:52,800
He is I think I think you played it on his shift but I wouldn't ask anyone ever

2222
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,568
Do that

2223
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,872
So now from there we jump to Trump

2224
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
Crop top

2225
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,432
And

2226
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,712
Look

2227
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:02,528
Trump just latched onto what Alex was doing man

2228
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,720
The real quick

2229
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:16,352
Obviously the point of this is going to be that he was yelling Hillary for prison and then Trump took that and is good lock her up

2230
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:20,192
But Alex said that he stole Hillary for Prison from somebody's like buffer

2231
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,472
Forsake her that he saw

2232
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:27,616
Answer this person is actually responsible for from somebody who's anonymous

2233
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:29,152
Cuz they can't argue against

2234
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,688
That's how it work that's a great point

2235
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,088
Paradise motel

2236
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:37,856
Banner

2237
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:44,000
Trump tapped into the same populist

2238
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,024
Anchor

2239
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,048
The same Papa

2240
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:46,816
Worcestershire

2241
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,352
I've been tempted

2242
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,656
The whole takeover fail

2243
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,216
And now

2244
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,008
Who gets to talk to the president

2245
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,800
Who gets to talk to Supreme Court Justice

2246
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,080
Alex Jones

2247
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,920
Alex Jones

2248
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:03,200
He was a nice guy

2249
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,016
Gloves off

2250
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:09,088
Twisting stuff sometimes for playful like

2251
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:09,856
Joke

2252
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:12,160
You like every newspaper run today to yards

2253
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,184
Every newspaper

2254
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:22,144
So in case it's not explicit enough here is Rob do laying out that Alex is responsible for Trump being

2255
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
President

2256
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:23,936
Alex Jones

2257
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,704
Matron

2258
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
Whether anybody

2259
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
Believe it or not

2260
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,712
Spirit of America

2261
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,344
He loves it

2262
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:45,184
So here is where things

2263
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
I would say

2264
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,000
Become entirely onyx

2265
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:51,072
Talking about how

2266
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,632
You know he basically was what Trump

2267
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,168
Surviving off of

2268
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,704
Trump liked him

2269
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,032
Dropcam on his show Hillary started to get mad at him

2270
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:00,800
And he was going to happen

2271
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,848
Huntsville crime

2272
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:03,616
Be the president

2273
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,456
And that in raids

2274
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
The permanent

2275
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:08,992
Bureaucracy

2276
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,016
That we know of

2277
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:14,112
The people are so awake I mean I'm not kidding every

2278
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:17,696
When they saw that

2279
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:18,720
They're like oh

2280
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,768
He stopped the crazy guy on the internet

2281
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:21,792
Now if you go back

2282
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:24,864
That we could get it

2283
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
Now we got it

2284
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
Destroyer

2285
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:41,504
I'm really upset I'm having to be honest

2286
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:59,424
This is no exaggeration the last wave at any self-respect

2287
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,472
FileMaker recover the subject matter

2288
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:08,128
Sandy Hook is not coming up as an instance of something really really bad that Alex didn't his career

2289
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:12,736
Something that people are only mad about because they needed an excuse to attack him because he supported

2290
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:13,504
Trump

2291
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,832
This is a choice that Alex Moyer is making as a filmmaker

2292
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:21,440
She didn't have to include the Sandy Hook outrage is merely the result of people

2293
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,744
Needing to justify hating Alex Joe

2294
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:29,120
I went to Sandy Hook coverage isn't even mentioned chronologically because of the context of this documentary

2295
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:31,424
One thing isn't his coverage

2296
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:35,008
It's the way people got unfairly mad about it because he like Trump

2297
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,080
There's no counterbalance to this depiction at all

2298
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:44,480
This is an unchallenged position in the film which is editorially supported by the way that Moyer has edited this

2299
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:48,064
If she thought that Alex's claim was it all dubious

2300
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:54,208
She could reach out to one of the Sandy Hook parents to discuss how they were trying to get Alex to stop this s*** long before you cared about Trump

2301
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:58,304
Or if you wanted to give the impression that she disputed his claim

2302
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,400
She didn't have to structure and edit the film to comport with Alex's narrative

2303
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:05,216
Again much like with the John the Baptist

2304
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:08,544
If you believe what this documentary is presenting

2305
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,104
You have no reason to not believe that

2306
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:13,664
People are only mad about Sandy Hook because of Alex

2307
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:14,688
Supported Trump

2308
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:18,016
The story as it's told Lee due to no other

2309
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,552
Conclusion and that is a choice

2310
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:20,576
That is a choice

2311
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,344
Being made

2312
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,392
In the creation of this documentary

2313
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,672
Unacceptable

2314
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
Hugh

2315
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:27,744
Recognize

2316
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:30,304
That this is intentionally being

2317
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,328
Not released

2318
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,120
During the Sandy Hook trial

2319
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,144
Makes this

2320
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:35,680
Outrageous

2321
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,704
Justly offense

2322
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,264
This is unacceptable

2323
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,592
I don't know what the f*** you think you're doing but this is

2324
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,128
Typing

2325
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:46,432
Causing PTS

2326
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,968
I mean is that

2327
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:48,992
What you want to say

2328
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,272
I mean part of

2329
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:51,296
Part of the problem

2330
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,576
Is 1

2331
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,344
1

2332
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,624
You

2333
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,648
Set everything

2334
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,672
That needs

2335
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,440
To be sad about

2336
01:59:58,464 --> 01:59:58,976
That is

2337
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,536
That is it and anybody who tries to

2338
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:04,096
Counter or even add anything to that

2339
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:04,864
Is wrong

2340
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:10,752
There's a reason that the discussion of Sandy Hook as the one thing that Alex f***** up

2341
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:16,128
Isn't included in the timeline of his career and all these Greatest Hits because it's a prop

2342
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:18,432
In order to justify why people

2343
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:21,760
Are so angry at him it's because they like that trumpet make

2344
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:24,576
The pick through his career to find something they could

2345
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:25,600
Could be mad about

2346
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,368
Yeah

2347
02:00:26,624 --> 02:00:27,392
F*** that

2348
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,416
That's like

2349
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:29,952
Ion

2350
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
Understand

2351
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:36,864
That this is an argument that's going to be made that it's like I'm just presenting him the way he is you make your own

2352
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,144
That's bulshit

2353
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,680
There is a Judgment Day

2354
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:43,776
You as a filmmaker are making by presenting this information that way

2355
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:49,664
That is not an unbiased oh this is who he is this is how it is no f*** that noise

2356
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:50,432
Yeah

2357
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:53,248
Still fine to make this documentary I'm not saying

2358
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,016
You should be

2359
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,040
Silence

2360
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:55,808
Store like

2361
02:00:56,576 --> 02:01:00,416
You shouldn't be allowed to make a second battery or anything like that silenced and then we'll talk

2362
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:06,816
But you can do can scream over it if you want the former silence.

2363
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,096
I don't think

2364
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:09,376
I don't think like

2365
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,400
You should be allowed

2366
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
To do this but

2367
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:12,704
You also

2368
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,496
Should recognize

2369
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,800
That what you're doing atkore is

2370
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
Malicious

2371
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:20,384
It is unacceptable and

2372
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,736
To see what other b*******

2373
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,760
She's going to do in her career

2374
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:26,528
Yeah

2375
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:30,880
This is the kind of documentary that if January 6th have gone the other way

2376
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:33,952
Would be looked at by history as hell any reefer

2377
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:40,352
We would look at Nazi documentary

2378
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:45,216
Can't believe it January 6th didn't go that way and so

2379
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:46,496
We have a couple years

2380
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:50,336
Until we look at it that way when you bring up January 6th

2381
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,360
It does

2382
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:52,896
Pullback

2383
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:54,176
A little bit

2384
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:54,944
The View

2385
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:58,272
If it was an alternate routes Jones on The View

2386
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,552
I know that

2387
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,600
That one is very narrow

2388
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:05,440
No I'll try and I'll try and keep this short but

2389
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:07,488
By bringing up January 6th

2390
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:11,584
That just require you to kind of pull back from the Sandy Hook

2391
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:12,608
Situation

2392
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,400
He's absolutely monster

2393
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:16,192
And then you pulled back and it

2394
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:17,216
Further

2395
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:18,240
Even that you know like

2396
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:22,848
No means my minimizing what he's done

2397
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:23,872
To the families of story

2398
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,920
But also

2399
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:28,992
Overthrowing in tonight in entire country

2400
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,528
That's also pretty big

2401
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,064
Sure you know and

2402
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:36,160
And to a certain extent whatever the point is made that

2403
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,720
Trump wouldn't be president without a lie

2404
02:02:39,232 --> 02:02:44,352
Which is debatable but there is something here's what I'm going to say about that

2405
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:46,400
When we talked about nuance

2406
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,424
1 weighted

2407
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,192
View that

2408
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:48,960
What is by

2409
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,496
Math just very simple

2410
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:54,848
And the fact that we are very capable of talking about nuance

2411
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:59,456
But when we talked about it we're not able to really get to the fact that

2412
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:00,224
If

2413
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:00,992
Alex is

2414
02:03:01,504 --> 02:03:02,272
20%

2415
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,320
Responsible for Trump

2416
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,088
Becoming president

2417
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:11,744
Then he is responsible for Trump becoming president because of the market with 20%

2418
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,352
That were not able to really deal with right now

2419
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:21,472
Even to make your point further like there's no way that we can create a counterfactual real

2420
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,776
Place where Alex is earlier career didn't

2421
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:29,408
Exist in the parts of it that involve the Tea Party of coin he helped start The Oath Keepers right

2422
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:31,712
And all of these things like the ripple effect

2423
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:34,016
So these things from further back in his career

2424
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:40,416
And how many of those haven't told direct effect in getting Trump elected

2425
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:42,464
So I think it is

2426
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,000
Kind of fair to say like

2427
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:45,280
Check in whatever sense

2428
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
Right

2429
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:51,168
Could be seen as somebody who helped push it over the hill at very we I mean you're absolutely right

2430
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:55,264
The problem with the word nuance is that we all understand what it means but if

2431
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,288
You try and Kwanzaa

2432
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:57,056
Safayet

2433
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,080
You're f*****

2434
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:01,408
Yeah yeah but the larger point is vasectomy

2435
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:06,272
100% I'm sorry for trying to like tangential

2436
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:08,064
You know what I'm saying

2437
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,624
Yeah I was just talkin here a little bit about Sandy Hook

2438
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:11,904
And he said something

2439
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,672
Not good

2440
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:13,952
I am not

2441
02:04:14,208 --> 02:04:14,720
Sandy Hook

2442
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:20,864
Sandy Hook

2443
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:21,888
Big events

2444
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,704
The internet was questioning

2445
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,984
Minion Amelie's

2446
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,824
Some of which turned out to not be real anomaly simovitch

2447
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,104
Were still unsolved

2448
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:32,384
Which one

2449
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,664
Good question

2450
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:36,736
Which one's Alex trial tomorrow

2451
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:37,760
No

2452
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:43,136
No we will get some reasons that you question Sandy Hook we're legitimate

2453
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:45,184
What what animal is which one

2454
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:45,952
Dumb dumb

2455
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:49,536
Fortunately you said today some reasons that they Quest

2456
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:53,376
Sandy Hook were good idea yeah I guess that move

2457
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,192
I guess that's their position good luck

2458
02:04:56,448 --> 02:04:57,216
6 good luck

2459
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:59,520
So they play some clips from the deposition

2460
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:03,104
And I will say we don't play the ones that are meaningful

2461
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:03,872
But

2462
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:10,528
Mark and Bill both make out of here to this document rape people grilling out

2463
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:19,744
Is right there is no mention of the fact that this deposition that they play of Rob dues is the one where he's there is corporal represent

2464
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,840
What that mean no clue there is no mention of any of

2465
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:27,424
The discovery issues or any of the bad behavior that Alex's

2466
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,704
Carried on in court

2467
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:30,752
Of the abusive practices

2468
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,568
These clips I believe are used

2469
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:34,848
To make it look like

2470
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:37,152
The lawyers are bullying hours

2471
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,456
Can I say one thing before you play the F bus

2472
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,992
Can I say one thing yeah right

2473
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:42,528
Daria was asked

2474
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,296
Today

2475
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:45,856
Why did Rob do leave the company

2476
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:49,952
And what she did not say was what I think we all secretly believe

2477
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:50,976
Is because

2478
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:53,536
He would never become the corporate represent

2479
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,584
224 Infowars again

2480
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,608
Underoath

2481
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:00,960
And that is why Daria is sitting in that stand right so I thought the reason was

2482
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:02,240
He's tied up in a bunker

2483
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:08,896
That could be there is also another possibility

2484
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:11,200
That works he's in the freezer

2485
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:17,088
I was watching the Picker answer was he decided to move on

2486
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:21,440
From this Mortal coil moment that I am existing

2487
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,256
Know how do I hear some clips

2488
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,536
Mistake or not mr.

2489
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,864
Anderson Cooper was in front of a blue screen

2490
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:36,288
The only reason I would say it's not a hundred

2491
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,592
Percent because somebody asked him if he was there and he

2492
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,712
Video

2493
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,016
Video of a guy asking him

2494
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,552
During a taping of a show

2495
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:49,088
You said hey were you at the

2496
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,880
The funeral has no I wasn't

2497
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,160
Right she wasn't

2498
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:52,928
Active

2499
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
Recently

2500
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,328
Your lawyer said

2501
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,144
There is no.

2502
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:02,912
Dispute

2503
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,192
The Sandy Hook tragedy

2504
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:04,960
He was real

2505
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,288
You stand by that that's

2506
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:09,312
What you would Minister

2507
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,360
Yes

2508
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:14,944
Appearance of the badgering Hammond like it

2509
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,248
It's it's 8:00 it creates the appearance of

2510
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:19,296
Like Alex is a victim in this whole thing

2511
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:20,320
There's no wreck

2512
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:23,136
Recognition of the fact that it is the parents

2513
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:24,160
Who are suing him

2514
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:26,720
There's no recognition of what they've gone through

2515
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,488
It is

2516
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:29,536
Hayirli one-sided presentation

2517
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,096
He's Sandy Hook legal troubles

2518
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:36,192
Which again are presented as only the result of people trying to

2519
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:40,288
To find something to be mad at him about because he's Sports dropped this is

2520
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,056
Stupid

2521
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:41,824
I've watched

2522
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,128
Far too many true crime documentaries

2523
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:47,456
To hear a clip of somebody saying no

2524
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:49,248
I saw that in a video

2525
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:52,320
And if they don't follow that up

2526
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:53,344
With the video

2527
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:54,880
Then you didn't see

2528
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:55,648
See it in that V

2529
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,672
Video

2530
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:02,560
It's tough to documentary immediately shows that video

2531
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,888
Yep

2532
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,448
You think

2533
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:10,752
It seems like that's what the dude the plaintiffs are doing

2534
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,032
So Alex

2535
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:12,800
Is a baby

2536
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:19,200
He likes to do is whenever people are like really f***** up stuff about Sandy Hook and your behavior wasn't

2537
02:08:19,456 --> 02:08:20,736
Probably

2538
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:26,624
You know over these people some money for defamation what have you

2539
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:32,512
That's what he thinks people are asking him to do what I've asked you baby

2540
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:36,608
I'm fine with that I'm not going to say you should be back by then

2541
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:38,656
We accidentally take a

2542
02:08:38,912 --> 02:08:44,544
Hard left turn the episodes of how not to cover Alex

2543
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,312
The okay

2544
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:47,104
But put me in prison for Quest

2545
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,384
Okay

2546
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:52,480
Pull the trigger

2547
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:56,320
Absolute control

2548
02:08:58,624 --> 02:08:59,648
Thanks pointing out the permit

2549
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:03,488
And this is where we find the source that God made

2550
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:05,024
Difference in the New World Order

2551
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:25,760
Alex more than indeed music piano sound

2552
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:31,392
Alex sound

2553
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:38,816
People like this song in the world

2554
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:56,992
I let that go on as long as I did because I wanted to illustrate that they play almost the entire Bon Iver

2555
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,272
Parody videos Alex

2556
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,296
Because

2557
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,600
Anthony most like

2558
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,624
For him

2559
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:03,904
Yep

2560
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:06,208
That's fun

2561
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:10,560
But also he doesn't know him that song they don't have permission to use it

2562
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:12,096
So I was thinking

2563
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,912
Hey this is a copyright strike right here

2564
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:24,896
Like no joke I don't mean to tell Tales out of school but I got in touch with the guy who

2565
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,432
They used your

2566
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:32,832
Chip in this documentary I know you didn't give them permission

2567
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,880
Have a copyright himself to that song

2568
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:38,464
So is Super Deluxe wants to

2569
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:44,608
I want to put a copyright strike on this they are more than welcome to

2570
02:10:44,864 --> 02:10:45,632
Viacom

2571
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
True

2572
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:47,680
Maybe

2573
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,728
Better is

2574
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:54,592
Is just fun tonight we smash cut forward to the January 6th

2575
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:55,360
Era

2576
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:57,664
Enzo January 5th

2577
02:10:57,920 --> 02:11:04,064
Owen on the evening they all got together in the documentary film

2578
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:07,392
Maker was like why are you burning this black lives matter flag and he was like

2579
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:11,232
Because it's so great

2580
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,256
But it isn't

2581
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:15,584
Evening of January 5th and it is Owen

2582
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:21,472
This must have been just before that I wonder if the document

2583
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:25,312
Was there and saw him burning a flag or just didn't

2584
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:28,896
Go along for those anyway suspicious

2585
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:31,712
Odd

2586
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,624
That could determine

2587
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,904
2020 election

2588
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:42,720
Supporters and Patriots

2589
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:46,304
Rndc

2590
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,584
Yep that's where we're at

2591
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:53,472
Some speeches are going to happen that night and also we're going to go burn black lives matter flag

2592
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,008
Antifa

2593
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:56,800
Nose kranti

2594
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,824
They were still on that

2595
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:00,896
The cranberry juice absolutely

2596
02:12:01,152 --> 02:12:03,200
So here's Alex on the 6th

2597
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,224
There's a good bit of

2598
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:09,856
A video of south on the 610 and what have you been here

2599
02:13:10,528 --> 02:13:12,064
Boiling people up with all the exact

2600
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:12,832
Same

2601
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:15,904
Rhetoric and the ideology that

2602
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,696
To everyone storming the capital

2603
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:21,280
Give me give me the rough cut

2604
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,048
Of this

2605
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:25,376
Entire documentary without the music

2606
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:26,144
Look at it

2607
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,192
I won't change a single scene

2608
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:30,240
And all I will do is change the music

2609
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:36,896
And you will hear a completely documented at completely different documentary probably could play Soul Coughing I don't need to walk around

2610
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,664
Run in circles

2611
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:39,456
And you would listen to that clip

2612
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:44,064
Listen to I reread you be like oh yeah this is a f****** moron for

2613
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:48,672
Simple this is a music made by music entirely.

2614
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:51,744
Which almost warms my heart because I love music some

2615
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,768
You know what I would like to see

2616
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:57,888
Was that replace all of it with a Cantina theme

2617
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:00,960
So now that Alex has led this March to the Capitol

2618
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:02,496
Things go bad

2619
02:14:03,008 --> 02:14:08,640
Remember

2620
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:15,040
Harrison talking about the capital is falling appreciative Takin Over

2621
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:15,808
Leaving

2622
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:17,344
Some things that

2623
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:20,160
Might be important

2624
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,440
Yep okay

2625
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:24,000
But here's Alex it's angry while happy with it

2626
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:25,024
Beloved

2627
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:27,584
Trying to get people to stop

2628
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:28,608
Rioting

2629
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:30,400
Stormy the capital

2630
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:31,680
Right

2631
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:38,080
There's one point that I want you to listen closely for because Alex is not getting anyone to listen to him and you can hear ali-al exam

2632
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:45,248
Hey Pryor chant no alright

2633
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:15,200
America to stop people from

2634
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:21,856
Taking over the capitol to get rid of the illegitimate government that you believe is taking off

2635
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:22,624
Over the country

2636
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,720
Don't know if chanting USA is going to really calm people down

2637
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:28,256
But he tries

2638
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:31,840
Dear every creative person that is ever exist

2639
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:33,120
Do you remember that

2640
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:34,656
That time when you were like

2641
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:38,240
Here's what I'm going to do I'm going to put into the section of my create event.

2642
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:39,520
Where

2643
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,056
Somebody in America

2644
02:15:41,568 --> 02:15:45,664
Tries to calm the crowd down or change their minds by just

2645
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:50,528
Randomly chanting USA you remember when you were going to do that and you were like

2646
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:51,808
That might be

2647
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:54,880
A step too far you were wrong

2648
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:56,928
Wrong

2649
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:03,584
Kitchen work

2650
02:16:23,552 --> 02:16:25,344
Record around the other side

2651
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:24,736
Mark Harmon

2652
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:31,392
Could be explored interesting Lee by a different doctor

2653
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:32,416
Commander even this

2654
02:17:32,928 --> 02:17:34,976
And that is Alex being unable to

2655
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:37,792
Control the monsters he creates

2656
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,584
He has done his part

2657
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,656
To create the exact situation that unfolded on January 6th

2658
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:47,264
And here he is yelling into bullhorn unable to stop people from doing the thing

2659
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,312
He's pretending he doesn't want them

2660
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:52,384
Yeah and that is a kind of sad picture

2661
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:58,528
And it's very similar to the way that he's unable to stop his listeners from harassing

2662
02:17:58,784 --> 02:17:59,552
Sandy Hook parents

2663
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:03,648
Stuff like he created this atmosphere he created this thing

2664
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,440
And even if he does

2665
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:08,000
Like eventually say

2666
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,048
I'm sorry

2667
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:10,816
Able to

2668
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:15,936
Stop the ball that he started rolling down the hill stop these people from

2669
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:21,568
Diet wanting to take over the capital after you have yelled into a bullhorn all day about

2670
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:25,152
One from you it is an illegitimate and we need to take back our country

2671
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:28,736
You and that you have no power over the monster you created

2672
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:31,040
You have the power to rile

2673
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:34,112
Pull up and create this atmosphere

2674
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:34,880
The your info

2675
02:18:35,392 --> 02:18:36,672
When it comes to

2676
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,440
Stopping

2677
02:18:37,696 --> 02:18:40,000
Yeah it's it's partially because you don't actually want to stop

2678
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:41,024
Yeah I mean

2679
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:42,048
So this

2680
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:43,328
What this reminds me of

2681
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:48,704
Is despite him being a horrific terrible shity person

2682
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:49,984
In the book

2683
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,520
Speaker for the Dead

2684
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:53,056
Orson Scott Card

2685
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:55,616
I had a character who was

2686
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:56,640
I mean

2687
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,944
Essentially living out an Alex Jones fantasy

2688
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,248
So he built up this

2689
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,272
Mob

2690
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:04,064
As as one would

2691
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:05,088
Describe it

2692
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,880
And the waitresses

2693
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,928
Goes through it is that

2694
02:19:09,440 --> 02:19:09,952
Disguising

2695
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:10,976
In control

2696
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:11,744
This situation

2697
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:13,792
He builds this mob together

2698
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:14,560
And he pulls it

2699
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:15,328
End

2700
02:19:15,584 --> 02:19:16,096
Then

2701
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:18,144
Without his ability to

2702
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:18,912
Control it

2703
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:20,192
It becomes a thing

2704
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:21,984
It becomes a

2705
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,008
General conscious

2706
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,312
Despite the fact that it's a bunch of different

2707
02:19:25,568 --> 02:19:27,360
Separate individual human beings

2708
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,640
It is 1

2709
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:29,408
Ma

2710
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:30,944
And then

2711
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:35,808
He'd be made the character he is now the enemy of the Mob characters

2712
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:38,112
Like oh this is a bad idea

2713
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:39,136
And tries to go

2714
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:40,160
Hey Mom

2715
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:42,208
Let's not do this

2716
02:19:42,720 --> 02:19:43,232
Guess how it

2717
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:47,584
Yell at Alex's honestly lucky that the mob

2718
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:53,984
Turn on him because in that environment him, everybody knows

2719
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:58,592
Photo stop

2720
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:00,896
Either he's telling us not to do the thing

2721
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,176
The natural conclusion

2722
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:06,272
Everything he's been saying for the last month's absolutely

2723
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:10,880
We've talked about it how many times but it's like just cuz you split in

2724
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:13,952
Infinitive doesn't mean you change the meaning of your sentence

2725
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:16,256
You still shouldn't split Infinity you Jamie

2726
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,280
It's just bad right

2727
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:22,656
It's a thing too badly do it.

2728
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,936
Alex now

2729
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,472
Poorly good leader

2730
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:26,752
What

2731
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:28,544
That wasn't bad

2732
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,592
So Alex now

2733
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:32,128
Had to deal with the fact that

2734
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:32,896
5 + 1

2735
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,944
Although he still in denial about it

2736
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:38,016
So now we're on his show

2737
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:43,904
Forget to the day of the inauguration and Alex announces the death of America has either whiny little titty baby

2738
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:45,184
From the Frontline

2739
02:20:45,696 --> 02:20:47,488
Of the information War

2740
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:52,096
Alex Jones

2741
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:56,192
Ladies and gentlemen it is 0 hour

2742
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:59,008
January 20th 2021

2743
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:01,824
The 46th president of the United States

2744
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:05,152
Has been installed in a giant

2745
02:21:05,664 --> 02:21:07,456
I am Chinese Joe Biden

2746
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,248
Looking like a

2747
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,016
A corpse

2748
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,552
With fake

2749
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:13,088
Hair blowing around

2750
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:14,112
Actually Jim Carrey

2751
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:17,952
Wonderful

2752
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:21,536
W76 he's really say it died

2753
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,608
January 20th the year 2021

2754
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:25,888
Very dramatic

2755
02:21:26,144 --> 02:21:27,424
Very very dramatic

2756
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:33,312
I mean in some ways he also has said the capital has fallen you know just with a different

2757
02:21:33,824 --> 02:21:34,336
Tone

2758
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:36,128
The capitalists as much as

2759
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,664
It's the same as ever

2760
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:42,016
The capital was in the hands of the Patriots were a very short. Of time

2761
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:46,368
Waverly Tire Schrodinger's Capital cuz it was up for grabs

2762
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,952
And then we observed

2763
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,512
So I guess

2764
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:54,048
I mean if you want to be

2765
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:54,816
Like

2766
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,096
Kind of

2767
02:21:57,632 --> 02:21:59,936
I don't know. One

2768
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:05,312
I mean in all honesty there is a part of that that is the Republican argument against

2769
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:10,176
Trump losing the election is like

2770
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:12,224
If you hadn't counted the votes

2771
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:13,760
We wouldn't be here

2772
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:21,440
Here's the here's one reading of this documentaries Ark

2773
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:22,208
That I think is

2774
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,256
Not with a intended but

2775
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:28,352
If you want to be really cynical about that sure and ignore all of the music

2776
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:31,424
Syracuse and the entire structure of everything

2777
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,216
You have

2778
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:39,616
Basically Alex's career he's this guy who everybody looks down on because you won't

2779
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:43,712
Compromises views and he tells the truth no matter what it cost him

2780
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:44,992
His job because

2781
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:49,088
Waco and all these station because of 911 in his liberal fanbase cuz he wouldn't

2782
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:55,744
Except Obama shrew in all this been finally has indicated right in the lead-up to the 2020

2783
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,024
Alexa, stop.

2784
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,304
The Steel stock price

2785
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,584
Finally a man

2786
02:23:00,096 --> 02:23:01,632
Because of trump who is seeing

2787
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,424
The guy

2788
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,008
He's been right all along and we were foolish not to listen Bro Hymn

2789
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:10,848
And then he has this call Natori moment on January 6th

2790
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,896
And he is completely unable

2791
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:14,176
To stop the crowd

2792
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:16,224
From taking the logical Next Step

2793
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:17,504
His rhetoric

2794
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:20,064
Which actually doesn't serve his purposes very well

2795
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,112
It doesn't end up working and then biting

2796
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:24,672
Is President kind of like a

2797
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,696
A deflation

2798
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:30,304
Yeah it's almost like all that stuff you was right about really didn't matter no

2799
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,328
Cuz Trump lost

2800
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,096
Easter 2020

2801
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:34,912
And that you weren't able to overthrow the government

2802
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:37,472
You know it is a little bit like

2803
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:41,568
Boy

2804
02:23:41,824 --> 02:23:42,592
Sucks to be input

2805
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:46,944
Yeah it had the politically especially it like in there

2806
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,480
Partially because there's nothing

2807
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,504
Behind what he say

2808
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:53,600
If you're better on the bone and therefore there's no protein

2809
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:55,648
If you were

2810
02:23:55,904 --> 02:24:01,536
I understand what you're saying

2811
02:24:01,792 --> 02:24:06,656
With your boy your metaphor because I just don't believe you are enough

2812
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:09,984
But but it is it is a little bit like

2813
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:12,288
While his speech is going on

2814
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:16,640
Right before the end whenever nobody pays its

2815
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:19,968
If you played the Benny Hill theme song

2816
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:21,248
Same thing

2817
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:26,624
Come on we can't go back to that well too many times it's in a Cantina

2818
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:31,744
Find the documentary

2819
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,280
Closing with

2820
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,048
Alex

2821
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:35,072
And his son

2822
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:36,096
Outshooting

2823
02:24:37,632 --> 02:24:43,776
This is the end this really humanizes this is hate

2824
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:46,592
Image of him and his son shooting guns

2825
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,384
I've been having some family time

2826
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,920
I meant this clip and

2827
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:52,224
With a really wistful clip

2828
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:53,248
From Alex

2829
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:55,040
No

2830
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:58,368
Refuse it's the wrong message

2831
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:00,672
He really just needs a space where you can

2832
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:01,696
Can Roman be free

2833
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:02,464
He's like

2834
02:25:02,976 --> 02:25:03,488
Buffalo

2835
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,512
Iraq

2836
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:14,240
27 years

2837
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:16,288
How is it going to

2838
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:20,128
My fear is a

2839
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:21,152
Failure not of death

2840
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:29,344
They could kill me anytime

2841
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:33,440
Hope I can do the best job I can to

2842
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:35,744
Maintain doing good work in the future

2843
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,536
However long that is and I've already

2844
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:38,560
Had a great life

2845
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:41,376
Rayman Rabbids

2846
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:51,872
Is the

2847
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:52,896
Setting

2848
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:53,664
OneAmerica

2849
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:56,736
Or is it Rising

2850
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,296
People that are well-informed

2851
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:06,208
So young Alex's monologuing over video of like a really beautiful sunset Picture Show

2852
02:26:06,464 --> 02:26:07,488
Yourself

2853
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:11,072
Not only that you haven't learned this

2854
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:12,352
You burned the opposite

2855
02:26:12,608 --> 02:26:14,400
Disgusting

2856
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,936
Yeah absolutely

2857
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:18,496
One last clip

2858
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:22,592
If you wear that thought

2859
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:26,432
Severe the shot of the sunset and then this is Alex coming in

2860
02:26:26,688 --> 02:26:28,480
With The Parting Shot of the documentary

2861
02:26:29,248 --> 02:26:31,040
The weirdness I've seen in my life

2862
02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:33,088
The bizarre happenings

2863
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:35,392
Incredible

2864
02:26:35,904 --> 02:26:36,928
Discoveries that I've been

2865
02:26:37,184 --> 02:26:38,208
Blessed to be part of

2866
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:41,024
Truth is Stranger Than

2867
02:26:43,584 --> 02:26:44,864
And that's not because I'm out

2868
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:45,888
Because of

2869
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:46,656
Time

2870
02:26:47,168 --> 02:26:48,448
Happy Wheels

2871
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:50,240
Incredible timer

2872
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:55,872
But really my personal best moments of my life

2873
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:57,408
NetSpend

2874
02:26:57,920 --> 02:26:59,456
Understanding of timelessness

2875
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:02,016
And those moments in eternity that are

2876
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,112
Those are

2877
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:09,184
Emily Eliza

2878
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:11,488
Of

2879
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:12,768
Infinity

2880
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:18,656
And also when I did mushrooms with Mike Tyson I remember when Amitabha Buddha said shoot me in the f******

2881
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:20,960
Kingface if that a****** talks about me

2882
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:22,752
You see the stats

2883
02:27:23,264 --> 02:27:25,568
You know that's not exactly how you

2884
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,592
But they're going to be

2885
02:27:27,104 --> 02:27:28,128
A Goldie in Eureka

2886
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:29,408
Better for everybody

2887
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:30,944
You know it's really painful

2888
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,224
Do you make mistakes

2889
02:27:32,480 --> 02:27:34,272
Children hurt people on the way but

2890
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:35,040
You're doing it

2891
02:27:35,296 --> 02:27:36,576
From a place of goodness

2892
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:38,880
Do you forgive yourself for that

2893
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:42,208
Process of being

2894
02:27:43,488 --> 02:27:44,256
The body injury

2895
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:51,168
I want to die

2896
02:27:51,424 --> 02:27:51,936
It's

2897
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:59,360
The right now in this hotel room it's a fairly good hockey ways and productive for me to die

2898
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:01,920
I mean what am I going to do what is better than

2899
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:03,200
How to say

2900
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:04,480
I think

2901
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:08,832
Ending the documentary with Alex expressing forgiveness for himself

2902
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:15,232
I'm really grateful that I'm allowed to be

2903
02:28:15,488 --> 02:28:18,816
Not responsible for any of my actually.

2904
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:21,632
Offensively indulgent

2905
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:23,424
And you know and here's How This Ends

2906
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:25,472
Yours have the sentence in a good world

2907
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:27,520
Animal House

2908
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:30,080
Freeze Frame

2909
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:31,360
Words

2910
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:34,688
Saying Alex is on the lam never seen again

2911
02:28:34,944 --> 02:28:37,504
That's as good as we can do for this documentary

2912
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:40,064
So if you're making this documentary doesn't end like that

2913
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,600
Then you're f****** done

2914
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:48,768
Done on the release date of this documentary Alex's in court and his lawyers being a complete ass hoe

2915
02:28:49,024 --> 02:28:50,560
Cool gas

2916
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:51,840
Yeah congratulations

2917
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,376
Can you fuc yeah man

2918
02:28:53,632 --> 02:28:54,912
Unbelievable

2919
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:56,192
This documentary sucks

2920
02:28:56,448 --> 02:29:02,080
I mean I guess I could have just summed it up that way I put in a half hours

2921
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:06,688
How many more things we need to talk about from The Trial update

2922
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:08,736
What have you

2923
02:29:09,248 --> 02:29:15,392
I think I think a lot of people are probably interested in following you on Twitter your live-tweeting

2924
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:17,696
I mean that's fun and silly and I have

2925
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:21,024
There's a little more context to like talking about what actually happened

2926
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:26,144
I totally and I'm going to be honest with you what I'm what I'm trying to do is just Infowars info

2927
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:27,936
Sprite like

2928
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:33,824
I'm not doing a good job as a journalist in any sense of the word you cited a source

2929
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:38,944
When I told you about the Saint Rose of Lima never not give you credit for telling me

2930
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:45,344
So your journalism is alright I give credit where credit is due I am credited Eugene mirman when I stole

2931
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,112
One of his jokes

2932
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:52,512
Today man of the sea

2933
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:53,280
Have

2934
02:29:53,792 --> 02:29:54,304
If you have a thought

2935
02:29:55,584 --> 02:29:58,144
It is it is quite simply that

2936
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,424
Mark

2937
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:00,448
Is

2938
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:07,104
Notification of a documentary

2939
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,408
All of these infinitive

2940
02:30:14,784 --> 02:30:16,576
Mike's emission of the documentary

2941
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:17,344
Is

2942
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:21,184
What if

2943
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:25,280
You made a bad p*** movie

2944
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:26,816
That was just

2945
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:30,400
Two and a half hours of somebody

2946
02:30:30,656 --> 02:30:31,936
Gradually

2947
02:30:32,192 --> 02:30:33,728
Ever so slowly

2948
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:35,008
Poking at a limp

2949
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:38,592
Is that is that work for you

2950
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:42,688
Does that is I feel like I've known

2951
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:47,808
I just said I'd like to drop my ear metaphor

2952
02:30:48,064 --> 02:30:50,624
Fine I think that this movie

2953
02:30:51,136 --> 02:30:51,904
Yeah it's a whole

2954
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:53,952
It's kind of excusable

2955
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:54,976
To a point

2956
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:00,352
I think the wave

2957
02:31:00,608 --> 02:31:01,888
But you talked about Alex's

2958
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:04,192
Career in terms of like

2959
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:05,984
Oklahoma City

2960
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,264
911

2961
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:13,920
If you want to portray that it's kind of mythological in this Fall's version of it whatever you're creating this me though so

2962
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:19,552
It's supposed to be said it's Corso if you're going to do that you're going to do that and whatever

2963
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:21,088
I think

2964
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:23,392
The framing of Sandy Hook

2965
02:31:23,648 --> 02:31:27,232
Is just something the people are mad about because he supported Trump is a nun

2966
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:28,000
Excusable

2967
02:31:28,256 --> 02:31:28,768
And

2968
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,560
Editorial choice

2969
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:32,864
That these documentary filmmakers are making

2970
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,888
Threatened

2971
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,936
I think they should be deeply ashamed of them

2972
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:38,240
I think that anybody who watches

2973
02:31:38,496 --> 02:31:40,800
Is this documentary like quick Glenn Greenwald

2974
02:31:41,056 --> 02:31:43,872
Or Matt Taibbi and they don't come away with the same

2975
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:45,664
Kind of conclusion

2976
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:46,688
I think

2977
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:47,712
That they

2978
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:49,248
I've lost it

2979
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:51,552
Yep I don't think it's possible to watch

2980
02:31:52,064 --> 02:31:52,832
Documentary

2981
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:55,136
Hey you know what it's responsible to

2982
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:58,208
Choose to make this

2983
02:31:58,720 --> 02:31:59,232
Like

2984
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:01,024
If that's why people don't talk about

2985
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,560
Yeah right

2986
02:32:04,352 --> 02:32:05,120
I mean look

2987
02:32:05,888 --> 02:32:09,728
The problem practice documentary

2988
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:11,776
What's be wrong about things

2989
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:12,800
Currently and loudly

2990
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,360
No I don't think that's going to work for us

2991
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:16,640
We're going to Haiti

2992
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:22,528
I don't know I keep I feel like I'm hitting my head against the wall trying to make a summation other than like

2993
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:23,552
This sucks

2994
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:25,856
It sucks

2995
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:28,928
It's bad I think even some of the

2996
02:32:29,184 --> 02:32:29,696
Stop is

2997
02:32:29,952 --> 02:32:30,464
Confusing

2998
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,512
Some of the musical choices

2999
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:36,096
Not the ones that are like really tacky and the crescendos that are like

3000
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:37,632
Overly dramatic

3001
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:38,912
Some of the other ones are

3002
02:32:39,168 --> 02:32:41,728
Very weird to pause a couple times

3003
02:32:41,984 --> 02:32:43,264
Cuz I thought something I got pop-ups

3004
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:44,288
Started playing music

3005
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:47,616
Right right right

3006
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:52,736
Pick some of the filmmaking itself is actually a little bit bad here's another thing

3007
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:54,528
Breaking Dawn

3008
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:55,808
Is like

3009
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:58,368
What about all of Alex's friends

3010
02:32:59,136 --> 02:32:59,904
Like what about

3011
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:04,000
What about pechenik name one

3012
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:06,048
What about like all of these gas

3013
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:09,376
But he's had all over the years who are complete lunatic

3014
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:12,448
The Nazi

3015
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:14,752
Adjacent guy who was his Bilderberg

3016
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:18,336
WorkSource

3017
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,104
Credits

3018
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:22,432
A Spaceman in his book above filter

3019
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:23,712
What about these

3020
02:33:23,968 --> 02:33:24,480
People like

3021
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:25,504
Chrisley

3022
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,528
You're missing a

3023
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:27,296
Big part of it

3024
02:33:27,552 --> 02:33:28,320
He's story

3025
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:31,904
If you don't recognize that a lot of his information comes from

3026
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:33,696
F****** wackos

3027
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:35,232
Right but what you're missing

3028
02:33:35,488 --> 02:33:36,768
Is that this is actually

3029
02:33:37,536 --> 02:33:39,328
Okay and I feel like I now

3030
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:40,352
Understand the

3031
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:43,424
I've come to the conclusion

3032
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,216
That what this documentary is about

3033
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:46,752
Is

3034
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:48,544
That's a man

3035
02:33:49,312 --> 02:33:50,592
At one point in time

3036
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:54,688
Is he a chosen not to do a Rush Limbaugh on Fresh

3037
02:33:55,712 --> 02:33:56,992
Couldn't find

3038
02:33:57,248 --> 02:33:58,272
The Vespers choir

3039
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:04,672
And instead he chose one Beth it is it is it is a classic poetic

3040
02:34:04,928 --> 02:34:07,488
Tale of a of a man who can

3041
02:34:07,744 --> 02:34:13,888
Go down to pass there's a beauty to that it is

3042
02:34:14,400 --> 02:34:15,168
Gorgeous

3043
02:34:15,424 --> 02:34:21,568
So we'll be back with another episode I think I think the next one probably will be

3044
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:23,360
About the Glenn Greenwald thing

3045
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:26,944
But we may be able to also have a court recap in that

3046
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:32,320
Cuz we can maybe make it a bumble episode or something record I would be shocked at how much

3047
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,088
We record

3048
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:36,928
Absolutely

3049
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:40,000
We're leaving the livestream on like the courtroom

3050
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:44,096
Everybody can just occasionally listen to us.

3051
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:47,680
So I will be back but until then

3052
02:34:55,616 --> 02:34:56,640
Super late so I'm to tell you

3053
02:34:56,896 --> 02:35:03,040
Go to bed Jordans no I have to get this app out a couple hours

3054
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:08,672
Yeah you know Saturday Leo I'm dzx Clark

3055
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,256
It's always something
