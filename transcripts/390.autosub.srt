1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody looking technology

5
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,704
Jordan damn you're doing that like the finally those Rock

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,104
Podcast

7
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Little bit of a

8
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Subtle Jab

9
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,296
You know what a lot of people say to me Jordan

10
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
You don't scream enough

11
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,160
Consistently that's the review I guess

12
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
Dear. Have you ever been

13
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:38,816
Sure of what

14
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,584
Somebody looked

15
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Just by their voice

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
And then saw them in real life and when

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
No idea.

18
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
No clue that that could possibly be

19
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:51,872
Yeah I mean like I think the standard one is like radio people

20
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Loving

21
00:01:54,176 --> 00:02:00,320
I talk radio and when I was much younger thee like y107

22
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
Personalities are like the morning show

23
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
It's like we had it

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Liquor in

25
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
Turning thing

26
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,744
Dang it my junior high or middle school

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,144
You go when you find someplace and you do a day of turning and I love radio so I wanted to go to the

28
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
And so I went

29
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
And not only did I learn

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,824
Nothing like what I thought their voices look like

31
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
And not in a terrible

32
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Most of them were way more attractive

33
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
Then I imagine

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,904
Yeah I don't know that was the image of head of my head but I thought they hide behind a bike because it's something

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,304
You never see pictures of a lot of these right people I like plastered all up all over the Play Store

36
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,448
On the radio aren't too big celebrities butts

37
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,496
And the other thing that I learned was that like

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
There were at least

39
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
A couple of them

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
That were multiple differ

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Different people on different radio shows

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Oh yeah

43
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Like

44
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:04,320
I don't even remember what their names to be but they're like I'm icon The Morning Show and then they do an afternoon shell

45
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,904
Voice in a slightly different

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,512
I'd like my world shattered

47
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
No

48
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
That's a look behind the curtain moment there

49
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Cuz I remember like my parents had to pick

50
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Pick me up but like

51
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,312
I remember them telling me

52
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,640
As a guy who really loved radio and wanted to

53
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
Don't do this

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
All the sudden their real voices they just like

55
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,952
Today got a kill you I'll eat you up alive

56
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Like this is

57
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
The future of what

58
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
I think

59
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Those before allotted the

60
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Play Jack FM

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
Type stuff works ship those

62
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
Things are coming Grandpa

63
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,472
In the field you probably

64
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Had some

65
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
The sense that this is what was going to call the evolving Market of radio disappearing and then also

66
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
It doesn't pay well it kind of sucks

67
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,344
I don't imagine many more hours to work in the

68
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Newspaper in this

69
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
History that's it's probably not good advice these

70
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
I don't know it any hours

71
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,768
You know if you got to be up real early

72
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,351
For newspaper a like morning shows

73
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
You don't want it going to be up at 3

74
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:27,263
Fu comedian 2

75
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
Babe do the morning radio thing

76
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
I wake up at

77
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
3 every morning in your leg you should

78
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:38,527
Stop that's not a bad schedule if you can get used to it and if your life allows it but I find it very

79
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,319
Very difficult to adjust to it

80
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,879
Either you stay up

81
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,279
I got to learn more about Gary Allan

82
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
Like this do I

83
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Overnight

84
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,935
Radio show about

85
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,263
Weirdo Communists nonsense

86
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,663
Love you guys because Robert Evans friend finally saw a picture of him

87
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,015
You put that picture up of a owen Shroyer

88
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
Yeah and I have never I've never seen Owen Shroyer

89
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:17,695
No more I never looked him up I did the whole point of the show is don't look at it

90
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
That's really weird cuz you talk to Adam for a long time

91
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:23,327
Completely different than what I expected

92
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,119
He's a weirdo

93
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
Yeah baby

94
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,935
What is a guy with a

95
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Beard

96
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Nonexistent

97
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,615
Or trim down mustache

98
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
Disgusted look for a little while

99
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
I'm not proud I wouldn't go back to

100
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
But now

101
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
I think I will but hey I have been denied

102
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,647
Heritage

103
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,951
They felt like I was honoring it through my

104
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Shaving the mustache

105
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,279
Of course I'm also part lumberjack

106
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,375
Backside the chop stash in a little while done it all

107
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,007
In the facial hair games Lumberjack meeting you worked as a lumberjack part-time I assume

108
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
No I just have a beer

109
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:12,735
Alterations by Caspar I know a bit about learning that people on the radio look different than you think

110
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
About what you do

111
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
Expecting

112
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,207
Something episode that I'm going to call

113
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,023
Grab bag mini soap

114
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,095
We do not have a full episode

115
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,703
Here but we're going to do is we're going to put out of this sort of scattered

116
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
There's a there's a couple of interesting things that are worth touching on

117
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
And then on Friday will be back with a full regular episode

118
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:40,895
Covering one

119
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,551
And it's going to be interesting to figure out what that will be because Alex is still on the East Coast

120
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,391
He went to the rally in Virginia on Monday in Richmond

121
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,999
And then now he's in DC because the impeachment hearing it started

122
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,303
Like I can't do it without him

123
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,399
Well I thought that he was going to be doing his show from DC that would make

124
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
Have to do he's not in the hearings right

125
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:13,151
Just be live doing his show in a hotel room in d.c.

126
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:19,551
Jerome corsi was supposed to be setting something up there I think you took the right to not workout

127
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,367
There is no Bureau in in d.c.

128
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
He could easily be doing

129
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
Something Wild

130
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:31,071
Abdul is up there with him he could be watching the impeachment hearings anything that's important you can come in

131
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:37,471
Scribbled on a piece of paper like easy we figured out our issues so much harder than the

132
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
Very simple

133
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,895
It's been hosting because he had a heart attack

134
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
No flying is out of the question

135
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:47,967
Travel

136
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,783
He's a steady hand to Alex's got him in studio

137
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Jhonni Blaze

138
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,623
If it if it comes down to it then like

139
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
You get there won't be an episode with Alex

140
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
Really except for butting into do like little

141
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,607
Truth is rising

142
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,191
I halfway expect him to start to try to false-flag some

143
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:13,055
This is that if you guys won't do it I'll do it myself god dad

144
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
I'm really bored

145
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:19,711
Yes I do I don't know what to Friday's episode of B but we will get back with

146
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,015

151

00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
No it's not

186
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
Phillipsburg

187
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Glitzburgh

188
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:19,519
Prune like a Nordic rune and hieroglyphic

189
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
Anger is a speedo

190
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Alright

191
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
Andrew Reynolds

192
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
Triple kickflip

193
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,199
Play too much alike that alright

194
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,735
Anyway thank you Chad

195
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:35,135
Signed up on an elevated level appreciate that very much so Steven thank you so much

196
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
You are now a technocrat

197
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
Thank you so much

198
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,975
You and I will check

199
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
We got to go

200
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:48,959
What's the business

201
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Heroin

202
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,847
Freakishly large

203
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
Thank you so much

204
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,503
Yes figure

205
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
Website.com

206
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
The sports show we would appreciate it be very helpful

207
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:16,863
So where we're going to start here today Jordan is we are going to be looking at the before and after of the Virginia

208
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
Second

209
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
An amendment rally

210
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,007
We're on the other side of it recording is on Tuesday we know that the Civil War

211
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,543
Did not start

212
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
Alex's

213
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:30,175
I don't know what you would call infirm that with an outside media source

214
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Eventually but

215
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,879
So on the 8th

216
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
18th of January over the week

217
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,535
Alex put out a little bit of a emergency message

218
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
It's this is before the Wrath

219
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
This is the sort of Tanner

220
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,423
But Alex is really bringing

221
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,031
And I know that we talked a bit about his coverage on

222
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:00,383
The show already on a Monday episode but I think it's still worthwhile to check

223
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
A little bit about this

224
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,711
Because I think there's something that's really important

225
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
You can see

226
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
In the aftermath

227
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
In the responses

228
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,391
Cuz of how people behave so here is the beginning of this from January 18th

229
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:17,023
We have cracked the code we understand the glove was false flag operation plan for next week

230
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,839
Y'all wonder why did Pelosi

231
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,911
Rush impeachment then hold it back for almost a month

232
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,239
They were liable under that Martin Luther King Day

233
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,311
Yearly gun marches happen for 20 years

234
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,103
In Virginia at the Kappa

235
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,199
They're planning stage mass shootings bombing or false Flags

236
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,807
The American people against gun owners and President Trump

237
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
The pre-programming is a

238
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Thousand percent clear

239
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:43,903
It is

240
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,303
Absolutely imperative it everyone understands that the globalist

241
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:56,703
Are losing their fight against America The Awakening is huge and they are betting everything on planning from

242
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,079
Supporters are white supremacist pro-gun and who are going to come kill law enforcement

243
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,919
Pretty clear I mean if you have a situation where Alex is

244
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
Predicting that there's going to be bombings and mass shootings

245
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
And

246
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Dupree scripting is 1,000

247
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
Preside clear

248
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
And it turns out that

249
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
His predictions are not true

250
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
It has to make you

251
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,791
Bring into your mind the possibility that hey maybe you don't know how to read

252
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
Espree scripting s***

253
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,631
Or maybe you're just making that stuff up

254
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
That's possible I mean some people do you know when they're shooting movie some people

255
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Do you have same-day rewrite

256
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
You know they did better

257
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
The script on the scene

258
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
Comics to come in to do punch up

259
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:41,759
Although I like it

260
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,831
I don't know if that's what they're doing

261
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
But

262
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,719
So Alex has this very clear this is the prediction that is what is going

263
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,535
Any tells people Hitman

264
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
Brinkoetter

265
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
If you want

266
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Brent Gunn

267
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,935
The rally hate but

268
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,983
That's not the most important

269
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Bring your gun

270
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,615
I'm totally for the Second Amendment I've done open carry marches all over the United States

271
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,687
We really need

272
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,759
If people with cameras watching the leftist

273
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
Antifa in that weirdo that they've gotten drugged up at some Hotel like a Southern Poverty Law Center has done before

274
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,975
Who they're going to use as their passing

275
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,047
Because this is one that dictates going to make their move

276
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
The planets have aligned

277
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
The trial starts the day after this in Virginia

278
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
And on every channel they say the right-wing Terror attacks are coming the cops are all going to get killed

279
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
Because they always pre-program before

280
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
They stayed something

281
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
All over the news they weren't saying that that's what Alex

282
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Turd

283
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,271
Because he thinks

284
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,063
He can read secret messages

285
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,111
In the news in the same way Steve

286
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,463
Mechanic thinks the newspaper is communicating directly to him

287
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
That is how these

288
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,839
Folks like Alex and Steve work out there like all this

289
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
What's going on

290
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
I know the secret codes of the universe entirely acceptable thing for people with a massive flat

291
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Form to act as though the T

292
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
TV and the newspapers are

293
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:16,735
Talking directly to them right that makes perfect sense and interpreting secret messages that are directed towards them

294
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,551
That is behavior that we encourage in all

295
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,855
Now it's interesting that's like

296
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
They can take some different shapes

297
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Like this

298
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,999
With Steve he literally does think of the newspaper is sending him message

299
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,631
I think he doesn't even leave that the security Community is speaking directly to him and that's how he stays in

300
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
In contact with the security Community he has implied

301
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Things

302
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:43,871
Is very very close to that prosticks that he thinks he's getting from the

303
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:48,991
Six or word search okay. The jumbled is like oh my God call swag coming

304
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,783
I'm not sure exactly

305
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
At the mechanics

306
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,719
Sudoku I'm going to blame that he's been pretty clear that what he believes is that there is like direct messages to him

307
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Through whether it's

308
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
Like specific Riders

309
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,815
Newspapers or

310
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Or whatever

311
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Alex

312
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
On the other hand seems to think

313
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
That the band The globalist yes

314
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,239
Need to get these coded

315
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Messages after all of their people

316
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,871
Right and what have you and he's able to read their language

317
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,455
And that's why he's able to deduce all of the stuff there

318
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,503
And that's just ludicrous

319
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Very much

320
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Also like

321
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
He's clearly saying that

322
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
According to him what he believed

323
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:34,303
Is it there he's already someone drugged up in a hotel room

324
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
Morris Dees

325
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
Individually keeping under house arrest ready to launch out

326
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,847
I'm in same day you got a book that trip in advance they had to get a good hotel rate

327
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
The globalists are Thrift

328
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
See if anything else

329
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:54,271
Right right program they've got rewards points that they're using to false

330
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,135
Hey. My My Name a little wrong there

331
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,695
Yeah I I just I think this is

332
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,999
I mean the word of the day for that is

333
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
Is Justin Sation

334
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
It's ludicrous

335
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
And now the narrative has

336
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:09,887
Become

337
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
But this is all I mean

338
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
But the owner lifesteps

339
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
On his

340
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,847
Is on Broadway

341
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Vance

342
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,711
Largely to do with Trump

343
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Impeachment

344
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:27,295
Like all of this

345
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
Of course they want to race war

346
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
That's really also about

347
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
The mostly about getting Trump

348
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
What what you can't do two things at the same time

349
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Blazing gentlemen

350
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
They're going to make their moves I've been saying for months during the Trump Trauma Center I told you

351
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:49,311
They have no evidence

352
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,943
Because they don't want Trump to take it serious my gut is always right

353
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,223
They want them to take it as a

354
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
The jokes and be ready for one defense

355
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Abuse of power by the president

356
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Blocking Congress of trucks

357
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,415
Congress

358
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,559
But what they're really going to be doing is using the trial as a way to have him under judgment

359
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:16,703
While they cause race riots Federal Building

360
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
The reason Alex has been saying that Vermont

361
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Is that I think he has a key

362
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Keen sense

363
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
The Trump being impeached

364
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,359
Might

365
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,383
Triggered

366
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
Some sort of a right-wing reaction

367
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,479
Manifest itself

368
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,783
Extremist violence

369
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:37,439
Any of those I mean he had all sorts of people from across the right-wing talking about there will be War

370
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
You see it across

371
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,095
Cancel wide spectrum of right-wing sources it's not unique

372
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
Alex the show but its rhetoric that certainly has been on his show

373
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
So it serves his interests

374
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
In terms of this pre-emptive narrative building

375
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
To associate

376
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:58,687
Like this is after this clip is after arrest for

377
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
Prior to that he's saying that this is going

378
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,039
2

379
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,879
Virginia rally is where things are going to pop off

380
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,975
But it's also about the truck that they put

381
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,255
Evening pietschmann

382
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,583
Impeached him right in order to have him there

383
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
In the state of judgement

384
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
Yes so then they

385
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:26,591
Could set off all of these race Wars and bombing Federal Building sure make Trump look naughty

386
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,895
That's what that's their goal

387
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:35,295
Alright I think that's I think that's

388
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Counterproductive stupid

389
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Any of these words work

390
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,695
If you look at it through the correct prism of how he

391
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
He operates from a propaganda rhetoric standpoint

392
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,791
What he's doing is

393
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Creating a just

394
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,607
Suffocation preemptively

395
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:51,423
In case as the impeachment does go along

396
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,239
Let's say somebody blows something up yeah

397
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,847
Now you're like of course of course they're just doing that 12

398
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:02,687
All I told you I told you

399
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
Right absolute

400
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
All

401
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,527
It works this way

402
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Court how he operates

403
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,599
So

404
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,671
You know we got already suggestion that

405
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
There's a guy

406
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
In hotel room

407
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,279
Course of the globalists and the splc and

408
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,071
Morris Dees

409
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,351
Alright

410
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Are you getting ready

411
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Say which hotel

412
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,215
Did they put them up in a nice place a really good letter

413
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
I would

414
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,847
He's drugged up though so you don't hear nobody knows

415
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
This is not spelled out bios

416
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,039
But he does talk a little more about

417
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:44,159
Besoros funded by the crate that class to say that one poor woman dying was Trump's fault

418
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,207
Babe.

419
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,999
Make this move

420
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
Screw the pooch with the attack

421
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,655
With what happened with Pelosi with other making sense unless they've got something big

422
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:04,127
I'm saying they're going to wash everything they've got in the next 3 or 4 days and

423
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,527
People need to be aware of it. Fueled up in my view message

424
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,184
Mentally ill white supremacy in hotel rooms right now they're telling me it's the second coming of Jesus you are the Lord

425
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,072
Have some more drugs and go out and kill a bunch of cops and that's why everybody said it's got to be on a swivel

426
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,424
So what Alex is doing their is making it so even if

427
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Character is

428
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,032
Sickly and according to all available information

429
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,312
Someone who does

430
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Commit one of these terrorist attacks

431
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
Look according to

432
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,944
To everything available

433
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Dead to rights

434
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:44,832
There a right-wing meth head white supremacist

435
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
They were being coached by the

436
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,952
Now admittedly all of them

437
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:55,072
That stuff that he described them as being coached to say is stuff that he himself has said multiple

438
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Right

439
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Something people do then say

440
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
It's okay to kill cops if they try to take your gun

441
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,544
This is the way you will knock your late your audience from believing

442
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
Any of this stuff is real even if

443
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
All available evidence

444
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,920
Indicates that it is real

445
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,712
If somebody he's running

446
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
Very clear explicit interference for right-wing

447
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,576
Domestic terrorism

448
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
Answer you have been

449
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:21,184
Particularly with his discussion of the the Texas

450
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,488
Domestic terrorism threat assessment

451
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
That's

452
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
That's the that's the name of the game

453
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
And it's very clear

454
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,400
If anybody asks on what I said clearly

455
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
Verilife

456
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
And they were coached by the globalist

457
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Because wouldn't that be perfect

458
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,176
If I were them it's telling you to do that

459
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,760
What so this was recorded and put out on the 18th

460
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:51,136
So you said they're going to do it within the three or four days is not the evening of the 21st

461
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Recording

462
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
Have a gun

463
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,768
No are you sure I get that confirmed

464
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,072
Deadline isn't going

465
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:05,472
To be up until you know this episode will be out so I guess we'll have to wait until Friday will everyone know for sure

466
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
So far prediction not looking good

467
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Pirelli

468
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,312
Not great

469
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,616
He's got he's always 100% right though

470
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Bright

471
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,664
Because he breeds

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
The Prieto

473
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
Victorville

474
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
Television talking to it

475
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:22,112
I can't imagine him actually knowing how to read in the first place

476
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
Let alone a secondary level of reading that goes

477
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,280
I think that the secondary level is required because the primary wanted

478
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
As week

479
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,352
I suspect that that's how he

480
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,376
He gets by

481
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:35,424
So in this last clip

482
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
From his

483
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,728
Emergency warning

484
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:38,752
Alex

485
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Gives himself

486
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,312
A way out

487
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,872
Will they be able to pull it off I pray and hope not

488
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,920
They're not fully right now

489
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:50,016
They're badly organized

490
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Are you talking about you

491
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
But the false flag

492
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:01,280
Governor Northam has already launched a civil war or white supremacist when he's the one wearing KKK outfits

493
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:05,376
And they're going to make their move their the media's going to make their move there

494
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,776
The day before the trial begins to make it all about that pressure on the Senate to remove the

495
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:17,920
President so I mean you can just kind of threw out that three to four days prediction he said it's going to happen

496
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,200
$100

497
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
That was always right

498
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,040
But the globalist also might

499
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:29,440
Be too weak to pull this off you never know but I just said that

500
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,448
Infinite is a organization that has existed since the dawn of human history of

501
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,264
Apparently they're very poorly

502
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Still working at

503
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,688
Governor Northam didn't say this is going to be a civil war

504
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Are white supremacists terrorists

505
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:53,760
Already

506
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
Initiate the false flag

507
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
No

508
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
So as we're on the other side of this recording

509
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:01,184
What's on the 21st we know that there was not

510
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
Civil war that broke out

511
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,000
Call Alex

512
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:08,864
It's very queer like in that warning message that like that they're going to make their move

513
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
He's very he's repeatedly talkin about

514
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,056
Them having a drugged-up of meth head or whatever Jean people

515
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
And it's extreme

516
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
It's it's

517
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
Nonsensical

518
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,200
Sensationalism so now on the other side

519
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:27,040
Let's go check out Paul Joseph Watson Twitter

520
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,832
What's this tweet here from the 20th

521
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Other media fear-mongering about the Virginia rally as that just

522
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
Did four weeks before the Joker came out

523
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,072
Same result nothing happened it was all alarms to stereo

524
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,888
No history on this

525
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,192
Dang that's a bummer

526
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
I seriously believe that some people in the media and on the left are disappointed the Virginia rally went off peacefully

527
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:55,968
Strongly disagree yeah I'm going to go with

528
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:57,504
What's this

529
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,296
Paul Joseph Watson article from

530
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
The 20th

531
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
The same day is this

532
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,416
Here's a headline for you quote

533
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:06,208
Conservative activist

534
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,608
Queens antifa is planning to Stage violence in Virginia and blame it on procon protester rights right so the fee

535
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,656
Fear-mongering in the media.

536
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Include health

537
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,008
Conservative author and activist Tom DeWeese

538
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,360
Claims he has received credible information suggesting antifa members of planning stage violin

539
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,920
Virginia later today

540
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
On pro gun

541
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
One protester

542
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,808
Those media figures stoking a fear monger

543
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
Yeah that's awful

544
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,416
Ryan based on a tweet here

545
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:37,952
Tom DeWeese

546
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:44,352
I'm in Richmond and I've just received information from a very reliable source concerning Monday's rally against the legislators gun grab

547
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:48,704
Antifa rented seven buses to bring in their Thugs and cause trouble

548
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,544
The report says they will be wearing Maga hat swearing-in are agar

549
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,592
They'll pretend to be pro-gun people

550
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,968
Meanwhile others posing as Democrats holding anti-gun signs will stand on the side

551
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,504
The antifa thugs pretend

552
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,624
I need to be pro-gun will attack the sign holders okay making it look like a pro-gun people have started violence

553
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,672
This is the plan okay

554
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,952
You know when you're making a

555
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
Complete and total bullsh

556
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,536
Do you like the use of the number 7

557
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,096
I think that's a great number that grabs your attention

558
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
7 bus

559
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,704
Bright

560
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
So I mean

561
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,032
You know you see the game here

562
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,848
Anyway Alex gets back into Studio

563
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
Actually doesn't

564
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,408
You just recorded something and it

565
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Advance

566
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,992
Play at the beginning of the show on the 21st

567
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,528
And he seems to be taking

568
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,088
Credit for the fact that the Civil War

569
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,792
Is the fact that won the publishers

570
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
We just saw in Virginia

571
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
People

572
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,664
Stopped

573
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,944
Stampede

574
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Your prayers have eyes action

575
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,856
But yeah

576
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
It shows we got to have action on the ground

577
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:16,512
There's a strange phenomenon the more viewers and more traffic we have the Infowars

578
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,304
Video

579
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,424
Money we have coming in out of a bunch of big sales just ended

580
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:27,008
We have crippling low amounts of money coming in right now

581
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:33,408
We need to keep him for supper for just the next year that we're delivering

582
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,528
Square.com

583
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,344
American

584
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,696
That translates to I think I've probably milked my dedicated audio

585
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:52,864
Some lucky loser are checking in to see what the f*** I'm yelling about

586
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Is not a sustainable way

587
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,544
Just go I do like the cash crunch don't bring your whole team to Washington DC for a week

588
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:05,408
Like weird attempted a public spectacle

589
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,736
That is my advice don't behave that way if that's

590
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,808
The truth as a an immature financial advisor

591
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:13,856
Right

592
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:20,512
So Alex's you know his angle on it is this a you know a we stopped a false-flag when we all come out and

593
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,280
Moraware

594
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:26,144
This is how he's able to have it coming and going you can see if Bo demonstration of how this goes

595
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,936
Wait people into a frenzy

596
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
Something bad happened

597
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
You predicted it

598
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:33,056
Nothing bad happens we we

599
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:36,128
And that is I do like him not only taking credit

600
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
For stopping

601
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,480
Any violent but also using that as a sales pitch

602
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Like totally

603
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
How are we going to stop

604
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
More violent unless

605
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,112
You buy stuff from Infowars

606
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Soda

607
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
So that is kind of a tale of the tape

608
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
There and I think

609
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:56,864
I know that we covered a lot of that on Monday earliest the like sort of the lead-up

610
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
And how he was behaving

611
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
Before the rally

612
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,448
But I think it's

613
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,056
I think it is worthwhile to take a look at like this is me before and after that

614
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,640
The Bread is made this is how this whole

615
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
World of bulshit operate

616
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
And it'll

617
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,016
Ensures itself

618
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,368
Non invalidation with the eyes of people who have bought in

619
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,904
So

620
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
I want to take us now to this ad

621
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
Did I write that I found

622
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,536
John the 17th

623
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Alex

624
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,584
Pre-recorded

625
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:33,984
Is that message we played on the last episode about how you don't need to feel white gillibrand then

626
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,616
Jimi Hendrix are not races weird please buy stuff weird weird pre-recorded at

627
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,896
Ben Paul Joseph Watson

628
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,176
Took over and saw lighter

629
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:42,944
Turned off

630
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:47,040
It turns out that there was another ad

631
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,344
Another pre-recorded thing

632
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,928
In the second hour

633
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,696
That

634
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,464
I thought it was

635
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,744
Super Bazaar

636
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,048
We're going to listen to a little bit of that here

637
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,608
It starts with Alex disorder

638
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
You know cuz he's still before the rally at this point

639
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,984
He's talking about the how it's going to be a false flag

640
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,032
We're going to be there all next week

641
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
Bring It live

642
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,616
The federal holiday

643
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Ruby

644
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
And Virginia

645
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Thirtysomething

646
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Virginia

647
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
For the laugh

648
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
Is openly trying to

649
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,296
Cause martial law and tried to

650
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,136
But all this insane garbage

651
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
This is America

652
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Reply

653
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:30,048
The football game where bicep going to head in the third quarter one

654
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
I made it.

655
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,888
Easier

656
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
Addison the football game versus the Hulk

657
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Humanity

658
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
Being fought out in America

659
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,520
Weather right now

660
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
The future of humanity

661
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Rest

662
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,872
Like the difference

663
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,664
Between good and bad is

664
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
Alex

665
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Stopping

666
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,504
False flag

667
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Obvious

668
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,880
I don't understand why you play games like this like when you rent relief

669
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
How do you escalate

670
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Like where do you go next

671
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,280
Future of the world right

672
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:06,400
Alex save the world on Monday I mean you got to go galaxy neck

673
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,496
I think that's the only way to go he's actually going to be a man in Black

674
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:13,056
I could go talk to Carrie he's agent Jerry

675
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,080
Sure

676
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:18,176
I don't know anyway that's not the main point of this little piece

677
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,224
This we get to that here

678
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,528
Navigate to Ramona

679
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,576
Let me just do this up front again

680
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
Tenda plug

681
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
At the end of things and do it like

682
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:29,952
Apologizing

683
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
This dog

684
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
Doesn't he

685
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
This dog doesn't win

686
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,888
Unless you buy the

687
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Like seeing some old boreas

688
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Happier

689
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:45,824
Been a pig

690
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
You know what

691
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:47,360
When I take

692
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
When I take

693
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:50,944
X 2 x 3

694
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:51,968
When I take the

695
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Confusion

696
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
I can't wait

697
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,832
3 months now

698
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
I can't work for me

699
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:00,928
Organic

700
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
What

701
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Organic

702
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Attached

703
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
ABS again

704
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
You know their test

705
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
$10 stuff

706
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Find something

707
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,432
That's just about how a couple years back BuzzFeed did a piece worth

708
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:29,344
Egyptian God stop saying that always happen

709
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,160
Indicates to me is that like he's working with bad suppliers or

710
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,976
There's something because it shouldn't take you a quarter of a year

711
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,816
To actually get something to pass a test

712
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
This product

713
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,144
The everyone loves has been sold out for

714
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,168
Quarter

715
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,008
Yeah a full quarter unfortunately

716
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,568
Yeah I was going to say the only way that

717
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,128
Show me why they can take 4 months

718
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
To test something is if it takes

719
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
Three-and-a-half months

720
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,760
23 and a half months filled with failed that

721
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,880
I assume that has to be what it is the restock

722
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,952
I mean I think that might be more likely

723
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,816
I don't know what it is I don't know what the reality is behind it but

724
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
Like what he's Express

725
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,888
Can't possibly be okay

726
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
You can't have

727
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,056
If it was so hard to pass these standard how is anything organic

728
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,920
Just called Gwyneth Paltrow to use the same s*** borrow some of hers

729
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,688
I don't

730
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,992
This is just bad business whatever it is

731
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,576
I once I once did

732
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,720
A couple of sample ad reads when I was trying to get some voice-over action for a little bit

733
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,256
The great Hustle

734
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:47,680
I remember reading so many like a husband-and-wife little conversations or like

735
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
I don't know where to get my tires done like that kind of stuff I would rather have read one of these address

736
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
Incoherent rambling that starts with a

737
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,320
The world are out of stock for four months of his intestines hard

738
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:07,136
By other things

739
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Christianbook

740
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,744
Voiceover ads included

741
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Hey I got bad news

743
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,376
If you want living defense

744
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,912
That's one of Alex's Providence

745
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,704
You also can't buy that

746
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Defense

747
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Fremont

748
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,360
Three months

749
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Are you mad

750
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
It two days ago

751
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
And I said listen

752
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
Supposed to take 12 weeks for this

753
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,832
The order and they said yes

754
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,368
But we

755
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Continue

756
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Adjust

757
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
It's not

758
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,608
Everybody else just

759
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,144
Slap the label on thing

760
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,168
This doesn't pass.

761
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,192
Eastandard

762
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
A billion

763
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
The air

764
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,848
But they like California

765
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,920
Toxic waste Ridin to the water calling at fluoride

766
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
There's a waiver for that

767
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Alright buddy

768
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Joan

769
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:12,928
So

770
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Inelastic comes down to

771
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
I don't understand what is going on

772
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
What does Alex think that his business would be crippled if there was a warning label on the bottle that says B has laid in it

773
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,104
It would really counter all of his this is the best most

774
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Perfect stuff

775
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
That you could ever put inside your body if it

776
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,456
It comes with a warning label say

777
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Not in California

778
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,088
I got yeah I mean I guess if your business model is based on this being the best

779
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,184
To keep up the appearances and keep warning labels off

780
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
I meant I think that's

781
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,304
Maybe a limitation of the business model

782
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,632
Again this isn't that this is a voiceover ad read I want like

783
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
This is like

784
00:36:55,168 --> 00:37:01,312
Hey get all of your auto needs taken care of at AutoZone except for headlights we can

785
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,640
Get headlight out of a don't work

786
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:12,576
So Alex is that you sold out on a lot of stuff and they're not doing a good job

787
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
Weird

788
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,928
He's also defensive

789
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,208
About

790
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,256

Poisonous

797
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
But the water tables

798
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
Poison

799
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:34,336
Body that's a revolution some other things and they got more poison into it

800
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,176
I realized after WWII the water was so toxic

801
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:39,968
Did they put

802
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
Fluoride

803
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272

So you want regulations

808
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,464
In the water and fat

809
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488

810
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Poison in the cover-up

811
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
Poison that was already in the war

812
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,888

Vines about

830
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:45,760
And also the problem is not so much that Alex sells water filters

831
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
It's that it

832
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Peers

833
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,112
That's some of his behaviors

834
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,440
Inspired by the things he sells

835
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:59,840

00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,784
Thinking person would have

844
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Grounds

845
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Disrespect

846
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,856

00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:11,999
Come on down to AutoZone unfortunately we don't have any headlights obviously we can't get them to pass California

926
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:15,839
But that reminds me a lot of Bill Clinton getting a blowie

927
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,679
So how about that look how big that piston is over there

928
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
Wouldn't be that big dick

929
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
What

930
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,871
Apparently AutoZone

931
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
This is

932
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,735
Pre-recorded add read

933
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,295
With the Monica Lewinsky joking

934
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,951
I think it's unwise also for Alex to be making Monica Lewinsky jokes

935
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,231
Context of like

936
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Hey there's an impeachment going there is that there is that it kind of calls to mind how trivial the last one was

937
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,495
That might not be in your best interest

938
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
I like

939
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,335
You know you want to make fun of Bill Clinton or go ahead all you want

940
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,639
I feel like a specially now

941
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,687
In the present day 2020

942
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:09,087
It's really shity to still be making Lewinsky joke out of

943
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
Whatever

944
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,159
Attack you want to make on the clintons

945
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
They took her it took her what

946
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
20 years to reclaim her

947
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Reality

948
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,887
You something like that

949
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,679
Look at what he's looking at the pills

950
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
These are big

951
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
He says

952
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,263
Monica Lewinsky could handle

953
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,847
Lakes at the beginning of it is not attacking Bill relief

954
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:33,407
A joke about her that is

955
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
I bet

956
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Well it's cheap and it's just

957
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
I think it's lame

958
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
Also these pills aren't that big

959
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
I can't

960
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
Recipe

961
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
Pics of special about these pills is

962
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,463
Not unique

963
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
It is

964
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:50,303
An attribute of every

965
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,863
Single fish oil pill I've ever seen in my life

966
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,935
We are look I'm sorry we're out of the life

967
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,495
Fence that's that's really tough

968
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,335
However take these fish oil pills that I call Lil clintons

969
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,407
Based on a Monica Lewinsky joke that is incredibly

970
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,479
Time Lake again this is a pre-recorded ad

971
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
Pre-record

972
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,319
It seems like every point in time they could have been like just stop

973
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
It seems like

974
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
Has to be because

975
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,159
He's going

976
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,695
To d.c.

977
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:21,023
And like he's supposed to be there like in a couple hours

978
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,863
Unless he's taking like a helicopter from the Infowars roof

979
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,727
I still don't think you could make it already

980
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,591
It has to be pre-recorded but you also understand

981
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:36,895
He's not a to take kind of guy

982
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,223
That's true I don't think he's got to get to to the east

983
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:46,111
That's fair as all these things take got to keep it in

984
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,927
It's like the movie 1917 it's all one big pig

985
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,695
Sure

986
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,231
So it starts complaining

987
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,279
About to drag queen story time

988
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,559
Story Hour

989
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:58,911
And who cares we don't need to listen to a lot of this but I think he said something

990
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
That is absolutely not true

991
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,311
Pedophile drag queen Story Time like 5 years ago

992
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,383
And people is not that big a deal

993
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,687
It's my library

994
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,503
What the hell parachuting in fat dudes

995
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
Clown outfit

996
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:16,575
Okay

997
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,343
Okay

998
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:23,999
So do you think it's fair that Alex has been on this beat 45 years

999
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,559
Probably not

1000
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,631
No drag queen Story Time 1 hour

1001
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,215
I did the starting 2015 but we've listened

1002
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
20 20 20 15

1003
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Almost all of it

1004
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,847
Yeah and I can confidently say

1005
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
Do not come up

1006
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,199
Route and I don't think I remember him being on the beach

1007
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
I also don't

1008
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:48,319
Think that they are remaking Operation Dumbo Drop with fat

1009
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
Certainly I don't think that's

1010
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
No

1011
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Nope

1012
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Operation it MacLeod

1013
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,743
Alex

1014
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,815
You know he's rambling a bit it doesn't seem like

1015
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,351
It seems like he's lost the

1016
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
The thread a little bit anyway

1017
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
Pre-recorded but it gets back to

1018
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
What not everybody looks like rice.

1019
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,359
Most of our

1020
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,455
Okay imma stop you know I am I am

1021
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735

Planets really up right now

1023
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:22,879
Governor's right now

1024
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
Cuz you're not there

1025
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
Is tell you that

1026
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
I need funding

1027
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:33,119
It's like a missile eats fuel

1028
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
And I will

1029
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
Hippie anime

1030
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
But

1031
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,799
You got to have the best hunting dog around like I said stop

1032
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
But you did

1033
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,383
You don't feed it

1034
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
You don't get more

1035
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,455
And you don't need

1036
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
Flea

1037
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Asia's got

1038
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,295
He's going to roll over

1039
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
One more

1040
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
Quite frankly I'm not

1041
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
Hot dogs in really great shape

1042
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,911
Is that he's getting a little bit too in better shape I think it's largely because he stopped drinking

1043
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:13,567
If you know what hey take that dog that you're talking about and I get it drunk for years

1044
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:18,431
Then take away the booze I bet it'll look better be it'll be better if I just have one

1045
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
Thing to say which is

1046
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:20,479
Where's knock

1047
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
How many

00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,367
Dead dog references going to get on this show that won't even slip by me a little bit

1049
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,903
Yeah I don't know

1050
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,975
I just seen others just desperation

1051
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
Like you need to

1052
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
You need to give money at

1053
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:39,679
Anyway this this next with Alex is going out to break the ends up doing it

1054
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
At least two segments by kind of lost my

1055
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,263
My patience for

1056
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,799
It is a Searchlight

1057
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
What do you eat are you goes out to break

1058
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,895
And he's yelling about how the globalist

1059
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
They really hate

1060
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
You

1061
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
Absolutely

1062
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
You you and Alex

1063
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:56,319
Around the same wavelength if you like freedom

1064
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:59,391
And that's why they're attacking Alex cuz that's the way of attacking you and to take

1065
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
Freedom

1066
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,183
And then

1067
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
I don't you just is very tough

1068
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
Energy levels take they just don't

1069
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,863
What is a sounding board

1070
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
If somebody say what

1071
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:11,935
And saying what you're already

1072
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Wanting

1073
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,495
Good morning the same

1074
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Spirit

1075
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:21,919
Liberty

1076
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
Wood Brothers

1077
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
Could you be Monica Lewinsky

1078
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:32,927
That's why I'm not going to be Hypocrites I want to make a stupid joke about Bill Clinton I'm going to make it because I'm not a hypocrite

1079
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,471
Okay

1080
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:49,567
All right all these ranchers telling you not to make Bill Clinton

1081
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,615
That I have been hearing that

1082
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
From So Many religious

1083
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,407
Just figures

1084
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Or at the past

1085
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,967
Sierra tire light

1086
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Non-Stop

1087
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,647
My childhood Pastor sent me an email out of the blue. He just said it was Jordan This Is It

1088
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,183
Email blast

1089
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:10,815
To whom it may concern I've been noticing a problem in society and that is everyone's making

1090
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
But too many bill collector joke

1091
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,887
That's why the United

1092
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:19,519
Church broke up that's why the United Nations exists.

1093
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Alex is so defensive

1094
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:22,847
Look I'm not going to be hip

1095
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,383
I'm going to make my Bill Clinton

1096
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,943
Credible to me that

1097
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,503
By making a Bill Clinton joke he is

1098
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Being hypocritical

1099
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,647
I don't know if he's being hypocritical and like by issue with it isn't like

1100
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Sing he shouldn't

1101
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,743
I'm saying that it's lame

1102
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,535
Michael

1103
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Complaint is more like

1104
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
This is lame also.

1105
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,887
Technically it doesn't seem like it's a great

1106
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:51,007
Joke to make your face tanvi impeachment parallels that may be brought to mind

1107
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
Buy it but

1108
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:56,383
You're not going to win me over by reminding me of a road hack that I worked with

1109
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,711
With two years ago making Monica Lewinsky

1110
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:04,575
That's a very specific memories about I'm not sure many of the people things.

1111
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:07,647
We're going to be at one-nighter

1112
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,743
So like I said Alex does a couple seconds

1113
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,559
And this he comes back from break

1114
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,351
And he is trying to cover

1115
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,423
That un video about vaccines

1116
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,959
That he's been

1117
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Which

1118
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,871
Who traces back to Del bigtree in this anti-vax Lobby

1119
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
We're finally going to get

1120
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,479
He Rambles about that a bit and that would starts

1121
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:35,039
Weaving into like him talking about

1122
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,135
All of the nurses that he's talked to have told him that they give

1123
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,695
Babies shots and then they die and all this

1124
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:45,023
It's all very non-specific I've heard of Dude Ranch about this

1125
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,327
All the time over and over again through the years

1126
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
But I've never heard of this

1127
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:52,703
I think Alex might reveal a source of information

1128
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,775
I would say doesn't make him look

1129
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Good

1130
00:51:58,847 --> 00:51:59,615
Little Willie Nelson

1131
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,039
I'm making this stuff up

1132
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,599
Willie Nelson concerts in

1133
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
Dump Chatterbox

1134
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,159
Beers down

1135
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
Female doctor

1136
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
After about five beers

1137
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
Well they start singing

1138
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,863
I already know all that

1139
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:26,751
Do you understand what I do as a great journalist is I go to a Willie Nelson concert with a

1140
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:28,031
The doctor get her drunk

1141
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,847
And then she said stuff that I repeat on air

1142
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,407
Probably embellishing it

1143
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,199
That's not great journalistic

1144
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
That's not bad

1145
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,991
Best practice

1146
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,783
I mean

1147
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
I

1148
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:47,487
5 Shiner box down a female doctors throat

1149
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
To get information

1150
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:52,095
But I already know all of it all man

1151
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,447
That's bananas makes him look like a real freak

1152
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
Creepy photos

1153
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,543
Great man

1154
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:05,663
And I assume he made a Cosby joke immediately following that

1155
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:08,223
So that's why we're lost my pay

1156
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,319
4

1157
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
Very boring

1158
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,367
It didn't

1159
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,439
Didn't add anything to the the conversation

1160
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,255
So that that's the end of this 17

1161
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
It's all good it's all good

1162
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,095
He had there

1163
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,631
This is like I don't know who this is

1164
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
Quite enough

1165
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
For an episode

1166
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
Started dipping around

1167
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,335
I was looking at stuff and I watch some of the videos of Alex at the rally

1168
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:37,407
I mean do you really lot of its kind of visual

1169
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
You know like Alex

1170
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:43,551
Clearly uncomfortable when someone ask him a question while he's just standing around on the street

1171
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
Or

1172
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:50,719
Alex poking his little head out of the truck and yelling 1776.

1173
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,023
I don't know it it's not it's not all that

1174
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,399
So I started also like considering some Project Camelot stuff for this episode and

1175
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
I didn't find anything that it was

1176
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
Worth talking about

1177
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,543
Sunny went to banned. Video

1178
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
Alex's website

1179
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,127
Is Big video site

1180
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:14,783
And I can report that it's still all just enforce people talk about providing a platform for all the band people

1181
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
Has a really panned out

1182
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
Not seem to materialize

1183
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,415
I was looking over the channels a lot of them

1184
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,439
Very enact

1185
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,975
A lot of them

1186
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Black people are not posting

1187
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:24,767
Stuff on there

1188
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:31,167
Glass videos like 3 months ago

1189
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,263
Make any videos videos have been passed out

1190
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:36,543
So I was

1191
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
I don't know man

1192
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,175
Who's like a lot of John bowne reports on here that I've never heard

1193
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
And then I was like what

1194
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:44,991
This

1195
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,319
Alex's son has his own channel

1196
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
Yeah

1197
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,903
Oh no recently Alex's son Rex

1198
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
That started his own show

1199
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,255
Now the name of the show is

1200
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
I'm not bragging

1201
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,095
Which is interesting because the name of his show

1202
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:04,191
It seems to be making fun of something his dad says all the time it does seem to be

1203
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Cloud

1204
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:12,383
Know if I would like it if by child named their shows something that I said when I'm acting like a dick

1205
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,967
I do remember that

1206
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:21,343
You know we should have named I do remember pitching the name of the show is my dad is a big dumb dumb

1207
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,879
I did that one

1208
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,671
That wooden mustard

1209
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,719
Possibly a bad

1210
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Strategy

1211
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,303
For the longest time I've had a very hands-off

1212
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
Approached

1213
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
Durex

1214
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Am I still kind of do

1215
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,911
Good idea

1216
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,447
Recover this show regularly

1217
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
But the fact is

1218
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:43,359
He has his own show on this at the Infowars Channel now

1219
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
So I decided I'm going to dip in

1220
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:48,223
And check out what it's all about what you going to do

1221
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,271
Now it's his first episode

1222
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
Is first guess

1223
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,599
It's someone we are aware of

1224
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,903
And it is not somebody that

1225
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:58,463
Someone of his age and

1226
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,559
Persuasion the Vezina like an impressionable young man should be talkin to

1227
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
I'll bet he is

1228
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,399
Mike Jones for this business a real ride

1229
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:09,471
I should tell you just for a little bit of clarification Rex

1230
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,751
Has a birthmark

1231
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
On the side of his hat

1232
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,567
So there's a reference to that

1233
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
At the beginning of this

1234
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,151
That's probably

1235
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,431
That bud

1236
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,455
Well

1237
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,223
We're here

1238
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
Debbie Dennis

1239
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
Starting off with a bang

1240
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,159
Yeah what's up man

1241
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Say hi like a headache

1242
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
I'd 130 walk

1243
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
Like a Walmart

1244
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
She saw me and my dad walking out

1245
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Beating me up

1246
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
GPS when I was about

1247
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:40,959
8 years old

1248
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,239
I come home from the t-ball game

1249
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,775
Walking out taking Gatorade

1250
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,079
And physically try to pull me away

1251
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:46,847
Twitter bird

1252
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,175
I hear it looks like the Dublin logo

1253
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
That's what my except

1254
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,503
Without for men

1255
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,039
Tattoo of it

1256
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,063
Like a tattoo

1257
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
On the other side

1258
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,951
Anything remotely we

1259
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
Get the girls like you

1260
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
I totally agree

1261
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,351
But yeah that's my type

1262
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
If you like something

1263
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:09,887
Makes you different

1264
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,911
Plastic surgery

1265
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,983
We should talk about sex

1266
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:15,519
Seahorse

1267
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
I don't get recognized

1268
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,431
Pizza tits where there's absolutely nothing no with no meat in there at all

1269
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Someone stole it

1270
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
That's a deal-breaker

1271
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,783
And then going bald as a

1272
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,831
But cankles

1273
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,879
Acne scars

1274
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,463
Laugh lines no boobs

1275
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
Loser weight

1276
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:35,999
You big

1277
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
Like a little

1278
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,791
Gap in the teeth

1279
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,351
You know what I would like those little bit wandering eye

1280
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
That's unique

1281
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,423
Superhot

1282
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
Obviously

1283
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,983
I heard

1284
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
I heard it I heard a saying

1285
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,543
You can get 10

1286
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,335
Small boobs in a nice ass

1287
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
Great Moves In

1288
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
That's a tough one

1289
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
Asians off of

1290
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
No ass

1291
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
I don't think I've ever seen

1292
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,111
That Asian booty

1293
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
That's like

1294
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
But that's

1295
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
Tik-Tok

1296
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
This is my man

1297
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,215
Just like what is this show

1298
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,495
What is happening

1299
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:24,895
Baby eighteen-year-old son of Alex Jones talking to a gang leader

1300
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
That's child abuse

1301
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,087
Wow

1302
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
It's it's absurdly

1303
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,999
I can't tell if

1304
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,303
The intention is to be funny

1305
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,703
Like I really can't cuz neither of them are laughing at the end there were Devin says this should be your child

1306
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:52,031
They're laughing at the idea that they're talking about this at the end

1307
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
But when you saying like

1308
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,591
Pizza tits

1309
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,127
Yeah yeah

1310
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,663
Sex isn't laughing

1311
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:03,295
Gavin's not laughing now they're very deadly serious

1312
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,599
No tits or if you're bald

1313
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:08,671
Hey bad news for you ladies with cancer out there

1314
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:12,767
Amanda this is Rob this is repulsive

1315
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
Mean

1316
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:20,191
It's really making me rethink my next show which was going to be me saying misogynist

1317
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,495
I just

1318
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,799
Now I'm starting to think it's a bad idea

1319
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
And then my other my other idea was saying racist eight-year-old and that's even worse that'll be the next episode

1320
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,599
Later in the interview and I just turned it off

1321
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,743
Is this how it started

1322
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
From the jump

1323
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:49,119
First first thing that Gavin wanted to get off of his chest

1324
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,143
To a child

1325
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
Pizza

1326
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,823
Man I don't even like him saying that that makes me feel really uncomfortable

1327
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,407
I'm still not entirely sure what he's made it up

1328
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,271
He might be

1329
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
F****** cry

1330
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,831
Pre poo

1331
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:14,975
I thought gross thing to say I found that to be pretty surreal and also just like I can't I know I've already said this

1332
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
And I can't stress

1333
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
I just needed one sharp okay

1334
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
To see this

1335
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
I understand the wrecks

1336
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Is the Sun

1337
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,399
Why is this on the network

1338
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:31,103
We're going to fight we're going to fight the globalist by talking about what is and is not acceptable in a women if they want

1339
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
To be attractive

1340
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:39,039
David Duke said that s*** to me as a thirty-two-year-old man I'd immediately be like

1341
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Hey stop it that's f******

1342
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
Gross you're a gross

1343
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:48,255
Girl who was raised by Alex may not know better

1344
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:50,815
18 year old

1345
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,095
Who's raised

1346
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,655
So we have one last clip.

1347
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
I think it's another little piece of a grab bag here and I mentioned that I went

1348
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,127
Can I listen to some Project Camelot episodes in a Pursuit

1349
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,223
And there was nothing to be found

1350
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
I'm but I also listen to

1351
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,527
Bill Cooper

1352
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,343
Okay I randomly shot around

1353
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
To a couple episodes that looked in

1354
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
Interesting

1355
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:20,767
I found some interesting stuff but it's tough little take a little bit longer to develop into like a fuller epi

1356
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
Episode

1357
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,327
But one that really caught my eye

1358
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,375
Was episode 150

1359
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,143
6

1360
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Of his an hour of the time

1361
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:29,215
It was called

1362
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,543
Proof of the New World Order plans or whatever

1363
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,311
Pizza Pit

1364
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,687
This episode was not proof

1365
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,711
The New World Order

1366
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:42,527
I will tell you that right now

1367
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,879
The proof that he gives is basically just op-eds the written in newspapers in the 40s

1368
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,159
Not really

1369
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Even compelling

1370
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
To deconstruct

1371
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,767
And explain why it means nothing

1372
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
Otherwise we would

1373
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:58,399
Might have just done that isn't episode of his proof was actually even interested

1374
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,983
There's something in this episode that I thought like well this

1375
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
Is

1376
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,055
Very much important

1377
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,615
Actually Abdul important

1378
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:12,223
I got this episode this clip here is going to start with Bill Cooper

1379
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,503
Doing an ad

1380
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
For the gold

1381
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,343
Company that sponsors his show

1382
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
Great

1383
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,671
Tell me it's not today

1384
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,951
It's not okay

1385
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
Is the different gold

1386
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:28,863
This is something that I want to also always wanted to stress and I think I've done this a little bit but I think it always is

1387
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
Deserves more

1388
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,911
That is that

1389
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,215
All of these people have gold companies by

1390
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,519
So many of these conspiracy

1391
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
CER

1392
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Operation

1393
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,383
Are have there either their own

1394
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:45,759
Little cottage industry or they're funded by Gold's

1395
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
Right because

1396
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,647
It works really well you make people really afraid of societal collapse

1397
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,439
Been paranoid and all that stuff

1398
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,487
To offer them the solution of gold

1399
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:58,559
What is a Sound Investment that even if that happens you'll be a king

1400
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,095
That's a

1401
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,935
Wonder who the first person to figure that who the first gold company was to

1402
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
To figure that out cuz it had to it has to go back

1403
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Acting like the 80

1404
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
1803

1405
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:12,383
But yeah I'm in some form or another

1406
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
And then

1407
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,687

1408
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
Taken aback by

1413
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,159

1473
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
Poke

1474
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:10,559
Everything

1475
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,655
I told you that Bill Cooper uses theme Attic music

1476
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,191
Throughout his episodes

1477
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
In order to sort of height

1478
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,031
And raise the mood

1479
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
He's talking about

1480
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,895
In this episode It's called proof of the New World Order Plan

1481
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:27,711
Just definitely an episode that Alex

1482
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,991
Would have probably list

1483
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:31,039
Listen to anybody been one of the main

1484
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,599
Episodes that he would be drawn to

1485
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
Bill Cooper

1486
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,183
In trying to create the mood of

1487
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,719
This evil group

1488
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:44,351
That he is talking about their nefarious plans we need to buy gold in order to make sure they

1489
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:50,751
You were able to survive he plays the f****** Imperial March by Alex plays on every one of the damn show

1490
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,031
That was the

1491
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:58,431
Crucial mistake that so many people on Tatooine made they didn't put their money into

1492
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,503
That's why they're drinking all that weird milk

1493
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:04,319
Man that's the whole situation that was in one of the novel

1494
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,599
Yeah that was discussed

1495
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:09,183
Yeah so obviously

1496
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:12,511
It's impossible to say absolutely

1497
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,863
That Alex listen to this episode and I was like wow that's really good

1498
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,399
But it also see

1499
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
Very Potter

1500
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,239
Literally everything in that clip is something that Alex

1501
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:26,847
Up to and including claiming that if you don't buy the stuff

1502
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,895
Then the world will collapse with that

1503
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,687
Order to protect

1504
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:34,271
Your family and the world you need to buy gold

1505
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,575
From me from the person that I'm director

1506
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,743
It's not going to happen it's going to have less time than you collapse is coming

1507
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,327
Play this song though so you have plenty of time.

1508
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:57,311
The full involvement of bike that is Alex's operation let it sit it Scribd

1509
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,847
Immediately

1510
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,383
Weird that is

1511
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,431
Exactly how Alex Stowell

1512
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,711
F****** everything

1513
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
It does seem that way

1514
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
Yeah

1515
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:12,671
We all should have listened to the Jedi they told us to buy gold Ben Kenobi he made the mistake

1516
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,279
Farmer Derek exactly there we go

1517
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
Are we go

1518
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:23,167
So anyway we don't do that of this and you know it's a bit of a shorter episode but hey

1519
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
It's a grab bag

1520
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
I don't know

1521
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
I don't know we walk away from this with other than

1522
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:31,359
Galaxy

1523
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
11

1524
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,151
McGinnis is a

1525
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
Reality

1526
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:34,943
To the thief

1527
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,783
Lewinsky jokes are dumb in 2020 still going

1528
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,063
And I think

1529
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,855
You know this looking

1530
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,879
The overs

1531
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,159
Sensationalizing

1532
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
And hyping up

1533
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,231
Of stuff in advance of this event

1534
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:48,255
In Virginia

1535
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:51,583
And then pretending like all the other side did that

1536
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
Afterward

1537
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,191
And the way in which is rhetoric works too no matter what happens

1538
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,031
Beyond aside that he can move forward from pretending he was right

1539
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,591
I think whenever those

1540
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,127
Events happening

1541
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
It's good to

1542
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,431
Direct knives like this

1543
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,455
Is the trick this is

1544
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Is the cheap move that he's playing

1545
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:11,551
People in pocket

1546
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
Paul there should be some sort of car

1547
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,903
For Paul Joseph Watson

1548
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Listen to

1549
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,463
Pull that s*** in the same day

1550
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:22,303
But there's just not going to be with but here's the thing he's already suffered

1551
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
Those consequences

1552
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,119
No one takes him seriously

1553
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:29,727
Without consequences because your life is a

1554
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,263
Rye Rye

1555
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:34,079
You are where you are is the consequence

1556
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,407
But you you are seen as a liar

1557
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,223
A fraud in a propagandist by anybody who

1558
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
You know isn't

1559
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:43,551
With you and

1560
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,879
That's the consequence you can just do this stuff

1561
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,159
If you're already

1562
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,279
I don't know I don't know a good metaphor but the one I was thinking of is like

1563
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,095
Is there already blind you can dump acid in your eyes

1564
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
Doesn't work

1565
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:08,639
That one's not going to go up in the pantheon like people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones but I think it's not terrible sure

1566
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:13,247
So anyway back on Friday with

1567
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,015
