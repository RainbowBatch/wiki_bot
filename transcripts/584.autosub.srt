1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:25,344
I have great respect for snowledge b b

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,808
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
Fight.com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,232
Everybody look like knowledge around

7
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
Where's the altar of Sweeney

8
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,424
But about Alex Jordan

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Question for you what's up

10
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,520
Today I guess

11
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:16,288
Is Ivy

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
Watching Laura Survivor

13
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
This is going to be for nobody but myself I guess

14
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,784
Survivor Gabon

15
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
Okay and there was a guy named Bob

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Country Bob's the map

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,464
Kabob okay

18
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:40,096
So he's a physics teacher and he wears his buff like a bow tie

19
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,632
Dumbass

20
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Alright

21
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,472
Looks just like an old

22
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
Nate Burrell

23
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
A friend of ours

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,128
The comedian okay have a great dude he looks

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
I'm picturing it and yes I can see it looks like an old physics teacher Nate Burroughs with a bow tie

26
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
Delivered

27
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Gabon

28
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,368
It's so weird

29
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:06,208
Some reason Nate Burroughs is a person that I can age in my head

30
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:10,048
Instantly like I just see it I was watching the season

31
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
Instantly was like this

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
Is my guy I realized

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,104
Solberg yes I enjoyed that

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Finally saw the movie event of the summer F9

35
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,224
Okay

36
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,856
Furious 9 little bit of a John Cena can I watch Suicide Squad

37
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
John Cena was also into a Scott Suicide Squad

38
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,512
Back-to-back and I was like maybe they're in the same movie I don't know if that could be

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,656
It could be shared Universe fantastic but I do have one huge problem with it

40
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
When am I

41
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,240
Obviously this is not

42
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,800
Spoiled if you went into this not knowing the Tyrese

43
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Go to space

44
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Wow

45
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
They go to space

46
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
Would like the record to show that I didn't

47
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,040
Spoiled that was all George

48
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
You didn't they go to space alright

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,232
And then they get rescued in the movie lineup at the drive to the space station

50
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,376
That is the wrong move 100% what they do

51
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:21,984
They sacrifice themselves Armageddon style during the regular movie

52
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Post credit scene

53
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,800
Oxygen-deprived

54
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
The Russian Space Station

55
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
Can pick some up that's fast

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,408
After Furious 10

57
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Luda and Tyreese

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Fighting again

59
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
It's the Toretto family

60
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:37,344
I was thinking that a good way that they could have done it is just like

61
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Leave them out of the red

62
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
Cast of the movie Emma

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:40,928
After credit scene

64
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
The two of them bickering in a car in place

65
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,536
I got cuz I would have been

66
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
Good comedy movie where they like

67
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,472
Not worried about it

68
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:58,592
Then they have the whole fourth-wall-breaking character Shield Banterra that's always annoying but

69
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
What you going to do

70
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,664
I enjoyed it but the further I get

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,944
Get permit the amor

72
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
The excitement about it where's the

73
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,552
The f*** off

74
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
F****** know you are God

75
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856

Opossum

98
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,479
What a great addition to celine's family

99
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,879
Fawlty Towers was at John cleese's characters might have been something like that

100
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:52,511
Either way also

101
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327

From Today Show here is the first one

104
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,735
Of Christianity is a very flawed

105
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,503
Ohio

106
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,975
Quit riding the Moonlight Sonata

107
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
Is that Beethoven urbach or god dammit

108
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,495
Why don't I remember anything while he was up in space

109
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
That's what they were think

110
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
That's what they were thinking

111
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
Somebody's

112
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
Bulshit

113
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:46,015
Like maybe a valance cover good from a commercial break

114
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
Instrumental just music and then

115
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,975
The human implementation of Christianity has been deeply flawed

116
00:06:55,231 --> 00:07:00,095
What you going to give it an extra lecture on the subject

117
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,399
So I hear that the other atacante

118
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,959
Little bit different in tone

119
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,751
What's the clear

120
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,335
Heterosexual

121
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
But but

122
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:12,895
What

123
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Alright

124
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
Anyway

125
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
Restart this off here and

126
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,111
I generally don't get too excited

127
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,647
About Alex's shows

128
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,511
He's going through the motions

129
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
A lot of times

130
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
There's nothing nothing too exciting when he said this I was like

131
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
I cannot wait

132
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Does he what he does

133
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Country

134
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
Barnesville Beyond

135
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:40,287
Talk about the legality of the big announcements I'm about to be

136
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,311
Okay what the fuc

137
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:44,895

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,343
Whether they are legal

141
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,463
We need Barnes to come in here and weigh in on whether or not what I'm going to do it

142
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
I heard that

143
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Yes

144
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,655
We absolutely do not have nor bad

145
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,703
Determine whether that would have

146
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,471
Is legal

147
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
You wouldn't do that again

148
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,543
Uno

149
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:14,079
I hate to break this to you

150
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
I want to be like a weird

151
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,127
Artisans

152
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
Not deliver a payoff supper

153
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,295
Isn't anything too

154
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:29,695
Barnes going to be in

155
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Bounties are League

156
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Let's begin

157
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,327
So here is the big news

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,607
Did Alex leave

159
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
The show with

160
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:40,959
Infowars.com

161
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,263
Show

162
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,543
Headline

163
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
For the broadcast today

164
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,639
And this is a pretty big deal

165
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
And somebody might want to listen

166
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,319
Exclusive I'd known as Nationwide lockdown on August 11th

167
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,647
First saw Jack Purcell

168
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
Definitely

169
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,023
Us intelligence agencies by the naval intelligence

170
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:10,655
He said the shatter is there looking to do it on August 11th

171
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
All that

172
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
2 weeks ago

173
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,263
So we got to August 11th

174
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Biden's going to put

175
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,127
Country into lockdown to look forward to

176
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
Premier future and I've been recording this on the 8th

177
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah we got a few days only a few days that we would be

178
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,415
Well it may actually be

179
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,463
It might actually be and there's actually

180
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
A secondary

181
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,815
Conspiracy that Alex has to weave

182
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
Is instrumental in

183
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Surprise Walk Around Heaven

184
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,191
Federal

185
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,031
Emergency Management agency and the Federal Communications Commission

186
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Internet takeover drill

187
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
EAS alert

188
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,687
On the

189
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
I'm a type of guy

190
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,831
But knows when to do something that big

191
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,927
They're going to have radio TV station owner engineers

192
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,975
Do test before

193
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
Make sure it also knows out of their platform

194
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,607
Cuz I've been ready on TV 27 years I know how that works

195
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,399
Asian phone calls

196
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
And they said indeed they're told there's something big coming on the 11th

197
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,311
I do enjoy the fact

198
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:27,199
For that first step that. That other Cliff we we we just heard we both have such little respect for

199
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,783
We didn't even need to address the fact that he's being listed

200
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
It is one of the sources

201
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,671
In terms of this deal we got this this emergency alert

202
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
What's going on

203
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:42,303
That's going to be the the flash-bang okay be like we're now in a lockdown

204
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,583
Tabac in June

205
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,887
They were going to run a drill of the emergent

206
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
The alert system on August

207
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
What's going to happen on that date is basically as follow

208
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,359
Consumers who have opted into receiving text messages on their wireless devices for emerge

209
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:57,151
Warnings will receive test

210
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,175
Emergency warnings

211
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
But say this is a test

212
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
Of the national wireless emergency alert system

213
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:02,783
No action is

214
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
As needed

215
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
A secret code for

216
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,439
Yeah let's say it is

217
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,743
Simultaneously there's going to be at the

218
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
The bear

219
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,071
Or the standard emergency alert system with a

220
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,143
This is a test type messaging broadcast on radio in

221
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,191
TV providers

222
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
This is scheduled to last about 1 minute

223
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,103
Starting at 2:20 p.m. Eastern and it is not a takeover of the internet

224
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,711
So what is it Alex's starting this

225
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,503
Conspiracy Jag that he's you know

226
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,831
Getting into early and they're talking about how there's going to be another lockdown

227
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
I'm starting on August

228
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
11

229
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,647
But then like

230
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Biden

231
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
I'm going to take over the airwaves that day and that

232
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,535
That's martial law

233
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,071
I don't know how scared

234
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
I mean what's he going to say

235
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
Just like lockdown

236
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
That's not that big of a deal if he overrides all communication

237
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,639
Since devices in the United States then well he's going to declare martial law

238
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
And I think Alex does later at clarify that he's also

239
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
Climate

240
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
There's going to be a whole bunch

241
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Just a feeling on.

242
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Things to make and apparently

243
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
The military of the military

244
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,255
Captain resources last night

245
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,607
Yes they're told Biden will make a big announcement on the 11th

246
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Well

247
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Anytime

248
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,031
Insurrection as within calling protest

249
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
I can tell you that

250
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,087
Whitehouse is writing a speech right now it will be on the 11th

251
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
Okay alright

252
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,391
B o u g

253
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,159
Just talked to Jackie

254
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
But this all coming

255
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
Just from

256
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
So when Alex is doing here it is painfully transparent to preempt

257
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,399
Do storyteller

258
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:00,031
He knows fully well there's a large faction of qanon weirdos and Maga dead-enders who have convinced

259
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Themselves it's something big

260
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,079
Is about to happen

261
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
There's a considerable contingent that believes the Trump

262
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
Is going to be reinstated as president on August

263
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
13th

264
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Friday the 13th

265
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,831
Very powerful day for the Illuminati numbers

266
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,439
Much of this is based on random online bulshit that's gotten out of hand

267
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:20,767
Of course the meddling of Alex's new sugar daddy Mike Lindell

268
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
The my pillow guy

269
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,351
Since the 2020 election Mike

270
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,191
Has been banging an incoherent drum but how he had absolute proof that the election was

271
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Stolen

272
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:32,287
He's released multiple entirely unconvincing an easily debunker

273
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
Couple documentaries that he claims lays out all the

274
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,359
Approved for everyone

275
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Sleep

276
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,407
And for the last few months

277
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:38,431
Contracted

278
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,455
Attention for his beak

279
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,735
Cyber symposium

280
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
What's taking place

281
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
August 10th through 12th

282
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
In Sioux Falls

283
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
Mike has insisted that the information and evidence

284
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
He's going to reveal that event is go

285
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Can be so convincing that this

286
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Supreme Court will vote 920

287
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:53,535
Put Trump back in

288
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
The office I am excited for that day

289
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
Leaving aside that there's no cost

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
Digital mechanisms

291
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,495
To do this there's also a huge problem that Mike them that s*** for evidence

292
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Is it going to be an embarrassing

293
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,567
Flop

294
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
What how does that day go

295
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
John Roberts is coming out just like hey

296
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Trump's the president now

297
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
That's what we could

298
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,367
I imagine it would be like the Vatican

299
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:23,487
Well we got to give it to I don't want to believe you

300
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,047
So the fact that this is going

301
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
To be a disaster and a flop

302
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Mike

303
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Can't prove anything

304
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,471
Machine of the extreme right-wing from getting into action

305
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:34,751
A lot of these folks

306
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Are fairly excited

307
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,639
You might remember when they stormed the Capitol Building to try and stop the election results

308
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Certified cuz they believe that if they did that

309
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Staying power

310
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,759
Every month the media tries to

311
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Make that a year

312
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
An extra gear in the past

313
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
Alex knows all about

314
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,487
She knows all of these angles

315
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,279
Mike Lindell pays forever

316
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
Advertising time on his show

317
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,631
Like he's a he's an idiot

318
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
But he's not an idiot

319
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
Sure sure sure

320
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,775
They're people who are actually holding out hope that the

321
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,567
His last-ditch Hail Mary attempt

322
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
Truthout is going to

323
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
And when it doesn't

324
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,663
They won't realize that my

325
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Proof is b*******

326
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Still insist that the Hail Mary didn't work

327
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,759
Because the game is

328
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
To Rick

329
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,831
Desperate people mixed with disappointing

330
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Making a volatile results

331
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
And that's why the dhs's warning that they've seen quote

332
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,791
An increase in calls for violence online type to election-related

333
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Conspiracy theory

334
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
They're warning to law enforcement entities didn't include any information about

335
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
What specific threat but it did say that quote

336
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,543
The timing of these activities may occur during August 20

337
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
41

338
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Folks folks

339
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:49,247
You know how they did all that s*** in the lead-up to the first time they tried to overthrow the government

340
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:55,647
The same shift happening now some of that same talk has happened I know the results

341
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:59,487
I'm paying and getting the same results

342
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
The combination of the election based nonsense

343
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
Conspiracies about the emergency alert drill

344
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
Combine to make this weekend

345
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
Murky

346
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
A key.

347
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,079
Personally I'm not overly convinced anything's going to happen but I do think the ingredients are all there for

348
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:14,847
Trouble

349
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,639
Nothing may happen

350
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:18,175
But the universe is true also

351
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Something may happen

352
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
And what we see on the show gears Alex attempting

353
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Infront of appetite

354
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Centrally harmful story

355
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:27,647
If you pay close attention to Alex to see him do this kind of thing a lot because

356
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
The really powerful strategy

357
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
Strategy to use when you

358
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:37,375
Kind of want to make domestic terrorism more likely want to pretend that you're not doing that

359
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
All I'm saying is that if these people don't get exactly what they want which is a 90 Supreme Court decision they will almost

360
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
Certainly commit acts of violence

361
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,103
And since we and everybody else

362
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Knows that

363
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm just going to let you know it's a false flag before it happened

364
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,247
I mean Trump being made president again

365
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
This coming weekend

366
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,063
Is being

367
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
Told to

368
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,879
A section of the Bible

369
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
This is what you're entitled

370
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
If you do not get this

371
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
This is not America anymore violence

372
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:09,119
Supreme Court

373
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
So I

374
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,423
You know

375
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:12,703
Mike lindell's

376
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
Wasn't coming around quite a bit

377
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:17,311
He's been showing up on the show and I noticed there was an influx

378
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
Soap commercials

379
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,127
On Alex's show

380
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
And now apparently they're running

381
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,479
On the Genesis Communications Network

382
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
Hello I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done

383
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,231
The last 5 months

384
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,631
It might efforts to bring the truth forward

385
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:45,727
Cyber Symposium on August 12th

386
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
The runs the commercial for his cyber

387
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Kristen poziom

388
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Does he still sell s***

389
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
Yes

390
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,711
Really feel like the whole

391
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Prison is part of his

392
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:03,647
Not existed anymore

393
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Why what is happening

394
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,327
I don't know it's going to be a new marketing strategy like the CEO of temper

395
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Eric is going to start coming out and being like

396
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Brazilian

397
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,471
I find

398
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
It's very strange

399
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:22,847
Yeah I do know these still selling stuff OB

400
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Because Alex

401
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,431
I have a promo code

402
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:34,367
But he gives out multiple times man for my pillow

403
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
It was really fun because he's like

404
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:44,351
All of you out there listening know what my pillow and myself have been through in the last year

405
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,263
So we knows now that

406
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,127
Biden is going to declare martial law by way of taking over the airwaves

407
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
On the 11th

408
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Of course I'm here's where we get to the

409
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
Climate emergency of it all

410
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,015
I have this friend

411
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Research

412
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
Because I know what the club of Rome and what

413
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
So I can tell you what to do

414
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
Climate emergency

415
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,007
20 years

416
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
How many senators

417
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,127
Governors

418
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Move it to the 14

419
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
We're talking right now

420
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,303
6 days

421
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:47,839
Roblox

422
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:50,911
And all the suicide

423
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Bankruptcy

424
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Do like

425
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,751
I don't know what Alex imagine

426
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Would need to go in

427
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
Into the implementation

428
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Mission of like

429
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Elegiac

430
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,479
Martial law thing because back on a William like 3 days

431
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:12,415
Pretty important for organizing a lot of this stuff

432
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
It also still has to be on the f******

433
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,815
Can highways before we can get there the reason why he's doing that is B

434
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
Because this is all bulshit

435
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
And

436
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:27,519
He needs to also create a backdoor for himself to slip out of

437
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,687
That's great he brought attention to it so now we averted it

438
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,247
Very specific prediction Elizabeth doesn't

439
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Come through

440
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,575
Hooray

441
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Trump doesn't become president but

442
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
They made a deal with Biden

443
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,463
To stop a second locked

444
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,047
That's my that's my guest narrative or maybe to avert

445
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:50,815
The climate of her

446
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
Something like that

447
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,399
So Alex

448
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Get this mother

449
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
News

450
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
He's talking about how like they

451
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
Things are really bad

452
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,775
But there is a way out

453
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:02,079
There's a way out of some headlines

454
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,895
Is it over like really inspiring as one of them

455
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,991
I got several articles together that illustrate the way out of this

456
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
Let me show you these articles

457
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:18,464
Few days ago zerohedge.com build is the biggest newspaper magazine in Europe

458
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,376
Apologizes for fear-driven coverage

459
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
I'm coming

460
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:34,080
And says the police are beating men women and children this is all overblown the numbers were much exaggerated what

461
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,920
PCR test for fake we apologize we were wrong

462
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
I thought I thought I would have heard about that

463
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,296
So this is about Julian

464
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
They do have the highest circulation of a publication in Europe at least that's what they build themselves as okay

465
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Definitely not the most

466
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Respected Outlet

467
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
It's a right-wing nationalist tabloid

468
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,424
That isn't really all that

469
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
That all

470
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
It's a prop for American extremists like Alex

471
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Text to use because he knows his body

472
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,360
Has no idea what publishing is even like at all in Europe

473
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
Pieces of paper is the most respect

474
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Adele just

475
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,272
I love the idea of a far-right tabloid because in my head it's like

476
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:18,624
Marine Le Pen who she dating we've seen her at the beach with me

477
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
Also this story isn't new

478
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,560
Julian's comments were made back in May but I assume Alex just a viral tweet about them now so it's

479
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:27,328
Kind of like it

480
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Just happened

481
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
The video was Julian apologizing for this

482
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Play Snow coverage of covid

483
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
Particularly in regards

484
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
Stew Howard effect

485
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
Two children

486
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,872
I have no idea if he's talking about his own coverage or everyone else's but honestly

487
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,712
I care about this just about as much as I would if the editor-in-chief of the Sun

488
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
I had made these comments

489
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
I don't care I don't care

490
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,856
Transcript I can find his comments there's no match

491
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,392
Should have any of the stuff Alex's

492
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,160
Talking about

493
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,512
PCR test being fake

494
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
I'm telling you what the

495
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,120
These are counted as details of the story that

496
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Galaxy

497
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,936
Does adding into these

498
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
Comments this guy made three months ago in order to make

499
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,080
Get fit into the narrative but he's already selling

500
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,616
Imma to it also I'm going to give

501
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,408
This is a free piece of advice for Alex

502
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Before you f*** around

503
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Drawing book

504
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,528
This dude does Julia know that guy from build as a gas

505
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,600
Alexandra know that on January 7th

506
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,904
Julian wrote an op-ed titled the quote

507
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,304
Donald Trump will live in Shanghai

508
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
Baby travel

509
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:37,472
You know I do appreciate Alex trying to give us a little bit of an uplifting news you know like hear the way here's the way

510
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,824
Too many broadcasts are always so depressing like I like to read the intercept

511
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,944
What is the most depressing thing in the history of the world do you know like give me a give me a positive

512
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
Way out

513
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,272
What story every noun

514
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:56,672
The editor-in-chief of this tablet is apologizing for covid coverage

515
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
You should know about

516
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,256
Build okay I don't know you know this

517
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,096
Snowcap there the mouth of the establishment

518
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:10,752
I don't know

519
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,848
Type of activity of people that are in the system

520
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,456
I mean build at the end of World War II

521
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
What

522
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,088
Paper

523
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
Everybody

524
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
The Germans ever really got control of

525
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
Build is the mouth of the established

526
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,584
Why would it be saying that because

527
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,400
I don't know

528
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
Alex's saying it billed as the mouth of the establishment

529
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
Because he has some

530
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
Comets

531
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
You asked him the day before the sepa

532
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,616
Episode who the mouth of the established

533
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,944
Boys I bet everything I own that he would not have said build

534
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,296
He would never have heard of you would have said Colbert FF

535
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
Yeah

536
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,464
Has the claim Alex is making the build was taken over by the OSS at the end of WWII and then was run by the CIA

537
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,512
I'm not sure where you pulling that from

538
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
I don't think it's a

539
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Scrutiny

540
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:11,936
The first reason I'm skeptical of this is that the world war ended in 1945

541
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
Yes I remember that bill didn't exist

542
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,008
Until 1950

543
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:19,360
YouTube okay well it was after the war ended so I'm still going to give Alex that one

544
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:24,224
Also after the idea of the paper was run by the CIA I find this tough to believe to

545
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:26,016
The CIA actually release

546
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,040
Correspondence

547
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,368
Spies in the reading room from May 1982

548
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,160
Is a letter

549
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
Hey did we run your paper

550
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,072
You guys up to you having a good day it's a letter from Charles Wick

551
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
The director of the United States

552
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Information Age

553
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
Agency William Casey

554
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
Event director of

555
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
The CIA

556
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
The letter was a request

557
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
For William Casey to be introduced

558
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
Do Alex

559
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
Axel Springer

560
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:51,872
The man who founded

561
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,640
Set build

562
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:57,248
When he was going to be visiting in Washington

563
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
1782

564
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,976
Pretty clear from the letter that Casey did not know Axel Springer

565
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:13,120
Quote we look forward to hearing from you and to the pleasure of introducing you to a gentleman who is doing all he can

566
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:16,448
The strength of the ties between the United States and Europe

567
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:19,520
Bags

568
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,568
Picture of

569
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:26,432
True that Springer and early build had a pretty staunchly anti-communist stanchion

570
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:30,272
The Foreign Affairs they would align with folks like Reagan

571
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Pretty close

572
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
Still not enough to establish a

573
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Anyway the

574
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,392
The paper was run by the

575
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,160
The CIA

576
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,440
In fact it looks like

577
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,720
Pretty compelling evidence

578
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
That it wasn't

579
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,840
Accusations that the CIA funneled money to build early on

580
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,120
But there's no proof of this

581
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,912
Of the people pointing to the tabloids

582
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
Support for US foreign policy objective

583
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
But even that isn't

584
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,264
Something that's consistent

585
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,384
Any of his nonsense

586
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
But it's just

587
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,272
Fun I guess the height of the Cold War

588
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,600
American Spooks are just emailing f******

589
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:11,232
Newspapers like nothing suspicious about us wanting to meet you no big deal

590
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,768
Jesus Christ

591
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,632
I just think that Alex has an inability to prove any of this

592
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,216
I guess this is why three months ago

593
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,496
The editor-in-chief

594
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
Who bailed him out and apologize for

595
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Sensational coverage

596
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,848
Covid

597
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,968
It's because they run by the CIA

598
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Defecting and rice

599
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Is the good news right

600
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,064
Good news

601
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,600
I think Alex a timeline quite

602
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Fits with the

603
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
True no

604
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
But there's other good news

605
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,000
As a headline that's good news

606
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,472
I watched it last night

607
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
I got home after work

608
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
Bombshell

609
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
Freddy Fazbear whistleblower confirmed

610
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,808
Ginger poisonous bio-weapon

611
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,624
Dr. Andrew Kaufman

612
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
And she just goes over the patents

613
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
He's designing

614
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,800
So yeah I guess one of Alex's dum-dum 4th our hosts interviewed Karen Kingston

615
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
She's very excited

616
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
Very exciting if you heard of her

617
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
No have we talked about her before now.

618
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
So Karen works for Pfizer apparently but it was just as a quote

619
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:43,648
Marketing cardiovascular therapies to healthcare providers in Manhattan

620
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,488
Choosing sales and marketing about how much of the scientific end

621
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,560
Things like Alex and all the folks were trying to imply

622
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Yeah I know those types you went around

623
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Hospitals and she bought everybody love

624
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,216
Also she worked there from 1996 to 1998

625
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,848
If you were born after she left Pfizer there's a chance you can legally drink

626
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,128
Can the United States

627
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,736
Here has been making the rounds claiming that she's uncovered evidence

628
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
That the Pfizer in moderna shots

629
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,344
Contain a poison called graphene oxide

630
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
Reuters asked Pfizer about that and they said this is not

631
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
True

632
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,768
So here's an explanation of this whole conspiracy

633
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Alright

634
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,912
Kingston laser research process of the interview which makes it easy to spot how and where

635
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,448
Either distorter

636
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
The information or arguing

637
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Mint Restaurant

638
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,312
The messenger RNA and covid-19 vaccine

639
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,384
Is protected by a lipid nanoparticle layer that also allows it

640
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,176
A the non-nuclear Porsche

641
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Turn of the South

642
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:43,040
These specific lipid formulations used by both Pfizer and modernity

643
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
Both include at least one chemical classified as a

644
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Deg

645
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Why why lated lipid

646
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
Regulated lipid

647
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:55,072
Such weapons have a polymer named polyethylene glycol added

648
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,120
Kingston's argument rest

649
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
I'm too deeply flawed to search

650
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,752
That the only company in the world that produces Pig liautaud

651
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
Lipid

652
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
Is the Chinese company called Cena pay

653
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
And

654
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
That documentation on Cena pegs website proves

655
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,968
The graphene oxide is present

656
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
In their products

657
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,320
Neither assertion however Bears any resemblance to reality

658
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
I think I think

659
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Bobcat

660
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,184
Man has a video of Reagan getting Peggy

661
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Alright

662
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
So

663
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,352
Yeah she's made this very

664
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Varidesk

665
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:35,008
Connected argument about things that are in the vaccine

666
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,616
Hearing a large amount of things that I absolutely do not understand

667
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,456
But I hope somebody

668
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
Play this conspiracy has something to do I think even with like

669
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,624
5G stuff

670
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
It only makes sense

671
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,536
So I look forward to her being on the show

672
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,304
High level

673
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
+ 98

674
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,656
Marketing department

675
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
I do like the tenuous

676
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
Directions

677
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,776
Alex's pretty opposed

678
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,824
To the moratorium on is it

679
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
He thinks it's unconscious

680
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Institutional

681
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,736
Or something

682
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,760
It's against the law

683
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,832
The CDC has no authority to do this

684
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
Yeah

685
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,440
Since when do they have the power they tell you how the other

686
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,328
Under civil emergency

687
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
The bacon do this

688
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,960
Martial law

689
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
Only abide this dictator

690
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:48,480
You see they haven't been officially implemented not all of them yet and that's what's going to start on January

691
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
January

692
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,856
Next year in my view the country going in the complete Banker

693
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
Obscene receivership

694
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
Fuel economy again put into cardiac arrest

695
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
August 11th

696
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
Declaration

697
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
Also declare war on fossil fuels

698
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
Drive anybody else

699
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
I think he said January by

700
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
And then he just

701
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:16,896
Additive

702
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
Betts Betts

703
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,504
Kind of Fantastic Beasts like I messed up and I said January

704
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,880
I could say August but I can never be wrong I think I'm going to have to I'm going to have to

705
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,904
Roll with it

706
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,280
What's a person's back to next year so I have to talk into the phone

707
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,840
Roll a die

708
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:42,240
High stakes for August 11th

709
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,104
Let's try this means anything if you could just make a

710
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,432
Speech A Day to Remember like either played stage

711
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,784
You got all these headlines out there all this news

712
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
The Delta very all day

713
00:32:57,088 --> 00:33:02,208
Scary no one's talking about the real issue

714
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
What

715
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,656
Colorado

716
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
Vaccinated

717
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
To the Vudu app

718
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,040
Saban is the blaming

719
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,576
Non-vaccinated people

720
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,112
Force Delta

721
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,184
Sure everyone should be talkin about the

722
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
Play get really disagree

723
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Route me to

724
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
So the media did actually very much

725
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,888
Cover the child who died in Colorado with you

726
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,680
Whose death was linked to the bubonic

727
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
Play

728
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
What are the reasons that you don't see the media going

729
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:51,104
Saying about it is because outside of some animals this is not a human outbreak of

730
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Like Mike

731
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,920
Squirrels and chipmunks

732
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,456
But we got to be worried about

733
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
Because not enough

734
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
Okay let's go

735
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,904
Also it's something that's super treatable with modern medicine and most likely the reason this child died was because they can

736
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
Condition wasn't identified or diagnosed

737
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Early enough

738
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Is very sad

739
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,560
The plague is carried by a number of wild animals like

740
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,656
Like fleas and various rodents so you do end up seeing a few cases of people getting

741
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
Disease each year

742
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Between 2010 and 20

743
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,312
2050 people tested positive for the plague in five of them

744
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,664
Media Outlets like CNN USA Today in Forbes all covered

745
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,480
The case of the child in Colorado but Alex is mad that they didn't

746
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,504
Continue covering

747
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,320
Recently didn't is because there's no reason

748
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,160
To continue to cover this story unless you're trying to use a headline to scare your audio

749
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,720
When a person gets the plague or God

750
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
I forbid they die of it

751
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
It makes sense for the media to cover

752
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Because it's an interest

753
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,352
Story and it provides an opportunity

754
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
I need to teach the readers

755
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,192
Viewers a little bit about precautions that they

756
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
You should take around Wildlife sure what

757
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Symptoms might

758
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Indicate some

759
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,384
Kind of potentially very serious condition to useful story but is not one to use

760
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
Naive

761
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:01,248
After that revisiting the story over and over when there aren't any development

762
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,272
Is pointless

763
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
Counterproductive

764
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,112
Spread

765
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,904
Still not happening to a lot of people

766
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,256
TuneIn later absolutely

767
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,560
Are there easy separate but sort of related

768
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,840
Kids story that I actually came out

769
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
This past week and that is the

770
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Mid South Lake Tahoe was closed

771
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:19,680
But for service

772
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,984
Have they found the plague was being carried by some

773
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,008
Some of the local chipmunk

774
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
This is a temporary thing

775
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
Camarillo

776
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Just don't let you

777
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Two dogs off

778
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
Police around

779
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,504
Areas where the plague could be endemic

780
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,528
Yeah it's hard

781
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
It's hard to do still

782
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,088
Get the plague

783
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
Harder than you might think

784
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,952
It can be done

785
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,232
Stampy

786
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
So we got some other

787
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Some bad news out of the

788
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
East Coast

789
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
The Alex

790
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,376
Alex Hudson

791
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Some breaking news

792
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
Play go no

793
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
Sure

794
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
It's your fault though

795
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,016
That's another story

796
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
10-second clip

797
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,976
Is his coverage of this story

798
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,560
Told You So This is an article out probably hasn't read about New York's

799
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,584
Excelsior pass

800
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
From the New York

801
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,912
State government website about the program

802
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:23,680
Quotes

803
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,728
Participation in Excelsior passes volland

804
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,616
At businesses and venues where proof of vaccination or a negative test is required for example at Large

805
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
Indoor venues that seat over 5,000 people

806
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:39,552
Individuals can always show alternate proof of vaccination or test results like another mobile application

807
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,832
Or paper form

808
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
These passes

809
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
Excelsior pass

810
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,416
They were rolled out in

811
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
So it's now

812
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,280
No it's more or less

813
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
What stores are naked

814
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
Covid test

815
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,864
Proof of vaccination of the QR code

816
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
The participating businesses

817
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,936
In stamps so they can effectively implement

818
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,496
Public Health precautions

819
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Get to get into the Cubs

820
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,384
This isn't news at all in place and working

821
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
King pretty well for

822
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,040
The past five months the new news stories about the rollout of excelsior

823
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:11,808
Plus

824
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
Which is just the same app

825
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,952
But now it can also be read by businesses that use QR codes that are part of the smart health

826
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,976
Card app

827
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
The story here is just greater

828
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Convenience

829
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,328
About to try to make this the mark of the beast

830
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
I'm afraid that boat sailed

831
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Sale if it was in March

832
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
Is everybody dead

833
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,984
Antichrist

834
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,408
The headline as he's reading it is New York is rolling out vaccine pass

835
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,480
And by his definition I think they did

836
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
That

837
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Months ago

838
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,296
Yeah

839
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:49,184
Hautboy alright sloppy work

840
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
So at this point the show Alex has a

841
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,352
This is actually pretty exciting to me because I put a clock on this

842
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,960
I I saw them rise to prominence

843
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:04,544
I guess they did a video that went viral

844
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,384
It's only a matter of time only a matter of time

845
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,272
And seapak

846
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:17,088
Fox

847
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,624
Censoring going on everywhere

848
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:21,184
But not here at the dreaded evil Infowars

849
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,768
So this is ivory

850
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,792
Hacker ivory

851
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,632
Jeezy was I guess a local Fox affiliate

852
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:36,032
General assignment reporter I know this lady yes she was definitely going on

853
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:43,456
Jesus from Houston she went viral back in June when she claimed that she was being muzzled and that she was taking

854
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,992
The proof to project veritas

855
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:51,648
Have you do it you did that in a live remote video

856
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,744
Release of her bombshell info got way less attention because it was just a

857
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Sweet.

858
00:38:57,024 --> 00:39:00,352
The most relations salacious of the revelations that you provided a versa

859
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
Censorship with a video

860
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:03,424
You captured of the assistant news director

861
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Saying that he doesn't

862
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Greenlight stories about B

863
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
Going because it's not something that would be relevant to the interest

864
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:11,872
Of their five viewing audience

865
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Censorship

866
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Don't know

867
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,040
Unlike Infowars

868
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,136
Just having anybody at the helm

869
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,512
Really poorly research pieces about Hydroxycut

870
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
Comfort their news director

871
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
To tell Ivory that

872
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,912
Quote failed as a report

873
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:41,824
Alright that's difficult it's all very embarrassing us expose lived up

874
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,592
Go to the O'Reilly's

875
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,736
Sensational buildup that they did with her going on air live

876
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,064
Yeah that's why Ivory's now on Infowars

877
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,368
Yeah that 11 viral marketing

878
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:56,160
Stunt isn't going to give you a career

879
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:02,816
Nope she took her shot it was an airball and now the only team desperate enough to give her time on the court is Alex

880
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
Lego very sad honestly for both of

881
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
Yeah yeah

882
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,728
I feel I feel bummed out

883
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
But also

884
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
A little by little

885
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
Laugh a book a single viral video star within a week of their

886
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
Viral video

887
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
You are low on the totem

888
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:27,392
Project needed the first bite at the Apple

889
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,416
Do they have the right

890
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,000
To release the video see any traction off it

891
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,792
But now she's at going into business

892
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,560
Versailles

893
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,608

896
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,240
Failed as a propaganda

897
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Probably

898
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
So

899
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
What you working on

900
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Plugs

901

This is live in about

902
00:40:54,784 --> 00:41:00,928
But what you're doing right now how you're launching a new major operation today

903
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,352
Upload uncensored journalism there

904
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,888
I'm going to cover all the topic

905
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:14,752
Didn't want me to cover I made a Blog

906
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,776
Yeah but it's not just

907
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
Blog

908
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,360
The paywalled plug

909
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:25,504

Was too hot for the local Houston Fox

914
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,928
Affiliate to cover

915
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
You have to pay $5 a month

916
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,096
Oh my God she is she is skipping a lot of steps or no

917
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Is it going to work

918
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Her website is just

919
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,472
The template offered by secureserver. TV

920
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
What is a platform designed to host

921
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
Sinalau direct monetization of

922
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
People's videos

923
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
They offer their services at a at a

924
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,687
Price like it's not a free service so

925
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
She needs to have a number of psoriasis

926
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,527
Drivers in order to offset the cost

927
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,135
For every business you start the first couple years in the red it just happen

928
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,463
She paid for hosting of all right

929
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,023
No shame that although it is

930
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,095
It is weird when you go you cuz you can find a bunch

931
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,119
Which of these different sites

932
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,935
Better all through secure server.

933
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
TV show

934
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,983
Jordan sather

935
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,311
The Cuban on weirdo in Legion

936
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,359
Okay I'll disown and they all look at

937
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:27,199
Exactly the same sure the landing pages all look identical

938
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,991
They can that get you to sign up

939
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,831
You know you don't go into right-wing propaganda if you want to work

940
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
I think this is one of these Sammy

941
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,719
Popular platforms that the people who've

942
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
Kicked off YouTube inside

943
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Are using

944
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,351
I don't know

945
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,911
If having a cost of Entry

946
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
Is going to be

947
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Conducive

948
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
To like

949
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,007
Just getting off the

950
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
The ground too early

951
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
You're too early in the game

952
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,895
Reason that YouTube work for a lot of these people never wanted

953
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,967
The number to the algorithms of Drive beep

954
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,735
Evil towards

955
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Content that they probably wouldn't be

956
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
Going towards

957
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Otherwise

958
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,647
This has neither of those advantages

959
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:11,487
Are you sure you don't want to learn more about the proud boys

960
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,023
This is this is

961
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Not free

962
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
And you have to search it out

963
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,911
I don't know how well Ivory Hecker is going to be doing

964
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,983
You got to spend a lot of time going around the circuit

965
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
You got to go on

966
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,591
On TV you got to get the word out before you can ever start getting a paid

967
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Serviced

968
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,943
Sorry I was pretty interested in this

969
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
Secureserver. TV cuz it

970
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,015
It does seem like this

971
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Is very strange

972
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,087
Cookie cutter

973
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,111
Fill in the blanks

974
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Thing for

975
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,439
People with bad ideas to make

976
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,767
Secureserver.net TV scruples

977
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:45,535
Why

978
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,863
I started digging around a little bit but

979
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,471
I got to bummed out until I decided to stop the only people I could

980
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:56,031
Could see talking about it we're people in like

981
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
Really f***** up message voice

982
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,407
Great great good news good news

983
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
You can be judged by The Company You Keep

984
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
Alex's tacos

985
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
The ivory and today

986
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Huey's

987
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,111
Eastside

988
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:12,671
Who built up this idea that she was censored

989
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,439
C-pack

990
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,975
You heard him say that in the introduction

991
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,815
Did say that unfortunately she's not going to allow this

992
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
Fictional story to be told every

993
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
You go to sleep

994
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,031
Fox is a sponsor that

995
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,847
What a dumb move to turn your microphone down

996
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
Stanford you again

997
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Oh yeah that only hurts Fox

998
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,671
If they're cutting my feed and then look day

999
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,719
Austin turn my micro

1000
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,303
Phone down because it did I mean c-pack was in charge of the mic and

1001
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,399
Camera

1002
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:59,519
Nation I was told by

1003
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,311
Viewers in the audience

1004
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
Fox Nation cut

1005
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
The feed

1006
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,431
When

1007
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,479
About your specific microphone

1008
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,063
Oh this is chain

1009
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,879
This is why this is why she's not going to make

1010
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:20,255
You yes and anytime any censorship

1011
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,535
No use trying

1012
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
To be too specific about what her narrative was a busted Alex's

1013
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Herbal idea

1014
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:34,335
Your narrative doesn't matter on Infowars you just need people to hear you talk

1015
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,151
Yeah I think she doesn't know how to play ball with Alex

1016
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Deletes Alex having

1017
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,479
The correct himself in a very embarrassing waves

1018
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,503
Beginning of the clip

1019
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,831
He was saying that all this stuff you saw and everybody knew is

1020
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:45,599
Navigate

1021
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
I hate that we know how to be

1022
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:54,047
Way better right-wing propaganda spend 99% of these idiots article in The Daily Beast

1023
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Something to add

1024
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Conversation

1025
00:45:56,095 --> 00:46:00,447
So Alex was saying that like foxes a sponsor of z-pack so they cut the mic

1026
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,495
Apprenticeship

1027
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,079
Ovaries version of it is

1028
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
That nothing happened

1029
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
Itzy pack because

1030
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Controls Xbox

1031
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,967
It was on Fox Nation

1032
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Exactly turned off

1033
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,063
4 ft 11

1034
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Quote

1035
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,111
A spokesman for Fox Nation

1036
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,159
Jen said the feed was never cut and it's

1037
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:22,463
The service had already stop streaming the event

1038
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:26,303
If I were a betting man which I am I would guess that

1039
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,887
Maybe Ivory heard second or third-hand that her speech wasn't on Fox

1040
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,911
This got turned it

1041
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,191
The fox shut her off

1042
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
Because this perpetuates

1043
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,287
Cancel culture narrative that these losers are so obsessed with

1044
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,079
And it's the only way they can bark

1045
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
Subscription-based blogs

1046
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
And so this is the version we've gone with

1047
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,455
She doesn't realize

1048
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,295
Silver dialysis version

1049
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:50,879
It's a lie but you got to pull off the lie you can't just

1050
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
You can't just lie

1051
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
You got to play the game with the LIE

1052
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:57,791
Why I don't have a whole lot of Hope

1053
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
She doesn't have the staying power

1054
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
She doesn't know where her bread is buttered and that is

1055
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:07,007
Making sure the people know that James O'Keefe is real cool

1056
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Cool guy

1057
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Yeah

1058
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,615
He's great I I really am

1059
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
Respected journalism

1060
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:20,319
He shows video and audio people in their own words being that's where we got to be at with journalism

1061
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:22,367
So few people Trust

1062
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,927
What the news is saying so if you can

1063
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:28,767
Video of what people are really up to

1064
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
Audiences want to see now they don't they don't

1065
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Trust

1066
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,215
The written word is much anymore there's just so much fake news out there

1067
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:42,335
I don't want to read in order to make my mind up about something

1068
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,407
I want to watch deceptively edited video of

1069
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,711
Somebody drunk at a

1070
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:52,063
Bar having a conversation that maybe about something that sounds weird

1071
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:56,671
That's how I'm going to make up my mind

1072
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
The media has ever tried

1073
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
People in their own word

1074
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Before

1075
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,583
Or like

1076
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Quotes

1077
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Or maybe even

1078
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,983
Full broadcast of speeches and interviews things have been done

1079
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,311
Yeah but what they tend not to do is with James O'Keefe

1080
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:18,175
Which is secretly filmed them in the deceptively edit the footage of making a narrative funk

1081
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,967
Looking for him man you bet

1082
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,271
But that's the good stuff

1083
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
So

1084
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,183
Ivory sticks around for a while but Alex goes off on a little bit of a Jag

1085
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
Sure

1086
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Because

1087
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:32,511
He's finally found

1088
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,535
Taking the Olympics

1089
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,327
Is alright with me

1090
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:40,703
George Orwell said in a world of universal deceit

1091
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,263
Telling the truth is a revolutionary Act

1092
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Real quick

1093
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
It's not in Orwell quote

1094
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:51,967
Us Olympian proclaimed her love for her country

1095
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Miniature stock

1096
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,319
I want the big wrestling competition gold medal

1097
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,951
Completely normal it's your country for you to go there

1098
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
No it absolutely did not

1099
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:07,071
Cultures and ideas

1100
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,167
Melting Pot

1101
00:49:11,935 --> 00:49:13,471
Instead most people here

1102
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,799
Big corporations

1103
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
And

1104
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,359
The nation-state there

1105
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
Challenging the Monopoly power of big corporations that are bigger

1106
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,783
And most governments

1107
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,623
Well I do believe

1108
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
Balance

1109
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,023
Braces becoming the government

1110
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,119
What is a short clip of what she had to say

1111
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:47,519
Revolutionary I just won the gold medal

1112
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,311
Why is this so

1113
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:58,271
So I meant to stock won the gold medal in wrestling

1114
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
After she won she said she loved representing the United

1115
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Red States of America

1116
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:05,695
Try as I might I cannot find anyone saying

1117
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:08,767
But you shouldn't have said that or that it was weird that you did

1118
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:12,351
I think it generally normal people saw that and responded Haygood

1119
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
Good for her

1120
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,703
We're proud of our house really cool congratulations

1121
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,031
However if you look around just a little bit on Twitter you might find some

1122
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,055
Maybe

1123
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:25,663
Slightly racist sounding responses on the right way

1124
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
Princeton

1125
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:29,503
And there was the Daily Caller sports editor David hookstead

1126
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
Who tweeted this

1127
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:31,551
Quote

1128
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,855
This is what real patriotism looks like

1129
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
LeBron James

1130
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
Colin Kaepernick

1131
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,439
Could learn a lesson from her

1132
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
I

1133
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,535
Can't understand a little subtle

1134
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
F******

1135
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
I mean

1136
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
The Gulf

1137
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
The f****** golf

1138
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,751
LeBron James's what your daughter f****** metal

1139
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
God I hate

1140
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,847
Can people I really can't find anyone on the glass

1141
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
She was somehow offended by

1142
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
It's Mira's interview

1143
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
Pride in

1144
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,039
The us but that's an essential thing for people like Alex to imagine

1145
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Didn't exist

1146
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,903
This is because they've been telling her audience that these other athletes who make the

1147
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,487
Statement that they do are actually concerned with the cause of the bring attention

1148
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
22

1149
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
They're actually just against

1150
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
America

1151
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:19,423
I have the people who support these woke athletes only support them because they to hate America

1152
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,959
Any idea of countries

1153
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,543
That's when an athlete celebrates their win and says

1154
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
They're proud to represent America

1155
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
There has to be a backlash or else none of this makes

1156
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:33,503
If we're cheering for the people want to destroy America we must be furious about someone loving it

1157
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
Right

1158
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,623
When that backlash isn't there someone like Alex has to imagine it is there and

1159
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,647
Respond to it not exist

1160
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
Austin point of no one's

1161
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
Not a revolutionary Act

1162
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,767
For an Olympic Athlete to be a proud

1163
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,815
Of the United States

1164
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:50,911
The same way it's not treasonous for an Olympic Athlete to use their platform to advocate for social

1165
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,239
Whatever even then within the

1166
00:51:54,495 --> 00:52:00,127
Context of them advocating for social change they always or at least often

1167
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,711
Say I love my country as well and that is why I wanted to

1168
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,991
Sure

1169
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,295
Jesus is a small-scale and very transparent

1170
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:10,879
Instant about that right-wing media strategies essentially based on manufacturer

1171
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,903
String outraged about face

1172
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
Endure running they just have too much

1173
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,303
They just have too much time

1174
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:24,959
And it works too well as work too well whenever you create an imaginary enemy that people have just decide

1175
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
Cited is real you can say

1176
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,263
Anything

1177
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
And they just believe it

1178
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,847
So Alex plays the wrong clip

1179
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,687
Of this this Olympian

1180
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
When it's happening

1181
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,295
Well he thinks he's playing the clip where she talks about loving America

1182
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,439
And she went on to say another interview that she loves American she's proud of her country

1183
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,303
And the left actually attacked her son but I don't like this image cuz they think they own women

1184
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,935
You're a loser

1185
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:58,239
Friends really

1186
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
So

1187
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
I'd like to I'd like for him to

1188
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
Groove anywhere

1189
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,175
1 Tactical

1190
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
Single

1191
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:11,039
Generally Paul Joseph Watson will at least show up with like a random

1192
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:17,183
Complete some assholes

1193
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:22,303
He's tweeting about how about black lives matter

1194
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:24,863
I'm even a little bit like

1195
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,655
If he about myself using

1196
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
From this guy but

1197
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,983
At least he's released

1198
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,079
Sports editor for the Daily Caller

1199
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:37,407
That's where they don't think that's indicative of a universal opinion

1200
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,455
Piece of s***

1201
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,503
I have no specifics but Alex was giving

1202
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,807
Anyone who said anything about

1203
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
No

1204
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
Just do that he is only speaking of this one

1205
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,743
Other athlete who is strength

1206
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
It's a weird

1207
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
So

1208
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,303
Alex

1209
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,839
Yeah it's a little bit defense

1210
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:56,863
2

1211
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,655
People have been

1212
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
I'm saying that Michael

1213
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
Allendale

1214
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
Is paying out

1215
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,263
Wow I mean my pillow guy

1216
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
Maybe not

1217
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
Okay alright maybe it's worse

1218
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
USANA

1219
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:23,999
He runs the ad with us

1220
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,327
Alex Jones

1221
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,887
Are liberals do that mean

1222
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,983
He doesn't completely

1223
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,335
Gold Ranger

1224
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
Idiots

1225
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,639
Okay

1226
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,479
Paying me I don't work for that a******

1227
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,551
We're sharing the profits from the things that I say

1228
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,575
Fell for him

1229
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:54,719
Give me a cut of the sales that I direct

1230
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
To his website profit-sharing program or unaffiliated I don't get paid by his

1231
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,447
Money for him to advertise

1232
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:10,847
What's up with the people who liked me but they should buy his product course at the end of the quarter we figure out the

1233
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:17,247
Prophesy get a cut of those words about that there's a financial arrangement

1234
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,039
Draw time chantaje

1235
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
Sales and he gives me money but I

1236
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,487
You fuking idiot

1237
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,767
Not only that

1238
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:33,375
You're an idiot even more because you thought I was just getting paid for it by him

1239
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:39,775
Like I didn't give a s*** if he succeeded or not know this is a profit-sharing so I need him to succeed

1240
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,591
I honestly think that the

1241
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,383
I think it's worse for

1242
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151
For Alex like

1243
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Flat rate

1244
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,735
For what you charge for an address

1245
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:51,551
Okay

1246
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,159
This is Mike Lindell being like if you don't sell anything for me I'm not giving you connected

1247
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,207
You are naughty you are an independent

1248
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:02,815
Contractor is there Lee believe that advertising with you would be worth it

1249
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:06,143
No

1250
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,679
We're not going to do this on spec

1251
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
So anyway Alex

1252
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,823
Understand

1253
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
The

1254
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
That

1255
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,759
It'd be better for you yeah you should definitely have got hit lateral

1256
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,527
Glendale

1257
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
No wonder he is playing that very add on his show and not where the ads Gus

1258
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:35,583
He plays the entire ad on his show

1259
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,935
Instead of during the commercials almost sponsored content

1260
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,983
Is that like is assault

1261
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,775
Just because Ivory wanted to

1262
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,543
Respond to it

1263
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,311
Exactly

1264
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,127
Since you mentioned it

1265
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,247
Temptations

1266
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,063
Are those hats ladies be able to enroll

1267
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
You want to respond to

1268
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:04,767
Hello I Mike Lindell the most important commercial

1269
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,535
Very important

1270
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:06,559
Commercial

1271
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
So they play this

1272
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,167
Here's here's Ivory's

1273
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
Geico

1274
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,983
After work this is

1275
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,263
Hear it

1276
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:18,591
Fascinates me why woodfox

1277
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:22,687
Down an ad for a symposium that is going to

1278
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Floor

1279
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,503
Truth about the election

1280
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:30,111
To the bottom of what really happened with the election here's the thing we know Fox

1281
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
News is in a huge lawsuit

1282
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,487
Dominion Dominion voting systems is suing

1283
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:39,327
The Wazoo now if you're being sued

1284
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:42,911
Buy Dominion wouldn't you want

1285
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
22

1286
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Get all the proof she could

1287
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:51,615
Got Dominion did commit fraud would win the last night

1288
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,663
Is she High I don't know

1289
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,991
She is really struggling to get through this concept

1290
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,087
It's a yeah I guess it would her argument is like she

1291
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:03,391
Fox News should be paying Mike Lindell to get the

1292
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,743
Yeah absolutely they should be running that

1293
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,511
Because

1294
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,583
If you're getting an independent investigator.

1295
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,863
Confirm

1296
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,935
Why wouldn't you want Mike Lindell to do it for you

1297
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,983
He's already on the way

1298
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
Maybe you're a giant

1299
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
And Company at you

1300
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:24,383
Maybe been able to have your own investigators

1301
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,431
Maybe use more rigorous approach

1302
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,247
DJ's then someone like Mike Lindell of looked at this and Blake

1303
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
Oh no we're f*****

1304
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:36,927
Yes. Realize you answered your own question with the question that happens a lot by wouldn't

1305
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,463
Fox 12

1306
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,279
Get to the bottom of this if they're being sued

1307
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Perhaps

1308
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:45,887
The very concept that you never

1309
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,727
Considered they are wrong

1310
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:55,615
And they don't want to lose a billion dollars

1311
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:59,199
So this this is this next clip kind of bummed me out a little bit

1312
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,783
Meowth

1313
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Yeah

1314
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,575
I don't

1315
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
I just

1316
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,903
Especially the way that

1317
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,719
The ivory tells the story of like her

1318
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,023
Her ambition to do a story about Dominion

1319
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
And then what happened

1320
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,911
I also tried to present the documentation from the Secretary of State's office of Texas

1321
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:23,007
Best Gators found in January 2020 that Dominion

1322
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,055
Was a no-go because

1323
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
It was

1324
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
Susceptible to fraud

1325
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:32,735
My boss is on again acted like they didn't care man assigned to me to cover

1326
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,039
Sidewalk chalk art instead

1327
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:40,671
I said I can't keep I'm being used as a tool of narrative

1328
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,511
At a certain point you kind of have to ask yourself if maybe the boss is assigned to you

1329
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,559
Thule report about sidewalk chalk art

1330
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
Because that's all you could

1331
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,375
Could be trusted to handle

1332
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,399
Possible

1333
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:53,215
Just not that good at through being a reporter I

1334
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,239
Feel bad

1335
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,823
Maybe you're sitting baby you failed as a reporter

1336
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,615
That's I've heard that from somebody

1337
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Her boss

1338
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,223
So the Secretary of State of Texas is actually Thrice reject

1339
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
Did certified Dominion

1340
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
Machines for elect

1341
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
Inside in the state

1342
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
First time was in 20

1343
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,671
B12 and the other two were in January and October in 2019

1344
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Respect

1345
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Not 20

1346
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,023
These machines make it harder for us to cheat

1347
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,559
You can find report

1348
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
It's very easily about their find

1349
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,399
Three concerns that were raised

1350
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:27,263
In 2012 there was a wide-ranging series of issues largely around them not being able to

1351
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,543
Conductive full enough review

1352
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
The technology

1353
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,335
So they decided not

1354
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
How to sign off on

1355
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
We don't

1356
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,455
In January 2019 there were concerns about me

1357
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,991
Maintaining the secrecy of ballots

1358
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,783
And whether or not the system was quote

1359
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
Capable of permitting

1360
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,087
Straight party voting

1361
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,183
That initially seems like a weird thing for a voting software to not be able to do

1362
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,719
But it turns out in some places

1363
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,999
It's not allowed

1364
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Reviews

1365
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
Straight party voting

1366
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:54,655
I didn't realize that when I was first Reason by one-size-fits-all

1367
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
And because it's outlawed in certain

1368
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
Places

1369
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,775
Concerns about that

1370
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,591
The October 2019 report is the closest

1371
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
But I can come up with

1372
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,943
It's to whatever you say

1373
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
System was quote

1374
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,783
Ephraim fraudulent or unauthorized manipulation

1375
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,575
That's certainly interest

1376
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,111
But the fact that Texas had

1377
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
Concerns about that

1378
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,439
Doesn't prove anything to finish

1379
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,463
Nope

1380
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,279
I want to learn a little bit more so I went to check out the more detailed

1381
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,583
Report on this October 2019 task.

1382
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
The specific problems with the Dominion system

1383
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:29,983
This report lays out really mostly breaks down

1384
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,287
Being a pain in the ass

1385
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
It's difficult for people to install

1386
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Bear

1387
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,639
They also found that something could be

1388
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
Be plugged into the second

1389
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
USB port

1390
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,759
Work on the machine but it wouldn't be

1391
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,295
Right

1392
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
List of needs

1393
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,367
Specific ways that I could be done this was Dean Vape

1394
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,903
Potential vulnerability

1395
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,439
And the realization was like

1396
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:54,303
Seal it up instead of trying to charge your phone on the machine just

1397
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,839
Cover the US

1398
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
Yeah yeah

1399
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,959
Every state in the country has the right to determine their standards and how they want to run away

1400
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
That's just how it's done in the United

1401
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
For Better or Worse

1402
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,055
Not confusing at all

1403
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,335
This theoretical

1404
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
Concern could be enough to

1405
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
To get Texas to pass on using these

1406
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,943
Machines but you can find analysis

1407
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
From States like

1408
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:13,759
Pennsylvania to Washington that reach

1409
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Different conclusion

1410
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:19,391
I suspected this kind of thing is why Ivory ended up on sidewalk chalk Duty

1411
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:21,439
If you look she read a headline about

1412
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,231
The Texas Secretary of State decided just

1413
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,047
Debaser reporting on that without considering the larger scope of

1414
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
The story

1415
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,375
Colonel tells you tried to run reports about hydroxy

1416
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,655
Quinn while ignoring

1417
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:31,679
The nearest Aldi's

1418
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,239
A massive pile of evidence that it was a miracle cure

1419
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,591
Or like how she wanted to do stories about Bitcoin Gold Rush is only local news how can

1420
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Considering the audio

1421
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:40,383
This is just

1422
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,175
Yeah I mean it so

1423
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:46,271
It's such a sad thing for her too because she's ruined her life

1424
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,807
Yeah because of this

1425
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:51,903
Spell f****** delicious Avenue

1426
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:55,231
Totally been one of those reporters who handles sidewalk chalk

1427
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,767
For the rest of your life

1428
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,351
Soft news on the five

1429
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:06,751
The other building to that I think about it is like you know there isn't there is a pesos that we can feel

1430
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,543
As much as like well

1431
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
His media career is

1432
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:10,591
Is.

1433
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,383
Except for as much as you

1434
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
You can do it

1435
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:13,919
This right-wing

1436
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,991
Just parallel reality

1437
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,783
Some traction you can get there

1438
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,063
I also like

1439
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,623
It's not that much pesos

1440
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,903
No that wasn't

1441
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:28,511
There wasn't much more for her to do know that's true I don't know I don't know if there's chop

1442
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:35,167
No she's in a lot of people who work

1443
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
Oh your career is ruined

1444
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:39,007
What career would you imagine

1445
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,871
Yeah I mean before you even started this I'm sure you failed as a report

1446
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
Sorry

1447
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:52,575
The chance to get better job or something she could have learned that if she starts with the softball puffs

1448
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:53,855
Places maybe some

1449
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
Pretty cakes are under a wing she turns into an actual journalist

1450
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,951
I didn't set her life

1451
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,535
Her career and media is over and right-wing media isn't going to

1452
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:06,143
She's too lazy and she's too lazy even for them

1453
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
I don't know

1454
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,215
I think she could get with the program but also

1455
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
There's a there's like

1456
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,287
A million other career paths

1457
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:16,383
She could probably go down

1458
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Maybe

1459
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:20,223
So she was censored

1460
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
All over the place

1461
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
Things that are the boss

1462
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,087
Their boss said

1463
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
Kobe black

1464
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,903
Texting Story song

1465
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
No

1466
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:35,071
What is a camera right there

1467
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:38,911
Your boss told you Xbox

1468
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
Yeah my boss

1469
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Fox

1470
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,079
Told me do not report

1471
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,383
Thousands of deaths after vaccine

1472
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,151
Nation

1473
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,455
What is that what are we hiding

1474
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,735
I've been working on a character

1475
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,783
You like me to do my new character

1476
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,319
Let's do it my new character is

1477
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,623
Ivory's boss okay

1478
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,695
I've got this break she'll story

1479
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,231
Okay everyone hoot

1480
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,255
Takes the vaccine dies

1481
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
Alright look you can't report

1482
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,375
The people who died after getting the vaccine died

1483
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,423
Because of the vaccine because that's not

1484
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
And you can't really support that

1485
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
They claim it all

1486
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,567
You can discuss deaths after vaccination in a proper

1487
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,895
Contact so long as he explained that there is no proof of causation in

1488
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,687
You restrain yourself from making

1489
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,967
Ridiculous insinuation

1490
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,247
That probably takes

1491
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
The fun out of it for you so I guess

1492
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,575
You should probably just pretend

1493
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
Stop you right there

1494
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:31,903
I don't like

1495
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,511
What you're telling me

1496
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:41,887
Could you pick up a clear head of it

1497
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,935
Cancel culture

1498
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
So she takes her exit

1499
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,775
And Alex

1500
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
I get back

1501
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Do scary

1502
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
People

1503
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,615
About sure

1504
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,895
August 11th

1505
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
Airplane vaccine passports

1506
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:03,135
Inside we've got that Biden is set on August 11th

1507
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:07,999
Credible sources

1508
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
Very dangerous time to be alive

1509
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Great

1510
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,079
Okay so

1511
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
Future

1512
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:29,247
Be tomorrow could be anyway

1513
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,343
The beginning of an inescapable hellscape where all right wing

1514
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
Christians will be

1515
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,415
We taken care of shoulders and everyone.

1516
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
Could start

1517
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:40,511
On the 11th

1518
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,423
Right now the plan has been the sources I have

1519
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:53,823
Gold standard not just check the soap ever

1520
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,871
Now since I got the wrong so many times

1521
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
It could be not bad

1522
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
With a grain of salt

1523
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,319
Hey just in case you were wondering

1524
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,135
Pictures of fortune cookie

1525
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:11,231
Keep your eyes open for this lucky number

1526
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,791
The last hour of the show

1527
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,583
Alex has Barnes

1528
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:19,935
This is where I was really excited I wanted to know what Alex was going to do that he needed to do

1529
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:25,311
This is the big is the Big Show

1530
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,615
Doesn't happen what does it happen

1531
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,383
That

1532
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
How can it not

1533
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,711
Appliance

1534
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
But he does have a long

1535
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,527
10 questions

1536
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
Okay

1537
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,599
There's a series of

1538
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Over a

1539
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Minute-long

1540
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,695
Conquest job

1541
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,487
Okay okay

1542
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,047
I started to get like really disoriented

1543
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,839
In the middle of this review

1544
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
Like I don't know what it was but like

1545
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,239
Listen to the whole question of minute and 17

1546
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,591
History

1547
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:06,527
Bum rushing my corporations by the UN by The Fortune 100

1548
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,391
Force experimental injections I mean

1549
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,791
You're really smart Astorian I really respect you

1550
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:24,191
What are they

1551
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,519
Desperate

1552
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,335
Insane push now they admit it doesn't work

1553
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,295
Same thing here they're trying to suppress that

1554
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,207
Find that out I mean

1555
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
This is like

1556
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:50,815
Watching insane Gremlins burn down a building or something

1557
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:56,959
Why are they doing it cuz they're going to destroy themselves the process it's already falling apart

1558
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,799
I just I just cannot find any even from a criminal

1559
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,871
Criminology logic

1560
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,479
What is this

1561
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,271
Grabber

1562
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,343
Wanting to punish the Westford

1563
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
Aegis

1564
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
I'd like

1565
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,023
It's very strange for someone to like

1566
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,351
Ramblin Lee ask a question that they answer

1567
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
For the person in the

1568
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,191
Process of asking the question

1569
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,519
Here's the direction I would like your answer to go in

1570
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,615
It's a long Quest

1571
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,151
Actually that I

1572
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
I counted three question

1573
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:38,943
And within there

1574
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,503
Bandit in descending order

1575
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,551
It starts with why are they

1576
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,575
Acting like the bad

1577
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,135
Right then why turned out with Hitler

1578
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
Why are they doing it

1579
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
And then

1580
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
What is the

1581
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,607
I can't really explain everything that is that Alex's make

1582
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,423
Picking up in just about everything he is trying to

1583
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,823
Solve the mystery of

1584
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,591
Long minute

1585
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,359
Questions

1586
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Is

1587
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,711
They almost always boil down to a yes or no answer

1588
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:19,391
You've given it why are they doing this is it just because they want to overthrow the world and take over and suck everybody's blood

1589
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Yes

1590
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:22,719
Go to answer next question

1591
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
Barn

1592
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,303
Here is a little bit later

1593
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,607
Pretty close

1594
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
Succession after this

1595
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Alex

1596
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
The Moon

1597
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,007
Because for a minute and a half

1598
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:41,407
Yeah oh my God

1599
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,223
Azima Global idea that cost while talking about

1600
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,503
Why did they name

1601
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:49,855
Something

1602
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,159
The National Institutes of Health in

1603
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
CDC

1604
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,535
Are you asking

1605
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
Do not

1606
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,863
Vaccine for the spike

1607
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
Will basically kill mammals

1608
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
Proceed with Extreme Caution

1609
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
Inhumans

1610
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
YouTube

1611
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:15,967
Get the power get the control make you by vaccines make you be tracked

1612
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Sprinkler World ID

1613
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,319
Right up front

1614
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,207
People get hurt

1615
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,351
What

1616
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
The doctors

1617
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,823
Are you high

1618
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,359

No no no no

1621
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:56,927
Upfront

1622
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,767
I just get everything you wanted once in a blitzkrieg attacks

1623
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
Total War

1624
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
Yes I end

1625
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,423
Okay

1626
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:11,263
What yes or no answer it happens every time

1627
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,543
That's exhausting

1628
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:18,943
I do appreciate that he always disagrees with his fake terrible plans

1629
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:21,247
Supplies that even worse terrible plan

1630
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
As like the

1631
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
Is the SmartThings

1632
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087
These idiots

1633
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:30,975
Are not putting out the placebo first they're killing people when we know they're killing people what I would do

1634
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,791
Is kill people later the skies are so f******

1635
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:38,911
Stupid the fake baby sugar water

01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,703
Barnes are they stupid

1637
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,471
Alright

1638
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,543
Iodized

1639
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
I was listening to this

1640
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:51,711
Barnes having a coughing fit or something like it's Alex has a mute button

1641
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:56,063
What is what is the explanation for this Behavior

1642
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:02,463
These are the type of free association questions usually come with something in the nose a little bit earlier

1643
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,231
Scott

1644
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,047
Just let me go Daddy-O

1645
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,399
Sense of likes

1646
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,423
I know when he

1647
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,263
He's going to stop step aside when a master is fed up

1648
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:20,127
When Satchmo start Bluff

1649
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,759
Dave Chappelle drops in your not doing your 5

1650
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:32,159
If you're not going to yell something out in the middle of his disrupt that rhythm

1651
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,951
Nope not going to happen

1652
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
Knows better

1653
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
I'm going to say that if people don't like gross things

1654
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
They should skip ahead

1655
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
Text Glen okay

1656
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,727
It's pretty gross

1657
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,543
Okay baby comes out of nowhere as much as

1658
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
It's going to

1659
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:53,663
For you that sounds about right now

1660
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,943
Disgusting

1661
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,503
Alexei on the show

1662
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,039
Like that for this

1663
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:08,255
You're having sex with your wife

1664
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,399
Imagine your wife gives you permission

1665
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,447
Whataburger

1666
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,311
Menu

1667
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:23,103
Come on

1668
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,991
That's how many people compared to

1669
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,783
Vaccine

1670
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,551
Things are putting

1671
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831

01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,599
Sent to you

1673
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
That was discussed

1674
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,183
What the fuk was that

1675
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
What the fuk was that

1676
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:44,095
I could have gone my entire life without hearing Alex Jones a ejaculate

1677
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,375
The fuk was that

1678
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,007
It was unfortunate that's what that was

1679
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
His response

1680
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,847
What the f*** did you just say

1681
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,663
Alex

1682
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,943
You just said that

1683
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,039
Oh my God Alex you are

1684
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,063
You're asking me

1685
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,367
Ask Dave link questions

1686
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:08,159
If you're talking about

1687
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,695
About to

1688
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
Hey Alec

1689
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,999
Did you just say

1690
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:17,887
You know how when you ejaculate inside of a woman and she doesn't want you to

1691
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,911
She gets mad

1692
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,287
Why did you just say that to me cuz I don't know how that feels I don't know how that feels

1693
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,591
I don't know how that feels I don't like

1694
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Knowing that

1695
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:28,639
You know how that feels

1696
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Let's meet up in the head

1697
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,599
Now we're back to Nan gross programming

1698
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Is Christ

1699
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,903
The edl

1700
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,231
Apparently is calling everybody who doesn't want

1701
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
Medical knots

1702
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,791
So yes I'm to come in

1703
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,351
To the world you are calling those people not

1704
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:51,423
Because he doesn't want medic

1705
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,703
Nazi ironic

1706
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,983
That they would call the knots

1707
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
These Nazis when they themselves are the Nazis

1708
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,103
I bet this clip

1709
01:15:59,359 --> 01:15:59,871
Ends poorly

1710
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,919
What do you make of the ATL

1711
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:06,271
Calling anyone that doesn't want this Nazi law over us Nazis

1712
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:11,647
Two-month-old terrorism policy put out my mind says You? Down

1713
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:18,047

01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Why are they doing this to us

1723
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,303

1727
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751

Why

1731
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:05,407
Are the Jews attacking white people is what I didn't

1732
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,943
Actually say

1733
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,247
But I'm very heavily implied

1734
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
Great

1735
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,319

He has it what's it like to be Vindicated about everything

1744
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,031
But this one's even

1745
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:32,799
Okay

1746
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,807
What is it like doing all this

1747
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Physically

01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:08,895
Upside down where we going

1753
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,687
We are

1754
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:13,247
No.

1755
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,783
Terrifying time of what the

1756
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:15,551
They're trying to do

1757
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,367
If you if you're paying attention to wave this question

1758
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,647
Started is

1759
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:23,231
Barnes there are not many people who know as much as I do and

1760
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,535
Do you do what is it like to be as smart as me

1761
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:26,559
Yep

1762
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:32,959
I don't know how a human being could not respond to that

1763
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Messing with Siri

1764
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007

What are you talkin

1767
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,407
Did the underlying things that are said

1768
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:42,175
Two people

1769
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,711
Like barns

1770
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,991
It's pretty rude

1771
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
Yeah that question isn't it

1772
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
Itself a little bit

1773
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
Dick head

1774
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,903
Also of all the thing you know

1775
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,999
Types of people where they give you that one sign

1776
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:59,071
I would like almost immediately to where it's like

1777
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,351
Listen

1778
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
I know how to

1779
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,911
Control my body of course

1780
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:08,543
And you look at them in your like the one thing you absolutely do not know how to do is control your body

1781
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,103
Do you feel like saying that

1782
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
Timmy is an acceptable thing

1783
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,943
Feel responsive

1784
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711

What are you f****** talk

1786
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
Talking about

1787
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,135
How can I sell you a pillow

1788
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
Looking

1789
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:27,743
I actually can't tell you why

1790
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,047
Code override

1791
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:35,167
Oh my God Michael Dell's website

1792
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
We got one last clip in

1793
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,751
Alex bringing everything back

1794
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,543
Into the center

1795
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:43,871
Full circle

1796
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,663
Got it ready

1797
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,831
From a lot of sources while I'm jacking Celtics

1798
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:02,047
Stephanie Claire basically civil emergency climate emergency martial law

1799
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,375
On the 11th when they see is alerting all the rest of it so

1800
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:11,007
I'm telling you man this is one hell of a time

1801
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
To be alive

1802
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
So the 11th

1803
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,640
Is B

1804
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664
Totally going

1805
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
Hbms

1806
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,480
According to many many many many many sores

1807
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:22,016
Does not just Jack Pacific

1808
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,552
Yeah baby walk

1809
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:28,928
Bye because Alex will do it

1810
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,720
And you should know that Alex is reporting

1811
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,024
Is totally accurate

1812
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,328
Nothing happened

1813
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:36,864
He's still right

1814
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,632
Right now

1815
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:40,448
Only changed it because he's so right

1816
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,240
What is it like to be as dumb as

1817
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,008
With me right now

1818
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,176
This is this is the game you how I got this is why I like

1819
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,968
Like predictions blow people's minds

1820
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Man

1821
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:56,320
Cuz maybe it'll happen if you behave this way

1822
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
But maybe

1823
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,648
What little load of s*** happened

1824
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:03,744
That's my prediction so Jordan This episodes a little infuriating mostly because

1825
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,096
Cuz it started with the promise of Barnes advising Alex on the legality of

1826
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:08,864
Some sort of

1827
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,144
The plan

1828
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,704
This this check-offs

1829
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
Plan never

1830
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,080
I wonder if the advice was given by a text message

1831
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:20,384
And the answer was no don't say that on your

1832
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:22,176
They could have been

1833
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,968
We will never know

1834
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,784
Yeah and then we got to the 11th

1835
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,320
Be worried about

1836
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:34,720
I mean it's going to be really weird whenever they surprised us with it usually they're like we're going into lockdown event

1837
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,744
Actually not like

1838
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,328
Outside today if you're caught outside dialects with guns

1839
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,096
Surprise

1840
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,936
There's going to be that emergency alert

1841
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,984
On the 11th

1842
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,752
That's going

1843
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,288
I'm sure sure

1844
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,824
Just going to be the second day of my

1845
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Glendale's

1846
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Does asterisk

1847
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:55,456
I'm calling it an advance but away

1848
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,480
It could be not

Some sort but

1855
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,680
I just I think this is

1856
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,216
I'm going to be a disappointment

1857
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,008
Maybe

1858
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,800

1859
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,824

1865
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
I don't think so

1866
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
Probably

1867
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:51,264

During the Cyber Symposium live stream

1877
