1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey everybody dan here just wanted to say hello and give you all a little bit of it true

2
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
Confusing

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,848
Based on the fact that this episode a couple weeks back

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,664
So there's something that may sound a little bit

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,760
Like for instance episode I say that I just signed a lease

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,832
When I at the point that we are.

7
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Zipso comes out I've already moved

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
This new apartment

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,696
And also Jordan makes referee

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
Prince to the idea that we just

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
I recorded a emotional

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm at now I have foisted this episode 35 to listen to

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Upon him

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,800
And that is because we recorded this right after we recorded the episode that came out

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,640
Where we talked about Alex Jones is coverage of the Christchurch shooting

16
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
Idris healing

17
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
Damn so he's still reeling from that a little bit

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
As we jump into this

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Episode

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,112
For a long time now I've been getting messages from listeners

21
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,392
Reached out

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,976
Express that they would like for us to cover Stefan molyneux

23
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:06,816
I'd like us to take a look at our thoughts

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,144
Watch the number of his videos and

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,472
Most of the time by I don't find them

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
To be something I really

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
I have much interest

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,056
Been covering

29
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:22,176
I think a lot of people who do shows that are slightly different focused than us have done

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,480
Great pointing out of

31
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
Things that are wrong with his world

32
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
There's a lot of coverage

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
You can find a vet service stuff

34
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,904
But I did think there was

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,488
That speak to me and I thought that it would be something

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
That snow was worth our time

37
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,840
Episode

38
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Here here

39
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,728
There was a part of me that felt that this would be the beginning of a longer series

40
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:50,080
About him that may be forthcoming in the future at some point

41
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,432
It's an open question at this point but for now we have this episode here

42
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,480
That I hope you enjoy

43
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344
With the who-knows-what Kubiak

44
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
Controlling

45
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Alexandra Thurston color

46
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
George

47
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
Whose last time you signed a lease finally got it all taken care of it like to thank everyone for their thoughts

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,784
Some prayers and concerns

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
Have been not real Hasselbeck

50
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
I will be I will be

51
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:48,192
Something that I can make it through

52
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
Keystaff

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
You know our recording

54
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,544
Bedroom

55
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
One-bedroom Studios

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,176
That sort of

57
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,504
I don't know over a decade

58
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,576
Assertive have kind of space

59
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,344
Experience

60
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
I'm excited for that

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
You know what I just realized

62
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,936
Interesting turn of events

63
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,080
I have lived in this building before

64
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,456
Laundry room

65
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,256
Is the quarter machines there

66
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
Grocery store

67
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,144
The customer service area

68
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,704
Get a roll of quarters so far ahead

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
I've been on top of that

70
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
It's nice

71
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
I just

72
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,944
Girlfriend

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,064
First time in my life

74
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,392
Beautiful

75
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:15,744
Apartments

76
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
Unessential

77
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:27,263
I don't like the rest of this apartment and honestly I fix the washer and dryer

78
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:33,151
Too much space you know

79
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,735
Variables

80
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
Limit other parts

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Very much

82
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:49,279
Support of our listeners

83
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,119
People who signed up

84
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
First to give a shout out to

85
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,775
Do some new donors

86
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,055
Your nail polish

87
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,943
I'm a policy wonk

88
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,783
I'm a policy wonk

89
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
Richard

90
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm a policy wonk

91
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,271
Thank you so much

92
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
You're now technically

93
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
Someone sodomites

94
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
I don't want

95
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,039
Just Sports

96
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
Goodnight

97
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
Appreciate it very much

98
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,911
The world

99
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,543
And instead of giving shoutouts to people who do donate we just finally got

100
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:42,943
Could never imagine doing that sort of shity

101
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
Or just anybody who we are showing you're not paying us

102
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,623
Fuc yourself

103
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Review

104
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Caribou

105
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
It's the van molyneux

106
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:22,367
Look at it this way

107
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:28,767
Bring it up the wackiness shirt

108
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:34,143
Evil monsters

109
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
Really struggled

110
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:40,543
What to do about this

111
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,591
Like requests from people to like

112
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,735
Hey you guys should cover Stefan molyneux

113
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
I'm aware of part of the internet

114
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
Lives and thrives

115
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
How do you solve a problem like Maria

116
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:59,743
Write absolutely to talk about

117
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,583
That's one of the things that kind of works in his favor

118
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,191
Is there anybody who wants to be like problem with this guy

119
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
Hours later you still haven't of what makes

120
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
Is Joe and what he does

121
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
So incredibly dangerous

122
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
To be honest I do not know anything

123
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,807
I've seen people screenshotted

124
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Tweets or something and it's like

125
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Tamia

126
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,303
Who's trying to be provocative

127
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,423
This is

128
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
Little bit of that going on with him

129
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,455
The criticism that I have for him

130
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,551
I have to wait. She is just outside of the scope of what I can

131
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Today but

132
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
As we begin

133
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
I can't give you a little bit of information

134
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Number one

135
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
He's bald

136
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:10,143
Okay I am out that's alright

137
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,983
Beneath the surface look

138
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:14,751
Stefan molyneux

139
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,079
Cover in a single episode

140
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,663
In reality it was outside of the framework of an in-depth

141
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,455
Week-long series

142
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:28,063
Do that because I fear it's dreadfully boring

143
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
Resisted covering Stefan molyneux because of stories I've heard that he's super litigious and really interested

144
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
People who uses contacts

145
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
I'm not willing to let the fear of that possibility stop me from covering someone I see in the white

146
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:48,543
Media

147
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,663
I've reviewed irrelevant Fair

148
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,783
Use laws and everything on this episode

149
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
Criticizing

150
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,159
Providing commentary in the clear

151
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
What compelled me to make this change my position

152
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,023
About

153
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
To cover him to be like we got to do this

154
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,655
Is that in December 2018 he released a mini documentaries

155
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
That should scare the s*** out of any

156
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:17,727
Thinking person

157
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
In the world

158
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,591
We'll get to that in a little bit

159
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Cuz you don't know anything about

160
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
Self-described philosopher

161
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,599
Messages to YouTube channel and his internet radio show domain radio

162
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,231
Okay so I don't know you might have

163
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
First of all molyneux isn't real

164
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:48,447
History from McGill University Masters in history from the University of Toronto

165
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Degrees in philosophy

166
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
I guess you could have been a philosophy minor but so was I and you don't see me doing the six-part series on philosophy 101

167
00:10:56,127 --> 00:11:00,223
Like the trial of Socrates

168
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
Damn damn damn

169
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
Do you think the original Plaza

170
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,743
Original original

171
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,511
Okay

172
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,447
Go to the philosophy it was easier back then

173
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
People hadn't said a lot of those really basic already laying there

174
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:33,247
Early philosophers didn't on the vine

175
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,343
Outside

176
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,487
Important things about it like philosophy education is

177
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,791
Like the history of these ideas

178
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:46,815
Is and stuff like that

179
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
And I didn't exist

180
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,727
Tradition of philosophy

181
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,895
There's a real dangerous ideas

182
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
The background of all of them as well

183
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,295
That is a lazy and bad philosopher

184
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Uses words that sound smart to dump

185
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,927
Attempt

186
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
What's use inference to make arguments or diagram a sentence

187
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:28,031
High school debate clubs and teams

188
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Which should come as a surprise to Noah

189
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:36,479
I've said it once and I will say it again the only people who stay are pathological

190
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
A deranged psychopath

191
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
To feel that they can train themselves

192
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Do use language of the weapon

193
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:48,511
I would not not his school's valedictorian

194
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,071
You know I would

195
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Painting

196
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
Literally debate

197
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
With such a broad brush

198
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,879
Without logic philosophy is

199
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:20,511
Everybody who enjoys Debate Club and stuff like that

200
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
They're all the same person

201
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,071
It is one of these

202
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,911
One of the biases that I've had in my at my stereotype

203
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
And I have never been wrong anytime I've met somebody who's like

204
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
Called Caribou systems in 1990

205
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,063
T5000

206
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:50,463
A listener of the show is written

207
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
Difficult access

208
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,863
Opera $800,000 for his share of the business

209
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
It took 18 months off work to write a book

210
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:02,239
Revolution

211
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,031
Which was self-published on December 9th

212
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,055
2002

213
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:11,711
Amazon

214
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,503
1099 dollars

215
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,039
So I'm going to have to pass

216
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
First editions of like

217
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Emily Dickinson that are cheaper than

218
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,791
Oh I feel like I was attacked

219
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:33,727
What's the number of books over the years of titles like the Gods

220
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,055
The art of the argument Western Civilization

221
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,591
And Aunt Ruth

222
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
Yeah

223
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:49,087
Because harpercollins and penguin books are run by Dirty collectivist

224
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,487
He's afraid of a note

225
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
Letters that would come from in trying to actually get anyone

226
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:03,679
Publicist literary agent

227
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,543
Is daunting

228
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,431
2005

229
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
The temp is grown into a full-fledged

230
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
He has books videos podcast podcast behind paywalls

231
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,671
Process

232
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,439
Of new recruit

233
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,047
Accounts that I've been able to find people who have left freedomain radio

234
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
Feature the same point

235
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,287
When you get out of a libertarian anarcho-capitalist

236
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
And discussion

237
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,335
But it's

238
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,639
Remember the community who experienced

239
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Refusal to accept criticism

240
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,807
Is narcissism grow is the show got more popular

241
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,135
80 clear projection about emotional issues relations

242
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,439
As the main driver of that chain

243
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,487
Why doesn't sound like any call later I've ever

244
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Now I need to tell you about the

245
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
The documentary

246
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,215
Documentary called a philosopher in Poland

247
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,287
For Houston

248
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,359
Experience. Countries 100th anniversary parade

249
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,175
What he actually does is something quite different

250
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Okay

251
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Now that

252
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,087
It's for a documentary

253
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Seems kind of

254
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,647
Fun and joyful

255
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,279
Nation celebrate 800

256
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
Yeah

257
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
And they would have

258
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,239
Positive way of viewing

259
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
Sure

260
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Nations do batshit that happens

261
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,943
But at the end of the day we're all the same

262
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Taken as a whole

263
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
Is profoundly f*****

264
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
It is not about going

265
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
March

266
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Cruel indoctrination

267
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Absolutely

268
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,535
Dyke

269
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,351
Rear demonstration of a man coming to terms

270
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:14,751
With being a white nationalist

271
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:18,847
100-year anniversary of the Third Reich

272
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,503
Restart the documentary

273
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
To learn about

274
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:38,815
Diversity of Europe is always

275
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
Pan-european family history from Ireland to England

276
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,359
And my family history bleeds Eastwood

277
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
Can I find Poland

278
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Incredibly fascinating

279
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:59,039
My notebooks. Question that I feel like

280
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:02,623
Until I get some answers how is Poland

281
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:09,279
Able to preserve its culture and its religiosity and its history so passionately

282
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
Is it constantly refer to in the mainstream media press as

283
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,031
Opel phrases

284
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,567
That it's not

285
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
I'm an empiricist I always want to get the fruit

286
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:24,639
It is all true

287
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,743
I totally get it because every part of that is a red flag

288
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
The true diversity of Europe

289
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
You like a version

290
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:03,039
You also come to the idea

291
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:14,047
Ultra-nationalist

292
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,655
The documentary itself you already know good

293
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:24,031
God damn well he's going to make peace with those things

294
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Wait

295
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
I love those

296
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Xenophobic

297
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,159
You know what I say

298
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Probably good

299
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,399
Turn all the stuff that's really apply here as we go along

300
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,959
I think one of the major reasons

301
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Is it when he went to Poland

302
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
No one yelled at him

303
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,175
Like they like they generally to in his daily life

304
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,015
They love me and I bet it's totally not because

305
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,927
Here is him discussing that just a couple minutes

306
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
Here's something else we did which I'm telling you my friends would be impossible

307
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,095
To do any other place I've ever spoken

308
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,375
And that is

309
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,447
We put out a request for anybody who wanted to come by and chat

310
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
Three social media open to the world

311
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,823
Could have done this in Canada could have done this in America

312
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,871
Australia New Zealand

313
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
So

314
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:39,295
Meetup

315
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,183
Nice little town hall

316
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Yeah okay

317
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,839
Maybe a bad example parallel but like

318
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,935
You can say the n-word at a Klan meeting and no one's going to yell at you

319
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:02,335
You understand that's true different circumstances you can do different things that are unacceptable another place

320
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,383
Right

321
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Xenophobic ultra-nationalist

322
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
You get yelled at

323
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,807
In other places

324
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
Hate those ideas

325
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,512
Eliza has he is polishing

326
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
I believe that's his

327
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,376
Main goal in life right

328
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
And share ideas

329
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,104
It's good to share ride

330
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,128
Town Hall in Sharon

331
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
Different races are variable in quality

332
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,816
Pushback from people

333
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,840
Most places

334
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
The address online

335
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,984
For this Meetup

336
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
He describes where he goes

337
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,800
Let me show some footage

338
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,640
Is at a bar

339
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
Describes

340
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
Discuss

341
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,512
International

342
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,088
Hahaha

343
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Place

344
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,512
Where this guy headlines

345
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,864
Revolutionary ideas

346
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,632
To be discussed

347
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
People twerking

348
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,264
You know they're just objectivist

349
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,104
People like that can come together and have these ideas and the great

350
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
It's in the basement

351
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,664
Headquarters

352
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,432
In Polish

353
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:19,808
These not recur reading are a space

354
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,464
Call the freedom Lounge

355
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
Quote the first right formation Center in Warsaw

356
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:38,240
The idea of a place to organize right-wing politics

357
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:50,016
So they can talk about it without

358
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,856
I'm more concerned about the fact that the founders of this Lounge

359
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,672
The right-wing formation Center

360
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
This is a place where rationalist objectivist

361
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,632
Can come to discuss ideas

362
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
That is an act

363
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
Whitewashing intention

364
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,800
Look at it

365
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
Discussion loving polish Patriot

366
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,408
It was funded entirely by the Warsaw enterprising

367
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
I think list

368
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Demography

369
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,296
Is one of the two primary areas of enter

370
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,648
Warsaw Enterprise Institute webpage

371
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
The Warsaw Enterprise Institute

372
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:33,536
It was created with conservative and free-market youth in mind

373
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
A place where youth organizations will be able to organize their events for you

374
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:43,776
Use the in-house television Studio to develop their professional careers as well as for socializing an Entertainer

375
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,896
The freedom Lounge is part of a strategy being employed by the Wei

376
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:53,504
To facilitate propaganda and social recruitment towards hall right ideas

377
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:57,600
This isn't some cool coffee house being full of revolutionary thinker

378
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,392
It's a well-funded hard rights

379
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,416
Think Tank created

380
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Space

381
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
We're fascism

382
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Confessor

383
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:05,792
Which

384
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
Explain to me

385
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
How what he said

386
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
Makes sense

387
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,240
Like whenever he's like

388
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,616
Xenophobic

389
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Fascist

390
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,816
That is a meaningless sentiment unless you are a person

391
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,912
Color or something along those lines

392
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:49,312
Coming into a place where with a fashion

393
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
Everyone in that bar is

394
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,784
Tiger documentary

395
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,392
That was the moment I read one of Stefan molyneux tweet

396
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
Heavily implied

397
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
A lot of different

398
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
Would be shocked if he's met a black person

399
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,752
That's Wei funded organize and run

400
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544

403
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,760
Really cool kids who like a

00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,064
Market get together in

405
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:45,888
Likes discussing the free market no idea

406
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,472
Barone's

407
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:59,968
TV

408
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
The pack

409
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,600
I'm sure someone exist in that mold but it's kind of comical

410
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Imagine.

411
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,024
I believe was the original working title

412
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,632
Narrative

413
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,936
He give this speech

414
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
What is shock

415
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,776
Here is his response to it afterwards

416
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
He's just so amazing

417
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
What's the well

418
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,688
We were in a glass-enclosed area face

419
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:34,528
Talking about philosophical ideas

420
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
No fear

421
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:43,232
Crazy people who want to shoot us

422
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
All the other things that have happened

423
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,816
Other places like Ghana

424
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:52,448
Experience also we talked about ideas all night

425
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:55,008
Without anyone

426
00:27:55,264 --> 00:28:01,408
Normal or

427
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,224
Clouds intellectual

428
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,784
Discussions in the Westin

429
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,064
Politics of sassy

430
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:12,416
Is wonderful to have that so

431
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
So wonderful

432
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:20,096
Face of just wonder

433
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
Because

434
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
There's no way that it

435
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:31,616
Because it looks really following this

436
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,712
No fear of crazy

437
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:42,112
People who might send bomb threats are others

438
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,952
Bombs with minorities

439
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
Well

440
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,288
Actually talking about his last like bomb threats in

441
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Fearing for his

442
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Really more talkin about

443
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,944
Disrupt

444
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,784
Like if I were to go to some college campus in the United States

445
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,088
Give a speech I will get that Milo treatment

446
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,416
F*** you

447
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:23,840
Assistant

448
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:27,168
Everybody was concerned

449
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:33,568
Or concerns for them out or repressed to a level where it never

450
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
The conversation about

451
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
Human rights

452
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
That just doesn't come up

453
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
You discussing meeting someone

454
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
This Bar

455
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:47,648
This is the only place where I'm going to make a leap of logic

456
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,208
That is maybe irresponsible

457
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
But I think I know who it is

458
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,792
I'm not entirely sure but I

459
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:57,120
I think I know who it if you were making a leap of faith I would say it was

460
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:05,312
It is

461
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
I met a man

462
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,408
In the freedom bar

463
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,224
To the man who was organizing the entire

464
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,784
Now they were facing

465
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Opposition

466
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:18,624
WFAN.

467
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,648
The matter Wausau

468
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,720
Cancel the entire Market to dancing timer

469
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
They were engaged

470
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,816
Any significant legal battle

471
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,632
Try and get the mic back on

472
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
So he meets this guy at

473
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,056
Was canceled

474
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
Which will get into in a little bit

475
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,688
That's a big first question before you end NES

476
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,064
And their culture back

477
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,344
The mayor of Warsaw

478
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
Cancel the March

479
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:52,160
Here is why the mayor of Warsaw

480
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
He's talking about

481
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,704
It is one of the only other people who interviewed in this documentary

482
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:12,640
This in-between I believe this guy

483
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,944
Whose name is Lucas worth

484
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
Here is a little bit of his

485
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,040
Estefan

486
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,392
Liberal

487
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,072
It's like

488
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,144
In Poland

489
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,496
The. Of collectivism during the year

490
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,080
. between like sayings

491
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
2015

492
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
When they say these words

493
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
These were

494
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,272
Preschool

495
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,576
Remember that 2015

496
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,208
Who is a person who

497
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,280
The in-between that connects upon molyneux with

498
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
The guy who

499
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,840
We'll talk about the next clip

500
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,168
Sure this guy whether or not

501
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,960
Whoever them between kind of

502
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,288
This guy is named Lucas Ortega

503
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,616
If you Google him you'll find it complice photographer

504
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Which is great

505
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
But doesn't really explain his involvement in this documentary

506
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
To understand

507
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:21,504
You have to go past the

508
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
First page of search

509
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
That stuff

510
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
To do if you do you find a really crazy coincidence that Lucas wore chica is one of the primary writers for the

511
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:37,120
The people who built the freedom Harley-Davidson chatterley ER

512
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:43,776
On January 1st 2019 published

513
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:47,360
Amounted to Liberal indoctrination of school kids

514
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,944
He discusses a textbook passage about a pyramid

515
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
That describes different levels

516
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:58,112
The lowest floor of the pyramid is verbal acceptance

517
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Which is absurd

518
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,976
Are we obliged to everything we do not like

519
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,280
It looks like it because this layer receive

520
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,560
Exclusion language

521
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,352
Parentheses out-of-focus

Category arbitrarily interpreted by The Lacs

523
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,008
Parenthetically

524
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,288
We can't even gossip

525
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,592
And even making malicious jokes

526
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
According to all ports

527
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,712
All these behaviors lead to violence

528
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,272
While the top of the pyramid is extermination

529
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:31,392
So to put in a nutshell maliciously joking with a friend I'm aiming for his extermination

530
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
No

531
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:35,232
He's making a

532
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,000

We hear from Alex Jones

These

538
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,456
Making younger people aware of the consequences

Directions

540
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,808
That sort of thing is to indoctrinate exempt

541
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:06,208
To be all about that I don't like

These the same

That they keep popping up all over the place

Poland

560
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,856
Makes me pretty suspicious that it's because he was told and not to mention

561
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:09,696
That's kind of feeling that I

562
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,232
The idea

563

00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Is just a photographer

571
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,320
I don't know why he's in the documentary

572
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,696
Wish you hell is this wonderful

573
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
You might want to give people a little bit of history about who started

574
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:56,800
We were in Austin

575
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:07,552
There's no point

576
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,624
If your perception of this is a heroic

577
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,392
Important

578
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,184
Free Speech Wonder

579
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,232
The world

580
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Here in Warsaw.

581
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,840
It would behoove you really

582
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,888
It would be an ugly

583
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
Thing to just say like

584
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:30,080
And thank God the Warsaw Enterprise

585
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,480
In your world

586
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,880
They are nothing but unless you recognize

587
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Stephon

588
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,440
Recognizing

589
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
How's are all over this documentary

590
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,768
Would make

591
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,496
This is 100% a propaganda

592
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:01,824
To the Prager University haha

593
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Goodbye

594
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,128
You can stop right there

595
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Yeah

596
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:10,016
So I don't know if Lucas is the guy who connected

597
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
Did Stephon with

598
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
This guy is going to talk to

599
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
Who's trying to get

600
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,672
The Martian running in earnest

601
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
HVAC guy

602
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
And

603
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,120
Start tomorrow

604
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,472
True the Center of Warsaw

605
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,800
From the bridge and the March

606
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
National

607
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
Devon

608
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,736
The land of what is March's going

609
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,504
To be about

610
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:42,784
That's all good

611
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
1st March

612
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
Southwest

613
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
And then Southeast

614
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Northeast

615
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,488
And then Northwest

616
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,560
And then we go back down north south

617
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
And then Southwest

618
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
Domingo

619
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,144
Over

620
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
Northwest

621
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,240
And then Southwest and then we March back up

622
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
North

623
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Are used

624
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
Selfie

625
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,128
And then go back down one more time

626
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
It one more time straight

627
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,712
Can do this pretty much

628
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
I think

629
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
You know what I got

630
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Bosa

631
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,440
The primary interview subjects

632
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Documentary

633
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,048
He's credited organizer anniversary March

634
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
Interesting

635
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,472
Ser

636
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,104
Which is pretty easy and free simple f****** for someone to make

637
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,184
He's only got more right-wing as his career has gone on

638
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
He's currently a member of the national movement party

639
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,536
The party that only came into existence

640
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,560
Open 2013

641
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,888
Has been a force of hyper nationalism and xenophobia ever since

642
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
With a little dash of LGB

643
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,520
Folk don't deserve rights thrown in for good measure

644
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
They trace their roots to quote

645
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
Active before World War

646
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
Shifting Poland politics

647
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
To the extreme right

648
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
In recent years

649
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,816
Along with a couple of other parties that are silly

650
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:35,680
Or not surprisingly are also involved in organizing

651
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,264
Trace our history back

652
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,336
To anti-Semitism before World War

653
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Yes

654
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,432
All right that's not a ring

655
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,248
I believe a little bit more into that a little bit later in the oven

656
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,880
No

657
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,768
The key in an interview with this known to talk about it

658
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,048
Android

659
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:07,680
Critical coverage of politician party

660
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:13,056
Brought up

661
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,504
Tracing his lineage all the way back to a World War

662
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,648
Uncool

663
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Backwards just

664
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,512
Really uncool

665
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
2015

666
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,752
And part of that is probably because

667
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
Office

668
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,176
He's done a good deal of work to democratic power

669
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,712
Andres Judah

670
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,808
Injustice 2

671
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
And refusing to give their rulings

672
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Official state back

673
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,072
Is just a puppet of the real power of the Polish government

674
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,168
He's the leader of the law and Justice party

675
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,704
Which doodle was apart of

676
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
Until he got elected

677
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:17,056
Independence

678
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,360
It really still being under the sway of

679
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,664
Prison School

680
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Hazing

681
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,648
Is a hore nationalists who aspires to assert

682
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Complete government

683
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,696
Control over

684
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,304
Who controls the moral Revolution

685
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
You super bad news

686
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:44,704
And you had the party that elected Duda as well as their current Prime Minister in Poland

687
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,752
Bypass

688
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
But in reality

689
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
All indications are that they're actually getting the March

690
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
Motors Direct

691
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
If it's not a problem

692
00:41:54,687 --> 00:42:00,831
Peterson stats innsky periodical against the Communist Party in the 80s

693
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Put it this way

694
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,415
There are no longer checks and balances

695
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,719
The power the parliamentary system is dysfunction

696
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
The Constitutional Court in

697
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
Judiciary

698
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Paralyzed

699
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,375
New laws passed by the parliament

700
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
The government is supposed to publish sentences

701
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
The Constitutional Court to the journal

702
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
For them to become legally effect

703
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
This is required by the Constitution

704
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:23,103
But the government by not printing

705
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
Paralyzed

706
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:28,991
The Constitutional Court which has been reduced

707
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,039
It's a very dangerous time

708
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
It's a very dangerous time

709
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,135
Because I'm That Kind of

710
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:39,231
Evil people are the first to realize that there are no longer consequences for their actions

711
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
In this vacuum in Poland

712
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
Fascist xenophobic group

713
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
Growing empowered

714
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,631
The very rapid pace

715
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,471
Since 2015 to be there to push back

716
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Against the mob

717
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,335
This all came to a head of the Independence Day March 2017

718
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
The year before this documentary is shot

719
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,455
Which brings us to the reason why there isn't

720
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
Going to be in March this year

721
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
According to the mayor of Warsaw

722
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
There's a real reason

723
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,135
But here's what Kristoff bosox says

724
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,375
So there is no

725
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
Until we went to the court

726
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,495
Concord councils of the constellation

727
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
Always

728
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,943
It's not that far right March

729
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,991
National conservative

730
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759

Answer

741
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
That's something for important

742
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,087
Say anything

743
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:13,183
Is literally called

744
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:18,815
Okay remember the videos that came out 2017 dependence March in Polish

And refugees get out

750
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,871
It broke out all over the Martian

751
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:37,503
Buy a new station from Power

752
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,855
Tommy Robinson made the trip from the UK specifically to be there for that

753
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:42,879
August 8th March

Andy edel a language teacher in Poland describe the marches quotes 52,000 mostly football hooligan

People in Black Mask March behind large banners that read Islam equal Terror

Anti-Semitism and elimination is

762
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
The world war

763
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:24,095
Their party was outlawed by the state back then

764
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:27,167
But now in 2017

765
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,703
If its independence date March

766
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,007
As you might imagine the objects of this work

767
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
F****** terrible

768
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:36,383
Marched alongside outright

769
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Fascist

770
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
A celebration of national Independence

771
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,991
It's been characterized by people with

772
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,271
Text Amanda

773
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:51,743
The politicians are like I don't want to be okay with it

774
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:58,143
I don't want to be

775
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,287
Who are also racist

776
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:11,199
Colin Kaepernick doesn't have a job

777
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,271
Your word we use ours

778
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:22,207
Happy about that March Optics individuals that came out of it and people

779
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
That's really scary

780
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
That's

781
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:31,167
Strolled around the organizers like Christophe Bostock

782
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
Nationalism

783
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:37,311
President do decided to make his own independent

784
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,847
Kmart's to replace the

785
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,639
Organized

786
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
Hibernate

787
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:48,063
Specifically

788
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:55,231
Under threat of arrest

789
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,583
Tatoosh anality take

790
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,399
Replacements 2015 environment Poland

791
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,447
Worthy

792
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
The same thing happened in our country

793
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,567
Are fascists and Nazis

794
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,663
This is a large-scale problem in the world which is why has no surprise

795
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,039
Fascist also marched with signs that said God

796
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
Which is a reference to polish song

797
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
They were quoting the song

798
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,975
They're quoting Trump referencing the song in a speech that he gave in Poland

799
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
A few months prior

800
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:33,375
I just sent you the March was published in politico's European arm

801
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,727
It makes it very strange attempt to minimize the fascist

802
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:45,151
Nationalist of the fascist

803
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
This is really defensive guy trying to defend

804
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
March and he's starting with 10%

805
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:01,279
That's not a good sign 60,000 total people

806
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:06,143
Nothing

807
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:10,495
An argument that this is really about how the EU is desperate

808
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
The quote use the threat of fascist

809
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
As an excuse to push

810
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,615
For further centralization of bureaucracy

811
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Sedation

812
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:22,015
Probably worth noting that that defense that article in Politico was written by

813
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:26,623
President of enterprise

814
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:31,231
I didn't want to pull because I knew this was coming because I did the same thing to you

815
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,535
Whenever I did my climate change episode

816
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
But

817
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:42,751
Everywhere

818
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,031
Everywhere

819
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,383
What's going on with this March

820
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:50,687
It got way out of hand

821
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
In 2017

822
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
This

823
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:58,111
And then they came up with the sanitized version

824
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,647
Is agreeable to everybody

825
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:06,047
The Nationalist still got to be apart of the March the government got to celebrate the 100th anniversary

826
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Everyone got the

827
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
Come out in

828
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,631
And it didn't appear

829
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,959
Dear to be something so f***** up right

830
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:19,359
The year before right nobody screams killed the Jews everyone is like they were talking about the Blues

831
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:26,015
Any other

832
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,295
Thanks

833
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,831
Oh good work

834
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
He's really excited

835
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
Go to this

836
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,279
See that hear that

837
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,303
Without thinking

838
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,607
Part of why you're excited to go to this March

839
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
Did you know what happened to 27

840
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
It doesn't

841
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,775
I don't know how to encapsulate this other than

842
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,383
He saw the image of what was being reported in the 2017 March

843
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,175
So he comes to the 28th

844
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,223
With the idea of like

845
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,527
Is it as bad as everyone says

846
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
And obviously it's not going to be

847
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:01,599
Is bad

848
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,415
Because the government has stepped in and said we will arrest you

849
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,719
If you have racist and fascist

850
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
If the government didn't do

851
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:11,071
Do that

852
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
Control some of those aspects

853
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,775
So what you're seeing is actually the opposite of free speech

854
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:23,359
Being represented manifested here

855
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
And it's a trap

856
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:26,175
Because the van molyneux is going to

857
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,503
He's going to see the margins like everyone lies about them

858
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:34,879
Yeah yeah yeah yeah everyone is just so full of s***

859
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
The only reason of that

860
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:42,559
If that is the case is because of State

861
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,327
So

862
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,911
I don't know when he made the plan to go to this

863
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,447
But he knew

864
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,983
Before you made the

865
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:51,007
The plan to go to the March

866
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,799
That the government was going to

867
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
The clampdown on

868
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
Hate speech

869
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Maybe

870
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:02,271
Orville worth

871
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
My supposition is also

872
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,671
You know it wouldn't have mattered it could have been a shitshow like it was in 2017

873
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,975
But he still would have made the same documentary

874
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:18,655
With a different.

875
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:22,239
Documentary

876
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:28,639
Call antifa colon

877
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,711
Turn into a victim narrative esposa Lake isn't this

878
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,503
White ethnostate wonderful

879
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:41,695
That's where we're going

880
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:48,351
People around

881
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
It's f*** out of here

882
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,991
Stefan molyneux claim videos

883
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,783
He's not really specific

884
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,599
And it's not

885
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,415
He thinks with his name is spelled in the Polish way which is

886
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,439
Nevermind

887
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:14,207
Give a s***

888
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,279
How exciting

889
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,559
Take Play Take Park

890
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,839
In this polish

891
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
When he's not pulling

892
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,215
He's not he's not involved

893
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
With their country at all

894
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Express

895
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,847
So here

896
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
You're able

897
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:32,895
Celebrate

898
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Beanpole

899
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,455
You're able to celebrate

900
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
And everything is survive

901
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
And everything it will account

902
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
In the future

903
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Unironically

904
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,903
Without having to deferred other

905
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,487
People's feelings of a couches feelings other races feelings you can just celebrate

906
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,023
Who You Are

907
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,047
And where you are

908
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,095
I really wanted to

909
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
Like I could return to that brief window of my

910
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,959
With celebration

911
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,175
There before that she was talking about how when he was a younger man

912
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,503
There was that

913
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,271
You could have

914
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
And being in

915
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,487
So he's like now

916
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Taste

917
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,119
Who's the Sun

918
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,911
Remember so romantic

919
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Being proud of

920
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,055
B b

921
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,407
It's

922
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,175
Does what

923
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Just what

924
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:43,295
Did she think what he just said

925
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,695
Because I feel like what he just said is you're allowed to celebrate

926
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
Like when he says without having to

927
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
To defer to other races

928
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:55,071
Is like wait

929
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:58,399
Do you mean without having to consider what other people think

930
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:04,543
.

931
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
Part of this nation

932
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,919
And you don't even have to think about how rude

933
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,247
Like I kind of what you just said right

934
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,623
As long as you have a

935
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,695
You don't have to be concerned about other

936
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:25,023
Races in what you're doing today

937
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
Right

938
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:34,495
Again it's important to note that this is the 28th

939
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,287
Which is operating with strict

940
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,567
Order from the government

941
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,711
This isn't free speech Haven is he wants

942
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
It's a March that exist

943
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,271
The full expectation

944
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,599
If you show up with your

945
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,415
Like I said earlier this is a very literal

946
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Representation of repressive Cinemark

947
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
Studies

948
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,535
But it definitely helps

949
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
Create the visuals that you need

950
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,167
Name of the ultra-nationalist he's hanging out a really just super into Poland

951
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
Xenophobic

952
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
Right

953
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,407
And now the worst manipulative

954
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Censoring speech

955
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,735
Present this place is a Bastion

956
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
In his next life we get to sponsored of wrestling with the idea that you

957
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Collectivist

958
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:29,023
To a very serious

959
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,559
Individual

960
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,351
That's defined

961
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,423
But you can find probably a decade

962
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,703
He's worth of videos on his

963
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:45,151
I would say you should have taken down some of them and thankfully I've got copies of them

964
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:47,199
But there's so many things

965
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,271
From his career one of the biggest pizza

966
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
Obsession

967
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,063
Individual

968
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
Who is Severus

969
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
Why you when

970
00:55:59,231 --> 00:55:59,743
Went to Poland

971
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:03,071
He starts to talk about how we wanted to challenge

972
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Dualism

973
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
Whether or not there is

974
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,399
The possibility

975
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,447
Collective

976
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,007
And that's f***** up

977
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,055
Given what we know about the collective

978
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,335
But you hanging out with

979
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,895
Call boy

980
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,599
My individualism because

981
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:31,999
Individualist know that I am skeptical if not

982
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:38,655
We have people

983
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:51,455
That 2,500 years ago whoever can live alone

984
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:04,255
Britain

985
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:10,655
I've just kind of shattered something within me

986
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:23,455
Has arisen

987
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:29,855
Before and I can't tell you how that I have

988
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:33,695
I've never been to before

989
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:39,583
I think this clip is a perfect encapsulation of how big is he

990
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:44,447
In this clip Stephon claims that his long-standing position of being an individual

991
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
Shattered

992
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:50,079
By being around these people we're all marching in the same direction and are there for the same reason

993
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
That's bulshit

994
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,895
Have you ever been to the pride parade

995
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,431
How about the Puerto Rican Day Parade

996
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,527
Any of these parades that I've been to in Chicago that are equally moving

997
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Engage with

998
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
What I need to do

999
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:06,975
Christopher consider one of his deepest held beliefs

1000
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,791
Collective

1001
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,607
All that took the shadow that was

1002
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:15,423
Be walking around in a large Collective of only white

1003
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,751
People that is all that is happening here in anyway

1004
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,055
I was a

1005
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:21,823
Rugged

1006
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
And then

1007
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:32,831
Collective

1008
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
F*** you

1009
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,279
What but I didn't I didn't want that to be thing

1010
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,559
Any more than you do

1011
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,423
But the moment he started saying like I've always been an individual

1012
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,471
Is tonight's finally found a collective

1013
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,311
Hey my head was screaming just

1014
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,991
This is the same thing as Alex

1015
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,527
Once he realizes why

1016
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:05,087
Applications of

1017
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
Rex 84

1018
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,903
Slipping on his

1019
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,743
Because those beliefs are conditional

1020
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:12,767
Those things

1021
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,303
People have built their entire

1022
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,095
Careers personality

1023
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Philosophies

1024
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:20,191
Whip as soon as they recognized

1025
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,495
This works better for me

1026
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,287
Yeah it's soon as that

1027
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:27,103
Being absorbed in the whole of America

1028
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,503
Whatever I want to be with my wife

1029
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
Yeah

1030
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:39,903
It's so sad it's such a

1031
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,743
I argue

1032
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,791
Dafont

1033
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
Is that he's a lazy bad philosopher

1034
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,055
Baby I will be at the collectors that they were the kind of collective

1035
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,639
I would Super Bee ones that exclude people

1036
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,967
Creeped out by afraid of her

1037
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
So

1038
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,807
I think in that last clip there you got the sense that

1039
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,831
Stephon was about to cry

1040
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,367
You kind of

1041
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,439
I don't know if you could pick that up

1042
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
You could definitely see some

1043
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
In his like

1044
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,559
I've never seen a collective

1045
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,143
Bright starts crying

1046
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,959
This point Unity disquiet fry

1047
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,239
Iskcon resolution

1048
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:29,055
Celebration without getting it

1049
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,023
That I have put up to defend myself against criticism

1050
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Have Unity

1051
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,095
Against criticism

1052
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,679
It is an appalling thing to take away people's history

1053
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,775
2 take away people's Pride

1054
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:02,847
And it is an appalling thing to take away their Unity

1055
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,407
Because I've never felt it

1056
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,455
More stronger than I do today

1057
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:12,831
Divided

1058
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
We thought

1059
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,951
Music

1060
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,767
Kickback in a roll of the March

1061
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
Shitol

1062
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:30,751
Who name is

1063
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,199
Career

1064
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Intention

1065
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,415
I realize what my career is about now

1066
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,975
About this

1067
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Like

1068
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
It's not really

1069
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:56,863
These things

1070
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
To get to that place

1071
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,679
I think it's just a realization

1072
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Look like

1073
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:07,359
Alright let's just get real battle ready

1074
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:15,295
I've been to the gay pride parade and I felt zero pride and I felt like I was being attacked but I go to the

1075
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:20,927
Nationals parade and I realize the collectivism is great

1076
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:23,487
Forget what

1077
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
Super clearly a very specific

1078
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,607
The footage that shows of the parade

1079
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
In Poland

1080
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,655
Like it is all white

1081
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
But

1082
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,519
I don't think that all of those people are

1083
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:41,919
Or anything like that or out for the anniversary of their country

1084
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,991
Parade in Warsaw

1085
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:50,879
And everybody loves the f****** parade

1086
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:55,231
Everybody who was in the previous

1087
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
How to escape

1088
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,071
The

1089
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:02,911
The character of the March itself

1090
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
Again

1091
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Not an indictment

1092
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:10,335
People there or the city of Warsaw Poland even as a whole like it's not the people's

1093
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,359
Sport there

1094
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
There's something

1095
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
Scary that's happening there

1096
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,599
Yeah like when they showed me roll of the parade was it like fun parade

1097
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,671
Flyers and stuff

1098
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,975
I remember growing up I was

1099
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:28,255
In the marching band

1100
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
For the

1101
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Town parade

1102
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:33,887
That we would always do them

1103
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Cycle March

1104
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:36,703
And I remember

1105
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:41,055
People throwing candy out there were floats

1106
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,359
It's mostly just people walking with Polish flag

1107
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,967
Yeah and some music and people singing

1108
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,783
Patriotic songs and stuff like that

1109
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,855
Becomes night

1110
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,951
We're leaving to dance

1111
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,511
Flyers

1112
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,631
Carnival is the best

1113
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:10,239
Really advanced

1114
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:15,359
Then you don't understand how joyworks phone would say a little

1115
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:19,711
But the

1116
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:26,623
It's all just people with Polish

1117
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,415
Which is

1118
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,351
Only come with your red and white flag

1119
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,447
Okay

1120
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,359
Already got our first

1121
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Is he saying

1122
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:55,039
I apologize

1123
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,367
Let's call it

1124
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
He is saying that

1125
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,743
The people who have covered the parade in the

1126
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:04,767
Have gotten

1127
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,351
Because this parade that he's at

1128
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
Currently

1129
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
Does not reflect

1130
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:11,935
The coverage from the

1131
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
The previous parade

1132
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,007
He is not admitting

1133
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,359
Does not reflect at all the previous parade

1134
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,151
The circumstances are entirely

1135
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:28,319
You can have the white nationalist horrifying parades at the

1136
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,855
Covered perfectly

1137
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,927

Exclusive

What was being talked about in the 2017

1145
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
And all that stuff

1146
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,455
It was just a bunch of collectivist coming in

1147
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,527
Scoreboard

1148
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:03,647

Contemplatively

1156
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,959
Estefan molyneux is it a graveyard

1157
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,495

Poetic

1159

I already don't want to

1161
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,615
We're not going to listen to

1162
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,175
Because it's

1163
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,735
Like it is

1164
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
Whatever thing

1165
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
You could be trying

1166
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
To bring into the conversation

1167
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,647
We know yeah that is

1168
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,951
Suck a horrible time

1169
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,743
Including the Polish

1170
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,303
Like everybody did not have a good time

1171
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,583
In World War II

1172
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,143
Rhapsodic

1173
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:49,215
About Poland in WWII

1174
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Yeah

1175
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,567
Blue Point Beer

1176
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:54,591
It really doesn't

1177
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:58,943
He loves to whenever people critique him on Twitter and stuff like that

1178
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,503
His stock response is always not an argument

1179
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
Disinfected

1180
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,647
Blowing hard in a foot

1181
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
Graveyard

1182
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,695
About why

1183
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
Dislike

1184
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,279
Is white nationalism that you

1185
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Coming to accept

1186
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
That's not an orca

1187
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
Not a crying breakdown

1188
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
His ideas

1189
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,431
Is philosophy

1190
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
He's mine

1191
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,295
Particularly about the idea of collectivism

1192
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Being bad

1193
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
Is there a benevolent Collective

1194
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Is there a good version

1195
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Collectivism

1196
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:42,719
Have

1197
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,327
I'm collectivism

1198
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,167
A death with no redeeming characteristics

1199
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:51,935
Pictures for me

1200
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,007
It was a cloud with no Silver Line

1201
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,823
It was a night without a door without a man

1202
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
And

1203
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,431
Almost like trying to

1204
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,247
Square peg into a round hole

1205
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:07,039
I have to face

1206
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,111
Pathetic beautiful collectivism of the poles

1207
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
And find figure

1208
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,951
Cigarette into my mindset of collectivism

1209
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,023
Ethan my definition of collective

1210
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
Been found wanting

1211
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,863
But I am an empiricist and

1212
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,399
I also respect emotion

1213
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,471
And if my emotions react positively

1214
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:26,751
To the

1215
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,519
Beauty

1216
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,055
And strength

1217
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,847
A Polish collectivism

1218
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,431
I can't just dismiss that I can't just say well

1219
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,015
That's just a silly throwback to Medieval tribalism

1220
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
I speak Spanish

1221
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:42,623
I bet stuff

1222
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,391
Square

1223
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
Publisher Steve

1224
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
Right

1225
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,303
Does everybody not

1226
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,351
I don't understand how is it called

1227
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:58,751
Because it's very clear that he is a pompous pretentious f*** who should shut the hell up I don't have any

1228
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:05,151
Criticism

1229
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:11,807
No that's that's very real

1230
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
You talk some more about this

1231
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
Benevolent Collective

1232
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
Have to recognize

1233
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447

1234
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Is being surrounded by

1235
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,127
That no one yelled at him when he had that show

1236
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,479
Strong leader great treasure

1237
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
Has been with house

1238
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
A great treasure

1239
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
Has been turned into a customer

1240
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
And collectivism

1241
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,183
That is beneficial

1242
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,719
Bike racer

1243
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,743
Compliant

1244
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,023
Collectivism

1245
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,631
If you drive app

1246
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,655
Benevolent

1247
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
You

1248
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:01,983
Atomized

1249
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,031
Then from there

1250
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,311
Tribe the pier

1251
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
There

1252
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
I have

1253
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:09,919
For the most part

1254
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,967
Over the course of my career

1255
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Papa

1256
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,599
Because you think

1257
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Collectivism

1258
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,999
And therefore those who have organized themselves

1259
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,279
Does lions have a great advantage

1260
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,327
Skip

1261
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
I lack

1262
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
A community I like

1263
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:30,911
Shut

1264
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,935
The fuc

1265
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,847
Being out here

1266
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
With these wonderful people

1267
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
Who are

1268
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Organizing and filming

1269
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,503
And recording

1270
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
Is it buried

1271
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,111
So that's something interesting

1272
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:52,927
To me because he has people who are organizing

1273
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:57,279
There are other people

1274
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
And I'll tell you that at the end

1275
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
He has a credit

1276
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,375
Feels like the credit

1277
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
There's nobody mention

1278
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Credit

1279
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Who could have been

1280
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
The camera people

1281
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,031
There's only one

1282
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,311
Title card

1283
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:10,591
Ending credits

1284
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,127
What is starring

1285
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:12,895
Stefan molyneux

1286
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,943
Right and the other one is

1287
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,223
To the White

1288
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:21,343
No it's all interviewed in the documentary

1289
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,391
Breitbart writer

1290
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,023
Cuz at Breitbart writer does talk about polish

1291
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,583
Fusillade

1292
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:37,215
Is the only person who doesn't

1293
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,519
Do your on camera

1294
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,871
He doesn't think the Warsaw

1295
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:49,503
Probably

1296
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,343
A handheld

1297
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:57,439
So he doesn't listen

1298
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:00,511
No credits for the people who are actually working on this week

1299
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:02,047
Strike me as very suspicious

1300
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
Employees

1301
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:08,447
UEI

1302
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:13,567
Don't walk credit well that the fingerprints will be here

1303
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
That we brought you here

1304
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,711
To do this propaganda documentary

1305
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:26,111
Alright

1306
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:29,695
And it doesn't necessarily

1307
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
It's the dude

1308
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:37,887
Tourism board is really influential with Stefan molyneux

1309
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:40,703
Took you heard there

Wonderful been

1312
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:46,335
Unofficial collectivism

1313
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:50,175
Which is great benevolent the more I want to

1314
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,503
Tribe

You have

1316
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:02,463
He's talking about

1317
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:06,303
Being in the studio is a solitary exercises

1318
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
Just me and a camera

1319
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,727
Back in the days

This videos you can find at the zoo

1321
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,591
Car with a camera on him

Singular

1329
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,655
Sting

1330
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,679
It's always been

1331
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
He's about

1332
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,239
Next clip

1333
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,335
It comes from him being an auntie so

1334
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,383
F*** on some level

1335
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
There is strength in numbers

1336
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
There's strength

1337
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
There's power

1338
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
In the trunk

1339
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:08,511
The enemy with faces

1340
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
Empower and organize

1341
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
Well Finance

1342
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,335
Maybe they tricked me into fighting alone

1343
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
So that I

1344
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,431
And everyone

1345
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:29,247
Would you please

1346
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:40,767
Even from

1347
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,559
You take any of the ideas out of

1348
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:49,983
Goddamn boat

1349
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,775
They tricked me to fighting alone

1350
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,847
F****** cry for yourself your ass

1351
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:03,039
This is so frustrating because it's like in your college philosophy

1352
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,087
Puppy class could just have started a cult

1353
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,159
If you try hard enough with an atom British accent

1354
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:15,583
If you've ever been in college in a philosophy class

1355
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,655
Bolognese f****** stupid

1356
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Pretty smart

1357
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
It's just not the right kind of until the

1358
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:43,743
Apparently positive things about awful

1359
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,071
People

1360
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,631
Able to analyze these ideas and come

1361
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Conclusion

1362
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,727
He's smart in the way that he's able to

1363
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
Package

1364
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
He's smart and he's able to present these ideas

1365
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,127
Astounding the less crazy than the X

1366
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:04,991
Cruise

1367
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
If you want to go back to that

1368
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,343
There's there's definitely an

1369
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,391
It's just dumb.

1370
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:16,255
But in the next clip you back in the graveyard

1371
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:17,535
Stalking in the graveyard

1372
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,887
Clips a little bit longer

1373
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,679
Listen to it

1374
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,031
An accidental condemnation of what

1375
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,567
He does

1376
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,335
People he's around

1377
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
Simself do

1378
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:33,663
And their effect on the world

1379
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,759
It was natural for us to hate each other why would so many

1380
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,551
Woods

1381
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,343
And fox required

1382
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,415
Why would we need

1383
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,487
From the black cheetah propaganda

1384
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,559
Why would we need to constantly

1385
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
Before

1386
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,143
Just propaganda if it was natural

1387
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,471
Come from

1388
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:03,615
They come from the language we imbibe the language

1389
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
The hatred

1390
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,175
South

1391
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
This group

1392
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,535
Are your friends

1393
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:25,375
Listen to language

1394
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,751
At this point

1395
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:34,079
A good end of the documentary

1396
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,919
I'm so sorry for my career

1397
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:46,111
I'm the one who's doing

1398
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,671
These graves are the result of propaganda

1399
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,695
Yep yep

1400
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,767
Step further

1401
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:58,143
Instead of just strength

1402
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:01,983
Results are we the Baddies

1403
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
I do not believe

1404
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,159
I believe that we can live in much greater

1405
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,999
That would be

1406
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
We collected much credit

1407
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,119
But to live in Greater peace

1408
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,911
We must be very very careful

1409
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,703
About the language

1410
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Describe

1411
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,263
Our group other group

1412
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,687
Common humanity and we must be taught

1413
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,135
Disgrace

1414
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:51,903
From language

1415
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:53,951
Beef grades

1416
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,255
Come from the seeds of hatred that is owed

1417
01:18:58,815 --> 01:18:59,327
Sophistry

1418
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:01,887
Alright

1419
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,191
The syllables of sophistry

1420
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,031
Analysis is kind of like

1421
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:14,431
Finger himself

1422
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
People like Alex

1423
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,271
He's doing it with

1424
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Vegan version

1425
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Do you like

1426
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,623
No no no we're the ones who were right

1427
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:28,767
Hugo Boss to insist on multiculturalism is the sowing the seeds of sophistry

1428
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,327
Disgrace

1429
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:39,263
Is that we used to talk about ourselves disagree with

1430
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:46,175
Like if the Martin Luther King jr. speech was given by Strom Thurmond

1431
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
You be like

1432
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,391
So what you're really saying underneath all of this

1433
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
Beautiful language

1434
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,095
As long as the

1435
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,655
So

1436
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,824
Because we've been calling Stefan molyneux a white nationalist

1437
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,104
And maybe that's on

1438
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Fair

1439
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:22,528
It's not unfair because

1440
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,368
We are free to call him

1441
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,160
First of all

1442
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,464
I've always been skeptical of the ideas

1443
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,536
A white nationalism identitarianism

1444
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,816
And white identity

1445
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
However

1446
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,400
I am interested

1447
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,448
And I couldn't help but notice

1448
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,984
That I can have

1449
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
Peaceful

1450
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,824
Free easy supplies and safe

1451
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
Discussion

1452
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,640
In what is essentially

1453
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
Call White

1454
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,688
Country

1455
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:02,464
You just told real hard

1456
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,584
No one yelled at me so white supremacy is f****** awesome

1457
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:11,424
Call me names

1458
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,448
Is that

1459
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,264
White nationalism is good

1460
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,800
Because

1461
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
Nationalism is good

1462
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:23,968
And we need to separate ourselves from

1463
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,552
It should be for whites

1464
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
Should be for blacks

1465
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,256
And never the twain shall meet

1466
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:37,024
Now

1467
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
Hey historically

1468
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:41,376
Maybe when they're are all white Nation

1469
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
Could be

1470
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,776
Could have something to do with why we don't do that anymore

1471
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,104
As long as it's always for good

1472
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:58,528
I think it's pretty much

1473
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,344
I've been resisting

1474
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:04,416
The ideas of white nationalism

1475
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:07,232
But but but

1476
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,512
I'm an empiricist

1477
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,448
And that mean

1478
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:21,056
Did the free exchange of ideas as possible as long as everyone is what what a f***

1479
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:25,408
Level of

1480
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,688
Terrible things

1481
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:31,040
When you have a conclusion you want to get to

1482
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,344
Working your way towards it

1483
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,160
Because anybody who was an empiricist

1484
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:37,952
Would consider alternative

1485
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
Like I don't know

1486
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,280
What if I was in Poland

1487
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
For 2 days

1488
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,424
Parade

1489
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:53,824
And a bar that's run by a group

1490
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,920
What if I'm only seeing what they want

1491
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:02,016
What what if I'm not getting the full picture of what it's like to

1492
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,576
What is IMO means

1493
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,856
The

1494
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,672
The the Warsaw

1495
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:09,952
Diversion

1496
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,488
Of what

1497
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,376
They wouldn't accept

1498
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,656
Does blindly in be like

1499
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
Nationalism

1500
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:21,728
Wheat

1501
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,848
You're trying to justify that

1502
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:31,968
There been so many examples of that where it's been.

1503
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:34,528
Well-known writer and

1504
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:39,648
China or wherever

1505
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:45,280
Will bring them in and I'll have a tour guide

1506
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:48,096
Castrating their entire thing so when they write the

1507
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:50,656
Holy s*** it's overwhelmingly positive

1508
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,384
Because they just showed him the version of Nazism

1509
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,480
Broadcast

1510
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:07,296
That word is satirical and comedic in nature

1511
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,344
That minimize the idea of the Nazi

1512
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,904
He's being evil

1513
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Talk about how like

1514
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:13,952
I did

1515
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:19,072
Know what was going on

1516
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:22,400
Nazi collaborator

1517
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
Said it was because of the

1518
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,872
I don't think it's as extreme

1519
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
Example

1520
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:41,344
Yes absolutely

1521
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,112
Situation

1522
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,648
Political

1523
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
And culturally

1524
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,184
Going on

1525
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:47,488
And he is

1526
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:51,072
This one specific time

1527
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,544
Coming up

1528
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:01,824
Look at its campus

1529
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
Coincidence

1530
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
And the fact that you do

1531
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,664
Bring it up at all

1532
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:10,016
Like this is an interesting organization or anything like that

1533
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
Now I think I think

1534
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,416
How many.

1535
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:28,448
Discard his

1536
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,752
Ridiculous posturing

1537
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,032
You cannot be in a

1538
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,312
If you do not also true

1539
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
We all

1540
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:43,040
At the end of this right now

1541
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,088
I think we all understand

1542
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,160
This conclusion

1543
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
Any

1544
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:49,952
Conclusion

1545
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,488
White nationalism is fuckingawesome

1546
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,328
These people that are extreme

1547
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
As evidenced by

1548
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,776
But that still leaves

1549
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Question

1550
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
News

1551
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
Cry

1552
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
That's weird

1553
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,200
Why did Stefan molyneux cry at

1554
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:11,968
That March

1555
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:16,064
Because that's f***** up I don't know

1556
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,392
Yeah but he's not like out

1557
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:22,208
It is emotionally resonant

1558
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,000
But he's not like Alex

1559
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
He's not unhinged

1560
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,584
Yeah Alex fix crying

1561
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,376
Or even Doves Cry

1562
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:30,144
Sometimes

1563
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,080
That is not part of his present

1564
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,872
That seems very strange

1565
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
Yeah exactly

1566
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,176
Describe what happened

1567
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,480
In this next clip

1568
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,016
Supposed

1569
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:48,064
Or not guilty

1570
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
And guilt

1571
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,904
Has been so infused

1572
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,440
Into

1573
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,280
The hearts and minds of Europeans

1574
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,400
A resilient strong

1575
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,936
Culture that is resistant

1576
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
Collectivism

1577
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,032
It's something that moved me more than

1578
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,568
I can probably ever

1579
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,616
But I hope is encapsulated

1580
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
In the footage

1581
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
That you're seeing

1582
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:14,944
In this documentary

1583
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
It is

1584
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,528
Is encapsulated

1585
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,344
Yeah I mean you're totally right

1586
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:40,800
Because that's what he cares

1587
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
So f******

1588
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
Is the worst

1589
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,808
Mostly because everybody

1590
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
White guilt

1591
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:56,160
Is just a horribly profitable Vending

1592
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,952
The people pound

1593
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
In order to get resource

1594
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
From

1595
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,304
Lucky white male tax

1596
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,400
I did something that should be enormously resist

1597
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,472
Unless you down as to why it should be resisted

1598
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,752
Look at toilet

1599
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:14,848
Look at the glory the celebration Topeka

1600
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,128
Everywhere

1601
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:22,528
I did not see one drunk person I did not see one fist fight I did not see one crazy

1602
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:25,088
Protester out there threatening violence

1603
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,624
Because their ideas

1604
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,648
That they don't agree with

1605
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
What's not to love

1606
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,256
About something like

1607
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
For Jordan

1608
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:41,984
Evriholder

1609
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,568
Indictment of his capabilities in that Realm

1610
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:51,712
He's a wonderful Utopia

1611
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,296
You describing these things he's seen as being a result of

1612
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,136
It's very clear

1613
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:05,536
That's the premise

1614
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,352
Those things only exist because of non-white

1615
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,376
Yammy

1616
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,984
Concrete versions of Azusa

1617
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:16,800
Whatever

1618
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:23,200
Michael

1619
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,040
Ascribing cause

1620
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
People around

1621
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:36,256
Streets to be cleaner in no fight

1622
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:40,864
Clean streets and no fight there's no history that would suggest otherwise.

1623
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,032
Where he tells on himself

1624
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
Is the

1625
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,664
That's where he tells on himself a little bit

1626
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,224
Define

1627
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:56,992
Concrete terms

1628
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,296
Right

1629
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:02,624
As opposed to in empirical

1630
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,904
Analysis

1631
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,696
The streets are clean there weren't

1632
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,000
Those are them

1633
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,024
There is one

1634
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
Whatever

1635
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,424
The people are civilized

1636
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,824
Dog whistle in the same way it be like every black person I saw

1637
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,384
You know what you said

1638
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,688
Right you know well what you f******

1639
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:31,296
So even if he is right there

1640
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
She's not right about

1641
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,624
Do you have improved the causal connection but

1642
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,904
Between the things you see in

1643
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,440
And the fact that everyone there is

1644
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,976
30 sloppy

1645
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,536
Junior varsity level

1646
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,560
Philosophy

1647
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,840
If I've ever seen

1648
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,192
That is not an argument

1649
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,264
I suppose the only way

1650
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,616
And I don't know why I'm somehow on the side of giving him the benefit of

1651
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,664
As if

1652
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,480
What he meant was he

1653
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Homogeneous

1654
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:04,064
Like that's the only way that you could

1655
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,928
Has more of an argument to stand on because

1656
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,280
Because his argument because all of the people are like

1657
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Each other

1658
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:15,584
In the same way

1659
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,632
Right

1660
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,168
Let's call it white.

1661
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,032
Then if there was a

1662
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:26,080
Let's call it miseducation

1663
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:32,480
Rate and we know how well it is when

1664
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,272
Spawn does all the time

1665
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,552
They hide their bigotry

1666
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,600
Electrolyzer

1667
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,392
That's everything

1668
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,160
He does

1669
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,656
And the Philosopher's going to a hypothetical

1670
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,192
All black country

1671
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,752
Experience

1672
01:31:55,008 --> 01:32:00,640
You just wonderful

1673
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:07,040
I think the same way

1674
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,624
Is defending

1675
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,648
White nationalism

1676
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
Identitarian

1677
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,792
Absolutely

1678
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:23,168
Metaphor

1679
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
Degree in history

1680
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:32,128
Metaphors are really something

1681
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:35,968
Veteran is this one's all right though it's about keeping the fire

1682
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:41,856
You got you got to go get one by the fire

1683
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,904
Existential crisis what are you going to do

1684
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
Oh I don't know

1685
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,720
The salamis

1686
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,744
Holiness

1687
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,072
Western European culture compared to

1688
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,096
The seriousness of death

1689
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
The Polish culture

1690
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
Darkness

1691
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,216
And something I will take

1692
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,264
Take me to Mike hold on WhatsApp

1693
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,312
Freedom

1694
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,336
You say

1695
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,456
To have a fire

1696
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,248
You need to go and gather the firewood

1697
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,528
You need to light the fire

1698
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
And then my friends

1699
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,856
You know what you need to do

1700
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,904
Did he attend

1701
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:25,632
Into the Woods

1702
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:28,960
If I were to keep that fire alive and pass it down

1703
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
To your children as your father's

1704
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,288
Passed down to you

1705
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,640
Is keeping that fire a lot

1706
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
The Westin

1707
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
The rest of Western Europe

1708
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,552
Different about him

1709
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,832
When the fire

1710
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,440
History of your civilization

1711
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:52,000
But it begins to diminish when it begins to die

1712
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,304
There is a great temptation

1713
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:58,144
Too close to that fire

1714
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:02,752
And to stay close and too warm yourself in the dying Embers and fading calls event

1715
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,288
Rather than go out

1716
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,824
Into the woods to gather more

1717
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Wood

1718
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,896
Repeat that fire and bring it to life

1719
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,784
It is so easy to take that 5

1720
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:21,440
Imagine that the fire is not something you need to protect and see but it's like the sun in front of its own accord gives you what you work

1721
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,280
It's false

1722
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,816
Headed to destruct

1723
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:29,376
Fantasy to imagine that the fire will last

1724
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,448
As long as you and your ancestors

1725
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:36,544
Have wanted it and as long as you and your descendants draw breath

1726
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,664
It's cleared the specifics that he's talking about but it is clear

1727
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,432
Fitbit

1728
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
Close

1729
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,480
He's so emotional

1730
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,088
Experiencing like he said it himself

1731
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:52,672
I'm suspicious of white nationalism

1732
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,208
But I'm an empiricist

1733
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:56,768
And what I've seen

1734
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,048
I had pretty cool

1735
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:01,120
So if his conclusion comes to

1736
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,936
The fire of freedom is really delicate

1737
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:07,776
Woods are

1738
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,592
Whatever the firewood

1739
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,128
Whatever the fire itself

1740
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,432
All of it is about

1741
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
Preserve

1742
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
In the best

1743
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,784
Rephrase that

1744
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,320
Your culture

1745
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,600
White

1746
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:26,208
Culture does not exist black

1747
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,768
Yeah

1748
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
Popular

1749
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,864
And he totally is

1750
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,144
80s

1751
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
He has

1752
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,264
Is

1753
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:42,592
Turd polish version of

1754
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,920
Every every

1755
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,200
Presented so far

1756
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,760
Variation

1757
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,528
Of the

1758
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
Whites are great

1759
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,880
A different

1760
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,648
Flowery length

1761
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,464
Urinating thing for him

1762
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
Duke

1763
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,512
Because if you know what

1764
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,536
Talking about

1765
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:04,096
No matter how much flowery language

1766
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,400
You're still trying to say the n word

1767
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:13,056
You know like that's what you're really trying to do

1768
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:15,616
Is it long and passionate speech about the Polish

1769
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,664
Struggle in World War II

1770
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,528
Fine

1771
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Lotta folks

1772
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:29,184
In acknowledgment of what

1773
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:34,816
Vanos

1774
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:40,192
Duda doesn't come up by name at all the documentary

1775
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:43,008
Injustice party comes up

1776
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,336
Kristoff

1777
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,896
Someone Envy National

1778
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,664
Party

1779
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:50,944
The fact that

1780
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:52,992
UEI is so

1781
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,272
Deeply involved in

1782
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,344
Assertive

1783
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
Justifying

1784
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,952
The acts of the democratic Act

1785
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,488
Of the government

1786
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:04,256
AR

1787
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,840
You know behind at least one of the interviews

1788
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,632
He's doing and the bar

1789
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,936
I just can't walk away

1790
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,216
The documentary without

1791
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,752
Looking at it

1792
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,032
This is

1793
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,056
Basis of

1794
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,336
This is something that was playing

1795
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:19,872
To Anixter

1796
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:21,664
Yeah there's no way that

1797
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,480
Would exist

1798
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,504
It's so consistent

1799
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,296
And the people who would be

1800
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,600
Publishing articles

1801
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
Politico

1802
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
Justify

1803
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,184
March

1804
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,232
That became such a

1805
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,256
Embarrassment

1806
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,024
4

1807
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
These National

1808
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,584
Yeah

1809
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,864
Overplaying your hand

1810
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,400
Yeah

1811
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,680
Did the all of that one

1812
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,216
Back to a single

1813
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
Like I don't

1814
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,824
The documentaries only an hour long

1815
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
Like not like

1816
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
It sounds like he talks to a wide array of people

1817
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:55,968
Yeah

1818
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,576
There's there's the interviews

1819
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
Firefighter

1820
01:38:01,856 --> 01:38:04,928
There's the interviews there's him standing in the woods in the snow talk

1821
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,976
Thursby parade self

1822
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:10,048
Emotions on a train

1823
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,608
And then there is

1824
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,192
Tiger documentary

1825
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,472
1 interview

1826
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,240
With somebody

1827
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:25,408
Marshmallow shooter

1828
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,944
I'm the receiving

1829
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,712
So much

1830
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:29,248
Bigotry

1831
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,352
There's a unified front

1832
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,656
Seems less like a

1833
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:49,216
Documentary and more like a propagate

1834
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:54,336
You bet how to find MZ

1835
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,248
Liberty is not constant is not a force of nature it is not a force of gravity it is not

1836
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:06,624
The element of physics it is something that must be protected and maintained and kept

1837
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,928
Every single generation

1838
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,696
Poland

1839
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:13,280
Remembrance what the rest of the West had forgotten

1840
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:15,328
Which is that your freedom

1841
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,400
Which type generation to Bill

1842
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:23,008
The fires of Liberty that keep your civilization warm

1843
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:36,832
Remember that

1844
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
Difference

1845
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,696
Between Poland and

1846
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,280
Stephane has demonstrated

1847
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:46,816
Is it everyone is why

1848
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,096
Yeah it seems

1849
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
Empiricist

1850
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,216
Population

1851
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
Napoleon is 100

1852
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,080
I think it's the version of Holland

1853
01:39:58,336 --> 01:40:00,128
Yeah

1854
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:02,688
Fundamental

1855
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
Different from any other place

1856
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,272
He was kept oyster.

1857
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,040
In

1858
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,064
White pepper

1859
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,368
Protest white nationalist

1860
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,672
And that is enough

1861
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,696
For him

1862
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
To say like

1863
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:16,768
They are keeping the fire alive

1864
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,792
These are the

1865
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
It's insane

1866
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:25,216
All the more so because

1867
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:29,056
Man if I were the worst surprises

1868
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,688
Scour the entire f****** country

1869
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,504
To find any non-white person

1870
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,600
Object

1871
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:54,656
No matter the price

1872
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,240
Sister whatever it is

1873
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,336
What it doesn't

1874
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:10,016
Couldn't even get one person to stand

1875
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,040
In the background

1876
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,000
Non-white

1877
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,792
People that I could find

1878
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:27,680
I'll say that there is a possibility way in the background

1879
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:28,448
Anybody

1880
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:29,728
That wasn't

1881
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,312
Indifference

1882
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,592
That is what change

1883
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:35,872
Stefan molyneux

1884
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,920
From being

1885
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:42,016
You being like

1886
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:50,976
Oh okay

1887
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,512
Freedom could disappear

1888
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,560
Herrera

1889
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,888
You could tell from the sound effect

1890
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:00,192
He could use an Editor to Pare down his

1891
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:04,544
Federal Credit

1892
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:11,456
Stephon a documentary after the entire Corpus of the work is done

1893
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,992
But coming back on camera

1894
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,528
And pleading with his audience

1895
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,552
To give him more money

1896
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,088
We can do more of his

1897
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,672
That was just an act

1898
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,000
He's realized that he doesn't want to stay in his Studio

1899
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,328
There's a big world out there for him

1900
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:28,608
But he needs them

1901
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,376
To pay for it

1902
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,656
Do you mean to call

1903
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,448
To provide him the money

1904
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,472
To be able to do

1905
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:36,288
Incidentally in August of 2018

1906
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:39,104
Stefan molyneux made another trip outside of his Studio

1907
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,920
Hemet Lawrence trip to New Zealand

1908
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,456
Speaking to

1909
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,600
First attack

1910
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,744
Is all entirely rooted in the ideas

1911
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,072
The people like Stefan molyneux his maid career off of spreading

1912
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,376
His mentality isn't new

1913
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
But it's something

1914
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,424
Made so much

1915
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,264
Who is validated white terrorism

1916
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
Excuses for Timothy

1917
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,384
All the way down

1918
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,688
The present day where we seen Alex Jones

1919
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,736
Excuses for this terrorist Act

1920
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,272
You making

The good idea

1922
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,648
Hey

1923
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,768
We talked about all the time

1924
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,048
It's always important

1925
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,072
Recognized

1926
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:33,120
Ecosystem

1927
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,448
Stefan molyneux comes on

1928
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:38,496
The show comes on that much

1929
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,288
But he has been

1930
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,568
Fairly regular

1931
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,848
For a while

1932
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,152
In the same

1933
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,944
Anti other

1934
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,504
Yeah

1935
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,552
The bigger picture of it

1936
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,600
Anti

1937
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,904
People ride

1938
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,488
Possible

1939
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
Not to be this

1940
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
For himself

1941
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,912
The world and declares himself

1942
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,704
National

1943
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,240
We've known

1944
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
Spawn

1945
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,032
We know

1946
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:14,080
We've known for a while

1947
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,872
And we've been criticizing you

1948
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
For it

1949
01:44:17,664 --> 01:44:19,456
People have been criticizing him and say

1950
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,504
Hades

1951
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,344
You're a piece of s***

1952
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:29,440
That's why he gets yelled at speaking engagement

1953
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:35,840
In this Enclave that's very safe space

1954
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
He's like oh my God

1955
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,144
It's all white people

1956
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,680
Fuckingawesome

1957
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,216
Isn't this the best thing ever

1958
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:42,752
He comes out

1959
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:44,032
And he recognizes

1960
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,104
And that means two things

1961
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:48,896
No s*** you are

1962
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:53,248
F*** you

1963
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,528
How dare you

1964
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,576
How dare you

1965
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,648
That people yell

1966
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:05,536
When all the documentary

1967
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
And say

1968
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:11,168
I always was suspicious of white nationalism but I'm in a system

1969
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,704
Pretty good stuff

1970
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,240
How dare you

1971
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:16,032
How dare you pretend

1972
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:18,336
The people criticizing you didn't have a point

1973
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:21,152
You were before you were ready to admit it

1974
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:24,736
Not the best Wacky Wednesday

1975
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,928
I mean we got plugs but I'm really trying to like

1976
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:35,744
In my head

1977
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,768
Episode

1978
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Struggling

1979
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:45,984
Kill anybody

1980
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,008
Teacher

1981
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,800
Complaining about how all the

1982
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,592
The parade 2017

1983
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,360
He was a bunch of

1984
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,384
The football hooligan

1985
01:45:56,992 --> 01:46:00,576

1990
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,176

Alex
