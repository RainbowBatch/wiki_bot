1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,032
We're couple of dudes who likes

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,568
To sit around and drink

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,592
Red wine

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,920
Specifically red wine

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,712
Picture because Alex Jones

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
The character of a man who cares about anybody else

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
Weirdo

9
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,976
As we always do an event

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,768
Enter through Alex Jones Infowars

11
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,328
I'm a guy who listens to a ton of Infowars

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
It Alex Jones in particular

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,912
Listen to any

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
That's why I mean

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,776
I've got to find all the eclipse

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
And then we can

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
We are both a little bit unhealthy at the moment

18
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,344
Buckeye said I haven't been sick in like a year

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
And now I have a pretty bad sore throat

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,536
My life

21
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
If there was ever proved for the globalist

22
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:15,776
I think we might have been poisoned polonium

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:22,176
Also I'm not sure but I believe since we recorded last Rogers

24
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:22,944
Claiming that he was

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,480
T-boned in hit-and-run

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:30,880
Second attempt on his life

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,672
Okay

28
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Sketchy details

29
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
About

30
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,024
This hit-and-run situation

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
The other car

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,680
Whether or not it exists there is one there is also an issue of

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
The police report being filed like

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
An hour and a half

35
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Disturbia

36
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,800
I was supposed to have taken place

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
Usually

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,664
I don't know I don't know

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
You know is that I don't believe Rodger

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,552
I'm not sure I believe him on this

41
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Anyway

42
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,368
Really

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
Made of Polonia

44
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
See now this is an interest

45
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
Is where we go

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:10,304
That way we get just kill two birds

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
1 Stones everything's

48
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,424
Alright alright

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
We had a good run

50
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,824
After that pun it's time for us to go to an out-of-context drop license

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Drunken Soldier

52
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Pumpkin world

53
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,832
I am anti shrunken

54
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
I am smart them

55
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
Led Zeppelin haven't talked about

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
Might as well it's a woodland creature.

57
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
That was it

58
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192
Just give some contacts that he was

59
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240
Lena Jolie

60
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,264
Does he cares about

61
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,128
Is in the middle of a long rant about how I

62
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
Your daddy

63
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
What you probably really a shame to you

64
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
We got to bring in your dad

65
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,464
It's not like the most

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,488
Insulting

67
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,328
Or inappropriate thing in the world

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
Especially in the movie Anaconda

69
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,592
The president

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
We have

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
We got a website going

72
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,600
It's at knowledge.com I know We've joked about this in the past

73
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,880
But it's real now

74
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
You can go there I have a doctor

75
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Document ated

76
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,048
I've documented

77
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Alex Jones

78
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,840
Past lives

79
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
The archive will build

80
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,400
Grow from there

81
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Starting

82
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,544
Living biography of Alex find pieces of his life

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
Which is going to be the best

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Little Snippets of Alex Jones telling his life story

85
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,600
Episodes

86
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Trinket discussions going with

87
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,672
I want to try and build in a discussion

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,440
Chambord

89
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,976
I've some point but that's

90
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't have the time

91
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
Go in

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
Comments on episode

93
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
We could argue about stuff I'd love it

94
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
Betty White

95
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Could be episode

96
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,447
Today

97
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
For mostly dealing with Friday March 7th

98
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
Okay

99
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
F***** up stuff that happens on that show

100
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Of course

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
But first I wanted to play

102
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,175
Uclips

103
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
From the 6

104
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
From March

105
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,271
60 + Thursday

106
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
Because you said a couple of things

107
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,111
They were really stupid

108
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
There was one

109
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,511
Then there's a call in the

110
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
Is it needs to be discussed

111
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,119
I meant he says something that proves why word

112
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
So that's why I

113
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
He says we don't have enough to do during

114
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,847
Is what he says

115
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,991
Exactly.

116
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:18,719
I got a few more clips of President I want to go to it and it's only right epic species, Road

117
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,143
No they're not want to dress up for a second

118
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,703
Yeah I pulled up I pulled up a collection

119
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Current polls

120
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,079
On Sunday

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,615
And most current numbers

122
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Show a if you if you average

123
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
12 of the most

124
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:40,991
Recent polls

125
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
His net approval is -2

126
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,063
6.6

127
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,159
The Gallup poll has his net approval at -21

128
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,487
37% approval rating 58 disapproval

129
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,767
The highest

130
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,559
That we have in the last

131
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,167
Women all these polls are basically up from March till

132
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
Beginning of March still current

133
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,775
The highest is a Rasmussen report

134
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
From the 14

135
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,103
Study was done

136
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,663
S48

137
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,943
Approval rating is

138
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
That's unconscious

139
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,295
That is -4

140
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
48

141
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Percent of this

142
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
That's wild

143
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,975
What are you do not have

144
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,375
If you are a few are a Hermit living behind a giant

145
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,959
Rock that closes up York Avenue only get out

146
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Once every four years

147
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,263
To vote for the

148
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,335
Your approval rating of him is going to be

149
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
If you're alive

150
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,223
Let's call it a human being

151
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
With consciousness

152
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,599
There's no way you can read any day of the news

153
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
And be like

154
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,487
Oh you doing a great job you can if you don't believe the news

155
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
He's doing even if you support this whole Muslim ban in like there's no way you can look at that

156
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
And be like he's doing a good job

157
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,311
This bad thing he wants to do he's doing a bad job of setting up

158
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,151
To do you have to admit he's terrible at

159
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
I totally agree

160
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
Even worse the only people from the month

161
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
March that has him with net favored abilities

162
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,135
Is the USA Today poll

163
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,279
Come on now on every front page

164
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
2 + 3

165
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
Favorability

166
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
But still

167
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,375
Only 47% of

168
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
God so

169
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:35,935
Again

170
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,775
Crazy

171
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,591
He's only been president for two months

172
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:48,991
Doesn't this feel like he's been president for our entire lives because everything changed

173
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,575
How long is this guy going to be

174
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,647
Much longer now but anyway

175
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:01,279
What numbers are going up up up

176
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,559
Uncontrollable

177
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
55 56

178
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
Perfect

179
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Devastated

180
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:23,039
There's no way there's no way to really know what possible way you can real numbers are 74

181
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah

182
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,855
Unbelievably untrue

183
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,647
Just based on

184
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
There's no way that's

185
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,511
I don't think there's ever been a president

186
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
Once in American history

187
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Well if you don't going to win 97%

188
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Boy anyway

189
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,503
Our sources didn't

190
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,063
Sources in Bloomsburg

191
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
Numbers

192
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
Weirder

193
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,039
Fair enough

194
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
That's the real upper-class billionaires have secret numbers

195
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,999
Secret numbers that we don't know but I kind of agree with him there

196
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
The Billionaire's have secret everything that we do

197
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Casually drop in like

198
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,239
You know I know a lot of billionaires no big deal I know people who have access to the billionaire

199
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,895
Sources apparently couldn't

200
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
Sure

201
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:01,855
He's got people close to billionaires interns at Google the baby that he knows that call him on his telephone

202
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,391
He hasn't turned it billionaire

203
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,767
So he would get to the next clip I'm going to cut one where he misrepresents what happened when the party

204
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
We flipped in the sea

205
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,911
How could you not

206
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,751
It's pointless to go over but here

207
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,519
The phone call

208
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
From from a rapper

209
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Is it Riff Raff

210
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
It's not riffraff

211
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,455
Should be Riff Raff so right not anyone famous

212
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,991
But

213
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Alex

214
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
Response to this

215
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Is amazing

216
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
Play for Maryland

217
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,119
MTV Snoop Dogg thing

218
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
33 now

219
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,983
5015

220
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
Awesome

221
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,815
You name it

222
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
You name it

223
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,679
He says you named it when he's like I can't come up with a lie

224
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:30,175
Literally the only rapper who I think would talk to Alex and get along with him is Vinny pazienza

225
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
AKA Ikon the verbal hologram is the the rapper in Jedi Mind Tricks

226
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,111
I feel like you're not

227
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,719
He's pretty talented but he also is a

228
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:44,767
Little bit of a conspiracy

229
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
There is also

230
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:50,143
Is that people a lot which is

231
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,239
He and Kanye West

232
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:59,615
Station right below that

233
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,967
Interesting conversation

234
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Crustacean at the other purse

235
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,415
I mean like if you go through the history Alex Jones

236
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
5 degrees hated and loved Kanye

237
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Depending on what

238
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Most recently said about Trump

239
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,631
We all love them

240
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
He's a genius and his Mercurial and he's at 100%

241
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,359
This this call is great

242
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,151
Cuz it made me started off already and we

243
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Still complaining about Snoop Dogg

244
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Which

245
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
I'm not here to defend Snoop Dogg I don't care you're fighting a ghost

246
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
If

247
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Actually

248
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
Do you think he would fight

249
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Somebody

250
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
Alex

251
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
This is like

252
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,823
I think that one's about babe

253
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,687
You still there

254
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,807
The website we're going through every Tupac lyric

255
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
And see if we can

256
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
Vaguely apply something to l.a.

257
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,671
Alex Jones

258
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,999
Song For Mama those probably about

259
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,559

00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,863
Gatto's on the Makaveli album

261
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
Great empowering

262
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Now

263
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,407
I want to see a couple things

264
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:15,807
We've already drop we've already drop that we got a new a new track, hopefully the dog

265
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Not going anywhere

266
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
Mel Alex

267
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
Is about to announce something he wants to

268
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
To do

269
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,487
Which would be

270
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
Crazy please

271
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Please tell me

272
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399

275
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
Call

276
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,415
I want a whole hour long show everyday

277
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,791

278
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
The best

279
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Hip hop hardcore stuff out there

280
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:41,823
But then deal with it

281
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,663
I need a few crew members on the funding to shut it off

282
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
Flower show everyday

283
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,295

00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
Replay everything

285
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
I just

286
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
I don't believe

287
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:08,703
Play Willie Nelson

288
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,263
Alex Jones

289
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,823
To play Willie Nelson's new track

290
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Do this show.

291
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
That would be amazing

292
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Also

293
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,551
It's in the hell you get anywhere near the legal rights to play any music on Infowars

294
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:29,183
What legal rights do need to play this guy's music was just some weirdo calling you

295
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,463
About

296
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,231

298
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,303
Country songs Bass

299
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:40,703
Amarillo by Morning

300
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
Going to make people have grudgingly allowed into

301
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:51,199
It's not going to make us money except for all these super male Vitality ads were going to

302
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Has anybody got a funny operation

303
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,975
Leanne Wackadoo doesn't have time to do this

304
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
She's busy

305
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
Doing something

306
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Tearing

307
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
And so

308
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,103
But believe me sir absolutely

309
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Take her from you

310
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
40000

311
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Alex is claiming that you did that

312
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
He didn't

313
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:37,535
She's claiming that he has some responsibility for Joey Joy Villas

314
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,095
Success

315
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
He didn't

316
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
She came out

317
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,983
The Grammys in that make America great dress

318
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,199
After the fact our tether as a guest on the show now he's trying to rewrite history that we feature her

319
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
And tons of record sales

320
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
And because of it we can watch careers

321
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
Meanwhile it's a couple weeks later I haven't heard

322
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:10,047
Yeah what is this

323
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
Start I don't know

324
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:13,887
Genre of music

325
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
How dare you

326
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
We're in this together

327
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,879
Uptogether

328
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
Where was that going

329
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,631
He said it doesn't matter what color we are we sink or swim together

330
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,727
Doesn't matter if we had problems we don't need to talk about this point

331
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,751
Alex Jones

332
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Very much

333
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Fix the sky is black

334
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
I looked him up

335
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,943
Kane glaze isn't black

336
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,527
Every rappers

337
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,367
That's why he's giving a message of racial Unity

338
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:11,999
Do everyone but

339
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
People who aren't

340
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Explain my research

341
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,983
Enemies of Freedom worldwide or against Trump because he's real

342
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
Hypnotic

343
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,895
Mississippi Market

344
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,759
Fighting whatever you know we got to rebuild this phone to the thin crust bonus

345
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
Garbage out here on TV in the media and

346
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:42,975
This release is my first one even though they're rather size 15

347
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,535
Carvana linoleum stamp

348
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Amanda

349
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Blue envelope and put my album in there

350
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,959
Massanutten was handing it out just handing them out handing them out

351
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:59,103
Not charging nothing to try to get them

352
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,943
My YouTube name is Daffy Duck

353
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,759
Let me say that that

354
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,391
That's not otherwise known as Daffy Duck

355
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:15,487
That's not a good YouTube name it's very hard

356
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
It's a bad YouTuber

357
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:26,751
He wasn't first popular

358
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,639
The day I managed to find him though any guy with a big bushy beard without chopped

359
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,967
Without the Sideburn he looks really ridiculous

360
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,807
And on his YouTube Channel videos of himself rapping

361
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,599
In what appears to be like

362
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
A service truck that he drives

363
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,415
A living

364
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,999
And they're about 30 45 seconds

365
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:53,887
16 days after this episode

366
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
Nothing nothing

367
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
100 hits

368
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Did you

369
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:13,087
Look it's hard to tell from like a 30-second clip offensively bad but it wasn't

370
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
So I don't know well

371
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
You know it

372
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
It's disappointing anytime

373
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:21,792
We can't add K Blaze to the list of the greatest rappers

374
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:25,376
About time

375
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:29,472
Pokemon that show to heaven

376
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,776
Believe it cable is not getting a return phone call

377
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:32,800
Let me tell you this

378
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,848
What are you going to tell me a blaze is a patriot

379
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152

I really didn't my pep talk

419
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
And this I believe

420
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
Whenever anyone asked

421
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,032
Do you want to do this show why is knowledge fight something that they

422
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:12,800
Important

This clip

428
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
Really spells out why I think it's important

429
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
We do this

430
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
And push back a little bit on the b*******

431
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:42,240
I told Paul 56 years ago you're going to do weekly videos you're going to come on you're going to Tweet or I'm going to cut your

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,688
Stick with me history I don't think is real but

445
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,040

Eye Center

450
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:43,424
You always have the videos in front of a giant

451
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
Heol Paul Joseph Watson

452
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,032
Does all of his videos

453
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
In front of a judge

454
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360

But anyway here's where it gets where at

459
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,488
Really sums up my

460
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,048
My feeling on what the future holds if we're not

461
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Ketchup

462
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,776

00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Keep in mind that

468
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Wait

469
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464

471
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,280
I like

472
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
Staffing discussion with himself on air right now

473
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,592
He's already so Mark is watching

474
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
This is Alex

475
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:03,552
Physically describes in his human resources report on Marco Polo review on air

476
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,696
Pause

477
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
You must come to the Mothership

478
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,328

479
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,216

481
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Time

482
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,528
You know what I mean I need someone with a real grasp of slander really knows the fine lines of libel

483
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
I like somebody who knows it

484
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,880
Exactly where the line is and then

485
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Crossett

486
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,720
Without the government finally catching you I hope

487
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
People

488
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,864

489
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400

491
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:56,800
What he shouldn't be saying stuff like that on Harry climb the mountain

492
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
It makes

493
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
Parrot that like

494
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
His business

495
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:07,040
Just barely not getting sued

496
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
Imitation of the things you said

497
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,392
He wouldn't have to worry about getting sued

498
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
If it's the truth and he can prove it

499
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
That's not live or slander

500
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,536
I mean after the whole thing

501
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
Who knows

502
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Whether or not

503
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,936
You can publish if someone s*******

504
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216

It's anybody's being there though if we really break it down is that

519
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:24,352
We need more media Empire filled with Liars

This is the future if we

So when he says another Mothership do you think he's trying to

526
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,112
To turn the himself into a 24-hour

527
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:46,880

00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,728
I just broadcasting live like on the internet from 5 a.m. to 8 p.m.

531
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:04,800
The too much news is breaking week There's we can't cover all this

532
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,104
BYU got 4 hours a day and you don't cover any

533
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,528
He just wants a jiggly infomercial to try and sell more exactly

534
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
He wants more time

535
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880

536
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
Sell these pills

537
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,280
It's not it's not like it's

538
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
I mean I don't know what would your overhead cut why why am I think

539
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,680
Thinking about his business strategy

540
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,776
It would only raise your over

541
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Head cost

542
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:40,128
They probably 40%

543
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:43,968
I think that's a very smart business decision I think he races overhead a lot more than

544
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:50,112
Manpower's please Alex start broadcasting

Stranded on a desert island

569
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,976
Covid-19 Chicago Animal Shelter

570
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
I was like how do you

571
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,608
Fix a radiator with Chester's this is really carefully

572
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
The could be

573
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,192
Redux Channel

574
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:16,640
We have had our amuse-bouche Leto as a patriot Jay Leno we had our app

575
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:19,200
Which was a lesson in why I think

576
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
Disorder shows in Port

577
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
The counter propaganda

578
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
That is going to

579
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:25,344
It's going to only get worse

580
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
For the foreseeable future

581
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
And now it's

582
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,464
Which is the

583
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
March 17th

584
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Now I want to say clearly

585
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,376
A couple of these clips along

586
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
We're going to have to play them

587
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
I couldn't count them

588
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,704
There's no way to cut him

589
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
We're going to play them and we deposit any time

590
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,848
One of them is like 10 minutes long

591
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
The ones like

592
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:51,712
Which is under lock but he goes on

593
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Tangents

594
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
That I need to have

595
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:56,320
Incontact

596
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:59,904
He wants to start off the show by talking about immigrants

597
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
And also make a little

598
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
B of A point about

599
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,864
Considers President Trump

600
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,912
Double-patty sounds refugees

601
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,520
Adam and by the judge

602
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:23,200
Islam Sharia law would be an unusual intervention

603
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
The elected president and Congress

604
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:35,488
Yeah thanks Breitbart you guys are always on the ball they're very impartial very

605
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,072
Journalism

606
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
What was he talking about

607
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,752
That a judge was going to order Trump to allow more refugees in

608
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,032
So he didn't

609
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
Well maybe it is maybe it's like a potential future

610
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:56,736
It's not like a we already have a commitment

611
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
To accept such and such number of residents a program to

612
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:08,000
Patriot such-and-such number of river like un guidelines

613
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:13,632
Depending on their economic ability and population

614
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:19,008
Executing all of his responsibilities

615
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,544
Anyway

616
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
The people

617
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:25,664
Whatever he

618
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,736
Spending all of our money

619
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:35,136
For his wife to hate him meanwhile Muhammad Ali

620
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,024
Khon2

621
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:43,072
This goes on and on and on

622
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
And

623
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:51,776
The judge is are now issuing executive order Psy.

624
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:55,104
It's not called an executive order when a judge does it it's called a

625
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,712
It's already a decision in a court case

626
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,040
Yeah generally they have something in front of them on their docket

627
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Invade

628
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
Decide what the law says about it

629
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
Which is

630
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,464
Judicial branches for

631
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,744
No it's not

632
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
It's not

633
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:13,792
Now

634
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:21,984
There is zero possibility of no it's not even if you wanted to

635
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,520
And here's the craziest

636
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,104
You can't even compare it to an executive order because

637
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
Can't overturn it

638
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,664
Right

639
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Of that

640
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
Other people

641
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,808
Unconstitutional

642
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
Yep

643
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,488
No checks

644
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,560
It isn't

645
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Dictatorship

646
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,680
Did they

647
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
I don't know

648
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
You know what babe I'm scared

649
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
They have

650
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
Consistently

651
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
Push the narrative

652
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,904
Obama's a dictator

653
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
Obama doing all of this stuff

654
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,024
So for them to say that

655
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,120
Trump is being caught

656
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Because

657
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:23,680
We don't have a dick

658
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,264
Realize that Obama

659
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,288
Was not inside

660
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
Sure

661
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,152
Save-A-Lot

662
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
As long as you

663
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,224
Obama is a dictator who got to

664
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,248
To do whatever he wanted

665
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
You get to assume that Trump gets

666
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
To do whatever he

667
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
Well it's like they called I like Preparatory rhetoric

668
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
Yeah it's this idea a bit like

669
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,232
Muslims poses

670
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,280
Threat to America's way of life

671
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,864
When people make that argument they aren't reflecting their reality

672
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Currently

673
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:56,704
They're reflecting what they want to respond to later

674
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,544
Yeah I can see that you're Preparing People

675
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Hozier

676
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,384
Meaning that there is no threat

677
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,176
No no maybe there will be

678
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:11,296
Brighton framing the discussion

679
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
And it's very very

680
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:15,904
Yes but it couldn't be an executive order anyway

681
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,184
Executive orders a reference

682
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Executive branch

683
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,744
Judicial order

684
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,472
Wallace Rebellion

685
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,592
Tarzan goes there with the proper size picture

686
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,712
Shut up

687
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,504
Again

688
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
That's not how that

689
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,600
Snow.

690
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,672
That was how that worked and it didn't go well

691
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,280
Also that story in question with them not wanting to hang up

692
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:57,120
Put Trump picture at the VA

693
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,704
Bureaucracy

694
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,776
Should have to go in to decorate

695
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,872
Or something along those lines

696
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:12,736
Bureaucracy on decoration I kind of agree to but the idea that it was like we hate Trump

697
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:15,296
You can't put up his picture that's not what it was it was like

698
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:20,416
Is rigmarole

699
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
A spot where picture of a present

700
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,256
Supposed to go to bring the wrong size picture

701
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
I'm not saying that

702
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,424
Still do not care I don't care either but it's not what Alex Azar

703
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:41,152
Although if it was me I would want to go to agree with him for the wrong reasons

704
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
They already have one

705
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:56,512
Porsche open up your board is bringing 5 million

706
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
No I don't think

707
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:13,152
Create

708
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Confused

709
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:31,072
Many say you're against people that are

710
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
A different

711
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:39,008
Fifty-year-old man has her six-year-old kids

712
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:52,576
That that that was you know I was always

713
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,608
Run the World

714
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
Voting is

715
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,656
Is so

716
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,192
Crazy cuz he's like

717
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:15,360
I don't I don't hate anybody for their sexuality but if you're up

718
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,176
Which kind of proves

719
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,808
He knows what he's talking about you like you're a beta and you wonder why your abandonment

720
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
School tells you you should be a woman

721
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:30,208
Watches Over Me

722
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
Of course

723
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,792
Of course they go to class

724
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,328
Have you ever been to work

725
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
No you haven't been to one of these class

726
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,704
These classes they tell you how to be a girl

727
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,824
Not if you're an alpha

728
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Also

729
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
If he's right

730
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
The number of genders is exploding

731
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
Too fast look

732
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,344
I don't want to be I don't want to be anti multiplying

733
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
52 101-year

734
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:00,928
Guys

735
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
By next year they'll be ten million

736
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
See now that it's interesting that you say that

737
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
This sort of relates to what he's about to say Preparatory rhetoric what he's about to say

738
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,288
Not really but

739
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
Exponential growth of

740
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
Something alright

741
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Bred 4S

742
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
The clip you said I have the

743
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,992
He's talking about that like

744
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,808
If you dump chemicals into a thing

745
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,368
Gay frogs

746
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:31,136
So that means

747
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
People are gay

748
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,208
Because of Pence

749
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,512
Got you

750
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
More

751
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Gay frogs

752
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
I don't know.

753
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,943
Business

754
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,647
That's on me

755
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
I just want you to know for sure that

756
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,071
You've got a long as you keep that I've got to run once I'm 35

757
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,799
The number of each year in Sweden

758
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:24,383
Within only 15 years

759
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
They can't procreate Mission completed

760
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,551
Exponential growth curve

761
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Wallace

762
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,631
Concur

763
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:51,263
Sexton stupid

764
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:57,663
Okay very great a lot of pink

765
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,967
I love Lana Del Rey

766
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
So

767
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
Here's with stupid about

768
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,903
He's quoting a Breitbart article

769
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,671
About

770
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:11,231
The rise of transgender identity

771
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:13,535
Right and there's no snow

772
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
There is nothing

773
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
There was a quote

774
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:21,727
From a doctor in Sweden

775
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:26,335
Sad without any statistics without anything to back it up

776
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,359
She just said

777
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
That each year the number double

778
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
There's nothing to back that up

779
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,503
Also

780
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
She said that in the last

781
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:38,111
Searcy scene 197 in

782
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
Who are trans

783
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,815
Way more than 197

784
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,351
Play for next year

785
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,679
We got one more year before sleep

786
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
There's literally

787
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:59,871
That's a percentage wise of so minuscule is less

788
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,455
More people are trans so much as more people

789
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:09,855
F****** comfortable enough most of the time it's people who are already identifying as we think

790
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Hiding it

791
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:17,279
F****** killing themselves right right trying to not be what they are I believe if I if I work

792
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,423
It's just a correctly like it's on the rise in America as well but it's like 1% of the popular

793
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:29,823
It's very long might be called at 1%

794
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,919
Has to be at least at least like forty million probably rub

795
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
So that's

796
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,319
Almost nothing

797
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
So she didn't see everybody

798
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,695
So I mean

799
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,975
She's a doctor in one

800
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:51,071
Goodluck Stockholm

801
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
York

802
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
But like

803
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
There's no statistic

804
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
It's just

805
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,735
The quote that doesn't have anything to back it up

806
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
From somebody is using

807
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,879
Also there I did in my research I did find that there was an article

808
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
About how the trans population of America

809
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Is double decker

810
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
In the last five year

811
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
Conflating those two nonsense

812
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:25,887
What was possible but that number doubling is only base

813
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,191
On a very unscientific

814
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,215
Convey guest

815
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,495
Estimate of about

816
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
700000

817
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
Trans individuals in 2005

818
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,151
So that number that is hypothetically doubled

819
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:37,919
Is not

820
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:44,575
There's no evidence that's true and that's already a bulshit thing because it's still got that same that

821
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
That same ring of like

822
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,415
Previous length

823
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,463
The time in in the same way that

824
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,511
In Saudi Arabia there like

825
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Yeah we don't have any

826
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,703
Tomorrow is population growth of 3%

827
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
We're overrun

828
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:07,103
Now let's take another lap around this b******* Christmas tree

829
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:13,503
I don't know why that came for my ring around the rosie

830
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
Shipt

831
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,255
Good luck Maple f*** the pool is the metal version of it

832
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,047
Symbolizes a tree

833
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:29,887
Bada-bing bada-boom Christmas tree

834
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,751
The other thing that Alex is f****** stupid about and if he had any understanding

835
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,335
Of these communities he talks about know is that

836
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,663
Not all trans people are operative not all of them

837
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,687
Have surgeries

838
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,735
To get sexual reassignment sir

839
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,039
Many of them are still

840
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,831
Able to have children

841
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,647
The idea that wants you are want to be

842
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:54,719
Become the other gender now you can't have kids

843
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,487
Is b*******

844
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,815
That's absolutely bulshit

845
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Into that

846
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,287
Ariel

847
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,567
I know but again that's

848
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,175
Still validate that idea of something about having a womb

849
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Qualifies you as a

850
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,807
Yes like that's what it always gets back to is not wrong

851
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
Are you a baby Factory

852
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,367
Is

853
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,903
Alex Jones

854
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
Woman are you a person

855
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,047
Are you a man with a big dick who can

856
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
Be all kind of alpha

857
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Or are you a baby

858
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
And everybody who doesn't fit in

859
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,983
To those inappropriate

860
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,311
Procreate art

861
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,615
He's full of

862
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,687
Serious

863
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,735
Canary idea of reality

864
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:49,759
It's such a fuc

865
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,671
S*** this next clip we're going to go into is a string of Lies

866
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,951
One of them

867
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:58,975
Is

868
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Really fun.

869
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,535
And the others

870
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
But the

871
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
We'll make it through

872
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,191
Phone

873
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,127
Double is the cheapest and most nutritious food in human history

874
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,431
So that's the introduction of the premise

875
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:23,807
That is another great isolated drop right there

876
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
Is a McDouble

877
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,159
So I want to have McDonald's to have that

878
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,951
On their f****** website

879
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
Tomorrow I would like to use Bisquick

880
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,559
As something of a case study

881
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,399
Then we will come back to later the episode of Alex Jones

882
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,959
Not knowing the stories that he's talking

883
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,031
So the introduction is that McDonald's

884
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
McDouble is the most nutritious

885
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Cheapest food

886
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,127
Humanist

887
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Is Amore meaning it's the cheapest food with the most

888
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,295
Nutrition in it

889
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
Should I redo the article

890
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Of

891
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Or fuschia

892
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
I don't want to read the

893
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:04,255
Basically it is a telegraph article

894
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
About

895
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,839
The co-author Freakonomics

896
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Stephen Dubner

897
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
He

898
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,007
Debate on his blog after reader suggested at the

899
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
McDouble packs a better nutritional punch

900
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
Search for the penny van is often assumed

901
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,919
The double cheeseburger provides 390 calories

902
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
22 grams of protein

903
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,223
Happy birthday Lisa

904
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:31,135
7% of daily fiber 19th grams of fat

905
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Half of your daily serving

906
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:36,255
Right

907
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:44,447
Christmas audio for the average person it isn't a great option

908
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:47,519
Take a trip to the farmers market to puzzle over esoteric left

909
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:51,871
Codes just weird

910
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,687
Where else but McDonald's can poor people obtain

911
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,735
So many calories per dollar

912
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,527
Now that's interesting

913
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,319
Really good question

914
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:04,415
This article goes on to break down the difference

915
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
Between like caloric intake

916
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,255
Price of junk Foods

917
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,095
They have it thrown in the face

918
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,887
The argument when

919
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
Thomas

920
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:17,215
A campaigning organic farmer

921
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
North Carolina

922
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,799
Subs nutrition

923
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:25,663
You can get a pound of organic brown rice in a pound of red lentils for about 1/3

924
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:27,199
1 lb 30

925
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
A serving of each of these things would be around 48

926
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,623
So basically saying that you could have red lentils and rice

927
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,951
Yeah also

928
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,719
Right

929
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,791
So basically this article

930
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,863
Not to jump on the whole like

931
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,727
You know what nobody wants to hear

932
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
If you're if you're

933
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
Going for like hey I just want to

934
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
You know you could get a half of a

935
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,407
You can get all the brown rice

936
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,431
You want to eat for half

937
00:50:59,455 --> 00:50:59,967
Yeah well I

938
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
I didn't get that

939
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,575
Goddamn reason

940
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,623
Red lentils

941
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:10,207
The premise

942
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Right

943
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:16,095
Is that a reference I don't care music

944
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,775
Very close

945
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
This article starts with the headline

946
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,503
McDonald's McDouble is the most

947
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
Hypothetically

948
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
But it has

949
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,623
Just got those what the premise

950
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:42,207
The article is I'm by the end

951
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,767
Explains that there are comprable other

952
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,047
Things that you can eat

953
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Could have about

954
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,607
The same nutritional value

955
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:51,935
What articles

956
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,007
Do you mean the

957
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,031
Point out information

958
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:58,335
Generally you could use

959
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,663
Is Jamaica in French

960
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
You don't get the information

961
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,479
If you just read the headline

962
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
You don't get any of that information

963
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
It's much like

964
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,087
It's much like the McDouble

965
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,879
And that you get a lot of empty

966
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
Tea calories

967
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
I was going to say it's like eating these

968
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
10 of an orange

969
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,535
You're not getting why you're supposed to

970
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
Eating the skin of a five-year-old boy who is taught to think he's

971
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
So Alex

972
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
I have not read this article

973
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
But

974
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,751
He's mad about it

975
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,775
Any talks about it

976
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
For quite a while

977
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
Spends it into something

978
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,639
Conspiracy theories

979
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:36,223
Alex hasn't Reddit very mad about

980
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:41,087
Press release put out

981
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,623
It's the cheapest

982
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:48,255
Most nutritious food in human history

983
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,583
He did not

984
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:56,447
Eyeglass a folks

985
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
Don't

986
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
Press secretary

987
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,271
The longest-running

988
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,831
Is it a bomb

989
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,415
Bombas running press secretary

990
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:18,719
Mr. Gibbs

991
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:24,095
Mister

992
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,423
Francis comeback

993
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
Was an accident

994
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
Know someone somewhere

995
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:38,431
Did that isn't McDonald's

996
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:41,247
Article he's thinking this is a press release from McDonald's

997
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:45,599
Discussion that was led by the co-author Freakonomics

998
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,695
From McDonalds because this guy who used to work for Obama is now

999
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
PR at McDonald's

1000
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Holyshit

1001
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
Let's let's bring Obama into this

1002
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,095
Let's bring this whole thing in

1003
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,119
It's crazy

1004
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Now watch

1005
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,935
He's off on this

1006
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:03,007
For quite a while and then eventually

1007
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Cuz he's an idiot

1008
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Are you just ramble

1009
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
But then

1010
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,895
He starts to read the article

1011
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
And I think

1012
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:13,503
He realizes everything I've just said is wrong

1013
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,063
Gmail

1014
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,511
Confused look but it wasn't it wasn't as the words coming out of his mouth

1015
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:29,119
There's been other times that it's been more obvious.

1016
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:32,447
But this one was just like

1017
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,495
Bass

1018
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
Enjoy this

1019
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,823
Dumb

1020
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:51,391
Thank God they're so dumb and MSNBC last with him

1021
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
Mister

1022
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:04,447
Don't criticize him because New York

1023
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Google

1024
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
These aren't true things he's just headlines from like

1025
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Zerohedge

1026
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:14,943
Right

1027
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
Johnson

1028
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,551
Don't get bogged down in 8

1029
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
Elsa gets back to McDonald's

1030
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,751
By the way

1031
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,543
The Muggles get mad

1032
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
Got to go in

1033
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
With or without Muslims we can't drink on the

1034
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,479
In America we can't have open

1035
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:56,159
Do you know when that law came into effect

1036
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,999
Or maybe it was some drunk assholes through like a bottle at a car

1037
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Muslims

1038
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:09,215
And you drink beer on the street

1039
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,199
Find yourself

1040
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:26,623
Muslims

1041
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,303
Cuz it's so easy

1042
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
Yep

1043
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:44,031
15 years ago

1044
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
Ridiculous

1045
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
I'm saying that now

1046
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
How long till we get to realize

1047
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:56,063
Never be afraid of it for 9 on my entire life now

1048
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,367
Absolutely

1049
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:03,487
Henry is right around the corner more of a boogeyman than Obama

1050
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
For Soros

1051
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:11,167
Barack Hussein Obama Leah his daughter Rides Again

1052
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,471
Islam

1053
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,031
Control those areas

1054
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,647
We've got millions of

1055
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,327
So we're not saying that

1056
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
So he's mad

1057
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,911
Coupland

1058
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,471
Yeah he's mad at Earl

1059
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:51,103
But I mean like professors

1060
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
Piece of s***

1061
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,431
But they ought to

1062
00:57:54,687 --> 00:58:00,831
Still denying that much like Rogers code for polonium poisoning

1063
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:05,183
Probably but

1064
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,255
Types of salad

1065
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:13,375
If you can get away with that move that's a solid moves you're not a krasic dictator movie

1066
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,727
They have millions of people per European city

1067
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
You're going to move you're in

1068
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,311
Entire population

1069
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,335
Kiss people

1070
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,431
And

1071
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,967
He's not saying that

1072
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
Yeah that's right

1073
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:34,111
We got bogged down in the reality of Matt's

1074
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
To the fact that nobody has said any of

1075
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,207
I promised it says compact

1076
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
I forgot once

1077
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
We got under turkey

1078
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,215
Still in North Korea is also going to come out

1079
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,335
Islamic domination

1080
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Thought

1081
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,879
Turkey

1082
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,327
I wonder if that has anything to do with the people in power

1083
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:16,607
Sing

1084
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,887
Holy war language

1085
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,167
I wonder if that's

1086
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,215
I wonder if it has anything to do with Bannon

1087
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:28,895
To the president literally saying he foresees a holy war between Christianity and Islam

1088
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Bird wants nothing

1089
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
But

1090
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
If he was

1091
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,271
We're playing

1092
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
And we should not be doing that

1093
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,855
Do a lot of holy war Reddit

1094
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
Using that holy war rhetoric

1095
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
United

1096
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
No that's true

1097
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:56,543
Which is the best Family Guy bird is the cheapest and most nutritious food in human history

1098

1099
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,599
In the middle of him

1100
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:12,415
Telling a fake story about Robert Gibb

1101
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Being behind

1102
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,255
This McDonald's story in the telegraph

1103
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,327
He's complaining that people think he's fake news

1104
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,607
This is

1105
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,959
Insane Through the Looking-Glass

1106
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Don't make sense to me

1107
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,591
Everything you've heard me say for 39 minutes

1108
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,663
Most of it from their own mouths

1109
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
0 of what

1110
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:39,551
He said the opposite currently

1111
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,343

1120
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:10,783
His fingerprints are nowhere near any any of this

1121
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,111
Reached for comment in the article

1122
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:26,399

What's the cheapest most nutritious and Bountiful

01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
Also

1127
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,015
The best comedy ever is probably the original Ghostbusters

1128
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Not this

1129
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,319
I think it's the one with the women

1130
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:50,207
Capicola

1131
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:53,791
Will not rot

1132
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
Under blocks

1133
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:03,519
Handsome man

1134
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:11,199
Flowers

1135
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,247
Kim Jong-un

1136
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:16,063
17 different

1137
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,183
Yo in North Korea

1138
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:24,511
North Korea do that

1139
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,791
Do you know what's crazy

1140
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,119
Do you remember what happened on the day of Trumps inauguration

1141
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,447
I don't when it was raining and then the sun came out

1142
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,031
They said that it was him

1143
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,079
Is Providence

1144
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:42,687
It was God smiling down I'm not going to lie to you here at

1145
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
But

1146
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Alex

1147
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
You're busted

1148
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:55,743
Where is badazz North Korean propaganda

1149
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,047
He doesn't even have any clue

1150
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Father

1151
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
Sheets this is ridiculous

1152
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
Official

1153
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,383
So is he

1154
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:19,039
Is he doing the voice of the North Korean news agency people

1155
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:25,695
McDouble being the nutritious playing that liberals believe all this stuff about

1156
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,463
North Korea

1157
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,487
Kim Jeong Hoon

1158
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
Which is not

1159
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
Anybody

1160
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
But

1161
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,655
Believe half of that show their forced

1162
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:40,287
They're beaten if they don't cry when the Kim Jong-il die

1163
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Well they're also be

1164
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,615
If they speaking

1165
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
Anytime

1166
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:47,711
1842

1167
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:54,111
Effeminate British Butler I kind of wish we all spoke

1168
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,255
This would be much more interesting podcast of somebody you.

1169
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
To use this

1170
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,559
Voice

1171
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:07,423
Kill myself honestly with my sore throat I don't do nothing I want to f****** die

1172
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,191
Talk like

1173
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
He's going to get right back

1174
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
Of course

1175
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:17,919
Under Obamacare to bring that in

1176
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:19,199
Nailed it you got it

1177
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:24,319
That wasn't unfortunate

1178
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
That was an unfortunate thing

1179
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,647
Obama said

1180
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
So turned out not to be true

1181
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
Lion

1182
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,887
The year the liberal Outlets

1183
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,167
Vrv

1184
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:43,007
Mainstream Outlets all have also

1185
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,823
I believe I believe that

1186
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
He intended for that

1187
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,199
Be the case

1188
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
He couldn't

1189
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,503
Do it

1190
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,343
And everybody was like

1191
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
I imagine

1192
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,671
Animal might be fantasy booking his

1193
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:03,999
History but I imagine in a situation where you wasn't up against such a

1194
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:04,767
Very

1195
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:10,143
Strong opposition that threatened to shut down the government over his the health-care bill

1196
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:12,191
I imagine he would have

1197
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,007
Got them and you can keep your doctor

1198
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
Peace to the bill

1199
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
Maybe that's not true who knows

1200
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:22,175
The more important point is

1201
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:28,063
Re-litigate the past on that one cuz

1202
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,183
Scant months ago that we should probably go after

1203
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,975
You can keep your own doctor toy

1204
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,047
Timer

1205
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
He says

1206
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
We're about to hit a lightning rod

1207
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,119
Out of Lies

1208
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,167
So the next one

1209
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,959
Pause

1210
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,055
What is isolate that

1211
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,383
The building it says that Obamacare

1212
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,175
They said Obamacare was going to be free

1213
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
No one ever said that

1214
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:58,527
They did say if there would be tax credit

1215
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
It's that would help you

1216
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,671
And eventually it would

1217
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,719
Necessarily pay for itself but it would

1218
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,535
Fuel Expo pay for itself in terms of government

1219
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,447
So there's the other one

1220
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:23,103
Did the Obama saying that you didn't build your business you super super mad about that

1221
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,919
Obama's trying to make him that speeches that we all live in

1222
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
Communities

1223
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,503
And you didn't individually build your business

1224
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,783
You did it within the network

1225
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,807
And the framework of

1226
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
The community you live in

1227
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:37,439
Or even if you did build your business like legitimately from

1228
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:38,719
The ground up you built

1229
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
The building

1230
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,023
You built all of this

1231
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,583
You got your clients did you build the roads

1232
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,399
Did you Corey the rocks that you built the building with

1233
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:51,007
School that you went to the Taj a build all of it

1234
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,079
You build the hospital when you broke your goddamn leg

1235
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
Did you build the neighborhood that provides you with Gus

1236
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Parents

1237
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
Right

1238
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,527
Pointe Ranier like

1239
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,087
You didn't build your business but the reality of it

1240
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
Is what he saying is

1241
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
The everything

1242
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
Framework

1243
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,511
That's like saying

1244
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:19,679
So Alex Belcher business

1245
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,103
2 + 2 equals 5 is the next lie

1246
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
Of course that is classic Orwell

1247
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:33,503
Very much Obama to

1248
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,039
If you

1249
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,367
Sometimes two plus two does equal five

1250
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:44,255
I don't want to get into geometry

1251
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:47,583
It's about to get wild I'll give you

1252
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,679
I'll give you a very basic example this comes up in like Taxation and accounting

1253
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,239
A lot of times you have to round thing

1254
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,287
If the round things to the nearest

1255
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,639
Brian Austin X

1256
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,711
But often times that you can leave a penny

1257
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
Play Penny's anymore

1258
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,623
So if you have something that's like

1259
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,671
2.49

1260
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
You double it

1261
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
That's rounded to

1262
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
The two cents

1263
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,071
When you're adding it up so it's $0.02

1264
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
$0.02 and what you'll end up with

1265
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,399
The 2.49

1266
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
149

1267
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,959
Jiggles 4.98

1268
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
Around that up to five you now have an

1269
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
What's $0.02 +

1270
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567
Tucson sequels 5

1271
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,663
Is that

1272
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,199
We should have ballast

1273
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,807
I agree with that

1274
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,135
Stupid

1275
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
We've been having for

1276
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:47,487
I understand the point of making it slightly pedantic

1277
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,839
What is string theory

1278
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
Basic arithmetic

1279
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
But yes there are other in San

1280
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
Located where

1281
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
The numbers take on differ

1282
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,383
But just in that in the case of rounding

1283
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,783
Often 2 + 210 equal 5

1284
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Alex Jones

1285
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:20,511
You

1286
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:24,607
Telegraph

1287
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,399
The biggest load of horse manure

1288
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,959
One of their most recent tweets is the Shamrock Shake

1289
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,591
McDonald's in Austin

1290
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:36,383
Emma told me that

1291
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,455
Horse manure

1292
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,223
Manure

1293
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,783
Horse winner obviously more nutritious

1294
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:55,583
Double is the cheapest I'm reading and most nutritious food in human history

1295
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
The terrible British

1296
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:07,615
The cheapest

1297
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:16,319
Might seem sensible giant colossal

1298
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,599
Might seem

1299
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,951
But according to the author of Freakonomics

1300
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,255
Injection is a

1301
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,863
At this point I think Alex realizes that his whole narrative

1302
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,935
Confirming that maybe they're just saying

1303
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
You might be

1304
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
Surprised

1305
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:38,079
Copaxone amazing caloric punch Pernod

1306
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,103
But

1307
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
I think at this point he realizes he's about to

1308
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
He's about to jump ship

1309
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,199
He's about to dismount

1310
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,063
That's right

1311
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,791
This is a grown up

1312
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:09,055
Because he read that Freakonomics doesn't say what I've just been saying for the last 10 minutes

1313
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Does

1314
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:17,503
Pretty well if he was I was dreaming

1315
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,831
Like instead of like it's like in

1316
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:24,671
Whatever the whatever the gymnast falls off the balance beam

1317
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:28,511
They still get up and do the thing with their arms out

1318
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
But he still doing

1319
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:31,583
He still didn't he committed to it

1320
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,679
Still performing the man knows what he's doing

1321
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
So embarrassing

1322
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:43,103
Yeah that's that's

1323
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,407
The Arc of that clip is

1324
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:52,575
McDonald's I don't read this article but I'm going to tee off on it I'm going to claim that it's some Obama guy who's the

1325
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
Behind it

1326
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,671
I'm going to other fake stories

1327
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
About Muslims invading countries

1328
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
I'm going to

1329
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,839
We've Obamacare and Obama lying about

1330
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,631
Also

1331
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:12,031
Also North Korea that all liberals believe North Korean propaganda

1332
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:16,639
I'm going to actually get around to reading the article OSHA

1333
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:23,295
Hero's journey Joseph Campbell

1334
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
Volume

1335
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,111
But then here's what's great about it

1336
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
So that

1337
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,671
Quip ended with

1338
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,719
Let's get on to something more

1339
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:35,583
Ridiculous this next clip is going to start with him saying that

1340
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,399
Just so I can illustrate that all of that

1341
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
Lead to this

1342
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,727
Alright

1343
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,287
Is yet another one of our little adventures

1344
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:50,687
Down Alex Jones's bulshit history know it's personal history or is Imagination of what the

1345
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
The real history

1346
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
I think the ladder

1347
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,039
I don't believe it

1348
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
But I'm certain

1349
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,975
That there is an element of the story

1350
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,279
Does not know

1351
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,559
And he doesn't know that

1352
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:12,191
Story

1353
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,543
100 years on air

1354
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,311
I believe

1355
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,847
Based on

1356
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:25,247
Based based on how repetitive you I guarantee you stole it more than 100 times

1357
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Though I have never heard

1358
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
Toothbrush for me

1359
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,135
Because it happened about a year

1360
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,303
I just reset there because this is such a big deal

1361
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
What about

1362
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,567
And I'm staying a small apartment

1363
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,831
More about that story was together

1364
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:06,463
Where they had to say for their bedroom or whatever but

1365
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,791
Now we know where the

1366
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:16,447
Alex is the worst at being discreet is the worst at telling stories

1367
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,727
Isaac

1368
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,775
There's nuclear weapon

1369
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,455
But I'll tell you this

1370
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,735
Obamacare

1371
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,783
You want me to tell you that

1372
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:47,167
Aggression problem

1373
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:52,799
Well-known newspapers

1374
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,103
So

1375
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,151
Recap so far

1376
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:01,759
Yeah if you want to steal his parents safe just know that when you go in

1377
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:08,159
You can already grab Alex's guns to do so they're in the bedroom to bring your own guns

1378
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
Make sure that you walk in empty-handed this is my situation

1379
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,351
You can walk in there

1380
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,143
But to be fair you need a time machine

1381
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,679
His back when he was in junior

1382
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
I mean who knows

1383
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,775
You don't want to keep guns in

1384
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:27,871
Junior college dorm

1385
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,407
Support him on that

1386
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:36,063
And so I go and I come out

1387
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:38,367
Rifle

1388
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,671
And a Percocet

1389
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,631
And he's all the way through the living room in the den

1390
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,151
And I want yes

1391
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:10,367
And my dad goes pee it come on Alex coming

1392
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,567
I don't sense

1393
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,615
My mom works in the major newspaper

1394
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,711
Since I was born

1395
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,743
Today I'm haven't seen Bobby 67 years

1396
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:54,143
Walking out

1397
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,519
Sideload

1398
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,799
No big deal

1399
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,663
These freaking I will not answer

1400
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,455
It's fine I could see Eileen

1401
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:15,391
Really whatever friends with them again

1402
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
So now

1403
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,583
I don't believe that story at all there's something else going on and I don't know what it was

1404
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:25,631
Alex there's something

1405
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,191
There's something in the dynamic between the two couples

1406
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
There's some

1407
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,519
Straining their friendship that already existed

1408
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:37,663
There's no way that some squeamish liberal be freaked out

1409
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,199
Not a chance

1410
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,575
That does that does illustrate something about gun people that they just

1411
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,135
Which is that

1412
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,415
Don't

1413
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,695
Bring a gun

1414
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,767
Well I don't I'm not I'm not going to

1415
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
Whatever Alex Jones is make

1416
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,471
But I don't want a gun in my face

1417
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
Right.

1418
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:07,359
Simple to me that is something that would make me angry if

1419
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,151
You act like if I come into this

1420
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
To record this

1421
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,015
And you just haven't been around

1422
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:17,087
I'm not going to feel okay with that

1423
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,695
And then if you come up to me and the publicity

1424
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,743
Your p**** don't look

1425
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,279
It's not loaded

1426
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,607
It's not loaded right now

1427
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,167
Play kygo

1428
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
Tumi

1429
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
.

1430
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,263
Then it's your right to think that

1431
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:39,359
But then I also think I would put a strain on our relationship

1432
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:42,175
I think there's another thing.

1433
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:49,343
Not going to be couples therapy therapy

1434
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,183
They charge extra but it's worth it

1435
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:58,815
Here's the thing I think that gun people also don't realize that people who don't like guns

1436
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,095
Really aren't that

1437
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
For the most part

1438
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,399
They just

1439
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,679
Recognized

1440
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
The danger

1441
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,983
That's there and they don't want to be in

1442
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:09,823
That's really what I mean like I don't want guns around.

1443
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,871
I understand that a lot of people can use them

1444
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,663
Responsibly

1445
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,967
I just don't want to have a lot of my good friends

1446
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,271
A grown-up in Missouri had gun

1447
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,975
But I think a lot of very liberal people understand

1448
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,023
Responsible gun ownership

1449
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,047
Is possible

1450
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
Prevalent

1451
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,887
Junction

1452
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:40,031
I mean what we would ever want

1453
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:41,311
Realistic

1454
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,127
Speaker

1455
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:49,503
Could be a lot worse. Now the flip side of that is also liberals understand

1456
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:50,271
Statistics

1457
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,343
And a lot of times no matter how careful you are asking

1458
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,647
So it's best just

1459
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:57,183
For our money

1460
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,719
We don't want me around it cuz

1461
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,535
What's like a baby accidentally shooting another baby

1462
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,863
Two things do happen

1463
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,887
Are murderers

1464
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,751
Yeah how weird is that it was in there cold baby hearts

1465
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
How do you raise a child

1466
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,080
That has

1467
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,384
Accident how do you raise a baby

1468
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:17,920
I don't know

1469
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:18,688
When it was

1470
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
You know like

1471
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,504
CR7

1472
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:26,112
Is your seven got a parent statue down in the living room and they say

1473
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,904
No way no way

1474
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,952
You're freaking me out

1475
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:32,256
No it's not that

1476
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,536
Okay

1477
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:37,120
Oh my God you're a murderer

1478
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,424
You killed your brother

1479
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:46,080
Your ears all the time

1480
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:51,712
You take to the Grave that's like you notes that's like you're a right babe

1481
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:56,064
Pallet child

1482
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,392
I know that everyone

1483
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:01,440
It feels like all information is important

1484
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,976
Everyone to have no it's not

1485
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,304
If you accidentally killed someone else as a baby

1486
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,840
You can't tell that baby that

1487
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:10,656
You can't tell that baby

1488
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,448
Somehow in your scrapbook

1489
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
Inopportune picture to take

1490
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:21,664
Like you remember how we're getting so far off track the point

1491
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:26,784
Childbirth videos that somehow happen where they live

1492
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
And then just a baby covered up with a gutter

1493
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,928
We shot it on

1494
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:35,232
We shoved it up there in the third trimester

1495
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280
Handy with the steel

1496
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
To get back to Alex

1497
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,936
Pic of baby murder

1498
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
Yeah

1499
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:47,520
He does not understand something about this story

1500
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
I'm not sure what it is

1501
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,592
I'm sorry I can't

1502
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
I can't dispute

1503
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,920
What are you saying except to say I

1504
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,200
It doesn't melt

1505
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,272
Correlation there is no cause

1506
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,576
At this point he pulled out a gun

1507
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,416
He does not actually pull out a gun

1508
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,232
He pulled out a gun

1509
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:11,584
What a f****** idiot are there for about 15 minutes

1510
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:16,960
Because he's always pulling guns out and about 15 minutes throughout this

1511
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,288
This makes 15 minutes he's like putting the laser scope at the camera

1512
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,360
Shining Light On

1513
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
But

1514
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
F******

1515
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,832
He uses this as we're about to see the as the rest of the squid plays at

1516
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
He uses

1517
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:35,904
To discuss the story about Sean Hannity

1518
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,440
Pointing a gun at 1 William

1519
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,000
We can address after this clip is done

1520
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,560
So we can hear Alex's take on it and then

1521
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,912
I am 20 years

1522
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,032
What do I tell you the story because

1523
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:58,944
Pelosi press conference

1524
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,968
Bush is present

1525
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,016
Again

1526
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,832
Flip it and you're making

1527
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Hey

1528
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,648
While The Sun Shines on that

1529
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,000
That wasn't one of few weeks ago there's one even worse Maxine Waters again things

1530
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
Russia invaded Korea

1531
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:18,144
Same clip package you've been hitting on for a month now it's

1532
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,680
Stale

1533
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,264
The new ones she's obviously has dementia

1534
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,288
She's out of her mind

1535
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,336
Giggling like an insane person

1536
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,784
That is liberals are domesticated

1537
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,088
Really

1538
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,904
Most of us are not

1539
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
And

1540
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Tough guys

1541
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:48,864
Incompetent Foster just hard working class middle class people big dicks

1542
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,632
Big dicks

1543
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
I would like

1544
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,472
To posit

1545
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
Something

1546
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,056
I want to go back to that abuse thing

1547
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,104
Yes I would argue

1548
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,896
That a lot of people were abused

1549
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,968
Not generally liberals

1550
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:08,576
Okay talking about it there okay being open about

1551
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,344
Trauma

1552
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,112
In their past

1553
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,184
Because they understand that it doesn't make them any less

1554
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,464
Of a man or a woman

1555
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,792
Things that were done to them

1556
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:18,816
When they were powerless

1557
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:25,472
Which is something I say all the time all the time

1558
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:32,384
Because the damage scary to see somebody aggressive and confident I just love being around the Veterans Affairs

1559
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,808
It's the complete opposite

1560
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
Of the people that are friends with Juan Williams

1561
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,376
99 Restaurant

1562
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
Barry Fey

1563
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,936
A gun

1564
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:11,296
The truth is that the the story of that's being recorded in the blood people are

1565
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,832
Shocked about is the

1566
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:13,856
Sean Hannity

1567
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
Pointed a gun at

1568
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,184
Pulled the gun on

1569
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:23,840
Even if a gun is unloaded you're never supposed to point of conversations we have about responsible gun

1570
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,656
Responsible gun ownership

1571
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:29,728
James Brown

1572
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:32,032
Because even if

1573
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,336
It could accidentally go off

1574
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:40,736
There could be loaded even if it appears unloaded there could be something in the chamber or something

1575
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,016
It's entirely possible

1576
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,064
That something f*****-up could happen

1577
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,136
And that's why the number one rule is always Point guns at

1578
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,672
EXO

1579
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:52,512
Go to the person the story is like

1580
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
What

1581
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
Stop

1582
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,400
What's the second word

1583
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,568
Aggressive is the part we don't like is great

1584
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,384
Type of aggressive

1585
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,664
Embarrassed

1586
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:11,712
The only time I like aggressive when it is when

1587
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:12,992
High School football

1588
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,528
Hear those cheerleaders

1589
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,296
Spelling it out

1590
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,600
Aggressive

1591
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,136
Fbe aggressive

1592
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,256
Burdock root

1593
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:26,304
Sure. Cheerleaders

1594
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
I just felt

1595
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:32,448
The point is

1596
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,728
Like Alex

1597
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,056
Woody's harping on is that these new stories were saying

1598
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,896
That want Williams had a gun pulled on him after an argument

1599
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,968
Ever someone is reporting that that's on Friday

1600
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,552
Story was just that they were talking and then somehow

1601
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:54,464
And of course the one Williams he was fine with it

1602
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,000
Crazy Town

1603
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,560
That's just bananas

1604
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:02,656
If you want to be fine with it that's fine on the internet

1605
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
Is that

1606
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,496
When he said he was fine with it somebody was pointing a gun at her

1607
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,568
Sure it turns into the Deep Space 9 mm video

1608
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,128
Reference for you

1609
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:12,896
Cool

1610
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,456
Cool run the jewels fan

1611
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,016
You and that references too late

1612
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,552
Company flow referee

1613
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,600
The point is

1614
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
People don't

1615
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,488
And when you do

1616
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,512
Expect you should be criticized

1617
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
I think of that

1618
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,400
Expect somebody to at least be like

1619
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:35,168
Hey

1620
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,192
Don't do that

1621
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:40,800
So this next clip I'm going to play we're not going to actually deal with it at all

1622
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,104
Because I died I don't care to

1623
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:48,480
But at the end during the show he had an interview for an hour with a guy named Larry's

1624
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Johnson

1625
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:50,784
CIA

1626
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,832
The XVI a guy

1627
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
That's at least a

1628
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
Is egress

1629
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:02,560
Absolutely she's Larry Johnson she is not Grandma Ma

1630
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:05,632
Butler Johnson from the Charlotte Hornets

1631
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,192
He did not appear on Family Matters

1632
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,008
But here is Alex Jones's intro

1633
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:13,056
To I when he's about to bring him on

1634
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:27,904
Know-it-all orders board winning

1635
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,328
A crisis management

1636
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:38,144
I'm so much more he also ran

1637
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,728
Into Kuwait

1638
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,312
And that'll situation on the time to go over there while I'm asleep

1639
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,360
You don't have time to go over all of it

1640
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,384
So I will

1641
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,712
That on your credit

1642
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:56,064
I will go over all of them

1643
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,440
Failure of mine

1644
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,232
Larry Johnson

1645
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,768
Is notable

1646
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,304
Because he went on RT

1647
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,584
The Russian

1648
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
State News Network

1649
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:14,752
Give an interview where he was talking about how

1650
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,568
People that he knows within the CIA were ordered

1651
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:18,592
To Target Trump

1652
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,408
Which is based on hearsay get no

1653
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Kind of

1654
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
Maybe Trump is his Source through some

1655
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,320
Weird Ouroboros

1656
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,088
Love Lies

1657
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,368
So

1658
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,160
Made these claims

1659
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
And then

1660
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,720
Andrew Napolitano

1661
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
Father Judge and Fox News

1662
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,560
Guy

1663
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,328
He went

1664
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:41,376
Fox News

1665
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,144
And repeated

1666
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:42,912
Essentially

1667
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,192
That

1668
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
Larry Johnson

1669
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:51,360
Like a piece of it but it was basically that the thrust of the

1670
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:53,408
Is that the British intelligence agency

1671
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,200
Gchq

1672
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,272
Had been one spying and there's a quid-pro-quo thing going

1673
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:02,624
We spy on the British and the British spy on us and then we trade information

1674
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,648
Nobody's happy about

1675
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
No

1676
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,864
We're spying on everybody

1677
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
Yeah let me get through this

1678
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:17,472
I want to fully discredit

1679
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:23,360
So I was the source for napolatanos claims that he made on Fox News

1680
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:26,432
The conspiracy theory was later asserted as fact by present

1681
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:28,992
Trump with him sighting Fox News and Napolitano

1682
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,296
The British intelligence agency in question

1683
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:34,368
Gchq responded stating that the claims were

1684
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,440
Nonsense utterly ridiculous and should be ignored

1685
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,256
Fox News later just about the statement by Napolitano

1686
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,864
Trump has had to apologize to British intelligence

1687
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,240
Well

1688
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Exactly

1689
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,312
Because

1690
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:55,104
It doesn't because here's the other

1691
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,152
The reports are that

1692
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
Trump had to have

1693
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,224
Spicer do that but

1694
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,272
He has basically said to his death

1695
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,576
We want to keep pushing that narrative

1696
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600
We just don't want it to be

1697
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,744
Trump still want that to be the thing that people talk about

1698
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,280
Rather than the fact that

1699
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,560
He's made up Bowl

1700
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,608
And he's using his

1701
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,376
The distraction

1702
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,400
From the fact that

1703
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
He's full of s***

1704
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,752
He's doing s*** let's not get distracted

1705
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:23,520
Larry Johnson

1706
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:30,176
Because I could just be a thing where he's like you know I got the I got the s*** wrong

1707
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:30,944
Alright fine

1708
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,736
Would never ever ever

1709
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:37,344
According to the New York Times best known for spreading a hoax

1710
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,696
In 2008 that Michelle Obama

1711
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:45,792
In 2008,

1712
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:50,144
His blog No Quarter USA often criticized Obama's qualifications to be president

1713
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,424
On May 16th

1714
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:52,192
2008

1715
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:56,288
John supposed entitled will Throw Momma from the Train

1716
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,104
Which alleged that a tape exists of Michelle Obama

1717
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,896
Rallying against White

1718
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,432
Jeremiah Wright's Church

1719
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,992
Johnson claimed that Republicans were in for

1720
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
Possession of

1721
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
It's being held

1722
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,832
The fall

1723
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,392
It's being held for the fall to drop at the appropriate time

1724
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,928
In a subsequent post

1725
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:15,488
Johnson claims

1726
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,792
When she was on a panel with Louis Farrakhan

1727
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,120
He also explained that he himself had not seen the tape

1728
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,680
But it's

1729
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:26,752
Who have spoken directly with people who

1730
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:33,152
Where on what

1731
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:38,528
Real bad work

1732
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,808
Hopefully

1733
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:45,440
The smears website denied the rumors saying No Such Thing exists

1734
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:49,792
Michelle Obama has not spoken from the pulpit that has never used that word

1735
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
Which word

1736
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
Waiting

1737
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,352
White

1738
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:53,632
Cheap used that word

1739
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,424
I use that word every

1740
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,496
Rachel 1301

1741
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:04,896
Cracker goofing around I would love I would

1742
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,968
Would love Michelle even more if you want on TV was like

1743
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:10,784
I am sick of all these honkies talkingshit about

1744
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,344
I would love her for

1745
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,696
I would love her for that to the story

1746
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:18,464
Yes please

1747
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:24,096
No tapers ever released nor has any other evidence Michelle Obama using the word

1748
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:30,496
On October 21st 2008 Johnson said that according to the McCain campaign

1749
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,544
Progressive

1750
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
Convenience

1751
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
Convenience

1752
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:36,128
Yessir

1753
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:40,480
It really it really would have torpedoed

1754
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,504
That is bad

1755
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,528
That's a big

1756
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,064
That's a big line right now

1757
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,088
This one's worse

1758
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,136
In 2013

1759
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,160
Larry

1760
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:50,976
Falsely accused

1761
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:54,560
Oh no he's at his people

1762
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:59,680
I am a legend

1763
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:06,336
Do support his claim audio clips from a 1971 debate on the Dick Cavett Show

1764
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,384
Terry and John O'Neill

1765
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,456
The original interview audio was altered

1766
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,480
The piece together words

1767
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:18,880
The Kerry spoke as if he

1768
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,928
He said

1769
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
For pleasure

1770
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
What

1771
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,792
When the falsehood was exposed by a reader of Johnson

1772
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,608
The article without apology

1773
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,400
You

1774
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,960
What I did

1775
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,752
Bulshit

1776
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,056
Show

1777
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,872
When you talk about fake news that's what it is

1778
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:48,064
Didn't we can't prove or even do I think that

1779
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,368
He did The Cutting and pasting but you fell

1780
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904
For this obvious hoax

1781
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Video

1782
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,976
Yeah that he clearly make up the

1783
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,000
Stuff about Michelle Obama

1784
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,560
Way worse

1785
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,864
For the stuff you said about John Kerry

1786
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,704
Like that 228 literally accuse someone of war crimes

1787
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,008
And raping Vietnamese women for pleasure

1788
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:10,080
Abomination

1789
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,360
Perhaps

1790
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:15,200
Worst acts of defamation one person

1791
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,480
Absolutely

1792
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,784
Preclude you from ever being lied to

1793
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,832
People shows

1794
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:23,136
What do you make prognosticating statement

1795
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,696
Alex has one for a f****** hour

1796
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:26,464
Great

1797
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,280
I'm sure he's got wonderful things that we loved

1798
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,560
Yeah we do

1799
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
We don't need to hear it

1800
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,632
Anyway this

1801
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,912
It goes on from there.

1802
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:39,264
Look at him

1803
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:42,592
The arrogance the fake confidence

1804
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,320
Folks you think movie

1805
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,368
North

1806
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,392
They are Force

1807
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,464
The North Korean people

1808
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:00,000
Force

1809
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,024
If you don't

1810
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:05,632
Yeah you want to go to a labor camp

1811
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:08,960
Adult

1812
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,008
You better think he's a rockstar

1813
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:11,776
Right

1814
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:16,640
And I don't like the idea that he's making the argument first of all the people are choosing

1815
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,200
To do this is the

1816
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,248
Only possible outcome of socialism

1817
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,808
That's bizarre

1818
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:25,344
But be that as it may

1819
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,440
Very inappropriately weaves it into our American

1820
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:33,792
Just deserted movies

1821
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:48,384
I don't think that's why we were superstitious this is pathetic

1822
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:52,992
Any lizards anything in archery everything's Banette

1823
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,344
I love that everything's going to Ethan North Korea

1824
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:02,464
It's again back to that house bill Wildlife at all

1825
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:08,864
Baron nightmarish hellscape with no food it's like the book The Road

1826
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:10,400
This country that he references

1827
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
Just like that

1828
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:17,312
We references on a past episode he was talking about how in Venezuela's everyone's

1829
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,592
Eating all the zoo animals

1830
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,640
Research into that

1831
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:26,784
Actually after the truth on that before we recorded

1832
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,600
But the reality is

1833
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,624
I do too much

1834
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:34,976
But the reality is that there's one city where they had repeated break-in

1835
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:43,936
But it wasn't like a widespread everywhere around the country everyone's animals it was just

1836
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,216
Clearly one group

1837
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
In the city

1838
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,776
Kept breaking in in like stealing a

1839
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,128
That was what's going on

1840
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,456
Granted their situation is bad

1841
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,504
No matter no matter what happens

1842
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,040
If you say somebody broke

1843
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,088
Into his due to eat animals I am

1844
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:04,416
Just imagining somebody like Wylie Coyote with

1845
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,696
With f******

1846
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,768
Saliva dripping from them outgoing

1847
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,632
The wave

1848
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,960
The way this story made it sound

1849
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:20,544
It sounded like they broke in they found a horse

1850
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,080
And then they barbecued it

1851
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:30,528
Riverwalk

1852
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:34,624
Zebra with the phones at Worldstar Worldstar

1853
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,280
You know what

1854
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,304
That's that's

1855
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:48,704
Premier living in the first world life where I really have

1856
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
Llamas

1857
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,264
Lemmings

1858
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,800
And lemurs

1859
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,616
I have run out of lions

1860
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,944
I know all of my zoo animal start with L

1861
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,736
Forgiving is one of the greatest

1862
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
All time

1863
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
It's a monkey

1864
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,856
To the listeners

1865
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:09,440
Santa Monica

1866
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,512
That's the thing with Thor able to swing by

1867
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
Limb from limb

1868
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
Tree branches

1869
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,120
Monkeys are they able to do that

1870
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,144
It's something that only eight

1871
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,192
Play the given is

1872
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Is a monkey that is a

1873
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
Able to do it which is

1874
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,800
Really cool anyway this is another

1875
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,944
Another new segment of ours

1876
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:34,784
Cuz this next worth is

1877
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,320
This is a clip

1878
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,600
Where Alex Jones

1879
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
Explain

1880
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:44,768
What is going to happen in North Korea Ono know she is really

1881
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,792
Really out of shape

1882
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:50,144
About that rotten General but also

1883
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:56,800
Low blow I think that mites like cold that I've got going on I was making me a little weird

1884
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:58,336
I'm a little off this episode iPhone

1885
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:04,736
If you're a little bit on the bush League Baseball

1886
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,528
Punchy

1887
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,552
But

1888
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:11,648
This is he's just getting done talked about how North Korea is got2b

1889
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Taken care of and

1890
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,184
Rex Tillerson is

1891
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,952
Is f****** awesome

1892
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:15,488
Recognizes that

1893
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,816
Now I'm going

1894
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,912
This is a bit of a longer clip but we got to let it play for a little while

1895
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
Before we interrupted

1896
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,984
Cuz he's going to get into a nightmare

1897
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
Scenario

1898
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
If Rex

1899
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:29,824
Tillerson

1900
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:30,848
Was in

1901
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
It's a wonderful

1902
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,920
God we would all do

1903
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,944
Just watch him die

1904
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,224
Probably

1905
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
When is the banker that

1906
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,600
It is the worst

1907
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:42,880
Garbage human

1908
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,048
History tell you how this will go to the military

1909
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:54,656
Three different ways and

1910
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,728
Really try to crystallize in the best I can

1911
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,056
They start loading

1912
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,616
What appears to be an atomic payload

1913
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:06,432
They've got sensors in space that can scan

1914
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,992
Radioactive

1915
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:11,040
On one of those

1916
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,064
Missiles

1917
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
And

1918
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:18,464
The phone calls we got a President Trump who's got the mediator by attacking him constantly about

1919
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:33,568
What was leftist insoles out kind of China

1920
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:37,152
Call Tamara nextbot

1921
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,344
We got the stands there loading

1922
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:57,632
With atomic payload

1923
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,912
Maybe it's a

1924
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,192
He doesn't know the difference

1925
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,496
Hydrogen bomb

1926
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,032
Doesn't know the difference

1927
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:09,152
President makes the decision they've already had the meetings and

1928
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,224
Launch

1929
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,016
And then it'll be

1930
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,720
Line

1931
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,072
North Korea

1932
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:41,408
Spelling on the size of the bombs are or

1933
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,296
Small

1934
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:50,112
To wipe out the tunnel

1935
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:53,952
Basis

1936
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:59,584
And then they'll start dropping the 500 Megaton bomb song

1937
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,264
Thousand nuclear weapon

1938
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,408
Most of Russia

1939
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:26,464
Reverse engineer plus I have all the sources over the years

1940
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,512
But again is him saying I'll just making

1941
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,328
I'm reverse-engineer this

1942
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,352
Because

1943
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:35,424
Maybe a Bad Thing could happen

1944
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:40,288
Never distract the president pointing out he's a liar

1945
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,568
Well though

1946
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,848
He would be distract

1947
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:48,224
Cuz you guys are all about this

1948
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:53,344
Watched all those underage girls

1949
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,416
Or he's a rapist

1950
01:43:56,672 --> 01:44:00,256
How many times do you rape people

1951
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:04,864
Don't point out that because what if North Korea does a thing

1952
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,656
A little curious always doing

1953
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,752
I swear to God I will

1954
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,520
This is going

1955
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:16,128
I'm not saying they're not a threat but I do I do think that this

1956
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:16,896
First of all

1957
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
J / 0 fantasy

1958
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:23,296
Play it's it's very scary and I don't think anyone wants this out

1959
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,576
It really sounds like

1960
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:25,856
What he does

1961
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:29,184
He wants because but if it's something

1962
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:32,512
Another notch on his belt of I told you

1963
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,352
Sure anytime a thing like that

1964
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,144
3000

1965
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,168
Yourself

1966
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,216
I still think

1967
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,288
This is going to be the same like

1968
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:47,616
Twenty years from now when we all have webbed

1969
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Feet and hands

1970
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:53,248
For saying this Korea is

1971
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,088
I think they're silly

1972
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:57,856
And I think

1973
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
Without

1974
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,440
Without China providing them food and

1975
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,976
Their dad

1976
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,536
But that's why they're also pointed to China

1977
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:08,608
Alright alright

1978
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,400
Alex

1979
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,984
Wait wait wait for expansion

1980
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
Have they met

1981
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
The movie War Games

1982
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:17,824
I think I was totally fine with

1983
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,504
Drone

1984
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:28,320
They did not

1985
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:32,416
Where the DU schabo rounds or basically meteor gun

1986
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:36,768
Doubt they're not Atomic they're not they're not hydrogen bombs or Tommy bumps

1987
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,584
They gun parts

1988
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:42,912
All the classified nature

1989
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,960
Orbitz

1990
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,776
Rock Crusher

1991
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,688
When I get there you're dead

1992
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
No holds

1993
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,808
Mountain Crest High School

1994
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,088
You do a mile under

1995
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:07,488
Nobody Shake

1996
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,680
Huge weapons platform

1997
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:22,080
Japanese amateur astronomers are always showing him floating bases

1998
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:22,848
Space Station

1999
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:25,920
Military bases

2000
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,456
Big platform

2001
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,760
With particle beams

2002
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,808
Like in the movie The Avengers

2003
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:41,536
Every few seconds

2004
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:43,328
That works

2005
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,680
He's describing like Star Wars

2006
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:54,848
None of that makes any sense even possible in 1979

2007
01:46:55,104 --> 01:47:01,248
It's all I could remember whenever we spent billions

2008
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,528
$2 not making

2009
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:06,112
Space-age

2010
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,672
Gun bullets

2011
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:10,720
Yeah but it would be traveling

2012
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,744
Very very fast

2013
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,816
Going to be hard to Target anything's

2014
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Okay

2015
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:29,408
Let's start with the theory of relativity

2016
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,760
Alright it's going to be sent

2017
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:34,528
Different discs

2018
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
The difference between

2019
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,344
Traveling in a different

2020
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,392
Rate of time then the other ship

2021
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:42,464
If you think you're actually going to hit anything with

2022
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,304
Any accuracy in Ephraim a made-up gun in

2023
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:48,608
States in 1979

2024
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,888
Your f******

2025
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,424
Ridiculous even now it's

2026
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:55,008
It's dubious 79

2027
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:55,776
Special

2028
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:01,408
No stupid go through the rest of this where Alex

2029
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
Light goes on

2030
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:02,944
Threatened

2031
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,712
The Chinese

2032
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:07,040
Great great glad glad to know he's ours.

2033
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,368
Under the BB guns

2034
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:13,184
Missiles are in come out of Russian

2035
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,720
I'll come out of China

2036
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:18,560
That Russia cruise missiles

2037
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,472
If North Korea moves

2038
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,992
Pacific Ocean in the Gulf of Mexico

2039
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:46,464
City Center's population

2040
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:49,792
He's describing essentially the worst tragedy that could ever

2041
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,560
Befall the world

2042
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:55,168
He's describing once the population dying

2043
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,216
Tomorrow is describing

2044
01:48:57,472 --> 01:49:01,824
War crimes is that

2045
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,360
If North Korea does

2046
01:49:03,872 --> 01:49:04,384
Anyting

2047
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,944
All of China

2048
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,784
A billion people will die

2049
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,064
All the city centers

2050
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,088
All of them

2051
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:16,160
Civilian

2052
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:21,280
Hold on

2053
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:24,096
I'm sorry

2054
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,168
Okay good

2055
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:35,104
Chinese leaders make jokes about how

2056
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,016
And by the way

2057
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:44,832
WonderWorks of China

2058
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
No Doubt

2059
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:51,232
Noah

2060
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,512
No we don't

2061
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:53,792
Because here's why

2062
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:57,376
We're not going to sit here while you launch missiles first

2063
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:02,752
No

2064
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:06,336
Not even a little bit

2065
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,712
Calling for One World Government

2066
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,952
Krazy Connie's

2067
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:23,488
So we got it

2068
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,048
Kill Everybody

2069
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,376
So that was one of the three scenarios that he's playing

2070
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,704
Total total human destruction

2071
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,776
The end of all human life is one of the scenarios

2072
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
To be thrilled about that

2073
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
The auto Bible

2074
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
Survival

2075
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,600

Your desk get the survival pack

2077
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,720
You will make it through a nuclear winter

2078
01:50:55,744 --> 01:51:01,888
You got all the freeze-dried food I could possibly need and also now

2079
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:03,424
You be very horny what with

2080
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:08,544
Destruction of all human beings are enough to get it up and repopulate the human race

2081
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:15,456
What's up Superman Vitality food

2082
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,760
Feel porosis at Indianola

2083
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,320
Bone pills

2084
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,904
Here's the visitors

2085
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:28,000
Scenarios

2086
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,048
Could actually

2087
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:34,656
And

2088
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,680
Easter me did

2089
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,264
Horrible family

2090
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:48,224
Stolen loot

2091
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:51,552
Stabilize the country

2092
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,136
China combats off now

2093
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:59,488
Yes

2094
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,280
And understand that

2095
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,144
You're not going to get

2096
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:15,616
And Chinese understand that traitors inside

2097
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,688
Nope shows how crazy this whole thing is

2098
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,576
Satellites

2099
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,952
That

2100
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:33,024
No idea what's going on

2101
01:52:33,536 --> 01:52:35,840
Or how huge the secret space program as

2102
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:38,400
And all the stuff that's been going on for a long time

2103
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:46,080
Just look the United States and Europe

2104
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:52,992
It's still frustrating kind of jerk off

2105
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,272
Is that

2106
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,296
Disgust

2107
01:52:55,552 --> 01:53:00,160
I've ever looked into how do you even say

2108
01:53:00,672 --> 01:53:04,768
We're not going to let you start a nuclear war cuz we're going to strike first

2109
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,144
We're going to start a nuclear war

2110
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,960
Again

2111
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:15,008
People who could be helped by humans

2112
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,152
Not okay no none of that is okay

2113
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:25,760
Even makes any sense

2114
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,296
Murdered

2115
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,320
Immediately

2116
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:31,904
Even if we agreed that the Chinese government

2117
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:34,208
Was our enemy agreed with that

2118
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:34,976
Which we do

2119
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,768
The idea of

2120
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:37,536
Killing

2121
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,584
People

2122
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,120
Is disgust

2123
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:47,264
Play that clip through because it's not

2124
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,568
We're not taking that out of context he's not

2125
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,104
He's not saying no

2126
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:53,152
He's not saying something that like

2127
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,968
He's openly advocating the murder of

2128
01:53:56,224 --> 01:54:01,344
Billions of the most likely scenario

2129
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,136
We're absolutely not

2130
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,440
It's horrifying

2131
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:10,816
It is something of a teachable situation now for the American people

2132
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
Citgo

2133
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
Like

2134
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,424
You shouldn't attack us

2135
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,216
Because our president and our

2136
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,264
Yeah

2137
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:23,616
Do you know how we've treated so many other countries

2138
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:29,760
Because their government is insane we're like oh well that's fine if we killed our people there people are the end

2139
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:35,392
Hopefully we will become

2140
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:38,976
We're all going to rightfully be like everything

2141
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:43,840
Oh I don't want that it's exactly like

2142
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:45,632
It's exactly like

2143
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,520
Is look at the point of view of somebody being invaded

2144
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:56,128
Wouldn't you be on their side isn't it all about you being like sheep

2145
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:58,688
These f****** invading us are bad

2146
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,224
Yeah don't think about that

2147
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,064
Maybe when you're invading somebody

2148
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:06,368
You're the bad guy

2149
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
You consider that

2150
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:11,744
Maybe you're the bad guy bad guy

2151
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,376
What are the bad guy a while back but we could pretend not now we are one hundred percent the bag

2152
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,912
Agreed

2153
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
I've ever looked into these

2154
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:23,008
Secret space program that Alex was talking about

2155
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:27,360
I highly recommend

2156
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:29,920
It's not even a regular space

2157
01:55:30,176 --> 01:55:32,224
I would love for us to if people donate to

2158
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,296
To the show and s*** I would love for us to do like a bonus episode

2159
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,832
About bike project

2160
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,648
Never heard of them

2161
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:47,328
King Arthur Galahad

2162
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:53,216
Guinevere the whole shebang this is lady who does like interviews with people who claim

2163
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984

Contact

2165
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,288
You like that

2166
01:55:56,544 --> 01:56:01,152
If you like anyone's name except for this guy named Andrew basiago

2167
01:56:02,432 --> 01:56:08,576
Cuz that's the name but then also because he claims that when he was younger he was in the

2168
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,600
The secret program that

2169
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,880
Involve time travel

2170
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:11,904
In Stargate

2171
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:14,720
And when he was younger he time traveled with

2172
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:15,488
Barack Obama

2173
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,536
There's all that

2174
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,656
Discover Secret

2175
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:27,008
And then we'll find out that it's a lot like that where that lady married at

2176
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:31,104
He also claims that he has like

2177
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,896
He's like a half dolphin Warriors

2178
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,432
Exactly no.

2179
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:38,528
Disprove I can't prove that like

2180
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:41,088
I know Jeanette

2181
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:44,160
I know that Alex thinks he has better sources

2182
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,720
But he doesn't

2183
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:49,280
These are the people who come forward

2184
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:53,632
Say like I was part of the secret space program we have time travel

2185
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:55,168
Technology if you listening

2186
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,984
Project Camelot interviews people for like

2187
01:56:58,240 --> 01:56:58,752
2 hours

2188
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,544
Because they are

2189
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,568
So

2190
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:02,592
What's the word

2191
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:03,872
Onboard

2192
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:07,712

The stories

2196
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,904
Sometimes yeah I think I believe

2197
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,672
The stories

2198
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,208
You know

2199
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,744
That's Festival

2200
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,560
What's what's the

2201
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,328
Between

2202
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,096
You need help

2203
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:25,376
And

2204
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,656
You actually

2205
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,680
Time traveled with

2206
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,984
Will the edges that didn't happen

2207
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:35,616
Help thing is

2208
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:38,176
If people didn't believe

2209
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:38,944
Based on

2210
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:40,992
Clearly insane peep

2211
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:44,576
Word that there was a program that involved

2212
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:45,344
In space

2213
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,624
Same time traveling

2214
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,648
Would you like that

2215
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:49,440
If you didn't believe them

2216
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:50,208
Then they wouldn't eat

2217
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:57,888
Moosehead like his fun fantasy if they were living that's fine maybe it's not the most gratifying

2218
01:57:58,912 --> 01:58:02,752
Winding up in a mental and

2219
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
Institution

Slightly popular alien base YouTube channel

Allied with the Muslim stuff

What April

2242
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,984
Unbelievable

2243
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:39,776
F******

2244
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,360
Also

2245
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:48,992
Markel space I don't know if there's anything more indicative of

2246
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:50,272
Of how we view Trump

2247
01:59:50,528 --> 01:59:52,320
Merkel's face video is

2248
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,344
So

2249
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:58,976
God comfortable

2250
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,024
F****** four-year-old

2251
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,816
Crying like a little b****

2252
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:04,096
The f****** press

2253
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:08,192
And Margo both being like you want to have a handshake

2254
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,472
I mean

2255
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:12,288
Now I'm doing funny Alex Jones

2256
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:13,312
Him being Trump

2257
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,360
In that Trump is a giant

2258
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,480
The face that she made are those picture

2259
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:23,040
Cuz you see if the face you made once Trump said

2260
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,880
You were wiretapped by Obama I guess that's

2261
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:27,904
Something we have in common

2262
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,976
With that face

2263
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,512
Your rage

2264
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,280
And hatred

2265
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:38,656
Even I know you're a f****** liar about that

2266
02:00:38,912 --> 02:00:39,680
You're lying

2267
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,728
I'm here standing next to

2268
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,008
Giving you some sort of

2269
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,544
Platform for

2270
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:47,104
Forest because the office

2271
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,128
To stand here

2272
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:49,408
A winner

2273
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:52,224
He could do such a reputable. Emage

2274
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,040
There are standing in the world

2275
02:00:58,880 --> 02:00:59,392
Treehouse

2276
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:02,976
Most of us voted for that

2277
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:05,280
Call Vision

2278
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,048
Good point

2279
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,400
A very up not even a plurality voted for that fox

2280
02:01:10,912 --> 02:01:14,240
Because the weird rules

2281
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,264
Now we have him

2282
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,360
We have one

2283
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:21,152
Extremely long clip we've got to go

2284
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,944
Okay I'll try not to shout it

2285
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,760
To skip one of these clips

2286
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,064
It's about how I laptop was stolen

2287
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:34,208
Secret Service Car blueprints for the Trump Tower

2288
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,792
Alex Pretend This is Obama's

2289
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
Of course

2290
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,120
The false flag

2291
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:45,728
He's like I got to go inside job on this one

2292
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:49,824
I looked into it and it turns out that every

2293
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,616
Computer is deeply into

2294
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,664
Cryptid so no one can get any information

2295
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,712
And

2296
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:59,040
And every laptop that is owned by the temperatures every

2297
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:00,320
Device that is open

2298
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:01,600
Can be wiped

2299
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:02,368
Remotely

2300
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:05,440
So if it is something that is in hand with a k

2301
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,720
Take it back they've already why

2302
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:13,888
I think they're the Secret Service they have contingency plan

2303
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:16,448
Hey bro yeah so that's a non-story

2304
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:21,312
Whoever stole it doesn't have the blueprints to Trump Tower

2305
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,664
And not aggressive

2306
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,480
I like it when those two things go together

2307
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,504
To the strong offense

2308
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:36,672
Why do you stare at me

2309
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,440
The clip is

2310
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:38,208
Just fun

2311
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:39,744
We already know that

2312
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:40,768
The conclusion of it

2313
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:41,536
But it is just

2314
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,072
And how biased

2315
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:44,352
Is about Trump

2316
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:03,040
And it hurts me

2317
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,560
Him to compromise or something just doesn't do it

2318
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:15,840
IMDb a rapist

2319
02:03:17,376 --> 02:03:19,424
And it doesn't shake merkel's better

2320
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,728
Doughboy

2321
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:22,752
Bubbly

2322
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:33,248
That's kind of the games 100% respect 100% I personally expect

2323
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:36,320
My leader to recognize that we live within a world

2324
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,880
In a world with differing

2325
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:39,648
Opinions

2326
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:45,792
Either we don't have control of other cultural ideas

2327
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:49,888
And that we have to find a way to live together there are cultural compromises

2328
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:50,656
The need to be made

2329
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,008
Kantime

2330
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:57,056
Four things that you're okay with tolerances

2331
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,080
Tolerate

2332
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,360
So like

2333
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:02,432
Whenever whatever you talk about tolerating North Korea

2334
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:04,992
Angelica I'm against Kim Jong

2335
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,832
Before

2336
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:16,000
I'm fine tolerating it as it situation wasn't halfway okay with Ken

2337
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:16,768
And that's

2338
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:18,816
Just cuz it's closed

2339
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,584
Yeah

2340
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,888
Yeah I bet like the best

2341
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,656
Tolerating

2342
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:24,960
Is it like I'm against this thing

2343
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,752
I accepted as a place in the world

2344
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,544
We're not able to really

2345
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:30,080
Solve the situation

2346
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:30,848
Without

2347
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,640
The nuclear war that Alex

2348
02:04:32,896 --> 02:04:34,944
Describe

2349
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,224
On the prefer.

2350
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:39,552
So we tolerate the situation as it is now

2351
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:42,624
Until such a time a better opportunity arises

2352
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:43,904
Fix

2353
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:47,744
Compromises about

2354
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
Placated Scituate

2355
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,352
People mad

2356
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,632
The Iran deal

2357
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,656
The nuclear Iran

2358
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:57,728
Where do I go

2359
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:58,752
Is there money

2360
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,288
It makes

2361
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:02,336
It makes so much sense

2362
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,640
Perfect

2363
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:06,688
Encapsulation of

2364
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,968
Here's the bad thing

2365
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,504
Here's another bad thing

2366
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,272
Here's another

2367
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,296
Here's a good thing

2368
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,600
Can't do that one either we're trying not to do all the bad

2369
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:15,136
Here's what we're going to do

2370
02:05:15,648 --> 02:05:16,160
The best

2371
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,696
Possible thing that we

2372
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,464
Can

2373
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,232
To get the best

2374
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,512
Possible outcome

2375
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:22,304
That we know of

2376
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,608
Yeah

2377
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:26,656
The thing about those outcomes

2378
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,496
Two people then

2379
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,264
Is

2380
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,288
Is regularly thought of

2381
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,336
Is how the law of energy

2382
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,152
Is not

2383
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:37,920
Bad

2384
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,456
In those situations like

2385
02:05:41,248 --> 02:05:41,760
Alright

2386
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:44,064
The unintended consequences of that

2387
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:44,832
Deal

2388
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,368
I really negligee

2389
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,904
Right

2390
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,184
There's the fear from

2391
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,744
Awesome the the fear from the right

2392
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,536
In the United States of life

2393
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,608
Whatever it is a sin

2394
02:05:56,864 --> 02:06:03,008
Yeah they're barking and they're going to destroy Israel

2395
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,032
Spalon like

2396
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:06,848
Holy war coming to kill us but

2397
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:10,176
But overall it's just everybody on the most part has been like

2398
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,200
It's probably good

2399
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:12,480
Is probably okay

2400
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:14,016
And nobody's gone crazy

2401
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:18,880
Go too far in either direction in that deal

2402
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:19,904
Everybody

2403
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:20,672
Fuct

2404
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:24,000
Each side legitimately get with their primary goal is

2405
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:24,768
We get

2406
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,048
Array

2407
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,328
You can't have nukes

2408
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:28,608
We got that

2409
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:30,912
They wanted

2410
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:33,984
The ability to create sustainable and

2411
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,008
Powerful energy

2412
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:39,360
Money that we stole from them back

2413
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,640
And they got those things

2414
02:06:44,224 --> 02:06:46,272
It's kind of like a prisoner's dilemma

2415
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:49,856
Situation solved everything

2416
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:53,952
If you want to look at through the prism of Game Theory

2417
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:56,256
Like maybe that's a negative one outcome

2418
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:57,280
Right

2419
02:06:57,792 --> 02:07:01,120
Probably

2420
02:07:01,376 --> 02:07:02,656
Plus one plus one out

2421
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:03,936
Listen

2422
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,984
Here's the argument I want to make

2423
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:09,312
I think it's possible to - 1 - 1 out come

2424
02:07:09,568 --> 02:07:12,384
If you look at it through the prism of people who

2425
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,408
Like

2426
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:14,944
They're running

2427
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:15,968
Who what

2428
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:20,576
This is the negative one outcome for that

2429
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:26,720
Just hear me out with them

2430
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:28,256
I don't want them to have any cake

2431
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:32,352
Or they just want us

2432
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,400
To impose our will on them to not

2433
02:07:35,168 --> 02:07:36,960
Right that's still a negative one outcome for them

2434
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:38,752
Now the reality is

2435
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:40,032
One of the other outcome

2436
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,824
Is out-and-out

2437
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:44,640
War MSI - 20 outcome for both of

2438
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:50,016
So negative a pretzel

2439
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,808
Critical

2440
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:54,112
But it's a super preferable

2441
02:07:54,368 --> 02:07:57,952
Scenario people don't realize that sometimes a slight loss is a huge win

2442
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:01,024
When we talked about this North Korea s***

2443
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:05,632
Here's to be as what I'm saying

2444
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:08,448
It's the same thing with putting up with North Korea

2445
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:09,984
It sucks

2446
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:13,056
The people there are living in the terrible conditions they are

2447
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:15,360
We should never turn a blind eye to the

2448
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:16,384
That we should never

2449
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:17,920
Make that okay

2450
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:18,688
But

2451
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,712
The outcome

2452
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:21,760
Of us fighting with them

2453
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,040
Is way worse

2454
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:25,344
It is way way worse

2455
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:26,624
To Kim Jeong Hoon

2456
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,928
Kim Jong-il as well before he died

2457
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:29,696
Had no,

2458
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,232
Talks about the idea of killing his uncle

2459
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
So

2460
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:36,096
They would not even with Siri

2461
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:42,496
The problem and Siri absolutely

2462
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:44,288
Political situation

2463
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:47,616
North Korea but because they're not such a preferable pronunciation

2464
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:49,664
Eritrea

2465
02:08:50,176 --> 02:08:54,784
Because they're not f****** at least they're not protected by China

2466
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:55,808
Nobody f****** gives

2467
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,880
Do all the stuff

2468
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,160
Yeah

2469
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:02,208
What we focus our energy on itworks

2470
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:05,280
Everybody

2471
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:09,632
Trying their best except for people who work for and with

2472
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:13,216
Like they're doing everything possible to screw everybody

2473
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:18,592
We got to get to this last for

2474
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:21,408
This last clip

2475
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,944
As long as

2476
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,736
But it's

2477
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:27,552
It's worth it cuz f***

2478
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:28,832
This to me

2479
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:30,880
Is a roller coaster ride

2480
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,416
That I could

2481
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:34,208
I was at 1.20 that

2482
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:36,512
Teacher College course about what's going on

2483
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:38,560
I guarantee I could be

2484
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:39,328
College course

2485
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,608
About this clip

2486
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,168
What should I cook

2487
02:09:43,424 --> 02:09:44,192
Are we going to

2488
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:47,520
I couldn't I couldn't but I can sum it up in one

2489
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:49,824
Directions to

2490
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:56,224
You want it you want to put them on the board

2491
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,504
Is this worth in in Guthrie

2492
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,272
I get three

2493
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:01,088
3 Strikes

2494
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,112
Just cuz I don't like

2495
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:06,720
Anyway this clips

2496
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,256
With Alex

2497
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:11,584
Still mad about Alec Baldwin

2498
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:20,800
You still mad about that and

2499
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:21,568
Complaining

2500
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:24,384
Then he gets interrupted by one of his producers

2501
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:27,456
And Chaos ensues interrupted

2502
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,480
Angela

2503
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,832
It's a madhouse

2504
02:10:33,088 --> 02:10:34,368
Okay great

2505
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:38,208
They're just all of the comments sections going

2506
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:41,024
Why does Alex Jones think blacks are humans

2507
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,816
NSYNC

2508
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,352
Watch your Superior

2509
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:46,656
Because Alec Baldwin

2510
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:54,592
By the way when he was last complaining about Saturday Night Live he was like they have a million viewers

2511
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,664
Because he wants to play the victim

2512
02:10:58,176 --> 02:11:00,480
Of course

2513
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:02,016
Well whenever it's

2514
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:04,576
Whenever it snows

2515
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,344
PeopleSoft

2516
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,624
Whenever I'm the victim

2517
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:09,952
People think that that doesn't count

2518
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:14,560
Dumb people

2519
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,680
I told Donald Trump

2520
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:23,520
And I did not

2521
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,056
We all know

2522
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,456
Do people believe it

2523
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:36,832
Something like that

2524
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:42,464
I wouldn't get up on air

2525
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:46,816
They paid me on all that money

2526
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,448
Serial rapist

2527
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:55,008
He just comes up with his own line

2528
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:56,032
He's very clearly

2529
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,848
I think I might have cut right at the wrong time

2530
02:11:59,360 --> 02:11:59,872
Hold on

2531
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:07,552
Hey Alex This is Nico popping in on are we were just giving him with a New York Times writer

2532
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:13,184
Progenitor

2533
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:18,304
We have the New York Times

2534
02:12:18,816 --> 02:12:22,912
January 20th on Inauguration when they said wiretap in the headline

2535
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:25,984
Plus it's admitting

2536
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:29,056
Wow next level at I just

2537
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:37,248
Are flashlight apps used against Trump

2538
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,344
This story is from the night

2539
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:42,624
But

2540
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:44,672
But what

2541
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:45,440
So

2542
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:46,976
So

2543
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:49,792
The producer comes on and he says

2544
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:51,072
The New York Times

2545
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:51,840
Just saying that

2546
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:52,864
Infowars

2547
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:53,632
Progenitor

2548
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:54,656
Of the

2549
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:55,424
The idea

2550
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,192
Yes

2551
02:12:57,984 --> 02:13:00,800
Tweeted all that stuff

2552
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:05,152
But they were saying that

2553
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:09,248
We're going to get you going to play it

2554
02:13:09,504 --> 02:13:10,016
And do some of his

2555
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,808
Trademark media criticism

2556
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:15,904
But right now it's next level because

2557
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:21,024
That the New York Times

2558
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,048
What he knows is

2559
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:23,328
The truth

2560
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:25,888
He's so dumb that he thinks he's being gassy

2561
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:30,752
Like he doesn't understand like earlier this is why I wanted to make a big point of that

2562
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:31,520
McDonald's

2563
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:33,312
You didn't read the article

2564
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:35,360
Course he just read the headline in

2565
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,128
I'm teed off on

2566
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,432
He didn't know what the context was

2567
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,992
He thought it was Obama's old guy game

2568
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:43,552
Mr. Gibbs

2569
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:45,600
Then he just created

2570
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:49,184
Entirely false narrative about the story when he started reading it on air he realized

2571
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:53,024
This is a situation where

2572
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,304
There is a headline

2573
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,328
On the March

2574
02:13:55,584 --> 02:13:56,864
January 19th

2575
02:13:57,120 --> 02:13:59,168
Issue of New York Times

2576
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:01,216
This goes back that far

2577
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:04,032
There was

2578
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,200
Play it out

2579
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,224
And try and figure out the

2580
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,040
The case and then I will come in like Hercule Poirot

2581
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:20,416
Do that

2582
02:14:22,464 --> 02:14:23,744
Belgium is proud

2583
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,024
I don't know if I'm

2584
02:14:36,544 --> 02:14:38,848
For the main hubs go through for the USA anyone

2585
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:42,688
We always use American

2586
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:49,088
Share the data that's how we get around to show call log

2587
02:14:57,792 --> 02:15:03,936
So at this point he's talking about the idea that the British spy on us and we spy on the British that quid-pro-quo thing we were

2588
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:04,704
Talked about earlier

2589
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:08,032
Is not true

2590
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:13,408
In this particular instance

2591
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,176
I mean

2592
02:15:14,944 --> 02:15:15,968
You do with the soda

2593
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:18,784
Revelations there the idea like

2594
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:21,088
Vnsa is not allowed to Spider-Man

2595
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,160
What they are allowed to do is

2596
02:15:24,416 --> 02:15:25,184
Spy on

2597
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:26,720
Foreign Communications

2598
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:29,792
And because sometimes those do come to Messick Lee

2599
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:32,864
They use that is like their gray area too dense

2600
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:34,400
You're already to nuance

2601
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:35,936
Good point

2602
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,960
Already

2603
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:41,824
The reason I paused it was I wanted to point out that he's talking about this like

2604
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:42,592
Spying

2605
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:46,176
Leica all that came out I was telling you that 20 years ago

2606
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,712
I didn't I didn't

2607
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:48,480
Cut anything

2608
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,016
This is exactly what he says

2609
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:50,784
Next

2610
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,576
Has nothing

2611
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:53,344
To do with what

2612
02:15:55,648 --> 02:16:01,792
SmartPay

2613
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:03,072
Super high

2614
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:06,144
Small ring around my route

2615
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,424
Machine gun

2616
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:09,728
Missiles are coming

2617
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:12,288
Hopkins patient preparing to

2618
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:21,504
You just sit there with those men

2619
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:25,600
He's got nothing to say about the actual intelligence

2620
02:16:25,856 --> 02:16:27,392
Stuff what

2621
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:30,464
Talking about exactly he's gone back to these space BB

2622
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:31,744
Because he hasn't

2623
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,888
Nothing of this article but he doesn't know

2624
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:38,912
In his heart

2625
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,704
What is head

2626
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,264
What the article was actually even about so he

2627
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,288
Can't discuss it

2628
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:48,128
What what is even talking about

2629
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:52,224
Do you just desperately grabbing for whatever piece of information was fresh in his mind

2630
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:58,624
Yeah because he was talking about the North Korea stuff earlier all of this was revealed

2631
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,904
1990 whatever

2632
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:06,304
All this stuff or not found in there

2633
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,072
Matter at hand

2634
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:10,912
Rat desperately waiting for one of these dudes just talking to his hearing

2635
02:17:12,192 --> 02:17:12,704
That's 100

2636
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:13,728
What's going on

2637
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:21,152
It doesn't lose any of his fortune and

2638
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:27,296
That wasn't my opinion

2639
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:30,880
That's a fact because

2640
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:38,048
George Lopez everywhere else that job

2641
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,936
At that point someone had talked into his ear

2642
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:48,800
Is like okay I've got a couple more detail to what's going on

2643
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:51,872
And that he gets it from us

2644
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:54,688
World

2645
02:17:58,784 --> 02:17:59,296
Listen

2646
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:03,136
We do a show where we were now it over 2 hours

2647
02:18:03,392 --> 02:18:04,416
Was talking about Alex Jones

2648
02:18:04,672 --> 02:18:05,696
And all of this

2649
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,464
Has been like

2650
02:18:07,744 --> 02:18:08,768
So I don't need

2651
02:18:09,536 --> 02:18:10,816
I don't need to make stuff up to

2652
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:11,584
Discredit you

2653
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:14,400
You are just a liar

2654
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:16,192
The all this is wise

2655
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:21,568
Every single person you have as a guest on your show

2656
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:24,384
The only thing that's true

2657
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,664
So far

2658
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:26,688
Is this

2659
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:27,456
Keyblade

2660
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:31,552
Probably with no proof it's not digital

2661
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:35,392
No no he is giving it out to people he's the guy on the street going up next

2662
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,952
That's fine good on cable

2663
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:43,072
It's soaked but also let's be super fair to Alex North Korea isn't cool

2664
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,120
North Liberty

2665
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:49,728
Hazel mixed in with the untrue Things Are

2666
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:51,008
That we should nuke them

2667
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:51,776
Anyway

2668
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:55,872
Things are nuclear destruction

2669
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:58,176
He saw the bunch of other b******* and then he gets

2670
02:18:58,432 --> 02:18:59,712
To this clip

2671
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:00,992
Our gets back

2672
02:19:01,248 --> 02:19:03,552
To really spend those wheels for a while they tried a lie

2673
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,856
In the information

2674
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:08,672
And then now we're back with the legit

2675
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:09,952
Media criticism

2676
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:11,232
Some of the CNN clip

2677
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:13,536
The producer got in his hearing was talking about

2678
02:19:13,792 --> 02:19:19,424
Call this segment media criticism when you can't read

2679
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:25,056
North Korea threaten the new Pandora

2680
02:19:27,616 --> 02:19:28,128
It's that

2681
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:30,688
Trump

2682
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,480
Has apologized

2683
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:37,344
They just said look okay with her steps

2684
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:39,392
So this is big

2685
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:40,672
Intercept

2686
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:42,720
This is his big gotcha moment

2687
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:43,744
Is that like

2688
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:50,144
Do it supposed to be different

2689
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:52,704
Said the wrong word

2690
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,472
I'm lying

2691
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:54,496
At my f******

2692
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:58,592
Airplane games of semantics

2693
02:19:58,848 --> 02:20:01,152
Everything's fine

2694
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:07,296
What you can't deny what three up

2695
02:20:13,184 --> 02:20:16,512
The reason it wasn't more successful is that when people

2696
02:20:16,768 --> 02:20:19,328
Poured over the Vault 7 stuff

2697
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,656
Who was only ideas

2698
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:28,800
Some techniques that could be used there was no evidence that they actually did use them most of the things that were the most salacious

2699
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:31,872
Things like your TV is spying on you also

2700
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:32,640
Included

2701
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:35,200
That you needed to put a USB stick

2702
02:20:35,456 --> 02:20:41,600
Into the computer in order to use as a spy device

2703
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:42,624
You saw it

2704
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:44,928
Rolex

2705
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:53,376
Do I have Showtime is that what's going on I recognize that I'm quoting John Oliver but I did also look at

2706
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:56,960
Confirm this is unplugged

2707
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:00,032
Oh s*** that's the way to get around that

2708
02:21:00,288 --> 02:21:01,568
No so they

2709
02:21:01,824 --> 02:21:03,872
So

2710
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:06,688
If it weren't for you damn kids

2711
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:10,784
Alex is so sad about this guy who he wants called Hillary's butt plug

2712
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:14,368
Being his vault 7 release not being effective

2713
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:15,648
Because there wasn't allowed in

2714
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:17,184
Information in there that really matter

2715
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:19,488
No there was no smoking gun

2716
02:21:19,744 --> 02:21:23,072
There was no proof that anything actually happened there was just

2717
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:24,352
I work around

2718
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,424
Right up but

2719
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,704
It's not that big a deal

2720
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:30,752
Lot of it was already published

2721
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:32,032
A lot of this stuff

2722
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,824
Seems like

2723
02:21:35,104 --> 02:21:37,152
It seemed like a lot of what was lead

2724
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:39,456
Is the same thing if you were

2725
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:40,480
Comedy writer

2726
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:44,832
And you are in the writers room for for like a show like

2727
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:49,184
If you leaked all of their writers notes yutzy's a bunch of s***

2728
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:50,208
Well that's

2729
02:21:50,464 --> 02:21:50,976
Terrible joke

2730
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:53,280
That's the whole thing like

2731
02:21:56,352 --> 02:22:00,192
It's just a bunch of guys in a writers room throwing s*** at the wall hoping for the best

2732
02:22:02,496 --> 02:22:03,008
Weather

2733
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:04,288
Papago

2734
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,312
7

2735
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:07,104
Thousand thousands of pages

2736
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:11,712
Admissions of how they're sabotaging

2737
02:22:12,480 --> 02:22:14,528
Appliances

2738
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,320
Tracking listening and watching us

2739
02:22:27,328 --> 02:22:30,144
Underlust they listed all his calls with foreign governments

2740
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:32,448
If it's just

2741
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:39,104
Sphere

2742
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:47,040
And say the present was being listened to

2743
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:56,256
Really getting intimidating

2744
02:22:57,024 --> 02:22:59,584
Trump

2745
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:02,144
The rest of the ministration

2746
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:03,424
You ain't a crook son

2747
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,960
You just a shook one

2748
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:08,800
Mobb Deep motherfukers

2749
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:17,248
Boys club on a few people the country needs to grow testicles

2750
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:20,064
Frozen testicles

2751
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:25,952
3rd person

2752
02:23:26,208 --> 02:23:27,744
This latest Fiasco got launched

2753
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:33,632
And I pulled up washing post La time

2754
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:42,848
Intercept we got the surveillance

2755
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:43,872
Transcription

2756
02:23:44,128 --> 02:23:46,432
Bunch of trump

2757
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:50,272
Months later they don't release it they go

2758
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:56,160
Times again

2759
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:10,240
Intercepts

2760
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:12,544
At this point he's

2761
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,616
Splashing up this New York Times headline

2762
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:20,736
Two I can invest

2763
02:24:20,992 --> 02:24:22,016
Navigation of trump

2764
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:24,576
Even the headline

2765
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:27,392
Has nothing to do with Trump being wired

2766
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:29,440
Has everything to do with

2767
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,208
Specifically

2768
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:30,976
Carter page

2769
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:32,768
Paul manafort

2770
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:33,536
And Rodgers.

2771
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:34,304
Those guys

2772
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,352
Now if you read the actual article that

2773
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:37,632
Attached to that headline

2774
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:38,912
I can't imagine why

2775
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:41,216
Specifically lays out this

2776
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:44,544
We have no indication that this has anything to do with Trump

2777
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,360
Also even in the article to be superfair they say

2778
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,432
There's no indication that this has anything to do with the Trump campaign

2779
02:24:50,688 --> 02:24:54,528
They just say that these communications between

2780
02:24:54,784 --> 02:24:55,296
These Trump

2781
02:24:55,552 --> 02:24:56,064
Surrogate

2782
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:57,600
Had been intercepted

2783
02:24:58,112 --> 02:24:59,648
They don't say

2784
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:01,952
Probably through

2785
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,744
Yep probably

2786
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,024
Threw interceptions

2787
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:06,560
Of

2788
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:07,840
Foreign

2789
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:09,888
Legitimate looks like

2790
02:25:10,144 --> 02:25:11,936
You can't get a bicycle

2791
02:25:16,032 --> 02:25:18,592
You can't get them to sign off on a warrant unless

2792
02:25:18,848 --> 02:25:19,872
The person in question

2793
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:21,408
Is suspected of being a foreigner

2794
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:23,712
Well Anna Gunn

2795
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:24,480
That

2796
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:25,760
Like

2797
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:28,832
Paper wallpaper

2798
02:25:29,088 --> 02:25:30,624
Since the fisa court has been

2799
02:25:30,880 --> 02:25:32,416
So the fact that they said that

2800
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:35,232
A multiple warrants were denied through the fire

2801
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:37,280
The court should be the biggest

2802
02:25:37,536 --> 02:25:38,048
Like

2803
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:39,584
Oh maybe there's nothing

2804
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:42,912
It's because the fisa court is a rubber stamp Court

2805
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:47,520
Those denials probably amount

2806
02:25:47,776 --> 02:25:48,800
Total of

2807
02:25:49,824 --> 02:25:54,944
The 10 total Visa is denied

2808
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:57,248
Impossible for the fisa court to

2809
02:25:57,504 --> 02:25:58,016
Deny something

2810
02:25:58,528 --> 02:26:00,832
That it had two of either been something that

2811
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:01,856
Should be hidden

2812
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,392
For that had

2813
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:08,256
Alright but then agree after to denials that also

2814
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:13,376
Only something there is well because if the third one was just as flimsy

2815
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:14,912
And they would have had jumped

2816
02:26:15,168 --> 02:26:15,936
Does easy time

2817
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:17,216
Saying no

2818
02:26:17,728 --> 02:26:19,520
The third time obviously there was something

2819
02:26:19,776 --> 02:26:20,288
It is

2820
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:26,688
I love it when Alex Jones live

2821
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:30,016
And this is his belligerent ass

2822
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:39,744
Don't want to have a show

2823
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:43,840
They don't want

2824
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,424
If the facts

2825
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,216
Is Armani

2826
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:56,896
That's why we are now an enemy number

2827
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:57,920
It is not weather

2828
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,200
No and

2829
02:26:59,456 --> 02:27:00,992
It's just again

2830
02:27:01,504 --> 02:27:07,648
Look back at that McDonald's story when he's complaining about the Evelyn thing these fake news while lying about a story he's talking about

2831
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:08,928
This is just such

2832
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:09,696
Juicy

2833
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:10,464
Like

2834
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:14,048
It just that that's why they hate me cuz I have a memory

2835
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:15,328
4 things that aren't true

2836
02:27:15,584 --> 02:27:18,400
It's like I remember all this b******* I said

2837
02:27:18,656 --> 02:27:23,008
You're teasing this too much we got to get into this man I got it I got to hear this b*******

2838
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,824
MCI officer

2839
02:27:26,592 --> 02:27:29,408
And one of the richest man in America

2840
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:32,736
These operators and Cooper I just want to be clear he interned at the

2841
02:27:32,992 --> 02:27:39,136
The CIA has not one of the richest

2842
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:39,904
Vanderbilt

2843
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:46,304
No f****** way you stupid at least a hundred million dollars

2844
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:55,776
Other people need work

2845
02:27:56,032 --> 02:27:57,312
One thing it's Admiral

2846
02:27:57,568 --> 02:27:58,080
About him

2847
02:27:58,336 --> 02:27:59,360
I think is that

2848
02:27:59,872 --> 02:28:00,640
He could have

2849
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:02,688
Just done that and instead he had a calling

2850
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:03,968
To do something else

2851
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,992
So he

2852
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:10,368
Wait

2853
02:28:11,136 --> 02:28:14,208
Ya know those Mark Wahlberg he hosted the celebrity male

2854
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:18,048
Alright

2855
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:23,680
Now I'm back on this side of the world

2856
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:25,728
Waging War against America

2857
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,080
Myself and my family

2858
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:32,896
You makeup

2859
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:36,736
The White House

2860
02:28:42,112 --> 02:28:44,672
And more of a

2861
02:28:46,464 --> 02:28:52,608
You know what eating grin he used to look on that New York

2862
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:07,456
Whoops whoops

2863
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,480
Also

2864
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:09,504
Effeminate

2865
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:11,296
He's got to be CIA

2866
02:29:11,552 --> 02:29:13,856
Arrogant

2867
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:14,880
Herobrine look

2868
02:29:15,392 --> 02:29:15,904
Real

2869
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:16,928
And I would

2870
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:19,232
He looks fine

2871
02:29:19,744 --> 02:29:20,256
I don't know

2872
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:21,792
Wake me up purse

2873
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:25,120
I'm Yul Brynner and I'm playing the part of Cairo

2874
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:27,680
New film coming out by Cecil B DeMille

2875
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:29,472
He's doing this because the guy

2876
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:30,240
Is bald

2877
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:32,800
They just launched into Yul Brynner impression

2878
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,360
That's it that's all that's going on here

2879
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:36,384
And it goes on

2880
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:37,152
For quite a while

2881
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:38,432
Enjoy

2882
02:29:42,784 --> 02:29:43,552
Charlton Heston

2883
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:47,392
And whatever you do

2884
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:48,672
Don't smoke

2885
02:29:49,440 --> 02:29:50,208
I'm your brother

2886
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:50,976
W2

2887
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,768
Country

2888
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,816
Who is this ding dong

2889
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:01,984
Weirdos they dug up come on

2890
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:04,544
Pansy around Anderson Cooper

2891
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:09,152
The White House fighting your article

2892
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:10,176
As part of the oven

2893
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,992
I mean

2894
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:21,440
Rodeo

2895
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,312
So again

2896
02:30:37,568 --> 02:30:39,104
Just let's let's marinate them

2897
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:42,688
I wanted to wait until the end to really explain

2898
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:44,224
It was full of s***

2899
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:46,272
But I think it might be more fun

2900
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:52,928
We've got a lot more specific

2901
02:30:54,464 --> 02:30:57,280
Like this guy wrote the article in the New York

2902
02:30:58,560 --> 02:30:59,072
He's a writer

2903
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,352
And he's going on

2904
02:31:01,632 --> 02:31:04,448
And the reason that he's discussing this

2905
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:05,216
Is

2906
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:06,240
His possession

2907
02:31:07,008 --> 02:31:08,544
Which I happen to agree with a hunter

2908
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:10,592
Is that

2909
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:12,128
You wrote this article

2910
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:13,664
About how there were intercept

2911
02:31:14,432 --> 02:31:15,712
Related to Trump AIDS

2912
02:31:16,224 --> 02:31:17,248
Again manafort

2913
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:18,016
Pavestone

2914
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:19,296
These

2915
02:31:20,320 --> 02:31:23,392
Trump has cited that article repeatedly an interview

2916
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,928
And in those three

2917
02:31:25,440 --> 02:31:27,232
As evidence that Obama

2918
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:29,024
Wanted to wiretap

2919
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,304
Tower

2920
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:33,632
Did not happen.

2921
02:31:33,888 --> 02:31:37,984
100% of any one of those words

2922
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,264
And then apply them

2923
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,288
None of them are true

2924
02:31:40,544 --> 02:31:44,896
Can you use the fact that the New York Times use the word wiretap in there

2925
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:46,176
As evidence

2926
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:47,968
That that's what he was talking about

2927
02:31:50,016 --> 02:31:52,576
Goes back to Alec not reading

2928
02:31:52,832 --> 02:31:53,344
Stories

2929
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,392
The only reads the headlines

2930
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:57,440
Scams

2931
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:02,048
So mad that he knows what's going on

2932
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,840
Know what the article a

2933
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:04,864
Actually says

2934
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:06,656
If you read it it would have said

2935
02:32:06,912 --> 02:32:09,472
This might not have anything to do with Trump himself

2936
02:32:09,984 --> 02:32:12,288
It might not have anything to do with the

2937
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:19,456
Alternate universe where would we live in if Alex Jones actual

2938
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:21,760
Thoughtful Alex Jones

2939
02:32:22,016 --> 02:32:28,160
Will it be a better world would be a better world

2940
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:32,768
Take his place there's always going to have you considered that The Wheel of Time

2941
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:33,536
Yeah

2942
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:35,584
We were testing

2943
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:41,216
Come to fight forever me and Alex Jones the destined to fight forever

2944
02:32:41,472 --> 02:32:47,616
Ben Alex Jones are basically like Sami Zayn and Kevin Owens that's a wrestling reference for a minor

2945
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:48,896
Sam's

2946
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:50,432
But the point is

2947
02:32:50,944 --> 02:32:52,992
This guy Alex doesn't let him really

2948
02:32:53,504 --> 02:32:54,272
To the point we can

2949
02:32:54,528 --> 02:32:55,040
Get this out

2950
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:56,576
But his argument is that

2951
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:57,856
We wrote this story

2952
02:32:58,368 --> 02:32:59,392
And then right-wing blogs

2953
02:32:59,648 --> 02:33:00,160
Picked it up

2954
02:33:00,928 --> 02:33:01,952
The president reference

2955
02:33:02,208 --> 02:33:03,232
It as evidence

2956
02:33:04,256 --> 02:33:04,768
Without

2957
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:05,792
Engaging with what

2958
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:06,560
The story actually

2959
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:08,608
Which is the hundred percent

2960
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:10,144
And it's Alex's Emma

2961
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:12,960
So he actually says Infowars

2962
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:14,752
Which is what sets Alex off

2963
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:17,056
On a f****** tizzy but

2964
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:18,592
His argument is right

2965
02:33:18,848 --> 02:33:19,616
This Matt Rosen

2966
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:21,408
He's totally right

2967
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:22,944
That is what happened

2968
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,480
They wrote this article

2969
02:33:24,736 --> 02:33:26,272
Infowars wrote an article

2970
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:27,808
Lying about what their article

2971
02:33:28,064 --> 02:33:28,576
Go said

2972
02:33:28,832 --> 02:33:30,112
Trump responded to that

2973
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:32,672
And then now we're here

2974
02:33:34,720 --> 02:33:35,232
Yes

2975
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:37,024
And that's where you went wrong

2976
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:37,792
Absolutely

2977
02:33:38,048 --> 02:33:40,864
I realize there were

2978
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:44,192
But now that we know the

2979
02:33:44,448 --> 02:33:45,216
The full picture

2980
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:46,752
Let's enjoy just

2981
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:48,544
Marinating and Alex being

2982
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:50,080
So sure he's right

2983
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,104
When if you watch this

2984
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:51,872
Instagram clip

2985
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:53,408
Roof adhesive

2986
02:33:53,664 --> 02:33:54,176

Based on what we know what he thinks the news is

3043
02:37:59,424 --> 02:38:00,960
It could include Breitbart

3044
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:02,496

3045
02:38:02,752 --> 02:38:04,288

None of those articles are

3050
02:38:12,736 --> 02:38:13,248
They don't

3051
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,272
Follow journalistic

3052
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:17,088

Yeah it was like

3073
02:38:58,560 --> 02:39:00,608
On the front page of Google it was

3074
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:01,888
The blogs

3075
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:03,168
Really

3076
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:04,704
Dumb kids

3077
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:07,520
Unpatriotic to wear

3078
02:39:07,776 --> 02:39:08,800
American flag colors

3079
02:39:09,568 --> 02:39:11,104
With our knowledge

3080
02:39:11,360 --> 02:39:12,640
The Cambridge

3081
02:39:12,896 --> 02:39:13,408
Analytical

3082
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:15,200
Great question

3083
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:16,480
I would have the

3084
02:39:16,736 --> 02:39:17,248
The same

3085
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:18,016
Google search

3086
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:27,232
You have those because you're at work

3087
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:29,024
Which is interesting like what

3088
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,840
So so their whole thing is that

3089
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:32,864
They can

3090
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:36,192
Looking at like by analyzing the number of

3091
02:39:36,960 --> 02:39:37,472
That you like on

3092
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:39,776
How many searches and all that

3093
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:41,568
Like what

3094
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,848
They think of you

3095
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:44,896
With your researching

3096
02:39:45,152 --> 02:39:49,760
The insanity likes only Orange

3097
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:50,528
It's just

3098
02:39:50,784 --> 02:39:53,088
Cambridge analytica must look at you and be like

3099
02:39:56,672 --> 02:39:58,976
A lot of pornography

3100
02:39:59,744 --> 02:40:03,072
Which is the same thing listen to Boz Scaggs

3101
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:05,120
Avril Lavigne

3102
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:06,400
Lana Del Rey

3103
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:09,984
Write confusing a lot of old Steely Dan

3104
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:12,032
Yeah they've got to be I'm a riddle too

3105
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:18,688
This kid is depressed

3106
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:26,368
The catch Russian just last year

3107
02:40:28,160 --> 02:40:34,304
They were on the news

3108
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:48,640
Thousand

3109
02:41:02,464 --> 02:41:04,768
The thing is it get exhausting when you're lying

3110
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:06,560
You know

3111
02:41:06,816 --> 02:41:08,864
This isn't that hard for me

3112
02:41:10,144 --> 02:41:11,168
I'm just saying that

3113
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:14,496
Made me think like we're if Infowars

3114
02:41:15,008 --> 02:41:15,776
Was honest

3115
02:41:16,032 --> 02:41:22,176
Like all the things that he says he's doing is basically what you do

3116
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:31,648
Take spoken word poetry about.

3117
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:36,000
You can't have a play-by-play with color

3118
02:41:38,304 --> 02:41:42,656
You're doing the job that Alex Jones says he's

3119
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:43,680
And

3120
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:44,704
Weirdly enough

3121
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,752
Turn

3122
02:41:47,776 --> 02:41:49,056
He's not doing that job

3123
02:41:49,312 --> 02:41:51,104
He has millions of dollars

3124
02:41:51,616 --> 02:41:52,640
I have 925

3125
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:54,432
I have

3126
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:59,808
Rat with reality shirt

3127
02:42:00,064 --> 02:42:02,112
Coronavirus

3128
02:42:02,368 --> 02:42:03,136
Three months

3129
02:42:03,392 --> 02:42:04,160
It's not that but

3130
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:10,048
Only president for so long I've forgotten my own

3131
02:42:10,560 --> 02:42:13,376
Restart the show before the inauguration

3132
02:42:13,632 --> 02:42:16,704
Feels like 7,000

3133
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:17,984
I know it does but

3134
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:22,336
My parents don't believe the Earth has been around as long as I feel like

3135
02:42:23,360 --> 02:42:23,872
Totally

3136
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:28,224
But look that the reality is he's complaining about we don't have enough human intelligence

3137
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:28,992
Qmap

3138
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:31,552
We don't have enough weed eater we need more help

3139
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:34,368
We need more help to get all this stuff cuz there's so many lies

3140
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:35,392
It's like

3141
02:42:36,416 --> 02:42:40,000
I can do this on my I can bat you down on my own

3142
02:42:41,536 --> 02:42:44,608
I don't need a team all I need is my friend over here laughing

3143
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:46,656
And bring it over wine sometimes yet

3144
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:48,960
And I was just having a good time

3145
02:42:49,472 --> 02:42:50,496
Uno

3146
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:51,520
Listen

3147
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:54,848
Hey

3148
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:56,640
That was not throwing shade

3149
02:42:56,896 --> 02:43:01,248
That was not

3150
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:04,576
The one that's obsessed

3151
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:09,440
It's pathetic

3152
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:10,720
An operation

3153
02:43:10,976 --> 02:43:12,512
Worth millions of dollars with

3154
02:43:13,536 --> 02:43:16,096
Can't f****** get his s*** together to know what he's talking about

3155
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:18,656
When the information is all right in front of him

3156
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:20,192
Apathetic

3157
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:21,472
It means you like

3158
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:25,312
Keep going back

3159
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:28,640
It is within his self-interest

3160
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:29,920
To not tell the

3161
02:43:30,688 --> 02:43:31,200
Yes

3162
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:32,992
But at the same time

3163
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:35,808
He seemed so convinced of the lies that he's

3164
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:39,648
Just a weird like

3165
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:40,416
What are those

3166
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:43,488
Coincidences of

3167
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:45,024
Knixwear

3168
02:43:45,280 --> 02:43:46,560
Somehow we have a man

3169
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,864
Who's naked ignorant

3170
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:50,144
Somehow

3171
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:51,168
Coincides

3172
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:52,448
With his naked selfie

3173
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:56,032
Well you know how one of the features of

3174
02:43:56,288 --> 02:43:58,336
Schizophrenia is often you can hold

3175
02:43:58,592 --> 02:43:59,872
Belief that can't logic

3176
02:44:02,944 --> 02:44:04,224
I'm not saying that actions

3177
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:06,016
I'm not I'm not diagnosed

3178
02:44:06,784 --> 02:44:07,808
That is what

3179
02:44:09,088 --> 02:44:11,392
Haha

3180
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:15,744
So you can have this belief in your head

3181
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,048
That you've worked yourself into and no matter what

3182
02:44:18,304 --> 02:44:18,816
Someone

3183
02:44:20,096 --> 02:44:21,120
Basically your response

3184
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:22,656
Rationalize it

3185
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:23,680
Use their

3186
02:44:25,984 --> 02:44:28,544
Whatever it is called

3187
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:31,360
Flavor

3188
02:44:31,616 --> 02:44:35,456
Yeah I think it's possible that Alex Jones has some

3189
02:44:35,712 --> 02:44:36,224
Schizoid 10

3190
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:39,040
And when he was younger he came van

3191
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:40,064
This idea

3192
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:41,344
Of the global

3193
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:43,136
The reading that book

3194
02:44:43,392 --> 02:44:44,160
None dare call it

3195
02:44:44,928 --> 02:44:46,720
And it's stuck with him

3196
02:44:47,232 --> 02:44:47,744
The point where

3197
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:48,512
Now

3198
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:51,072
3540 years later

3199
02:44:51,840 --> 02:44:52,608
Can't not below

3200
02:44:53,888 --> 02:44:54,912
So all of this stuff

3201
02:44:55,168 --> 02:44:56,448
He's just Incorporated whatever

3202
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:58,752
Whenever anyone needs built

3203
02:44:59,520 --> 02:45:00,032
Tire like

3204
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:00,800
Lifeline

3205
02:45:01,312 --> 02:45:02,336
Yeah

3206
02:45:04,128 --> 02:45:05,920
Even if he does

3207
02:45:09,504 --> 02:45:10,016
If

3208
02:45:10,272 --> 02:45:10,784
Allows

3209
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:11,808
1

3210
02:45:12,576 --> 02:45:13,600
Tiny crack

3211
02:45:14,368 --> 02:45:14,880
To form

3212
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:16,160
The whole thing

3213
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:17,440
Comes comes comes comes

3214
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:23,328
Realize that there are no glow up

3215
02:45:23,584 --> 02:45:24,864
Zorbing

3216
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:27,680
Like

3217
02:45:28,192 --> 02:45:28,960
Write everyday

3218
02:45:29,216 --> 02:45:30,240
But if

3219
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:32,800
1 time like we've never heard him

3220
02:45:33,056 --> 02:45:33,568
Admit

3221
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:34,336
Said he's wrong

3222
02:45:34,592 --> 02:45:40,736
No. There's actually even when he was wrong he was also right

3223
02:45:40,992 --> 02:45:43,040
I didn't pull this clip because it was

3224
02:45:43,552 --> 02:45:44,576
The relevant but

3225
02:45:44,832 --> 02:45:47,648
On the Thursday show he was complaining about

3226
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:49,440
John McCain

3227
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:51,488
Saying that Rand Paul was working

3228
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:52,256
A Putin

3229
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:56,864
And he was like

3230
02:45:57,376 --> 02:45:59,936
He was relating it all to Ukraine

3231
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:04,031
He saying that McCain wants to go and have war with Russia

3232
02:46:04,287 --> 02:46:07,103
And that's why he's mad Rand Paul standing there

3233
02:46:07,359 --> 02:46:09,151
Contesting his motion

3234
02:46:09,407 --> 02:46:10,943
That was about Montenegro

3235
02:46:11,455 --> 02:46:12,223
That wasn't about

3236
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:14,783
Ukraine do that wasn't about that at all

3237
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:17,343
The entire time

3238
02:46:17,855 --> 02:46:18,879
So now

3239
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:20,415
On the next episode

3240
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:22,975
Admitted that he was wrong at the idea wrong

3241
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:24,511
Here's the twist

3242
02:46:25,791 --> 02:46:26,815
He brings it back up

3243
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:28,863
And he's like I got I got a couple things

3244
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:29,631
Conflated that way

3245
02:46:29,887 --> 02:46:31,167
Was about Montenegro but it's

3246
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:32,447
Oh

3247
02:46:32,703 --> 02:46:38,335
So

3248
02:46:38,591 --> 02:46:40,127
Yaga

3249
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:44,223
Realistically

3250
02:46:44,479 --> 02:46:46,271
Yeah I believe

3251
02:46:47,295 --> 02:46:48,319
I don't know it's so hard

3252
02:46:49,855 --> 02:46:51,391
In terms of what I think about what he

3253
02:46:52,671 --> 02:46:53,183
But if you

3254
02:46:53,695 --> 02:46:56,511
If you look at it as a 40-year mental illness

3255
02:46:57,023 --> 02:47:03,167
About the globalist you notice you look at it like that

3256
02:47:03,423 --> 02:47:09,567
Hazing movie with Judd Apatow called the 40-year mentalism

3257
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:12,895
But everything falls into place all of the

3258
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:15,967
Conspiracy theory s*** all the reasons why he's joining up

3259
02:47:16,223 --> 02:47:16,991
With Trump now what

3260
02:47:18,527 --> 02:47:20,575
All of the fear about in Armageddon

3261
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:22,111
How's the weather

3262
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:23,903
He can rationalize that

3263
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:26,975
No I'm not a snake oil salesman I'm really trying to help

3264
02:47:27,231 --> 02:47:29,023
If he actually has convinced

3265
02:47:31,839 --> 02:47:32,863
To be that

3266
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:35,679
Go home at night

3267
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:36,703
Sleep

3268
02:47:36,959 --> 02:47:37,983
Like a human being

3269
02:47:38,495 --> 02:47:39,519
He has to believe

3270
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:41,567
Will the flip side of it is like

3271
02:47:43,103 --> 02:47:44,895
If you have people around him

3272
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:45,663
Convince

3273
02:47:46,687 --> 02:47:47,199
That is

3274
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:48,991
That's like a very

3275
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:50,527
Your Christ syndrome

3276
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:52,831
Yeah it

3277
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:56,671
The real corollary to look back on

3278
02:47:57,439 --> 02:47:57,951
Historically

3279
02:47:59,231 --> 02:47:59,743
Cult leader

3280
02:48:02,815 --> 02:48:04,607
Actually believed

3281
02:48:05,119 --> 02:48:06,911
I would say

3282
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:07,679
Minoriti

3283
02:48:11,775 --> 02:48:16,383
Like

3284
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:20,991
I think a lot of them knew what they were doing

3285
02:48:21,503 --> 02:48:23,039
Right on study Jim Jones

3286
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:24,831
In particular

3287
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:31,231
So I can use him as an example l.ron Hubbard

3288
02:48:31,487 --> 02:48:32,767
Like a

3289
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:34,559
Who's the Mormon talk Joseph

3290
02:48:35,839 --> 02:48:38,399
And then come up with the most normal name ever

3291
02:48:38,655 --> 02:48:43,519
Well I remember because I was

3292
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:49,919
Like Joseph Smith may have just been a f****** lunatic who is Brigham Young was like the Paul is more still one who

3293
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:50,943
Went

3294
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,223
The town on that ship

3295
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:56,319
What about Brigham Young on this

3296
02:48:56,575 --> 02:48:58,623
This clip

3297
02:48:58,879 --> 02:48:59,647
Open surveillance

3298
02:49:03,487 --> 02:49:05,279
0 Segway

3299
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:16,799
In the circular reasoning

3300
02:49:17,055 --> 02:49:18,079
President Trump says it

3301
02:49:23,455 --> 02:49:24,479
You better

3302
02:49:24,991 --> 02:49:26,783
But that's because you're only engaging with the head

3303
02:49:27,295 --> 02:49:28,319
That's the problem

3304
02:49:29,855 --> 02:49:30,367
Consistent prob

3305
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:36,767
I say you say I say

3306
02:49:37,023 --> 02:49:37,535
God say

3307
02:49:38,303 --> 02:49:39,327
What if he was one of us

3308
02:49:45,215 --> 02:49:50,847
Communication

3309
02:49:51,103 --> 02:49:53,407
Associate

3310
02:49:57,503 --> 02:49:58,783
Who wrote

3311
02:49:59,039 --> 02:50:00,063
Schmidt

3312
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,855
Adam Goldman

3313
02:50:05,695 --> 02:50:06,463
Joseph

3314
02:50:06,975 --> 02:50:08,511
Can you talk to me

3315
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:19,263
Cover for drinks

3316
02:50:23,615 --> 02:50:24,127
Don't walk

3317
02:50:24,383 --> 02:50:29,759
Another fake another fraud another scumbag liar

3318
02:50:45,375 --> 02:50:45,887
It started

3319
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:52,287
It's time to pray

3320
02:50:55,871 --> 02:51:01,247
Where did that one of his Waypoint

3321
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:03,551
Who's Rick

3322
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:07,135
Billy yes

3323
02:51:07,903 --> 02:51:10,719
You know if you go see a jazz musician

3324
02:51:11,231 --> 02:51:12,511
Any always winds up

3325
02:51:12,767 --> 02:51:14,303
On the same like little triplet

3326
02:51:15,327 --> 02:51:15,839
Your f******

3327
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:18,143
You're sure you're not doing your homework

3328
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:19,935
Really realize just now

3329
02:51:20,191 --> 02:51:20,703
What

3330
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:24,031
Alex Jones is essentially a debate student who didn't

3331
02:51:25,311 --> 02:51:27,359
Like he would have been thrown out of the Bay Club

3332
02:51:28,639 --> 02:51:30,943
Because it becomes obvious in like

3333
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:31,967
You don't know the source

3334
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:34,015
You're trying to make an argument about the

3335
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:35,807
But the other person

3336
02:51:36,575 --> 02:51:38,367
Who has like

3337
02:51:39,391 --> 02:51:40,159
A nuanced

3338
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:41,695
Understanding of the article

3339
02:51:41,951 --> 02:51:42,463
Are you saying that

3340
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:43,999
Doesn't say what you think it says

3341
02:51:44,255 --> 02:51:45,023
And all you have is yellow

3342
02:51:47,071 --> 02:51:47,839
Because you don't know what it

3343
02:51:52,703 --> 02:51:53,215
All right hold on

3344
02:51:53,471 --> 02:51:56,031
Can I counter Counterpoint

3345
02:51:56,287 --> 02:51:57,567
But you can

3346
02:51:57,823 --> 02:51:59,103
I like that

3347
02:52:00,895 --> 02:52:03,711
Here is the one thing cuz I do have a

3348
02:52:04,223 --> 02:52:04,735
I do

3349
02:52:05,503 --> 02:52:07,295
Inexplicably have a base

3350
02:52:07,551 --> 02:52:09,343
Acknowledge of Debate Club

3351
02:52:11,647 --> 02:52:12,159
Was younger too

3352
02:52:13,439 --> 02:52:15,487
From all of the

3353
02:52:15,743 --> 02:52:16,255
Inexperienced

3354
02:52:16,511 --> 02:52:17,535
A lot of the times

3355
02:52:18,047 --> 02:52:19,071
Confident

3356
02:52:19,327 --> 02:52:19,839
M

3357
02:52:20,095 --> 02:52:21,631
Goes a whole lot longer than

3358
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:26,751
Aren't many more demeanors

3359
02:52:27,007 --> 02:52:28,031
More confident

3360
02:52:28,543 --> 02:52:30,335
Or at least confident in there like a

3361
02:52:30,591 --> 02:52:31,103
Confidence

3362
02:52:32,127 --> 02:52:35,711
Alex jump I will say he does not follow Robert's Rules of Order

3363
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:38,271
He does not follow Roberts.

3364
02:52:38,527 --> 02:52:39,807

Sir

3366
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:44,415

3367
02:52:44,927 --> 02:52:45,439
Heady

3368
02:52:45,695 --> 02:52:46,463

Lack of comfort

3370
02:52:48,511 --> 02:52:50,559

02:52:57,471 --> 02:52:58,239
Experience

3372
02:52:58,495 --> 02:52:59,775

Some Powers know what it is

3375
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:11,039
VSCO this idea of

3376
02:53:11,551 --> 02:53:12,063

But every morning they wake up

3382
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:29,215
Negus

3383
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:31,519
I guess you just also nailed another

3384
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:36,895
Toxic masculinity

3385
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:39,967
I rather quotes still isn't

3386
02:53:44,319 --> 02:53:46,623
They're not they're not

3387
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:54,047
I'm glad he doesn't say s*** Rosenberg

3388
02:53:54,303 --> 02:53:55,327
Intercept

3389
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:10,943
And you still force-feed it cuz I got to shave head

3390
02:54:16,575 --> 02:54:18,111
Look at that

3391
02:54:19,135 --> 02:54:20,415
And see that's not what it said

3392
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:24,767
Angela

3393
02:54:30,911 --> 02:54:35,775
11 seconds ladies and gentlemen

3394

Around here

3395
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:49,343
Because

3396
02:54:53,695 --> 02:54:54,975
The other

3397
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:57,023
Outlets out there

3398
02:54:57,791 --> 02:54:59,327
If these are the two sides

3399
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:00,351
We better f***

3400
02:55:00,863 --> 02:55:01,631

3401
02:55:02,143 --> 02:55:03,423
Are you saying it's time to pray

3402
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:04,703
Inside of her

3403
02:55:05,471 --> 02:55:05,983
Dear Lord

3404
02:55:06,751 --> 02:55:07,263

Don't know how I feel

3406
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:10,591
You don't know what things are like

3407
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:14,943
Because yes nationalreview put it out they were forced to retract it wasn't true

3408
02:55:24,415 --> 02:55:27,743
Months before the peace headlines

3409
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:36,703
Is it important to help the president

3410
02:55:38,751 --> 02:55:44,895
He just clocked out all of the other blogs that he relies on but then secondarily that he's responding to

3411
02:55:45,151 --> 02:55:47,967
Do something that is now with the reporter said that's not what Rosenberg

3412
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:48,735
Merced

3413
02:55:48,991 --> 02:55:49,759
He said that

Infowars

3415
02:55:51,295 --> 02:55:53,343
Lied about what was in his story and then Trump

3416
02:55:53,599 --> 02:55:54,367
Responded to that

3417
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:56,159
Which if you really look at it as a

3418
02:55:57,439 --> 02:55:57,951
Pretty much

3419
02:55:58,207 --> 02:55:58,975
Exactly what hap

3420
02:55:59,231 --> 02:56:01,791

3427
02:56:10,239 --> 02:56:11,775
Have to face Alex's Wrath

3428
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:12,543

The oldest one

3432
02:56:22,783 --> 02:56:24,319
See how Alex reacts

3433
02:56:25,599 --> 02:56:30,975
Let's turn into the only thing I want to find out you're out there

3434
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:33,279
I want to

3435
02:56:33,535 --> 02:56:35,071

02:57:53,151 --> 02:57:54,431
He does not read

3455
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:57,247
The cover who watches Fox News

3456
02:57:57,503 --> 02:57:58,783
Probably reads like Alex

3457
02:57:59,039 --> 02:58:00,319

You did not read it

3461
02:58:06,975 --> 02:58:07,999
We might be in agreement

3462
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:10,047
But anyway watch out this

3463
02:58:10,559 --> 02:58:12,351
Never were talking about that Nadia Comaneci

3464
02:58:12,607 --> 02:58:13,631

She did but I mean

3469
02:58:31,551 --> 02:58:37,439
Warrants for that

3470
02:59:06,623 --> 02:59:07,135
Corley

3471
02:59:13,279 --> 02:59:14,303
When a

3472
02:59:14,815 --> 02:59:20,959
The north remembers

3473
02:59:26,079 --> 02:59:29,919
He's merely transitions into a field

3474
02:59:30,687 --> 02:59:33,759
So he does that bedroom I'm so angry about something

3475
02:59:35,295 --> 02:59:38,879
Superman Vitality just the Classic Alex Jones

3476
02:59:39,391 --> 02:59:40,415
Exactly what we've always

3477
02:59:40,927 --> 02:59:42,207
Does episodes been too long

3478
02:59:42,463 --> 02:59:43,743
We're both under the weather in

3479
02:59:44,255 --> 02:59:45,791
Clearly at this point red wine drunk

3480
02:59:46,047 --> 02:59:48,863
Yep so we should I mean

3482
02:59:50,655 --> 02:59:54,751
I mean

3483
02:59:57,567 --> 02:59:58,591
Credibly insane

3484
02:59:58,847 --> 03:00:01,151
Him not realizing to the point that the article was making

3485
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:03,455
Is it they misinterpreted the headline

3486
03:00:03,967 --> 03:00:06,527
And then him not knowing what was in the body of the

3487
03:00:07,039 --> 03:00:08,575
Improving

3488
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:10,111
Through his yelling for 10 minutes

3489
03:00:10,367 --> 03:00:12,927
But he doesn't know what's in the Bible

3490
03:00:13,695 --> 03:00:14,207
Was

3491
03:00:14,975 --> 03:00:15,487
Sad

3492
03:00:15,999 --> 03:00:16,511
Pathetic

3493
03:00:18,303 --> 03:00:18,815
