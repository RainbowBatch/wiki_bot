Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,808
I have great respect for knowledge by

3
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,088
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Knowledge fight

6
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan

7
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,400
Quest

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,472
Kind of

9
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
Trying to make peace with

10
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
Okay I'm already getting back to grapefruit

11
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,152
No it's another proof that I despaired quite a bit

12

Michelle

13
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,504
Severe the South air

14
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,040
I said some really negative

15
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:27,808
Things about coconut

16
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
That's true

17
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
Hate the coconut

18
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,488
I hate it as a

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,304
Seltzer strawberry flavor for liquid

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
So I want to take this opportunity

21
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
To say something positive about coconut

22
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
I recently encountered in my life

23
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,568
Exploring various like

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,456
I've recently discovered

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Milk yogurt

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,552
Coconut milk yogurt

27
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,136
Does the trick

28
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,816
Definition of

29
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
Amaya scientist scientist

30
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
You're the one who knows more about milk

31
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
Look up a big dad why not

32
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,112
Are some expectation that I would look into it

33
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
I just haven't

34
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
I've just been Drake

35
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
And honestly

36
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
I don't know

37
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,352
I don't know if it's healthier than like a Greek yogurt or just a abandoned

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,216
Diversified

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:49,984
Things that I have

40
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
The food offering

41
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,288
My life

42
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,616
So looking forward to drop

43
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:02,272
Yogurt yogurt

44
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,856
It turns out they are in a couple years

45
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
I have no updates on that front but I would like to know what your

46
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Comedian David

47
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,888
Dan

48
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,448
Pronounce that name

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
You pronounce

50
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,336
Okay no

51
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
I particularly enjoyed a lot of stand-up

52
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,248
Has been released recently her so went back and watch some

53
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:34,784
Danny Phantom

54
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320

56
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Aeropostale

57
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,208
Incredible song

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
Pretty Rock

59
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,144
Like in a genuinely funny kind of

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
Dark

61
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:57,568
Miserable kind of

62
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
I do not have a great time

63
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
A lot of people don't make it 25 specials

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Probably

65
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
I just remembered pissed off because

66
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
The bar

67
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
Close

68
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
Maybe like half an hour left in this year

69
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,055
Meter to go over and look after

70
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:34,943
Kind of half-hearted lab demands more Merlot

71
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,735
No no

72
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,623
It was one of our friendship

73
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:48,767
Didn't want to go

74
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
What was the setup

75
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,239
That's right my timeline

76
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
A little screwy but

77
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Not to worry

78
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
So don't think they'll actually described as a very special episode

79
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,991
And I don't understand exactly

80
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
I'll tell you something

81
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
Stay awake

82
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Just say no

83
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
Best policy

84
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
Sarah program

85
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,487
Dare program

86
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
Adair bear

87
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Know what

88
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,583
Okay

89
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,423
I don't know if this is just something

90
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
Their curriculum with our logo.

91
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:39,967
Vacations section of their curriculum or whatever

92
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,271
You take it home for the evening and it'll bring it back

93
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,111
That's not reliable is universal

94
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
Never heard of a dare

95
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
I guess we'll probably hear from

96
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
You just had an incompetent

97
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
Citicom

98
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:03,007
I think it was around the time that Care Bears was a cartoon

99
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,079
That might have been part of why but ended up happening

100
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,527
Sure to make this special structure of this is going

101
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
Incredibly well in advance

102
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Do shoutouts

103
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
Some folks are signed up in our sport

104
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
Bring the show

105
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Right

106
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Okay

107
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,887
We're going to play

108
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:30,655
A drop

109
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,823
A time capsule episode

110
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,663
Or listeners child to listen to

111
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,039
I like that

112
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,439
Pics

113
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,767
However

114
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,423
And I wanted to create a time capsule David his daughter was born

115
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
You can hear what Alex was doing on

116
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
She was born

117
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,407
I got to go f*** dad why are you

118
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
I thought it was one or more uplifting things that I've heard in awhile

119
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
Skewered through the lens of our show which is never sleep nor up with

120
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,423
And some sort of a weird memory

121
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Your family is at

Of Roberts child

130
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:28,415
Love it so we're going to do that but I wanted to try and I don't know why

131
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Episode

132
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:34,559
Conceived in my mind is that we would play that drop

133
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
And then we would answer it

134
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
You know like that

135
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
The beginning of the episode

136
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
Only because I was like I don't know

137
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,823
The Time Capsule episode

138
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,223
I just don't know how good this this works

139
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
So anyway if you do

140
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
Alright alright

Check it out really great

181
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,319
And

182
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
It's hard to say for sure

183
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,975
Because there's no gear on it but I think I was at one of the shows

184
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:19,583
Decemberists show that there's a poster of I was at

185
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,399
It's hard to say for sure because I would have had to been over a decade

186
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703

Do not like each other anymore

To Alex's now

289
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:31,039
It's always going to be a row

290
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
The same ship

291
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
What's been going on

292
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,463
This this is good to know that some friendships do crumble hilarious

293
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Friendship

294
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,351
This is just like a convenient

295
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,335
Alex Like Larry

296
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
This guy was around

297
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,151
You know there's a lot of stuff look like

298
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:57,919
My God that's

299
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
That is

300
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,271
Very different

301
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Yeah

302
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
It's interesting

303
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,951
What's coming up on Today Show

304
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
He does say there's

305
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
And I will say

306
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
This is not company follows through

307
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
And of course

308
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,399
Cuz I said open phone

309
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,935
But I think it's going to be on

310
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,703
Specific

311
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
Topix

312
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Because

313
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
Calls and also if you have open

314
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,015
But it's only on certain topics it's no longer open

315
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,551
Contradict

316
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,575
We have close by

317
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,623
Right

318
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,183
I think it says that at the beginning of every show back at this point

319
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
We're going to have open Play

320
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Right

321
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,023
It's only talk about

322
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,887
Talk show

323
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
You know of this store

324
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983

325
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:59,871
Well I mean

326
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
So they're going to listen

327
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Through the points

328
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Somebody's going to say it's

329
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,247
Turn to call right

330
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,527
A good diet

331
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:07,295
Gadot

332
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:11,135
So Alex jumped into the stories and besides

333
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
The begin

334
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
There is so much

335
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
The cover here

336
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
So much to go over here

337
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,167
Socialism

338
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,751
General Motors says no way will pay back 10 billion bailout

339
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,567
Money used to move to China and Brazil

340
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
If you don't like it

341
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,623
So yeah it is interesting you know Alex does have the you like there so many stories to get to

342
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,207
He does at least start

343
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
That's true

344
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,887
What it's worth in July 2019 GM finally finished paying back to the United States

345
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
All the money that is owed is part of the Baylor

346
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
That was later than I was supposed to paid it all back

347
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,311
6.7 billion that was considered was

348
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,895
Government extension

349
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:10,783
Because part of the bailout plan was to

350
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:15,391
So some of the flowers in the form of the US government buying stock in General Motors

351
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,952
According to a 2014 article in

352
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
CNN business

353
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Fujiyama's

354
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
Very profitable

355
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Since 2000

356
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,632
Its stock price never Rose to the level that let

357
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
Treasury recoup.

358
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:27,680
Investment

359
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
ENT on December

360
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,336
16th back in 2013

361
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
Should GM repay 10 billion rescue cost

362
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
Beo says no

363
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,016
This article was about

364
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
Codm

365
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:52,768
Naturally the CEO said no and they quote

366
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,304
Treasury officials took the same

367
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,840
Consumed by anyone

368
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Who purchases

369
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,376
Stock

370
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:02,496
Also Alex Fields mentioned in this article discussed GM plant invest

371
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
2 billion dollars

372
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
Plant

373
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:08,640
Which brings their total for the past four years at that point

374
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,688
Up to 10 billion dollar investment

375
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
In United

376
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
It states plants

377
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,904
Brazil Brazil

378
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,928
Before the bailout

379
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,072
As for the reality of Chinese GM Factory

380
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Because of the expanding demand

381
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
In China

382
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,680
A 2019 article in

00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
Business

384
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
Percent of u.s. GM sales

385
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,312
Cars imported from

386
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
From Chinese factories

387
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,152

393
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,440
They're definitely things

394
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,720
Can take issue with about the

395
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,632
CEO's that you wasn't going to pay back money that wasn't alone and he's making

396
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
Stuff about the rush

397
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,008
He's getting mad about stuff that doesn't make sense when there's other things

398
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,384
Do not appreciate the sea

Towards the beginning of the episode

Well ladies and Gentlemen even mainstream media

416
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
Just calling it The Rise of

Rise of the robot animals as they've now but

420
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,720
In the last week or so 8 robot

421
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,488
Carbone's

422
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
In the last week as Google make

423
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,328
Executive

424
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Decision

425
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,424
Literally buy up almost all

426
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,008
Animal type combat

427
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Capable

428
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,080
In the future robots

429
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Systems

430
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Wow wow

431
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
A lot of claws

432
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
He kept adding dessert

433
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Lot of words

434
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,064
Google's agnor robot army together

435
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
It's still coming

436
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
I don't

437
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:06,048
Embarrassing

438
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,776
Easily traceable to a headline

439
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
Find from December 6th

440
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,104
What is really interesting is

441
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,432
Like going through this and like hearing the story that he's covering

442
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
Painfully easy to draw

443
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:26,784
Just go and find the exact article

444
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
Talking about

445
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,880
Like the last one

446
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
YouTube I like to talk about

447
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
CBS News article with the headline

448
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,072
Google buys eight robotics companies in

449
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
6 months

450
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:40,608
Why

451
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:47,008
These articles primarily a company called Boston Dynamics

452
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:48,288
Institute of Technology

453
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
What is investment could easily be understood as Google

454
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,944
Early stages of Technology

455
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,736
Mind-boggling array of purposes

456
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,528
Mostly in the field of autumn

457
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
If you look at it from that angle

458
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Close to strange about Google buying up

459
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:04,928
These businesses

460
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,512
The robotics section of Google

461
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
Aruba

462
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560

464
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,632
According to sources who spoke with rocks

465
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,472
2017 this quote

466
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,520
About what their role Google would be

467
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
Surprised that in 2017

468
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Google sold

469
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
Boston Dynamics

470
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
As well as their other large robotics interest

471
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Shut up

472
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Do a Japanese company called stop

473
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
Freezer part of Google

474
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Which is their developmental way

475
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,136
Hey so large

476
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160

477
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720

479
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,304
Innovations

480
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,072
Worked on

481
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
We're too far away from

482
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,704
Rosie the robot

483
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,752
The Google

484
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:54,592
Insignia on it and they had to get rid of those and that's why

485
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,488
Play Shoot Oliver's on site

486
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:17,376
I don't know how many times we have to have Verizon

487
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,008
A movie save the answer is

488
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,848
Big ask themselves whether or not they could not whether or not they should

489
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,408
And then we watch it and reality happened

490
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,944
Have you seen any movies

491
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,016
About you about you there about you look

492
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Can you building a black

493
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,392
Mirror episode

494
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,672
Predictive programming

495
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
It's a common artistic beam about

496
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,424
Subway

497
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,472
The field of robotics

498
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,800
I'm the one handsome

499
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Holding the field

500
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
By spending big bucks

501
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:07,040
Vision

502
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
Should have been

503
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:12,160
Maybe John outside of the restrictive

504
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,440
The purview of Google

505
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:16,512
And then others point out the fact is because Google showed such

506
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,072
Such a huge interest in robotics

507
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
It's what actually pushed

508
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Chesterfield forward

509
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,312
It's kind of a mixed bag

510
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,104
Complete handle on what the net

511
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,456
Gained or lost if we just know that there's some game there's some lost nobody

512
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:38,272
Seems like a lot of the sense that I was getting was trying to stifle

513
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,624
In hindsight

514
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,720
I guess

515
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Nearly enough

516
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,256
Or at all

517
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Should be able to

518
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
Speak with any kind of authority

519
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,144

524
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,152
Not yet there's still time

525
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
2020

526
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,224
As we sit

527
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,760
We are in the midst

528
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,552
Of the Coronavirus

529
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,320
The covid-19

00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Ears

535
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
Alex was talking about like bio-weapon

536
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
Stop in 2013

537
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,496
Timeline

538
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
The order of events

539
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
Is a little bit

540
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
You could grow up and be an adult

541
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,504
Do it

542
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,552
Arrested Development three-year-old

543
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Talking to new listeners

544
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
You're busy watching the NFL

545
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:56,864
While you're busy into your favorite music star

546
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
We're under

547
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
Then drop the hammer

548
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
If they release a bio-weapon

549
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
They done the war games

550
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,320
It's going to result in Clearwater

551
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
Problem

552
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,536
They get a real world government

553
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Bankrupt everybody

554
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
You can see here at 2013 Alex's conception is the martial law

555
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,848
Happens to like a bunch of people

556
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Now it's completely flip

557
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,528
The bioweapon is released in order to get the martial law

558
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
The bioweapon

559
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,368
Because they usually would say actuary

560
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,024
Change

561
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
Like

562
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Pieces but they're organized

563
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,424
Here's my here's my prediction

564
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Alright

565
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,264
I don't think anything Alex says

566
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
In any era

567
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,360
Is mint with any kind of actual predict

568
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
Livability

569
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,784
I've now decided that we are comparing 2020 Alex's predictions to 2013 Alex

570
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Sister addiction

571
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
And both of them

572
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
Or either of them will always

573
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,952
When they are in pain

574
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,488
2013

575
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
Will happen

576
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
To him

577
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
Interesting

578
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:33,888
At all

579
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
In 2020

580
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
Completely consistent

581
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
Because he said the word bioweapon

582
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:44,640
That's true for everything

583
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
Technically

584
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Matchup

585
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
The predictions are different

586
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Now the globalist plans are always

587
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,720
10 years behind true

588
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
Game and they were like well this is

589
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Going to start a nuclear war

590
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,328
Not releasing it is going to start a nuke

591
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,864
Clara Ward

592
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,912
Now and

593
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
Nuclear war

594
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
I don't know anymore

595
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
I'm falling perfect

596
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
Okay

597
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,896
Empath

598
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:21,248
Because of the times that I go back into the past

599
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Is that are shocking

600
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,368
And I would say that this is one of them

601
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:29,440
Alex

602
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
The show in 2020

603
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,048
Breonna Taylor once

604
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,120
Everyday I see where police go to the wrong house

605
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
And shoot someone

606
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
And don't even get in trouble

607
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,520
I've got two reports today in the stack of that

608
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
And Anthony gucciardi last night

609
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,128
Woke up

610
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,432
Armored vehicles

611
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
At the wrong house

612
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
Big giant fat Goblin Commander cop

613
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
What does SWAT team

614
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,112
Literally dragging some woman out he was innocent

615
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
What's wrong now

616
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
Fake drug war

617
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,976
All the drugs in the beginning

618
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Alex

619
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
2013

620
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
The individual

621
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,448
Necessary

622
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,312
No

623
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:21,408
User like a cops are going into the wrong houses shooting people

624
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,432
What you think

625
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,504
Talk about this

626
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Shopping and no knock

627
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
That warrant

628
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,648
Also it seems like that one

629
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,672
Easy 12b

630
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:36,768
Consistent on yeah that doesn't seem to have a fungible moral position

631
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,560
Going into the wrong house

632
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Murdering somebody

633
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,376
And then facing no consequences

634
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,032
Even in our time capsule episode

635
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Future be like

636
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,272
Nevermind

637
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,648
Yeah yeah

638
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
Squabble over is like

639
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,976
Demanding more information

640
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,816
Reserving judgment about individual

641
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,352
Until you know more about

642
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,424
Is really the only place I can see any kind of

643
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Mightier

644
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
Is love

645
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,384
You know carrying weapons legally and then

646
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,688
Nano philando Castillo gets killed

647
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:33,088
Carrying a gun legally and

648
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Non-white

649
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
Blog

650
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
Infowars around the same time that I was

651
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Pushing yourself

652
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
McGuire

653
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,472
He's no longer there

654
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,408
She already has one of them

655
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
But that stuff

656
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,200
Just doesn't stick with me

657
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
Cuz it's like

658
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
You like

659
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Now he hasn't

660
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,720
Mainstay around this time

661
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,768
In terms of like

662
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
Being another

663
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:24,288
Natural news

664
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Couple times

665
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,688
Definitely in the spear

666
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,456
Yeah

667
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,736
Yeah

668
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,320
Interesting to me

669
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:38,624
Do you see that you see that this

670
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
This principle that like

671
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:46,560
Cop shooting

672
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,192
They've dubbed

673
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,056
Opportunistically support

674
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:02,176
For being on the right side of than that and still lied I don't see

675
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
I don't see that happening

676
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
Attention just to say that

677
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
He doesn't want

678
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Mobster murdered

679
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
Every night

680
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,304
Maybe

681
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,584
Little sprig of parsley

682
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Alex

683
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:28,288
Livin on the road my friend going to keep you free and clean

684
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
Free

685
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
And your breath

686
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
Willie Nelson Merle Hay

687
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
Duet

688
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,824
Cry

689
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,480
Thanks

690
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,488
Three Willie Nelson song

691
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
Pancho and Lefty

692
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
Like variety of music

693
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
Like I see him as having a

694
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,360
A couple of songs that he listen to all the time or he

695
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
He does not listen

696
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
The music deep cut

697
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,248
So that come out every now and again

698
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Willie Nelson seems like his movies

699
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,600
If I were six song

700
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,048
Maybe it's the only things that are covered by WIC whatever his lease agreement is music

701
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,352
These ones

702
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,936
Shotgun Willy or whatever

703
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,264
Victorino That's What I Call Waylon

704
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,640
Will you play these songs and none other

705
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
Blazing let me tell you how it goes out

706
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
So this

707
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,600
This is not what I expect

708
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,624
Good to hear that next

709
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,184
This is where I was like this episode

710
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
I'm going to be about

711
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
And coming up with an X

712
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Tail

713
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,608
The facts here on Earth

714
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,448
And here on this planet dealing with our

715
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,360
All of the facts

716
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,896
Dealing with

717
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Soil

718
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
What have we gotten ourselves into

719
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
We are now going

720
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Going to sit here and learn

721
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:50,368
Everything

722
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:52,416
The past used to be Queen

723
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
But like 80 years in the past

724
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,560
So cute

725
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,864
Alex

726
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:04,192
I don't want to learn about you LOL

727
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,240
Beachmere

728
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,312
Again I would greatly

729
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
We prefer this

730
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:14,944
Look you guys we got a man singing to talk about soil that's just a regular show

731
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,272
It's just a regular show

732
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,808
Confused

733
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
You said that

734
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,952
And loyal is a topic

735
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,072
In about

736
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:31,840
Scurvy

737
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,216
If you go on and do research

738
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
The FDA

739
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,544
Has continued to lower

740
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,640
The minimum daily allowance of what they say you need

741
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
A vitamin C vitamin D vitamin E

742
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,808
McCullough

743
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Dr. Blaylock

744
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,888
They have lowered the level of vitamin C down to near

745
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Scurvy inducing level

746
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,288
Your skin basically falls apart

747
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
You see you talk to

748
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,600
That's why they literally all have rattles in their arm

749
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,416
I'll talk to nutritionist

750
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
The whole spiel

751
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:39,168
Hypothetical person impersonating who only eats McDonald's would have their behavior affected

752
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,496
Too greatly by an older desk

753
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,056
No one would say I owe you

754
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,872
McDonald's because the FDA said that was a good idea

755
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:56,064
I used to eat all the fruits and vegetables but then they lowered the vitamin C limit

756
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,088
McDonald's

757
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,208
Vitamin C

758
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,512
For most people you get what you need

759
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,888
In the journal the College of Physicians of Canada

760
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,448
Explored a slight re-emergence of scary cases

761
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
2008

762
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,240
Romeo

763
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,056
In a retrospective chart review conducted

764
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:21,408
Is the Mayo Clinic in Rochester New York and Scottsdale Arizona from 1976

765
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
2002

766
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,504
12:30 cases were related

767
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,552
Alcohol abuse illicit drug use

768
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
And psychiatric

769
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,696
Serotonia Foods people eat regularly

770
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,816
Is your having a specific problem that might be caused by a vitamin

771
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:39,584
Efficiency

772
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,656
It might be a good idea to speak to a dietitian

773
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
You're missing

774
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,752
What is not a great angle is to imagine that you have a problem

775
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,080
And the reason must be that you're not taking enough for something so you need supper

776
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:55,199
That's the fear that Alex is exploding here in order to try and create feelings of

777
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
His audience

778
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:04,159
People there's no deficiency to begin with

779
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
Century Privateer then yes

780
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
I agree

781
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
McDonald's

782
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Terrible

783
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:12,863
It's life

784
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Right

785
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,959
I mean it's one of those things

786
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Yes

787
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,567
Gerard Gerard

788
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,615
You know not the as rampant

789
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,895
Does Alex want

790
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,967
Nutritional deficit

791
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
It's an

792
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:31,807
To the extent that is real for some people

793
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,183
Sometimes

794
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,975
Into Better Health but like

795
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,279
What do you do here is exploitative

796
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
And predator

797
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
End

798
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
Once again putting the blame

799
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,983
Depressed economic sector as being like

800
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,615
McDonald's all the time

801
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:59,455
Places are f****** Cal poor that there's really not much option

802
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
That's true you know

803
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,343
True

804
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,647
Where is that

805
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,183
It seems like

806
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
That's not entirely

807
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:19,679
The soil which is why you want to do this

808
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,591
Blaming people who can't afford maybe more expensive

809
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,895
Being out a living in food desert

810
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Or something like that

811
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,223
You don't even unpack that necessarily

812
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
Territory

813
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
This is more about the

814
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,111
The fact that

815
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,927
Nutrients are gone from

816
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,047
This is all because of

817
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
An article v d red

818
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
About

819
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
Hey dudes

820
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,495
Studies only found the basically most people don't know

821
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
U-joint

822
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
People

823
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,639
There are some people who could be Alpha

824
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,455
There are some

825
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
If you take too much of them

826
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,575
People

827
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,111
Zero proper diet

828
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,135
Don't need

829
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,183
And upon publishing that research

830
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
Billion dollar industry of supplements

831
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
Oh no

832
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,047
We're useless

833
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,327
Cuz I guess we'll just stop

834
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,655
Nope

835
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:27,007
Hotels

836
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
Is this

837
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,055
Go cuz it's such bull

838
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,127
He's just saying like

839
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,967
FDA has come out and said you don't need vitamins

840
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:40,831
Alrighty

841
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,391
Yesterday they roll out with a huge

842
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,023
That vitamins and minerals do nothing

843
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
Basically the

844
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,351
Paces close

845
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
And on

846
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
Fox

847
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,031
My local paper has it

848
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,079
National papers

849
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Everywhere

850
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
Chase close

851
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,479
You don't need any vitamins any minerals any supplements

852
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
So he's presenting this as like the FDA

853
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
What vitamin

854
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
Running reality is Iraq

855
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
Like I'd like a bird

856
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,239
Turns out

857
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:34,079
Are are

858
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
You're not chewing when you breathe that's why you don't

859
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Get the vitamins

860
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,039
In the air everybody 2013

861
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,599
Yeah I mean I think it's pretty hot

862
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,903
What you missed

863
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Cop to the fact

864
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,095
If you have

865
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:02,495
Proper Diet Rite

866
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,847
Possible that have

867
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,639
A diet

868
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,943
Get you all the supplemental nutrients

869
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,503
And that you need

870
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
This is falling apart as you talk more

871
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,599
Clear

872
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,415
Apparently clear things like

873
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,511
All right did you know that

874
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
Until they cry

875
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Created vitamin

876
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,327
Supplements

877
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,607
All Humans died

878
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Let's

879
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,727
After okay well

880
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Okay you're right

881
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
Cfda

882
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Cause

883
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,151
Yeah so apparently I don't I don't know how true this is

884
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,943
I just decided to accept it as paw

885
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,759
Possibly through and move along

886
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
The FDA has lowered

887
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
The allowance or the amount you should get

888
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Certain things

889
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,911
Advise the food pyramid

890
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,703
We grow

891
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,519
Access to more information means better

892
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Because

893
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,919
Trying to come up with examples

894
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,831
Tripped over his own

895
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
Daily allowance

896
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
What you need

897
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,743
Things like vitamin C

898
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:30,559
It seems like

899
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,327
Down

900
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,607
Level

901
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,655
Littorai Regular Show

902
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:36,703
Portage medical doctors in Ventura

903
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:42,079
Examples of what

904
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:45,151
Oil of oregano

905
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,943
So much oil of oregano

906
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,343
I used to tell a joke in your life

907
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,391
Essential oils guy

908
00:47:55,647 --> 00:48:01,535
3 years

909
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,607
Blind out of my mind

910
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,399
I don't know

911
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:09,471
If oil of oregano is that everyone

912
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,007
In their daily routine

913
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,295
It's in the category with the FDA of things that are like

914
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
Generally it doesn't

915
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:27,135
So I don't think it's

916
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,463
Controlled by the FDA

917
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
Does the supplement

918
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,583
Industries like a million dollars

919
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
You can just come up with another vitamin

920
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,335
1111 North their follow-up

921
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,639
Nobody even knows if 11 is a thing

922
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,431
So Alex

923
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,967
Talking about salt

924
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,527
Hey substitute

925
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:57,855
You're watching on TV you can look at this or just go to the local

926
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,903
Supermarket

927
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:09,887
It says this salt does not supply iodine unnecessary nutrients

928
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,935
Why is that cuz the feds

929
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,703
Pressure

930
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,031
Iodine in the shop

931
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,615
Because of literally millions of people being

932
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,151
Born mentally retarded

933
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,039
Lower IQs

934
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,599
People that look like

935
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Jabba the Hutt

936
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,487
Where you look like a human worm

937
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,535
Fabric is devastated by the

938
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
So this doesn't happen

939
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
Because it suggests

940
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
Degenerative problem

941
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,127
By the seventies basically said remove it

942
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,967
Remove item

943
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
In that loving Adele

944
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,855
We've been fight

945
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:07,999
Uses the twenties we got we had to switch things up

946
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
Finally in the 70s

947
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
Under the Carter Administration

948
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:18,495
But also the Chinese are putting iodine in their water

949
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,311
He's good but they put fluoride in their water which is bad

950
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
So you never know

951
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
I mean look

952
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,455
Like a real problem

953
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Here's the thing

954
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,343
Reasons that salted Alex has from McCormick's

955
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,927
Now he's rambling about this the reason it doesn't have iodine in it because it's

956
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Sea salt

957
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:40,255
You'll find the same warnings on containers of Morton

958
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,559
Any sea salt

959
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
You're going to find on the market

960
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,655
The reason for this is that sea salt and table salt

961
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Solder produce differently

962
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,215
And because of how these

963
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,751
Seasalt Market operates

964
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:54,335
Is a product that generally is subject to his little processing as

965
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,663
The salt comes from evaporated water

966
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Which leaves flakes

967
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,735
Salt which retain some of the minerals and characteristic

968
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
Because the source that they come from

969
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,111
Table salt conversion deposit

970
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,975
So you can have iodine added easily in the processing

971
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,023
Changes

972
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,607
You go by any table salt

973
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Salt

974
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,423
Seesaw generally

975
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
He isn't

976
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,983
I agree with Alex

977
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,311
Inasmuch as maybe there should be better messaging to the world.

978
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,103
Sea salt doesn't contain iodine

979
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,431
Imagining

980
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,991
Any kind of large-scale iodine deficiency

981
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
In the United

982
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,783
Midstate because

983
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
It's just not

984
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,623
Everyday I'm walking around and all these

985
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
Hipster neighborhood

986
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,463
Even in Wrigleyville you walk around

987
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,023
Please people wondering why they got iodine deficiency

988
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,095
You can't go to a bar and get iodized salt man

989
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,143
All bars sea salt

990
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,447
Margaritas

991
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:00,639
McCray's and it probably didn't have at least

992
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
Some

993
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455
Effect on iodine levels

994
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:07,039
I'm not positive if it reached any kind of

995
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:13,439
Crisis point

996
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,743
Result

997
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,535
We are in your debt

998
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,679
You can eat seafood milk yogurt egg

999
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,519
Maintain proper health

1000
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:31,359
They're definitely serious problems can occur from iodine deficiency

1001
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,431
In the developing World particularly

1002
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:39,039
Makes it out to be particularly

1003
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:46,207
Again this is an example of Alex working to try and convince his audience that there's something wrong with them

1004
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Which he can provide this

1005
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,255
Lucian

1006
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
Because I know that is busy

1007
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,351
Business model relies heavily on selling iodine

1008
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,119
Supplements

1009
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,935
It's hard not to see this doesn't intentionally predatory

1010
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,495
Like he's going through all this stuff about

1011
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,103
Amazon

1012
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,639
Problem

1013
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
He can provide

1014
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Placebo solution

1015
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,455
4

1016
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,343
Taking advantage of

1017
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,367
Just giving them this

1018
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:19,231
9

1019
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,511
Yeah

1020
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:24,351
But this says supplement that down your gullet and you won't feel

1021
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,375
Depressed

1022
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,399
Alex

1023
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:30,751
Claim everything in the world there is to know about soil

1024
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
So

1025
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,151
Let me show you some of the articles

1026
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
Number one

1027
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:43,295
This is a Scientific American did you get some good stuff

1028
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:46,623
Fruits and vegetables become less than Frisch's

1029
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,695
Major studies going back

1030
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:55,583
University of Texas at Austin Department of Chemistry and biochemistry

1031
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,655
In the Journal of the American College of nutrition

1032
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:01,471
And agriculture nutritional data

1033
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:07,103
With 43 different fruits and vegetables that look into studies before that

1034
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,639
Is in them

1035
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,687
Metrically by numbers

1036
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,807
By 98

1037
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Vitamins

1038
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:23,231
Getting those numbers from cuz they aren't

1039
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:29,375
This is an article that's part of their column Earth talk where readers can send in questions which their writers will then answer

1040
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:35,775
This question had to do with whether or not fruits and vegetables were more nutritious 50 years ago and then it turns out the answer

1041
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
But probably not today except Alex's report

1042
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,407
Your uncle's life in the mouse's by the coochie in

1043
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,991
Institute Wichita

1044
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,015
When calcium levels

1045
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,807
12 fresh vegetables they study

1046
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,855
It was a 37% drop in

1047
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,463
21% drop in vitamin A and 30% drop in vitamin C

1048
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,535
I finally get off their ass and do a study

1049
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:58,815
Experts believe

1050
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,911
That there was this was the result

1051
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:03,679
Is there mentally

1052
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Expand

1053
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
Cropsey

1054
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Could be

1055
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
John the word enrich soil

1056
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
Eureeka's Castle

1057
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:12,127
It's like alternator

1058
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
Growing seasons

1059
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Embracing

1060
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,735
Organic growing methods in order to rebuild

1061
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Royals

1062
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,575
Scientific American

1063
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,391
Disgusting

1064
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,463
As it turns out a new paper published in the journal

1065
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,767
Scientific

1066
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,815
Oceans of essential nutrients

1067
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,119
Decrease in 18th strains of rice

1068
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
Exposed to increased carbon dioxide levels

1069
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
In the experiment

1070
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
Okay so

1071
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
Climate change

1072
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,055
From Scientific American article

1073
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,103
Agricultural scientist have known for

1074
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
Sometime but our food

1075
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:49,759
Thought it was only a byproduct of modern

1076
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
Which leads to Mineral

1077
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,111
Or breeders favoring

1078
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,391
Bright

1079
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,183
Which sacrifices nutrition Forsyth

1080
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:01,279
Meanwhile plant researchers working over the last couple of decades were fine

1081
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
Something surprising

1082
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,911
Elevated carbon dioxide

1083
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Did plants

1084
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,727
Plantain agricultural scientist

1085
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
YouTube pieces of

1086
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,311
The puzzle but Noah

1087
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,359
Some phenomenon

1088
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,383
Until

1089
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,247
There's some evidence emerging that a large Factory nutrients

1090
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Texas

1091
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
CO2

1092
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,879
The plants need CO2 to grow in the same way we need calories

1093
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,415
But if we have too many calories

1094
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,231
There somewhere suggest

1095
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
Plants with CO2

1096
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:39,167
That are particularly important

1097
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,031
He's using this as a prop

1098
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
To sell his supplements

1099
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
It becomes really clear because

1100
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,895
Comes in

1101
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
Walking info

1102
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,295
Over some of that for you

1103
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,599
Is coming in now just a cover.

1104
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
Vitamins and minerals

1105
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:04,767
That I'm used to have done wonders in my life

1106
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:11,167
And everybody that she use them you've heard the calls not one- call on our proprietary Nationwide

1107
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:19,871
This is insane man this is like an hour of his show is weird like I'm going to tell you all about the soil

1108
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:26,271
Which is all the prelude

1109
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Atmos Energy

1110
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
Because it's

1111
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:35,999
A lot

1112
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,631
I wish I could because it's simultaneously more

1113
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Appropriate

1114
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,679
Compressor

1115
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,495
Both

1116
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,311
It's so

1117
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
Very

1118
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Very

1119
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:54,175
Pretending to not be an ad

1120
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,039
The last like desperation to it

1121
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,111
That's what that's the weird balance

1122
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
0

1123
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
It is almost more is like

1124
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,255
Skating

1125
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,047
Then it is now

1126
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:12,095
Just absolute like

1127
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
I need money

1128
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,703
I hear they're kind of like almost giving you a little

1129
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Hey listen

1130
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,335
If you don't want to take your vitamins

1131
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,895
I'm going to talk about that that for next hour

1132
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:29,503
Also you're going to need vitamins

1133
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,295
Going to talk about where you at

1134
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,391
More profitable

1135
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
I have to imagine

1136
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
More money

1137
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:47,679
You know there's one reason I couldn't get madder and madder the three-hour show those honeystead

1138
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
I don't like to work

1139
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,775
And that's because

1140
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,847
I'm looking

1141
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,431
At the federal state and university studies

1142
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,479
On the soil

1143
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Debilitated

1144
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,879
In utero

1145
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:10,463
Of the humans developing and then after

1146
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,535
I'm waiting in the documentation

1147
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,887
They're taking the good stuff out of the food and put the bad stuff in it

1148
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,447
Was this just all like

1149
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Little darts

1150
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,775
He's throwing in order to lead people down the path

1151
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,055
To his eyes up

1152
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,919
Yeah so she already in there

1153
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
But baseball

1154
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Scene we're looking

1155
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:39,647
Inductor group will come in for like an hour and they talk about syphilis

1156
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,695
So

1157
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Trt leaves

1158
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,767
And Alex

1159
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,815
G boy

1160
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Stupid

1161
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,679
SharkMan unnecessarily

1162
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Cruel

1163
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,983
Our education over here

1164
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
NAU at

1165
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
I said healthy

1166
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:58,079
I should help South Africa

1167
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
It should help diarrhea

1168
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
So we will be able to build up

1169
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Future

1170
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Thank you very much

1171
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,295
South Carolina

1172
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,111
She's a very beautiful young lady

1173
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,183
I don't find her attractive beautiful

1174
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
That is that woman is so ugly

1175
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,815
Being a trophy wife

1176
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,863
For some Global its executive

1177
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
Call Armani

1178
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,727
A wife that is literally nothing but a biological Android

1179
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,799
Who can't tie it for shoelaces

1180
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,847
Alex is complaining about people being

1181
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
2

1182
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
Opposed

1183
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
On stage

1184
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,087
Ivan number from

1185
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,647
The first is that this woman was eight

1186
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:46,463
18 years old

1187
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
The question

1188
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,511
Clearly didn't understand

1189
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Respond to

1190
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:55,423
Sure it was

1191
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:02,335
Any of us on a bad day under a certain amount of stress could end up finding ourselves saying something

1192
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,359
Equally embarrassing

1193
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:07,199
Kind of mean to Define someone by that embarrassing moment

1194
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
Piccalilli

1195
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:08,991
That's so young

1196
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,599
The mockery and shaming about this moment was really severe for this Saturday's weather

1197
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,135
She said

1198
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,951
I definitely went through. Where I was very very depressed

1199
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,279
But I never let anybody see that stop

1200
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,839
It's a very dark moments where I thought about them

1201
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
Committing suicide

1202
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Second this was from the 2000

1203
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,007
7 Miss Teen USA pageant

1204
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
From 2030

1205
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
Seems like he's digging pretty far back just

1206
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,871
To take an unnecessary swing at

1207
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
This woman

1208
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:37,919
Also just because

1209
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:44,319
After this contestant South Carolina Caitlin Upton went viral

1210
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Pretty pageant

1211
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
15 million views on YouTube

1212
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
She was signed to a contract with a bottle

1213
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,743
$30,000 a day

1214
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,839
Who also owns

1215
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,119
The pageant to that time

1216
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
We're doing

1217
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,215
Also another one

1218
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:04,799
Tucker Carlson

1219
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
To say about Miss up

1220
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
As well

1221
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,943
Episode of Bubba the Love Sponge radio show

1222
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,735
She probably be a pretty good wife

1223
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Tucker was

1224
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
I don't understand how many 40 year old white dude with a giant platform that they can talk to millions of people

1225
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:35,519
I think is really interesting is Alex at the end there is like a trophy wife

1226
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Globalist

1227
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,159
Old white man shooting all over with

1228
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,999
Direct line

1229
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Restrain

1230
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,815
I swear I'm not a witch

1231
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
What's the point

1232
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
So

1233
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:04,447
Trt

1234
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,471
Haha

1235
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Giselle

1236
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,967
The balance of the hour by Matt dubiel guy

01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
He's had a song for couple years down

1239
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,183
Chicago 1530

1240
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:29,023
I got a power pack

1241
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
Lineup

1242
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
There

1243
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
Alex

1244
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:37,727
Chicago radio station

1245
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495

Always nice

1247
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,711
Make a Serengeti song favorite actor

1248
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,991

1249
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855

01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,975
Like this periodically will Papa and

1251
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,375
Literally the only station

1252
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,911
In the country that plays

1253
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
Troy Aaron David

1254
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,031
Night shows affiliates

1255
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
I don't know

1256
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
Six months ago or so

1257
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
Sucks

1258
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,735
I guess

1259
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:26,367
The premise is disposed to be on to talk about what life is like under Rahm Emanuel

1260
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
Great

1261
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:33,023
I don't know

1262
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,351
So I don't care about his protective on local pilot

1263
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,143
But

1264
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Mukbang

1265
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:42,239
You know it's like you said there's a lot of good things about Chicago

1266
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,799
I went to the the Bears game the other night Monday nights

1267
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:48,127
Football in ended cuz number was retired it was a big deal and

1268
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,663
I had free tickets so we went

1269
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
There was nobody there

1270
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,527
No one now it was cold it gets cold here in Chicago

1271
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,087
Typically stop

1272
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,647
Chicago Bear fans from going to Chicago game

1273
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,231
I saw the same thing happening at the Cleveland Pittsburgh

1274
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,047
Where the Pittsburgh stadium

1275
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,327
Why is that

1276
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:11,935
Why why is it that all of the storefronts that are for lease the retail spaces are empty

1277
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,239
Something is going on and

1278
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,775
It is not

1279
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:20,895
If not by accident I don't think I should call the starting to feel a lot like Detroit these days

1280
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
2013

1281
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
No

1282
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:34,463
Attendance was 60 2209

1283
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
Soldier Field

1284
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
Worried home game

1285
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Chicago

1286
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,103
This number

1287
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:58,015
There's nothing discernible the football game

1288
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,063
Kind of think maybe you like one of my friends

1289
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
Just didn't want to go with them

1290
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:02,623
Zoe processing

1291
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,927
According to the Chicago Tribune

1292
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,255
8 degrees start timer

1293
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,047
Call me

1294
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,095
Degrees

1295
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:14,143
Explain 1000-2000

1296
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:16,447
Sunglass people showing up

1297
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:21,055
Also the average attendance of Detroit Lions games is actually higher

1298
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
A game

1299
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:24,127
So I don't know what he saying about that

1300
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
Detroit

1301
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
Anyway

1302
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
Why does it feel like why are you asking so many eminently answerable questions only

1303
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,951
To imply something instead of

1304
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:44,607
Looking for an answer and that was

1305
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,215
It's really hard to sell out

1306
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
Yeah

1307
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,591
80000 is a lot of people to get in any one place when it's freeze out

1308
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359
Yeah

1309
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
Like him

1310
01:06:59,199 --> 01:06:59,711
Calling out

1311
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,759
Chicago's identity is like

1312
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,831
Bears fans aren't even real Bears fans any

1313
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Screw you

1314
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,135
Care

1315
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,183
You from The Burbs

1316
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,975
NFL

1317
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:12,511
Theranos

1318
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
Lego drive across

1319
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Country

1320
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,215
I bet it's on cross-country number time

1321
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,239
Complaints about them

1322
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
I've got kids ranging from 11

1323
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:26,847
My youngest is going to be 2 in February

1324
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,175
And we take a summer road trip

1325
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:34,015
We we drive around the country the great United States of America

1326
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:39,647
And the last two years

1327
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
And

1328
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,487
Last this last summer

1329
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:44,767
And as we drove

1330
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
Go through

1331
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,583
I saw first-hand

1332
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,399
The America that most of us don't see

1333
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:52,703
Most of the people in in Austin don't see it

1334
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,519
We live in very privileged area

1335
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,335
The rest of the country looks like a bomb fell on

1336
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Country looks like

1337
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,151
Third world

1338
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,223
Country is is decapitated it's it's

1339
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,759
Completely define

1340
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,415
Because nobody's driving down that Highway

1341
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
My gosh

1342
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:21,887
Took my father and his brothers

1343
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
To the Grand Canyon and stuff

1344
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,495
There was the Majesty in the

1345
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,055
66 inseam

1346
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,871
Shops and restaurants

1347
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,407
Where is it I don't know where it is

1348
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
I got a couple

1349
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Things say about this

1350
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,759
The guys are supposed

1351
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Be like La New York Elite

1352
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,111
Flyover country app

1353
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:47,231
Everywhere in America look like

1354
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:51,839
Everywhere but the Flies the flyover states are disgusting

1355
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
Burbs

1356
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:57,983
Super weird

1357
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,079
Purely talk

1358
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,127
You captured

1359
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,407
I'm driving along interstate

1360
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
Highways

1361
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:12,831
We will pretty bleak if all you're seeing are old Billboards and like out-of-date gas station

1362
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
The other America

1363
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Visible lock

1364
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,439
A little ways off of Highway

1365
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Vibrant

1366
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,231
Would you totally Miss

1367
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:21,023
Is you're only seeing what's right now

1368
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791
Next to the road

1369
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,959
The first play

1370
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
Maybe they'd maybe it's

1371
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:34,591
Just like a f****** billboard to take him down

1372
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,991
It is insane how many Billboards are filled metric

1373
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,015
Trick of how the United

1374
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,295
It was doing

1375
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
GDP

1376
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,343
Drop weight

1377
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Is real bad

1378
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:52,767
Maybe the factory

1379
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,791
Spell maybe

1380
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:58,655
Maybe don't need

1381
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
Stopping every 10

1382
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
11:50

1383
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
Is really good for the local economy

1384
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
Chicago and California

1385
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:17,343
But it stopped being nearly as important

1386
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:19,391
In our highway system came into play

1387
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
Early on

1388
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,743
Dominance as a cross-country Road

1389
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,071
Does Prospero because people had to use it to make that kind of trip

1390
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:31,167
Ever since the passage of the Interstate Highway Act of 1956

1391
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,959
66 has gradually become lesson

1392
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
Important

1393
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
No it's really

1394
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:35,775
You know

1395
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,871
Some stretches

1396
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:47,551
It's been like read it over and over again it's not even the same thing

1397
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Yes

1398
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:52,159
I just tired of all of these peoples harkening back to us

1399
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,719
Ikea

1400
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
Right

1401
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Be great dad

1402
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:57,791
It's not

1403
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
It's not a system

1404
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,399
Nowadays

1405
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:08,031
Prosperous businesses everywhere along the highway is not something

1406
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,079
Exist in the modern world

1407
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,895
It's something that existed because of

1408
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
Necessity

1409
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,479
The time when

1410
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Cars were much

1411
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:19,807
Suffocated

1412
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,903
And no small amount of resist

1413
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,719
Distance to the idea of building railways

1414
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,047
Renewable-energy Railway

1415
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:32,607
There's 100

1416
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
About

1417
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,911
Seriously the opinion

1418
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,727
Somebody who's only on this show because

1419
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,079
He does

1420
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:43,615
And makes out with a bunch of money

1421
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,687
If you are a right-wing reactionary Dan

1422
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,735
There's one thing that unites all of them

1423
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
They hate

1424
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Rose

1425
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,879
Yep

1426
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
The future

1427
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,743
So

1428
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,279
Dubiel Cumberland

1429
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
Another gas

1430
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,607
This guy sucks

1431
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:08,447
He's just gone to talk about the transpacific

1432
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:13,823
Interview but not because of the interview

1433
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:17,663
Jasper is as he joins us

1434
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:24,575
He's a Graduate University of Idaho and joined the staff of the John Birch Society in 1976 as a researcher and currents

1435
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,855
Editor

1436
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,879
American

1437
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,439
Is

1438
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:32,511
Which is the original John Birch Society publication

1439
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
And became

1440
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
Bill Goldberg

1441
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
From way back

1442
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,655
Inverter

1443
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:42,495
Alex like he likes to pretend that he's not just a

1444
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,519
Society guy

1445
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
Is 100%

1446
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:49,663
Interacts with a JBS guy

1447
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
That comes out

1448
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,503
Any join just breakdown

1449
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,391
In 1992

1450
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,951
First Alert about

1451
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:04,511
The UN and the biospheres William F

1452
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,559
And so he joins us now

1453
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:12,959
Alex's intellectual from propaganda

1454
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,495
Society

1455
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
So

1456
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,287
I mean

1457
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,823
It's almost comical to me

1458
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Like the idea

1459
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
He knows

1460
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,431
Pretend most of the time

1461
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,991
To not really be so stupid

1462
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,575
He is absolutely

1463
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:32,415
Where is when my dad was abusing me with his boot book and I decided

1464
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,207
Start reading it immediately following

1465
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,743
Literary

1466
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,863
So Alex just makes clear that his lineage Trace

1467
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,655
Is back directly to the bird

1468
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,703
Dirtbag

1469
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,263
And the Republican leadership is

1470
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
George P bush

1471
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,383
They want to absorb the Tea Party

1472
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,175
What comes out of the jail

1473
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,735
And Ron Paul

1474
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,295
Everybody else after that

1475
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,879
We're not radical radicals all day

1476
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,463
Are the radicals usurping our Republic

1477
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,815
Because we're crazy

1478
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:14,143
There's one more

1479
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,679
They're f****** crazy

1480
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,983
Yeah there might be wild

1481
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:21,311

1482
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:27,711
Ing, Lakeside

1483
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575

01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:15,839
Bottom ball

1500

Inoperative

1501

Listed retail price anywhere

1502
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,703
To document what's happening

1503
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,983
The police bureaucrats

1504
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,263
Wildlife you name it

1505
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,055
Infowars.com

1506
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:31,711
So Alex is selling in order to keep wild police at Bay

1507
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,991
Add stop

1508
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
Concerned that he hasn't

1509
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,391
Protect themselves

1510
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,183
Also I love the idea

Abbey Road

1514
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,287
The incorrect legend about Nero

1515
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,103
Mother pelicula

1516
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,127
UConn Storrs

1517

And also tried to make his horse a senator

1518
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,991
Acura

1519
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:08,063
Historical gossip

1520
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
Specifically

1521
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:17,535
Completely wrong in thinking the Nero was the Book of Revelations

1522
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:25,215
I could be completely wrong but

1523
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,031
It's just interesting that he would specifically bring up

1524
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,311
Talking about how

1525
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,079
Evoland

1526
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,871
Inside Nero was

1527
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,151
Being crazy

1528
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,455
When is favorite book

1529
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,015
It's talking about how even well

1530
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,879

01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:49,023
Religious

1532
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,559
In our conversation

1533
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,143
So far there is no begging people to

1534
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,799
Here's what we're going to do I am going to tell you all of the facts about soil

1535
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:01,823

1536
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:06,175

1537
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:12,575

Maybe some miles racism

1545
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
Expect

1546
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:28,447
Not too surprising his

1547
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,519
Wildest stuff now is that is not so much

1548
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,055
View of what else

1549
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:35,103

1550
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:36,639
The hemp that's very interesting

1551
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,223

01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,159
Except

1556
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:50,463

01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:13,663
Choice

1589
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,711
In politics I'm paraphrasing quote

1591
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,087
I said I probably read

1592
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,415
Doesn't mean I skip over some of the more

1593
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,183
Factoid

1594
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,975
Inside baseball stuff

Information

1599
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:49,247
From my experience with Alex

1600
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:55,647
This tells me he's right for Pages baby

1601
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:58,207
Inside yourself

1602
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:03,071
Please remind me of how I always acted about

1603
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,167
Oh yeah

1604
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Hybrid

1605
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,824
Dial.

1606
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,968
Most of those boxes

1607
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:22,528
Whatever it is like I'm going to read something from your book

1608
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,088
I tried to read it and I could not make hide nor hair

1609
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,648
That's the way I've always treated those books

1610
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,464
I wanted to give you

1611
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:33,536
Impression that I read more of it cuz I felt like it was something

1612
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,328
I should have read

1613
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:40,448
So I always I always acted like that

1614
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,752
Need to have red all over

1615
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,800
There is no it's

1616
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,616
Excuse why in 1995

1617
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
Read it twice

1618
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:55,040
Yeah there's no reason why he wouldn't study this thing that like it's the Zapruder film in book form

1619
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,856
It's supposed to be the inside revelation of a

1620
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,160
Exactly what the globalists are their plans

1621
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,184
Their histories

1622
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,464
The most import

1623
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,512
Of all of these

1624
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,352
In 2013 he saying

1625
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
Midas800

1626
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,520
Over 18

1627
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
To about

1628
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,384
8 words

1629
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:24,224
Heard Exxon acceptable not even that

1630
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,528
Straight unacceptable

1631
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
If you're giving this

1632
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,344
Like a song

1633
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:33,952
You don't say I've read every every word of that book

1634
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232
Why would you

1635
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:39,072
The only reason

1636
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:43,936
Everyone knows you don't read s***

1637
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:50,336
Readable

1638
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,200
I would like

1639
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:59,040
What if one of those inside baseball pass

1640
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:03,136
Messages has literally Carroll Quigley being like dude I'm totally f****** with somebody

1641
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,184
Later on

1642
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,280
So that was fun I enjoyed that

1643
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,840
That was a really weak moment

1644
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,864
Confirmation

1645
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
Information about how much Alex is making

1646
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:19,520
How to get to know 7 years old

1647
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,336
Not a reader at this point

1648
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,872
Do your muscles

1649
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
Now

1650
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,176
Probably but

1651
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:31,296
This episode

1652
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,368
Larry klayman

1653
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,184

1657
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,688
Orgy

1658
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736

1659
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,504
Has become

1660
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
Dictator love

1661
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:08,160
Yes we're very concerned about that

1662
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,720
He was able to give us 10 minutes today

1663
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,000
He joins us

1664
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:18,912

01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,192
Full take Larry

1666
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,056
This is

1667
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104
I mean

1668
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408

01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:36,064
Yuri dark it's like I love this guy to the point where every season Overdrive

1670
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,880
This is supposed to end

1671
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,928
3 hour Berkeley

1672
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
Extending show

1673
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,488
Who is Larry Cook

1674
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,512
Give him 10 minutes

1675
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,840
He loves it

1676
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:51,936
And that's because Larry recently gotten a lawsuit

1677
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,752
Careers

1678
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,312
You can say that every day of his

1679
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:59,104
His career

1680
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,128
In a little bit of a lot

1681
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,432
This one is one that like

1682
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:08,576
You know how when like Ron Paul one couple of the caucuses look like

1683
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,856
What's that like

1684
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
The Crazies will I go

1685
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:17,280
This is our chance 2013

1686
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,096
The headline

1687
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,472
Unconstitutional

1688
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
I brought the case

1689
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:31,360
Larry klayman

1690
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:37,504
And then if you continue Politico story claiming crows we hit the mother lode

1691
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,320
I'm glad he's proud of defending the Republic

1692
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:44,416
Play Man versus Obama

1693
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:48,768
Which resulted in the judge ruled unconstitutional

1694
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:54,912
Nothing was done however because I need something that the government would

1695
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:55,680
Almost certainly

1696
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,448
Play peel

1697
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,264
When this reach the Circuit Court

1698
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,312
Because his record

1699
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,080
Were collected

1700
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,360
He didn't have standing

1701
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,384
To bring the complaint

1702
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,688
You was the lawyer and the plaintiff

1703
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,480
I was hoping it was because

1704
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,016
Is he wrote most of that

1705
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,320
Annovera overused Cran

1706
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:18,464
Larry added someone to the lawsuit theoretically have c2017 the district court

1707
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:19,744
Dismiss the suit entirely

1708
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:22,304
In 2019 the decision was reaffirmed

1709
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,328
And

1710
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,864
Did not do it

1711
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,448
Program

1712
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,496
It was a

1713
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:38,432
Trying to get attention out of Snowden

1714
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,992
Larry

1715
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:47,392
Day he's trying to ride that way

1716
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Or this decision

1717
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,696
Confirm the judge

1718
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,768
Hindsight

1719
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,352
Ultimately was meaningless really good

1720
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,168
This forced to take his crap

1721
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,192
Larry

1722
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,776
If your

1723
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Someone like Alec

1724
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,872
You might have every reason to think like

1725
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,152
Larry f******

1726
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,736
Actually got one we're on the ground

1727
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,040
Of what's going to turn out

1728
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
Yeah

1729
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,416
Play

1730
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,440
He's an embarrassment

1731
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,048
Breakfast

1732
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,328
Unfortunately

1733
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,912
20 trillion-dollar lawsuit against

1734
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,192
China

1735
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:35,776
Lizards eating loses lights

1736
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
I don't think it's going to go in

1737
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,528
You staying grounded

1738
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
Alright

1739
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,840
Larry's like

1740
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:04,192
Jesus Christ butt

1741
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,496
I was just pushing back on.

1742
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
Got to Capac

1743
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,032
Jesus

1744
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,312
You know it's almost

1745
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,360
It seems more

1746
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,640
Egotistical

1747
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
To compare yourself to Jesus

1748
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:21,088
Rosa Parks

1749
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,392
This is where the weather like

1750
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,184
I'm going to steal Rosa Parks like

1751
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,976
It's weight

1752
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,256
To try and steal Rosa Parks

1753
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:35,424
Too much playwright the matter of perspective

1754
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,704
I got just have some dirt

1755
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,496
Come on

1756
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:45,152
I know you're on Lenny Bruce mode over here trying to

1757
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:51,808
Is so edgy Jordan a religious material

1758
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:55,392
So

1759
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,072
Yeah

1760
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:09,472
Workout

1761
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,264
One last clip in that

1762
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,848
It's just really bring home of Alex

1763
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,408
Lovingly reclaim it and knowing it

1764
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,432
The present day

1765
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:22,016
Larry is trying to destroy Alex

1766
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,064
Because he

1767
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
Really believe

1768
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,696
He's a good guy

1769
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,792
That's what you say when someone is on the right

1770
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,816
Theme for you at

1771
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:45,056
Piece of s*** I hope he dies tomorrow

1772
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,104
Scooters and where's the last Larry

1773
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
I could go and going to town on it

1774
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,296
So were they bring this to the end of it was really interesting

1775
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:57,856
Sing to go into because it's so

1776
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:02,208
Trivial and a lot of ways going back in 2013 episode

1777
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,792
It's mostly an infomercial for his supplements

1778
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:06,816
Couch under the

1779
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:09,376
Guys of Avis Orioles back

1780
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,520
With

1781
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
Chicago

1782
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Dubious

1783
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,576
None of them rise to the level of like really interest

1784
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:32,160
Even the interview the interview with magic

1785
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:32,928
2bl

1786
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,208
I just would

1787
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:39,840
Care

1788
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:42,656
No that's terrible

1789
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:45,472
Broker program

1790
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,264
For interview

1791
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,360
Fill in the blank

1792
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,152
Not really that interesting

1793
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:55,968
Embarrassing

1794
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
But it is a nice retreat

1795
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:02,624
Reprieve from the present-day ohs

1796
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,160
Being a depressed

1797
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:04,928
Husk

1798
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:05,952
The person

1799
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Don't make me not

1800
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,680
Actually

1801
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
Topix do

1802
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,496
We are living

1803
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:19,776
In a time that is

1804
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:20,800
Our lives are touched

1805
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,080
Affected by

1806
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:22,848
Bing

1807
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,896
Like the black lives matter protest

1808
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:27,200
The conversation that happen

1809
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:28,224
Turning around those

1810
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
Is really relevant

1811
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,272
Matters

1812
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:33,088
Covid-19 situation

1813
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,368
Whether or not

1814
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:35,904
Take things serious

1815
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,208
And here too

1816
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,840
Difficult

1817
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:44,864
The house

1818
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:49,472
As lighthearted and fun as I wanted to be a lot of the time because it's like

1819
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240
Hey

1820
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
Tomorrow

1821
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,080
Any number of people who listen to the

1822
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
The show someone

1823
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,920
Indirectly by

1824
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:58,688
Something

1825
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:02,528
We're talking about

1826
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,832
Hasn't anyone who could get sick

1827
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:05,600
Maybe

1828
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:09,184
Difficult

1829
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,744
And it's really hard to not

1830
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,536
Have that in your mind

1831
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:16,352
When we're hearing about those sorts of

1832
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,424
You can be kind of nice to look back

1833
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:23,776
On this time Stakes to it

1834
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,576
Efficiency

1835
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,600
Totally sure

1836
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,368
So

1837
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,928
It's worth it

1838
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,464
It is

1839
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,536
Now to have the time capsule

1840
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,072
Looking back at 2013

1841
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
And being like

1842
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Oh that's right

1843
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,936
I remember the show that I signed up to

1844
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,360
To cover weirdo jumpers and soil

1845
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:03,968
More like future maybe we'll get back

1846
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,040
Yeah yeah and

1847
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,576
Make me realize this

1848
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,136
I should be more

1849
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:13,696
Being able to flash back a little bit

1850
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,232
Restorative

1851
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,096
I don't know

1852
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:28,288
Happy Birthday Robert for you on your birthday V butts

1853
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:31,872
Happy birthday

1854
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:38,784
Thank you Robert for appreciate

1855
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,368
2

1856
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:47,744
Very weird

1857
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,280
Chalk mark on your cable

1858
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,120
Nice day it's nice to know that we can all celebrate.

1859
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:02,336
I think part of the idea that Robert had was

1860
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:18,464
Very little idea what's going on in the world

1861
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
About it

1862
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,912
No also Google has robot

1863
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,192
Google

1864
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,776
No matter what era of Alex

1865
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:37,408
You are about anything that has to do with your life

1866
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
How to do plugs

1867
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:47,136
Because by the time this episode is used for its proper prepping wheel

1868
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:47,904
Taking over Google

1869
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:48,928

1870
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:52,512
Command Facebook and Twitter going to be gone by then

1871
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,448
Imma juicy Ice Cube

1872
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
Alex
