1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn and Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B. I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,560
With the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
Astronaut ice cream week continue

7
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
Okay summer

8
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
This week

9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,040
Kind of my bright spots for this week are all just going to be an astronaut ice cream anyone I thought I'd get in on the dream creamy summer

10
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,112
And actually send anti-brake spot

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
This brand

12
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Monex

13
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
Odell and I X

14
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Benelli open this openness and try it drive it

15
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
I think that there's an expectation of what you're getting when you get astronaut ice

16
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:54,688
You know it's the freeze-dried ice cream it's got a little bit of a crunch to it

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,296
There's a vanilla one here

18
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
That is not what you

19
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,416
Respect when you get in astronaut ice cream

20
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Itzchok

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,816
It's poorly held together powdery chalk

22
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
Kind of

23
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
Is similar

24
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:19,264
It kind of reminds you of ice cream a little bit I almost started talking but I I couldn't stop

25
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,568
You worked it out of my I don't want to make noises

26
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
It's not it's not attractive

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
No more enjoyable ignore is it astronaut ice cream

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
No it's more like if they f***** up a marshmallow real bad marshmallow was falling apart

29
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Lucky Charms Lucky Charms

30
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:47,168
Falling apart on a atomic level

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,800
Like like if if a marshmallow was in the Last Crusade

32
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
And drink from the wrong cup

33
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
What does it's disintegrate again

34
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,808
It's fired that is

35
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,392
I think that there isn't anything that stands out as like

36
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,696
The best thing I've had so far

37
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,744
But man that is

38
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:17,632
Real badass

39
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,008
Astronaut ice cream is a very specific thing that you're looking for

40
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,032
And if you're going

41
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,104
Going in looking for that experience at this is what they give you

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Wow

43
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,640
Caca

44
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,480
I know you're disappointed I can't imagine anybody being like you know what I want

45
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,808
Crumbly ass falling apart

46
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
Soft

47
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Powdery

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,208
What if what if this is more of a metaphor for the dark

49
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Truth of all the astronauts who went to

50
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
To the Moon with that where they got there and they're like

51
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
This Munchen is

52
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
Kind of bad

53
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,192
I don't really like it no.

54
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
The problems raptors raptors aliens Nazis on the dark side

55
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:02,176
Galactic treaty somehow

56
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:05,504
Does murderers married to the Raptor Queen

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
Trying to teach you a lesson about leaving the Earth

58
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
Well

59
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
If that's the case I'm staying here

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
Cuz that s*** sucks

61
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
What are bright spots

62
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,071
Beard is the Kids in the Hall have returned

63
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679
Survivor

It's fantastic really good

65
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,079
It's surprisingly good like they should not still be

66
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Able to just

67
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,919
Jump right back into that kind of timing and stuff and they

68
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,735
Just do it fantasties do they have the same theme song

69
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Oh yeah

70
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Iconic

71
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:46,207
The first guitar lick and you know what you're in for a I have

72
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Respect

73
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,535
Before the Kids in the Hall

74
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:56,191
I do but I know you're not nevermind nevermind thing I'm not sure exactly

75
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
I'm not saying who's bad obviously like this moonx

76
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
Right

77
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
It just be I wasn't I didn't hit

78
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
For me when I was younger

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,383
Understand

80
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:11,039
I mean he had your longstanding prejudiced against all things Canada has been finely I may be able

81
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
I do I did like brain candy though

82
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Yeah baby

83
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,255
Although I bet I wouldn't if I watched it again

84
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
You like it more now

85
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:26,143
Because you know that it destroyed the kids in the hall for 30 years did it

86
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,031
Yeah absolutely is there Monkeybone 100% making that movie made them all hate each other so much

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Let here we are

88
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:39,711
I just remember this evening it was just a few flipper thing amazed if he only thing I remember from the movie

89
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
That's great

90
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,087
Lot of dog in the new series

91
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,671
Jackass roof

92
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
That's

93
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,207
I will

94
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,535
I'm going to give this one out for free this conspiracy theory is going out for

95
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,863
For free to Alex and I think with this is how we know he's listening

96
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Alright

97
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
There has been a massive up taking dong recently

98
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Hey Mike the past five years right

99
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,127
The windshield Theory

100
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:11,967
And I think we're about to hear Alex be like all men

101
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:18,367
Do you know what causes civilizational collapse whenever people show Too Much dong you know Michelangelo's choke you much longer

102
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
The Renaissance ended immediately afterwards

103
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,815
You know the Greeks stay over they were all about. And it immediately afterwards you know I think we're there

104
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:33,215
Wants dong exposure early hotel but like jackass

105
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
Alright

106
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,799
Pompeii is right around the corner

107
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
So Jordan

108
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
Today we have an episode to go over that will not be as fun as

109
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
Complaining about astronaut ice cream and talking about Kids in the Hall

110
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
Let's not do it

111
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,903
Talking about May 15th 2022

112
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
Was Sunday's show

113
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,255
This is the day after the buffalo

114
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Shooting

115
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,839
Anthem

116
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,607
Hey

00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,215
Sort of set out to do Sunday and Monday

118
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,519
Cuz I figured that Alex would develop

119
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,543
Wings over the course

120
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,079
Of that time

121
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,175
It listening to Sunday I felt like well there's enough of that merits discussion

122
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
I'm here so

123
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,551

A little bit more of that stuff

127
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Butts

128
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,535
Predictable

129
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,303
There's some

130
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,583
Some little elements

131
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
That IR

132
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,655
Off the beaten path

133
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,495
And we'll get them to chat about it

134
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543

149
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Risen above

And then we're going

00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,783
At the end of the day

157
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,831
F*** you and your new world order

158
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,879

00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:04,511
Maybe I'll just be gone a month baby 5

162
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
Got to hear tomorrow

163
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
And you never see me again

164
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Really what I want to do

165
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
Apologize

166
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
The crew in the western

167
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
Was legitimately having break

168
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
A better tomorrow

169
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
Suffice it to say he is

170
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:29,599
Not better tomorrow he is much much worse

171
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,999
Yeah I think at this point everybody probably has some familiarity with the event

172
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
That's what happened

173
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,815
Over the weekend

174
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
And

175
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
I don't I'm not going to dwell too much on all that except as we go through the episode

176
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,543
Other things that come up

177
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:52,639
But here is Alex coming in on his Sunday show

178
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,919

Programming

183
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,863
Election fraud

184
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,263
From the election

185
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,015
But incel white supremacist would attack

186
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,367
Churches colleges and other facilities

187
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
And the preacher

188
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,207
Killing each other at each others throat

189
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Plunge the dollar

190
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,375
And 177 days

191
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
So I'll give Alex this much

192
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
He did absolutely say the false flags were coming and in some cases

193
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,127
He did say that he'll be white supremacist shooting minorities in order to demonize the right wing

194
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,759
I don't really care about that and it's not impressive at all because the reality is that Alex says that all the

195
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,087
I further don't care because Alex said all kinds of

196
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Other false flag

197
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Exit was coming

198
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,927
To which he's been wrong about because

199
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,487
How the school of Prophecy works

200
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,303
You make a million prediction tonight if one of them

201
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,607
Looks like it happened

202
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:23,775
You pretend that all the other predictions and never happened and that this was the only thing that you've been talking about all along

203
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,175
It's a really pathetic game and you can tell from the fact that Alex is leading his coverage with insisting he predicted the shooting

204
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:33,247
That he's not interested in anything past self-aggrandizing

205
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
This is a game to him yep

206
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,599
Like he's starting with I told you

207
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,159
You so mean it really does feel like what he

208
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,231
He just did is like open his show with like

209
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Oh boy

210
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:51,167
I sure told Alia you know I you know you listen to me and here I am just being right

211
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,471
All the time I'm so right all the time

212
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,543
That makes me feel good to be right all the time you know it's like

213
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
Is is

214
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,967
Coverage of the shooting begins with him making an appeal to his prophetic abilities

215
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,247
In order to

216
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
Try and sell the people should listen to him about all of his other b*******

217
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
That's essentially the game buddy

218
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Starting out with a knife I do to pour

219
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,767
Here is Alex giving some sort of jest

220
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,815
Applications for why he believes

221
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
That's this may be a false flag

222
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
Possibly can you print out the Wikipedia page did not

223
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
People have called and said he's going to attack

224
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
I can kill people

225
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
But nothing was done

226
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
All of Talk Radio

227
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
What was

228
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:51,839
Anything else

229
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
No one blamed talk radio or free speech

230
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
That's just the way that Alex sanitize is the claims that propagandist to spread the Great replacement Style

231
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Piercing theories

232
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:07,455
They played a critical role in the dissemination and popularization of the ideology that

233
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
The shooter in Buffalo was motivated by

234
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:14,367
Any radio host for TV presenter who wasn't obsessed with white birth rates and didn't

235
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
And spend most of their time fear-mongering about immigration

236
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
Is basically it can

237
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,767
Concerted plan to bring in white genocide

238
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Come up because

239
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Conversation wasn't about

240
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Free Speech or talk radio

241
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,679
It was about the very clear connection the people who spread this

242
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
Type of narrative

243
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,239
That you know like Alex

244
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
Kentucker do

245
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:37,663
The shooting was done by somebody who believes essentially the same thing that they preach

246
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:44,319
I was just going to talk about that because it's much easier and more profitable to yell false flag and pretend that you're actually the victim

247
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,647
When there's a racially-motivated shooting to left 10 people dead

248
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
It's f****** nonsense

249
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,231
That's Alex's claims

250
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,071
That support his assertion that this may be a fault I'm going to take them one by one

251
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
The first is that the

252
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Affected red-flagged

253
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Substantiate

254
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
And anyway

255
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
In June 2021 the police

256
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:08,895
Recalled after the shooter was a shooting at Susquehanna Valley

257
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
High School

258
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,247
In the process is house was searched by the FBI and New York State

259
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
Police but no charges were filed

260
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,087
And you just ended up being sent a cow

261
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
Report stories is that

262
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,255
If you sees any mention of the FBI or CIA in anything

263
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
Then his work is

264
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,303
Done

265
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,703
If you can point to them popping up anywhere he can Bluster the audience that he has some access to other Intel that shows that the FBI

266
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,263
Bi was closely monitoring dendron the

267
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
The shooter

268
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
The FBI's tasked with a whole lot of crime investigation

269
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:44,223
If they don't file any charges here

270
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
There's no reason to believe that they had this guy red-flagged

271
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:52,159
Syracuse.com is pretty clear that this incident probably didn't

272
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Lead them being put on any

273
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
That's like list

274
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:59,071
The second is the people have called and said he was going to attack and kill people

275
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:04,191
This is in relation to the incident from June 2021 and I do think that this is

276
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
Is probably something that should have been treated more seriously

277
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:12,639
But I'm not delusional enough to think that the government is going to allocate the resources needed to deal with this issue

278
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:13,663
In a way that helps

279
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Before it's too late

280
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,343
There are so Alex is taking that warning that someone had made into 2281 in

281
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Flying into the presents

282
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
Situation

283
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Doesn't approach

284
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
It wasn't a it wasn't a warning from the immediate

285
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,535
Santa got a warning for the lasting bright

286
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,607
He's playing fast and loose with details Cody

287
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
That's the only way to make it

288
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:41,311
There were some indications prior to this shooting that something was up but it was unfortunately too vague

289
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,079
Bixby useful

290
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:48,735
ABC7 out of New York reported the Chunnel Teague and operations manager for the store where the shooting happened

291
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,087
Quotes all the alleged shooter sitting on a bench outside of her store the day before the

292
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
The shooting

293
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:57,695
He was panhandling eventually came into the store where he appeared to be

294
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,719
Be bothering customers

295
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
Teague asked him to leave and he quote did so without an ARG

296
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,423
Apparently he'd also been there in March and have been asked to leave the store but

297
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
These are data points that only really feel

298
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
Critically important

299
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
In hindsight

300
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
I worked enough

301
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Retail environment

302
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Not type

303
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Place

304
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,223
To know that tons of people get thrown out of our ass to leave stores everyday

305
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:24,319
And I pretty much never leads to a shooting so it's not something that would be like

306
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,343
Uh-oh

307
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,879
Here is a

308
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:27,903
Crisis

309
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
It only means something after

310
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
The Crisis happen

311
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
Sprayer

312
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,863
Write a Manifesto

313
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,143
This is true but

314
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
It's meaningless in terms of making disappeared

315
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,983
Be anything other than a real shooting

316
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,799
Didn't give anyone Advance warning

317
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
The Shooting Center

318
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
He published

319
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Right before the shooting which

320
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,151
Also streamed on

321
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:54,527
Incidentally there were some warning signs that could have been caught but they were made in a place

322
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,575
They would have been exceedingly difficult for

323
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
For police to find them

324
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:01,439
Gendron had a private Discord server and even posting music

325
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Sings about his plan

326
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
And also racist ship

327
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,279
4 months there before the shooting

328
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:11,679
Based on New York Times article about this it seems like no one else was in the server's there wouldn't have been any one there to sound the alarm

329
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:16,287
Hey Discord is not particularly well known for its content moderation policies

330
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,591
Add practices and like

331
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
If Alex were too

332
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
Think that the police should have

333
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,271
I do have on every discard it seems like that's against his

334
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
4th amendment ideas

335
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:33,439
If Alex's point is there was ample opportunity to intervene here before it was too late

336
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
That may be true

337
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
But nothing you brings up

338
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,327
Comes anywhere near even making me suspicious about

339
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
The shooting being a false flag

340
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
All of it just seems like

341
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Like classic

342
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
I like opportunities for things

343
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Things to be missed

344
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
Yeah it does

345
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,311
Just feel like

346
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,127
The only circumstance

347
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,431
In in here is that

348
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,503
You know when you when you say he needs to go to counsel

349
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Not

350
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
It's. You know the problem isn't a mental illness

351
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,647
Problem is he's joined

352
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,671
To get you know

353
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
So so when you refer them to counseling for something that's not

354
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,351
If you can if you join a youth group you're not going to

355
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,959
People are going to be like all will he's mentally ill it's socially it makes habitation of

356
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:21,055
Of mental illness personality disorder joining a gang

357
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,871
It could be a number of factors put

358
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,407
Of course

359
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,431
Amazing isn't it

360
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
That's the only place for intervention

361
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
And I thought

362
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
You know you know

363
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
Messerli help with that and it also

364
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
Counseling as I think both of us can attest

365
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:39,999
From our lives is really only effective if your act

366
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Actively involved

367
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:46,399
Doesn't seem to work if you don't want to be there not something that can be done to you

368
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,191
Necessarily it's active

369
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,519
Process you engaged with now that's basically mind control a fake

370
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:54,847
I can do it again

371
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
I think I think

372
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:02,015
In terms of the stuff that I can tell one of the opportunities that is messed

373
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Is

374
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,391
Shooting threat

375
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,719
Yeah there's an opportunity to take his guns

376
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,535
Put him on some kind of a watch list

377
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,119
Why wasn't that done

378
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:21,215
Imagine if that had been done yet that would be tyranny

379
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
Yeah I mean

380
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,847
Why hasn't that Bennett because of you because of the way that you have behaved constant

381
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
For the past your entire life

382
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:32,223
Project is making sure people

383
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
I mean it's it's hard not to say that it's like

384
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Well if you think

385
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
But that would have stopped this

386
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,767
Then you are taking responsibility for this happening

387
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,375
It seems really weird and I don't really know how to disentangle those points

388
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
So

389
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,263
Alex Alex has a theory about what happened

390
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,287
Hiiraan

391
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,823
Really really bad

392
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:02,687
The government

393
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
New York time

394
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,975
Is the left

395
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Kill each other

396
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
Criminology no

397
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
The media

398
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,239
Enough race war news

399
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:29,823
Black supremacist

400
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Betty White

401
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,247
And think there's not Justice

402
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
The globalist

403
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Playing

404
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
Sides off

405
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,183
Against each other and we got

406
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,975
To be smart enough to understand that

407
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,031
Two black women loading groceries in their car what the hell

408
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:06,431
Rockefellers

409
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,199
Cool boy

410
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,783
It's not how you cover this stuff all right

411
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,343
If I understand correctly his point is

412
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:18,208
This is the left's fault for making the right one to kill people

413
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,280
And this is the right fault for not killing the right p

414
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
I guess

415
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,144
This is just a cowardly rambling and nonsensical angle that Alex

416
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Taking

417
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:31,008
There's a lot of dumping in dodging trying to move quickly enough that the audience just nods and

418
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:31,776
Except

419
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
This ain't but it's s***

420
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:35,616
Endpoint where

421
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,920
You have no one's shooting up the UN if that's

422
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
That's f***** up

423
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,992
Untangle this

424
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
This b*******

425
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:47,904
Just trying to make is that this whole thing is the media's fault because the media is trying to further the globalist

426
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
Plan which is to have us all kill each other

427
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:55,840
No mind to the fact that the global is playing his supposed to be super bio-weapon indoor starting World War 3

428
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
Today's news

429
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,192
Or the main thing that he Hypes up is

430
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
Is a race war

431
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,240
Well but

432
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,520
Call me when it's

433
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:07,104
Necessary other days at the super bioweapon

434
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,384
In order to

435
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,784
Push this forward DVD around the bunch of stories about how white people need to be killed who which I should point out that

436
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Didn't do that didn't have

437
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,208
In response to these stories racist black people take it upon themselves to kill white people like this person in Waukesha

438
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,744
Then races

439
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,840
People see these people

440
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:34,240
Ultimately announces conception the white terrorists would not have done this if it weren't for the prior racist terrorist

441
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
I'm done by black people against white people

442
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,312
It really all of this

443
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
Comes back to the media Target

444
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
At the root

445
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:44,992
And at the end of every branch of this tree what violence is Justified

446
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,528
Even while Alex pretends

447
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
The Condemned

448
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
Alex said that there's a black supremacist in Kenosha but what

449
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:55,488
Doing is mixing up Kenosha and Waukesha probably because the hours he spent

450
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,256
Defending

451
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
I am yelling about Kyle written

452
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:02,144
The car attacking Waukesha happened during their Christmas parade

453
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Read last year

454
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:06,496
Darryl Brooks the person arrested in the attack has posted some

455
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Stuff you would call racist

456
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
Online of the past

457
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,408
But I can't find any indication that his motive in the attack was to kill white people

458
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,992
This is the leap that Alex is making which reveals

459
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:17,760
His own race

460
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:24,672
The attacking Waukesha is awful and I'm not interested in minimizing it but it's a case where a black person ran a car into a crowd

461
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,464
And 6 people who were killed

462
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,744
I happen to be why

463
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:32,864
In the shooting in Buffalo you have someone who intentionally set out to kill black people

464
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Inspired

465
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
Entirely by a racist ideology

466
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,984
These are not analogous situation

467
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
But Alex needs them to be

468
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,408
Because he needs to be able to point to the Waukesha attack to soften the blow the reality of what happened in Buffalo

469
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,248
What happened to Buffalo's way too close to Alex's ideology in the ship

470
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,784
3 sezon are everyday

471
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
So this is a game he has to

472
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
The play

473
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
It's inexcusable and it's

474
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,464
Absolutely intentional whether or not Alex is even aware of what he

475
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,232
He's doing anymore

476
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,512
It's it's

477
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
Dogshit

478
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
Hate it

479
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
I mean it's hard not to it's hard not to look at that

480
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
Just think like man this is America you know

481
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
Like

482
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
You can imagine the first f******

483
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
King pilgrims

484
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,616
Killing a Native America

485
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,200
Can being like hey man you shouldn't have if you hadn't walked on my property

486
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,296
I mean it's your fault really I put up a sign that says I own this now

487
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
You know it's mine

488
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
And it and that's justification did all these trying to kill white people

489
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
Just just you see it the whole f****** way

490
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,536
Through American history from the jump

491
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Yeah

492
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
It's so interesting

493
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,936
The way that Alex is trying to

494
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:44,032
Artificially create the appearance of nuance in the analysis

495
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,104
While at the same time all it is doing is

496
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Being like

497
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:55,552
Hey really there was a mass shooting where black people people were killed by a person who was sitting out

498
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:01,184
Specifically to kill black people write really the lesson we should learn is be nicer to wifey

499
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
What

500
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
That is the point

501
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,048
It is

502
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:12,448
You know I'm starting to think that the oppressors really don't like it whenever they get told their oppressors they like to elect

503
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
You know you got while you guys are so great

504
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
All the time

505
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:21,664
This is all about the New York Times running that whole thing about the

506
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,480
The slavery the history of slavery xt19 project

507
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:32,416
Yeah if people hadn't learned about American history than we've never would have had to deal with racism

508
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Whatever so Alex

509
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
He's

510
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Who's pretty early in the show

511
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
The Alex's Bears I was just

512
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Flabbergasted

513
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,472
Royce White is a former NBA player

514
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Martial arts

515
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
As well

516
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,336
Mixed martial arts

517
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:52,896
Ilhan Omar

518
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,176
He is about

519
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,968
Over here

520
00:25:57,248 --> 00:26:00,320
He's got a special

521
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,880
He was set to host today but things were so hot

522
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,696
Thought I had to come in and give you my

523
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,864
Play the excerpt

524
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,400
Very very specifically

525
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
So Alex

526
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,288
Leaves

527
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,616
The rest of the first hour and into the second hour

528
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,640
Before he comes back

529
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:31,040
And is rationalization for why he jumped on to do what we just listen to it

530
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
This is just like

531
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,880
Okay so I know that you probably experienced

532
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Dislike

533
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,744
Some kind of a local show

534
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,048
And the person who runs the show

535
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
They're not booked on it

536
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,120
They don't have a set on the show

537
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,984
But there's a huge turnout and they're like I got to give I got to get

538
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
Because it's like there's too many people listening

539
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,920
Get some of this attention for myself

540
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,456
Yep

541
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
No no

542
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
Predictable

543
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,112
Behavior that's kind of hard to

544
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
Hard to resist

545
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,440
I think I did it once

546
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
I think we had handsome

547
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,632
Squeeze myself

548
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
Impulse is the same

549
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Kind of desperate

550
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,776
But I was also a desperate

551
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,616
No-name

552
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:34,016
You know any states nice I've been on the one side of it I've never been on the other cuz I've never run to show successful enough to

553
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:40,416
You want to do a set at my own show Fahrenheit always been like man I'm going to host this but I'm not doing a second over like that

554
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
That's fair

555
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,024
Yeah I was I was shocked

556
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
I was like all right

557
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,096
Alex is going to go away

558
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
Well I mean

559
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
We can avoid the

560
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240
The reality I feel like

561
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,008
That

562
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Alex

563
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
Feels good

564
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Right now

565
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,872
Because of a mass shooter

566
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
Yep

567
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
So you know

568
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:04,736
I mean

569
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:09,088
That's that's real bad real bad you know he's he's like

570
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,904
A mass shooting happened

571
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
Now I'm going to get a lot more viewers

572
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,768
And that is how we live

573
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
That's how we live in the world

574
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
Royce White host

575
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,888
For a bit

576
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:27,008
This dude is definitely not going to be till on Omar

577
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,360
In the second hour a true to form and as promised

578
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Alex does comeback

579
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
He comes back

580
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
The first thing he sets out to do is

581
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,760
Really lay the groundwork

582
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,552
Of what the narrative this is supposed

583
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
We are now in

584
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Terrible

585
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,000
Black

586
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
Predominantly black grocery store in Buffalo New York

587
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Predicted

588
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,912
19 year old incel

589
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,960
Corporate

590
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Because it's

591
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Their fault is happening

592
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:05,664
Way to take all the guns

593
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Swag

594
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
A year ago

595
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,064
Pieces coming together about how Alex is going to cover the

596
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
He's got the he was red-flagged talking point there in order to help establish the narrative that there was for knowledge of the attack

597
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Back on the party of it

598
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,512
The authorities

599
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,608
And that's the globalist to essentially let this happen so they could demonize the right wing

600
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,448
You'll notice that Alex is perfectly comfortable calling this a white

601
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:32,032
Assist attack where is he usually tries to pretend to white supremacy doesn't even make

602
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Exist

603
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
This is because it's already that he thinks protect himself or taking any heat from sounding really similar to

604
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
To the shooter

605
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,296
This is Alex's been predicting

606
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Volkswagen

607
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
For a while which

608
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,904
The globalist who used demonize the right wing

609
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,696
Particularly right-wing media figure

610
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,328
Because Alex has that in place already it's unnecessary added work to pretend this guy wasn't

611
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
Actually a white supremacist

612
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:02,496
You don't have to invalidate the reality of the attack if you can invalidate the entire reality we're in the attack

613
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,520
Took place

614
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:07,360
There's no indication that gundren was an incel and that word doesn't

615
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,504
The pier in the entirety of his 180-page Manifesto although he does make fun of incels

616
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,064
In his post on Discord

617
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,088
Fresh

618
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,136
I don't believe that

619
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
As an accurate description of his

620
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,792
His beliefs yeah I mean he puts in cell in there because it diminishes the masculinity is

621
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
If we know one thing about Alex

622
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
It's that he likes

623
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,936
Dafuq so this allows him to create some sort of

624
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,032
Look at that distance between himself

625
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:41,664
And I accused him of associated with incels

626
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,992
And who is but you know he doesn't deal with themselves

627
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,344
Maybe his good buddy Nick Fuentes

628
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,136
Got to confuse outdated losing

629
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,512
So also I believe that the reason Metallica's using this epithet

630
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
To describe the shooter

631
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
He's because

632
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,144
In the predictions that he made in the past

633
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,216
He use the word incel he's trying to use

634
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
He's using this descriptor in the present

635
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,872
To describe the situation so it matches his prediction that evaded the past

636
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,920
That's essentially what's going on

637
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,992
After every shooting Alex pretends the people are going to

638
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,296
But, take all the guns which is never happen

639
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:24,672
And when he's been asked to provide examples of moves to restrict gun ownership after shootings and deposition

640
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,488
He's been unable to say even a single example

641
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,048
This is just a base was talking point that uses

642
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
Is all the time to push the audience

643
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Same with the blaming all

644
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Conservative media thing

645
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,520
But doesn't ever happen at again right now no one wants to blame conservative media

646
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,128
They want conservative media figures to stop spreading racist great replacement Style

647
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Conspiracy bulshit

648
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
And take responsibility for the harm to that behavior

649
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
That's

650
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
The reality of the situation without

651
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Buck

652
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,696
Maybe wasn't completely staged

653
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
I mean

654
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
It's just like

655
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
He said the reason that he started

656
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,424
The white supremacist

657
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
Is going to attack false flag is so weak

658
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:13,312
Feel protected when this moment happens I know and that's what we've

659
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,176
Discuss the many many times it shouldn't be

660
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
You can't

661
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,528
Anyway

662
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,136
I guess I would ask you this question then delete into this club

663
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:31,232
Do you believe that there is any value in

664
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
Immediately

665
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,352
Throwing around in bandying

666
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
Ideas about this shooting being faked

667
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,704
Like with no real reason

668
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,104
I mean for real evidence backing you up we don't know maybe

669
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
Maybe if you're in the writers room of

670
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,688
The Kids in the Hall

671
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
Does not know not Canadian

672
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
Was this

673
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,368
Completely stage run by the FBI

674
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,184
But historically many cases

675
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
No one died or not

676
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Collectively

677
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
Libertarians and populists

678
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:15,776
Nationalist

679
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Dylann roof

680
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:23,968
The church

681
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:27,040
You know years ago should killing 10 black people as well

682
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
The did the Terrible

683
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:39,584
So it's fair enough why people and Christians and populist shouldn't be blamed for the attack in

684
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,656
I don't know if anyone outside maybe some people on Twitter

685
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
I don't think anyone's doing that

686
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
The shooter is ultimately to blame

687
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
Conversation about social responsibility as it relates to broadcast and racist propaganda is being flirted with by the

688
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,944
Media has happened a bit and then

689
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Set the

690
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Drop the ball

691
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
On this conversation

692
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Through to a productive

693
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,320
Conclusion

694
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,344
What's going on

695
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
You see Alex Drive

696
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
Completely stories of instances

697
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:08,256
The killings in a way that's meant to sanitize white supremacy

698
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
This killings

699
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,816
Could I come up with

700
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:17,216
An example of a black mass murderer who is motivated by clear racist ideology comprable to the shooter or Dylan

701
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Barracuda

702
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
I think it would be impossible for him

703
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
He's

704
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
Unfortunately saying the exact same

705
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,480
Something that he would have about any mass shooting 5 years ago

706
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,808
But because he's faced minimal consequences so far

707
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
He's saying it with

708
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Extra step

709
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,904
You know like

710
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,952
Hey I'm not saying this is a false flag

711
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,792
I'm saying it you know

712
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
I'm not saying that

713
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:49,472
It is that there's no way the conservatives could be responsible for this I'm just saying that it's not a white people do it that you know

714
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,800
Ultimately what we're watching him do is

715
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
Claim responsibility for this

716
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,640
And then wagatail in our face

717
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,712
Yep Lee

718
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,760
Bno do not not to put

719
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
But the

720
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Sort of racist

721
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,672
Conspiracy theory that white murders are covered up by the media is

722
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
Is literally part of what dylann roof

723
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,792
Said inspired his path

724
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
His

725
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Mass shooting

726
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
So

727
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,400
Congratulations on

728
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,496
Pushing ideology even in your response to this

729
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,520
About how

730
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Your hands are totally clean

731
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Yeah

732
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Go fuc

733
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Yourself

734
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Anyway here's more b*******

735
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:30,944
The globalist

736
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
They need a

737
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,880
Cascading Civil War

738
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
As the preacher

739
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Text bring in

740
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
Two of the

741
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,232
Lockdown

742
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
The martial law

743
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
What is Schwarz

744
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Lockdown

745
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,328
This is cheating

746
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,352
4 months

747
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Maybe even

748
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:52,448
A year-and-a-half Alex has been saying the covid lockdowns were to prepare

749
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
For climate lockdown

750
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
Open fairy consist

751
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:01,920
He would talk about articles about how pollution went down during quarantine or articles about how much battery was for the environment that's open

752
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
People weren't driving

753
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,528
You talk about energy rationing and ideas that car is being tracked

754
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
Trace by the mile

755
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
This was the globalist playing according

756
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,136
Alex

757
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,952
Because it fit with his normal climate change denial ism

758
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:14,976
And conversations

759
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Is it before having dude like

760
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,048
Ipcc reports

761
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
And what have you

762
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
But now there's a story about a white

763
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
What is mass shooter

764
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,824
Now they're race war lockdowns over the plan apparently

765
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
Climate lockdown

766
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Not so important

767
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
On the back burner

768
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,736
Alex is doing this because his narratives are always about

769
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Against

770
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:44,160
Generally it's good to just fear Monger by climate-related issues because most of the right-wing ecosystem relies on money that goes

771
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,464
Back to billionaires tied into the energy Market

772
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,744
And that's a whole lot of

773
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,304
Conservatism revolves around that bedrock

774
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
But

775
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
It's secondary for Alex

776
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,656
Creating cover for white supremacy

777
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
Murderers

778
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,544
Alex can put aside the climate lockdown ideas when there's an opportunity to use the fear of coming

779
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,896
To make it easier to sell as audience on the idea that this horrific shooting was actually org

780
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,432
Castrated by his imaginary anime

781
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
That sucks

782
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
Like I said this is not cool

783
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,392
I would ever be serious if I was listening to that and I was in his audience and I believe

784
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,232
Because I would be paying attention to the things he's saying Alexa

785
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,560
Griswold lockdown come on man yeah I know

786
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,328
I mean

787
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
You couldn't answer I mean

788
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,168
It would demand better

789
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:27,936
Just

790
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,240
That's

791
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:37,152
Somebody stop him I wanted to be a bat signal something

792
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
OfficeMax

793
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,016
What is wrong with all of us

794
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,320
I think that's

795
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:49,696
If I have any sense of things are going with the lawsuits and such

796
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,024
I do think that that is a shoe that's waiting

797
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
I think it may be a matter of time

798
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:58,912
And a million or two million in Bitcoin isn't going to do s***

799
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
In terms of

800
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,984
The ultimate consequences

801
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,008
That may be,

802
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,544
Financial aid

803
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
And so I think

804
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,872
I think we need not a Batman

805
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,920
We just need

806
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,736
But that process to be allowed to run its course

807
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:19,136
That's what I think it's really hard not to have that feeling of wanting a Batman

808
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
It's just like

809
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,696
I can

810
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,976
I can't imagine

811
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
Acting this shity

812
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
Yeah

813
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,328
It's it's like

814
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
George

815
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Your Existence is tolerable

816
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,312
Nan this situation

817
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,152
You know like this should be a day where everybody just agrees like

818
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
We're not going to air Alex or Tucker

819
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,552
I could do it so Alex was planning to take the day off

820
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Exactly

821
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,136
Kaitlyn

822
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:56,256
Taking the day off he came in to remind you how much it makes him feel good

823
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,144
To talk about mass shootings and how he's right about everything and how he called this

824
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,520
The whole taking a Victory lap or whatever it's disgraceful

825
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
What what

826
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,336
F***** didn't predict another

827
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
The goddamn Mass shooter

828
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Is there enough

829
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,712
So anyway Alex

830
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Fusing

831
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,880
Yeah I don't dwell on this one for a little bit

832
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:23,904
Whatever

833
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,352
But we will the Sun

834
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
And we have the

835
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,496
Livestream shooter video from twitch

836
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
Into a

837
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Synagogue

838
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,296
People terrible crime

839
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,832
Put on

840
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,720
You do not blame the Telecommunications medium

841
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,256
The people commit crimes on

842
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
Verizon

843
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
Do you blame Southwestern Bell I mean

844
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Crazy show

845
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
There's a lot of difference

846
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
I'm soaking

847
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,640
Confused by what Alex is trying to say about Telecommunications

848
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,992
He starts off by talking about twitch and gab because the Buffalo shooters

849
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
Stream the attack on Twitch

850
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,320
Because Robert Bowers post

851
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,600
They're quite regularly

852
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
Not just on the day of his shooting

853
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
At the synagogue

854
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Incidentally Hitman shooting was also believed that the Jews globalist by Bring It

855
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Coincidence

856
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,192
It starts off about how you

857
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,496
You don't blame these telecommunications for the attacks

858
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
The people carry out

859
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
I guess that's fine

860
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
Blame them

861
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,200
Organize our livestream a racist Act of terrorism

862
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,248
It should be time to see what

863
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,784
To be changed about the

864
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
The platform

865
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Bood up

866
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
But maybe Soul search

867
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
Well I mean

868
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,184
If you start talking

869
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,304
Sing about that you're a slippery slope away from the things that other people say on other toe

870
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
Communication

871
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,608
Platforms like for instance

872
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,192
You know you don't want somebody going out there and saying like oh

873
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,288
Look at all the things that he believes that sounds a lot like this person on this show

874
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,432
The risk of is killing the First Amendment

875
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,552
If you do any kind of content moderation on these sites that would

876
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:32,160
Limit the ability of people trying to organize and inspire

877
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Yeah agroterrorism

878
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:38,560
Doesn't want you to hold any of them accountable

879
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
He points

880
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,120
To be problems but

881
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,912
The obvious solution to these problems

882
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,960
Counter to his ideology

883
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Guess we can't do any

884
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Guess we're stuck

885
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
So Alex talks about not blaming bees

886
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Things

887
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,175
Jumps to someone calling 911 to report a crime

888
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,991
I was in any way similar to the other

889
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,015
Things he's talking to

890
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,807
Doesn't make any sense

891
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,903
This is severely disjointed and it seems indicative of how little of a point

892
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,255
Also not to be believed

893
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Your butt

894
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,631
Conspiracy that the murders of white people are covered up by the media is literally Woodhill improved

895
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:19,007
Literally so Alex is really hit map to hit Matt drum pretty hard

896
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,055
Yep real shity

897
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
The globalist

898
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
Maturing more of this

899
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,575
Follow the script

900
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,399
5 minutes or so

901
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,447
Some of these specific

902
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
Because

903
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
The mind

904
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
The globalist

905
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:54,847
War games

906
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,063
Adobe in a race war because there is an Undeclared race war against white people

907
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
Run by the way

908
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
Cause the real race war

909
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Whoa

910
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,439
So what do you think about that

911
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,719
Well

912
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,511
I think

913
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,327
Alex is saying

914
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
That

915
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
He's looked

916
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,959
Did the current landscape and he sees the ascendance of the far-right in the fact

917
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,495
That these shootings are going

918
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
I mean unresponded to Beyond

919
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:28,639
Thoughts and prayers so he assumes that that's going to accelerate and increase

920
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
The frequency of the

921
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,783
And then people will rightfully blame him but again nobody's going to do anything about it so the far-right politician

922
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
Are going to sweep

923
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,135
The f****** Nation the based on terrorism

924
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
That they tacitly supports

925
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,231
But there is a

926
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,583
Undeclared race war in the media against white people

927
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,655
Yeah that one that one was I forgot about

928
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,959
Essentially

929
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,823
It in Subway's he's framing white supremacist terrorism as

930
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Self-defense

931
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:04,479
Well maybe on wise and his conception but that is how they think of

932
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:09,855
Yes like they really do think that it's not possible for white people to coexist with other

933
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,671
I think that there is

934
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
Degrees of that but yeah

935
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:20,607
I mean well you are one of those degrees

936
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
The degrees are going to

937
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:26,239
Go up let me know clear I think some of the degrees are in belief

938
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:29,055
The people have and some of the degrees are in Howell open

939
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
People are willing

940
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,639
Alex

941
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:35,711
You're obviously one of the examples we always go back to his him

942
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,295
Being freaked out by Muslim women in a pool supply shop

943
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:44,671
You know like that is the level of unwilling to co-exist abs

944
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
Also there's people who speak much

945
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,047
More

946
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,583
I openly about like

947
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,607
Wanting

948
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,143
No I'm coexist

949
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
People to get out of

950
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
The country Alex doesn't

951
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
He's not willing

952
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,031
Going to be that

953
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:04,383
Blunt right so be hard to pin that exact idea on him although

954
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
He does seem to have

955
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,199
Luther his beliefs that are expressed

956
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:11,551
Some inclinations towards that direction

957
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,319
We have

958
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
2

959
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,135
Start looking at him and say

960
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Well

961
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:21,279
If you're running interference for the people who are acting on the fears that you

962
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,095
Express part of their act

963
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
You know you're if you're if you're outfit skating like oh no I'm not saying that I want this

964
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:37,919
You want everybody to not do anything about this problem I let it continue it's a tough line to draw a

965
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Bad ID and

966
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
I think board

967
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,247
Should be done

968
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
So Alex

969
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:47,135
Is leading into this video that proves that he predicted

970
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,207
And this will be the rest of our episode

971
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
Discuss

972
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Hit the clips

973
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
30 put into a compilation

974
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,863
We can do this together

975
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
How bad is

976
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,679
Is this time well Alex predicted it

977
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,959
We called it

978
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
So here's his

979
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
Infowars.com

980
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,079
Tomorrow's news today

981
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Derrius guice

982
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:11,711
The last couple years where I specifically predicted it

983
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,783
On Friday a few days ago

984
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,575
Tomorrow

985
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,647
Few minutes of this go to break and come back with Royce White

986
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,279
Yeah so this video was titled Alex Jones

987
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,095
Predicted the white supremacist false flag shooting

988
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
@black

989
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Grocery store

990
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,959
So based on the title of this video

991
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
Alex is calling

992
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:40,895
As much as he might want to pretend like we don't have all the details yet so that's pretty explicit in the title now

993
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,687
Keep that in mind

994
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
That is the title of the video

995
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:48,319
So it's the stated goal that we should be

996
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
Watching this with that's the thesis

997
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:51,647
Well if you're saying this

998
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,719
You can't even say this is as like a

999
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
Observation

1000
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,559
It says it's an implication

1001
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,327
No matter what

1002
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
You know it's not an implication

1003
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,663
Real name where it just says Alex Jones claims that there will be a false flag you can be like well no that's just an observation of right

1004
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Stingy you're saying it

1005
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,879
Replaying it on his show it posted on his website

1006
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
This is at least

1007
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,303
A tacit acceptance that this is the this is the editorial line or going

1008
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,351
Here is the first clip

1009
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
That's in here

1010
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,447
Actually is a starting out on the strongest foot

1011
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,239
So what are they going to do

1012
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
Piranha attack

1013
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
A minority

1014
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,615
Church or College

1015
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,431
Grocery store some type of

1016
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
Minority gather

1017
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,503
So that's

1018
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,039
Pretty

1019
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,343
That's a great way to start this compilation

1020
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,903
Is that where that clip that he played End

1021
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,023
This is a clip from June 25th 2021

1022
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,071
I guess that Alex included grocery

1023
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,399
Tree stores as a possible Target in the list of some other places

1024
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,447
And this was almost a year ago

1025
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
I guess he should get a pat on the head

1026
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
Cuz you did say grocery

1027
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:17,151
It should probably be pointed out that this isn't an idea I'll just pulling out of thin air

1028
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,807
In August 2019 Patrick crusius carried out a mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso killing 23

1029
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,343
Motivated by great replacement

1030
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,111
Conspiracy theory

1031
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
This was something that happened

1032
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,183
Not too distant

1033
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,743
In Texas so it's hard

1034
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,535
Had to be that impressed by Alex

1035
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
It's also important to understand

1036
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
Contact

1037
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,911
Of this prediction that Alex's make

1038
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,287
It's not a generalize prediction that this false flag is going to happen at some point like

1039
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
Year later

1040
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,847
Here's how the show open

1041
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,151
Sims on June 25th 2020

1042
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Amish

1043
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
And general

1044
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
Twin

1045
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
Marshall Street

1046
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
The real president

1047
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
Pets come out

1048
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
A absolute

1049
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Chad

1050
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
SS are going to stage

1051
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
Flags I had

1052
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,167
The evidence of

1053
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,055
Generals lansinger be false Flags

1054
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,383
The cover of the results of the 2020 election results being audited

1055
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:24,991
And then Alex was just riffing about the sort of places he imagines might be targeted

1056
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:30,879
And the grocery store probably comes up in his head because of vague memories about yelling about the El Paso shooting

1057
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,695
This isn't really valid as a pronoun

1058
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
Diction of the shooting

1059
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,535
Buffalo in any way

1060
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
So

1061
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,607
I don't know let's see what what's the next

1062
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,167
Massive white supremacist

1063
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Media

1064
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
You're going to be bad

1065
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
Bleeds into the 8:01

1066
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,383
But honestly the clip itself is meaning

1067
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,431
Says this kind of stuff all the

1068
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:57,503
I'm going back to the earliest days I found a new show

1069
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,783
The globalist archons

1070
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,087
Philly planning these fake attacks to make a right

1071
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
Extremist book

1072
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:04,159
There's nothing specific about this

1073
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,439
It's not even recent

1074
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:11,327
This was from July 29th 2021 and Alex is calling into the show because he's on a work

1075
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Casein

1076
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:16,703
Here's the context of the clip that they've selectively cut out to be in this compilation of

1077
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:19,519
What's being so right about all of his

1078
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,567
I'm sick

1079
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
My stomach all the time

1080
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Because

1081
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,151
Responsibility

1082
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,295
People assaulting us

1083
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:39,743
Call Flags

1084
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:41,791
Throwback Thursday

1085
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
And or launcher

1086
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
War and Order Cyber attack

1087
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Pandora mask

1088
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,007
Programming in the media

1089
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,287
So you know it's kind of like

1090
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,639
Problems of using the clip in the way they did

1091
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:03,039
The first is that Alex has specifically talking about pro-vaccine people being targeted for false-flag to make anti-vax people

1092
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,343
Look back cuz that's the narrative he was on that day

1093
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,415
There is no relation to the Buffalo shooting at all

1094
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:13,279
The second problem explains why the clip in this compilation starts where it doesn't

1095
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,167
Conveniently edits out the part where it shows it's just a long list of possibilities

1096
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:22,239
Everything he's doing is just throwing s*** at the wall

1097
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:25,823
This is literally the dynamic I was talking about earlier on in the show

1098
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
He makes 100 prediction

1099
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,895
I've been four times that he didn't make the one

1100
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,687
Guns that don't work for his narratives later

1101
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
Ending of this clip is literally him trying to erase these other predictions because they don't help make him look like a prop

1102
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
Prophet in the main point of Alex

1103
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,695
The coverage of the Buffalo shooting is that I called it

1104
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,999
How does a f****** liar in a monster

1105
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
It's just gross

1106
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,839
These parts

1107
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
Stressed out

1108
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,423
Well I mean the the audio

1109
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,495
Disgraceful the audios for McCall right it took me a second

1110
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
To be like all of this is a phone call because

1111
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:01,663
If that was audio from like 1999 I would have never believed it right

1112
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Like it could have been the

1113
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Exact same thing

1114
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,063
The difference at all

1115
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,903
Here's the next Clipper

1116
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
Compilation

1117
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:17,279
You're going to be bad because you were Republican voter.

1118
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,631
To do this connect Republican Party

1119
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Do white supremacists

1120
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,775
But all these are bleeding information other weirdly

1121
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:33,407
This has nothing to do with predicting the shooting and honestly it has nothing to do with any kind of analysis that means anything

1122
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
If anyone is a soda

1123
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,039
Associated the Republican party with white supremacy

1124
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,319
Cuz they won't get their houses

1125
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:46,719
As long as someone like Tucker Carlson is hero worshipped as the number one pundit of conservatism going to have a problem

1126
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:53,631
So this clip is from June 5th 2021 so against buddy year-old there's nothing to do with the subject that

1127
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
The compilation is supposed to be

1128
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Recovering

1129
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,311
June 5th was a Saturday so if you did do a show that day it's not archived anywhere

1130
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
No matter what the

1131
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,127
Context year was it wouldn't matter

1132
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
Nothing to do with predicting

1133
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,687
This attack

1134
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,967
I think I feel

1135
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,503
Like this isn't going anywhere

1136
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:12,319
At this point I am not convinced by this compilation

1137
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:15,647
Previous compilation that he put out where he predicted

1138
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,767
Things correctly I remember you going through

1139
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,047
Each individual clip

1140
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,863
And applauding his ability

1141
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,911
Which was almost

1142
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:33,567
Almost prophetic in his accuracy creative false version of things

1143
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,615
His predictions are like

1144
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,151
Friends in Stalin's photograph

1145
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,967
You don't like him anymore get him out of there

1146
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:42,271
Here's the next one

1147
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
Preparing real false flag

1148
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,927
I just got dressed up like white nationalist

1149
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Discredit

1150
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,487
Republican

1151
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
Violence

1152
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
Again this isn't a prediction of anything

1153
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,607
Think this is just a standard

1154
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,959
Literally the everyday kind of content on Alex's show

1155
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:04,799
This is from October 13th 2021 the date

1156
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,103
Can't be accurate because Alex

1157
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
Wasn't hosting

1158
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
The show that day

1159
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,455
When was hosting on October 13th

1160
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:17,343
So close appeared briefly on the show but this clip was taken from a show where Alex was in studio

1161
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,623
And he wasn't

1162
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:22,975
You did appear briefly on the show that Owen hosted but it was over the phone

1163
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,255
I don't know where this clip

1164
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,815
Comes from but it doesn't matter cuz it's nothing to do with predict

1165
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Buffalo shooting

1166
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
They got the picture though

1167
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
I can't even get

1168
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
I mean

1169
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,447
Okay

1170
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
They don't want you to have

1171
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
They are doing this

1172
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:39,871
To you not to get your sloppy

1173
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
I think it's I think it's

1174
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
Absolutely a mistake

1175
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
That's so bad

1176
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
The other one being a Saturday

1177
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
And he doesn't usually do shows on Saturday

1178
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,951
On Saturdays

1179
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
This one is

1180
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
Just a f******

1181
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,303
Boy Next clip

1182
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,143
You go to black church or you going to love

1183
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,703
You know what grocery store

1184
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
You better

1185
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Be packing

1186
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,055
You better be watching

1187
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,335
Cuz let me tell you

1188
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,127
Deepstate succumbing

1189
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
That was the whole

1190
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,831
No okay

1191
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,135
Like first of all that clip kind of reads to me like a

1192
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,743
But I'm going to leave that aside.

1193
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,815
Music that you hear there is

1194
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
B b b

1195
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,191
The intro of the

1196
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,287
The Infowars logo come from the beginning of the compilation

1197
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,335
Before the like

1198
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:47,199
The longer I didn't even realize that this is like

1199
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,759
This is the cold open

1200
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,343
Oh no but like maybe a little Furious

1201
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,391
Grocery store there

1202
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
But you did also saver real grocery store

1203
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
Doesn't match the description of the Buffalo shooting

1204
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,023
Here's the thing though

1205
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:05,887
That clip is also from June 25th 2021 the same day as the first clip

1206
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,679
Compilation

1207
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
It's the same

1208
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
It's basically part of the same sense

1209
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
I think it's a little bit

1210
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,823
Deceptive splitting these up some through is from the same

1211
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
Thought is the previous clip

1212
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
The same prediction

1213
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:21,247
Weird almost like you know you're headed out the middle in order to give a certain appearance

1214
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
Speaking of the you get what you know you got a twofer

1215
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,135
Here is the full context

1216
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
Of that clip

1217
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,719
Includes the beginning

1218
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
Play the clip 1

1219
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
Gambit is eclipse

1220
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,119
Illegal aliens voting dead people voting

1221
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:37,887
It's on record

1222
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,447
Georgia with double counting ballots

1223
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,471
That night

1224
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,543
We can watch the video

1225
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:45,567
Now it's confirmed

1226
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,175
The did the Republican leaders in Georgia are not having

1227
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:50,943
You admit it

1228
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,271
What are they going to do

1229
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
A minority

1230
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Church or

1231
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,183
Grocery

1232
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,207
Restore some type

1233
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Minority

1234
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
Gathering

1235
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,607
Completely false flag

1236
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,679
Incel

1237
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
Ermine

1238
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,175
They'll go in and start shooting black

1239
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
Then they'll be

1240
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,783
Little kill them

1241
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,575
Anime committed suicide

1242
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
Somebody

1243
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,303
Cool if I thought

1244
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
And then

1245
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
Get killed by the Black Ops

1246
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
Black Ops

1247
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
Then tells wine share the people

1248
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:45,215
I want a big number hundreds of dead

1249
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
You

1250
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,799
Black

1251
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,079
Or you go to a

1252
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,127
You know

1253
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Store

1254
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,175
You better

1255
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,527
Cuz let me tell you

1256
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:05,695
Basic level this has no relation to what happened to Buffalo

1257
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
I got to say in the interest of fairness

1258
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,559
He does end up playing the whole clip later

1259
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
But in the

1260
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:17,727
Beginning of this compilation that's just the way the clips are presented to introduce these things

1261
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,543
Mind without the middle part which is like

1262
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
Ridiculous and Rockets yet

1263
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,895
Skewer the context

1264
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
So what are you saying and make it look like he was talking black

1265
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:31,039
About black pictures all the time right which is why you have

1266
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,343
Only instances of it by bringing up a grocery

1267
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,743
Historic presented separate from each other as to make it look like

1268
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:43,327
He's just having a bit in the reefs

1269
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
Some past like you brought up the predicting

1270
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
Video about Ukraine

1271
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:53,823
Alex does this because I'm sure you seen a fair amount of traffic and attention come from the whole Alex Jones was right meme and he's just

1272
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
Leaving Intuit

1273
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,407
The problem is that he's not right about stuff

1274
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:02,783
So he needs to lie about what he said in the past in order to create things for people to pretend he was right about

1275
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,623
And that's what this compilation is it serves the interest of marketing

1276
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,183
The idea that he was right about stuff

1277
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,487
By lying about what he said in the past

1278
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,095
I mean yeah there was a mass shooting so I'm going to cut an ad

1279
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,471
The important logo plays

1280
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
Here is where we are

1281
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
So what are they going to do

1282
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,223
Piranha attack a minority

1283
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
Church or College

1284
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,087
Grocery store some type of

1285
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,623
Minority Gathering

1286
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:45,279
Music you heard like a logo compilation just includes the same clip from June to

1287
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
25th again

1288
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,607
The first clip that we listen to

1289
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,935
It speaks volumes about the material he has to work with

1290
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,007
He's within one minute he's play backflip twice

1291
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:01,407
Because it's the one where you actually says grocery store and he knows that most people aren't paying attention to not really listening critically

1292
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:03,967
It's going to sound like he was making grocery store prediction

1293
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
Constantly to any passive listener

1294
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:12,415
At this point the whole clip plays through with the stuff about the two-man team Satan worshipers going in and then globalist

1295
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Kill team showing up

1296
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
Kill hundreds of black people

1297
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,559
I applaud Alex actually leaving that part in since it really makes

1298
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:20,095
His prediction look like s***

1299
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:26,495
Still cut out the part where this was a prediction or you specifically talking about the globalist and what they would do too

1300
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Heat off them

1301
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,823
About the audit results from the election

1302
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,967
Coming out he's still very much lying about that right in order to make it appear more related

1303
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
To the present

1304
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:37,759
Wow

1305
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,575
Hiding his bigger lie within a smaller life

1306
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
That's just a nesting doll a bulshit

1307
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:47,999
And who's to say that a globalist hit team didn't

1308
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Come in

1309
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
12

1310
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,887
Biggest shooter survived we haven't heard news from Buffalo

1311
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
Since then

1312
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,983
So is anybody alive on Buffalo we lost

1313
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,799
We lost Buffalo guys man

1314
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:04,383
So here here's the next clip

1315
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,455
This is the New World Order Revolution

1316
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,015
This is an assault and it only gets worse from here

1317
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
And that's why

1318
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
No matter

1319
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:17,439
How much heat they get at how bad they look no matter how much

1320
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Who falls apart

1321
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,999
They are

1322
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:27,679
Estate staging masetero tax and other crises to blame their opposition and framing

1323
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,519
So they can move directly against us

1324
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,567
This is meaningless in terms of predicting

1325
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:39,967
Shooting Alex says this all the time because it's his way of dodging responsibility when people who believe the s*** he says

1326
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:40,991
Are they hurt

1327
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
Instead of recognizing that his ideology is toxic and leads to violence frequently Alex has an intellectual coward and he hides me

1328
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Behind an insistence that

1329
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:54,303
Everything that makes him look bad as a secret plot by the most evil collection of villains in the world

1330
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,887
Because only I was a strong enough of a boy to defeat the Devil

1331
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:00,447
Do load of s*** but again

1332
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,983
You do with making any kind of prediction

1333
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,847
This clip is from June 17th 2021 so it's also about a year old

1334
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,943
You might notice that a lot of these clips are from June 2021 which seems strange

1335
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:17,599
I think it might have something to do with the fact that the January 6th committee was being formed that month which would definitely make Alex rant about

1336
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
False Flags

1337
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
More than normal

1338
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,231
Here's the clip from it's a large

1339
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
For context

1340
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,047
But this is globalism

1341
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Take over this year

1342
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
The New World Order Revolution

1343
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,631
This isn't

1344
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,471
And that's why

1345
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
No matter

1346
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,543
How much heat

1347
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,079
And how bad they look and I'm at

1348
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:38,847
How much

1349
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,383
Everleigh do falls apart

1350
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
They are

1351
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,575
Blame their opposition and

1352
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Fortera

1353
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,415
So they can move directly against

1354
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:53,951
Exposing

1355
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
January 6th

1356
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,767
False flag is so important

1357
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
We know what agency

1358
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
Weave

1359
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,423
Add

1360
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Carlson

1361
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
Very measured

1362
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,127
Wuhan lab leak

1363
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Everything else

1364
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
And then

1365
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
We'll all be brought up

1366
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,527
Stop

1367
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
Publications

1368
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
Home Depot

1369
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,135
Who did it

1370
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
How they did it

1371
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,559
And let the system deny it

1372
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,095
So we can discredit

1373
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
This clip is Alex going to rain check about blowback

1374
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,727
From January 6th

1375
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,615
Also I wonder if all those names and all the agencies it's all these people had and they like all the evidence

1376
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,919
They ran January 6th ever came out there's a

1377
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
Did it still simmering

1378
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:51,039
I mean that you know it's like a it's like a Crock-Pot

1379
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,087
Situation you thought it was a Boiling Pot

1380
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
That situation but now it's

1381
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
Slow cooking

1382
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
And

1383
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
The best

1384
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,463
The best pulled pork

1385
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,487
Take 6

1386
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:03,327
Is it what 67 years like we got a long way to go before we get

1387
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,095
Some good stuff from

1388
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:08,447
This clip is being misused

1389
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
Yeah man it's sad

1390
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
This is sad

1391
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,407
It is actually I was getting so disappointed by this

1392
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,271
That some anomaly that came up in this next clip actually let me down

1393
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:27,903
Completely different path non predict

1394
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
YouTube clip

1395
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
They're going to try to launch a race war

1396
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,511
False flag event

1397
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:36,607
Try to blame a course of gun owners and Trump supporters and Christians and so on

1398
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:41,983
They will see if the people will comply to turn in their guns which I believe people will not

1399
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:42,751
Comply

1400
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
That would be insane at this point with the

1401
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:47,359
The police being defunded in violent crime exploding

1402
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:50,431
Liberal cities everywhere people need self

1403
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Defense more than ever

1404
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479
Including by the way

1405
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Women

1406
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,807
And a People color and also

1407
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,623
Gays and lesbians and transgenders are buying guns

1408
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,207
More than ever before right now

1409
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
Buying guns more than ever so it's going to be

1410
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,583
Among left-wing

1411
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Legislators

1412
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,775
If we the American people if we surrender our guns

1413
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,823
I believe we will be invaded

1414
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:24,479
Yeah so this was Mike Adams just being Mike Adam Wright any kind of prediction for the

1415
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
Buffalo shooting

1416
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,575
It's just kind of the thing that said on Infowars pretty much everyday

1417
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,343
The General

1418
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:32,927
And Mike Adam saying will be invaded is part of his weird

1419
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,975
Saying that he was going on for a while but how

1420
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,047
China was going to have a Mainland inpatient

1421
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:38,815
Yeah

1422
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:43,423
Yeah I mean it's a guy who says there will only be Survivor

1423
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
Can't be on your pretty

1424
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
TextNow

1425
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,847
Until there are only lone survivors in which case

1426
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,639
You know I'm not going to be around

1427
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:57,759
So he can say I told you so to all the four people download

1428
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,391
Way bad I mean in a little because if there's Lone Survivor shortwave

1429
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:08,767
Yeah I bet they're really rich Lone Survivor so too you know

1430
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:11,583
Could be us from July 2nd

1431
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
2021

1432
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:18,751
I can't find the raw episode of this on Alex's because mysteriously there's no video

1433
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
Of this episode

1434
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,823
They have an MP3

1435
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,967
Of the episode but it's only an hour and 20 minutes long so it's a Friday episode so it should be 3 hours

1436
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,831
Didn't know what was going on so I gave the episode of Spin and it struck me as a

1437
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,855
Very strange

1438
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,695
Did this is how the file that's on Alex's website m

1439
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,279
Love you man love

1440
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
Play Bob

1441
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,215
Spirit Airlines personal enlightenment

1442

Call Yao

1443
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,175
I hate doing this cuz I

1444
01:06:58,687 --> 01:06:59,455
Tell me what's going on

1445
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
It's a very

1446
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:04,831
Complicated dichotomy which is the new world order that we all say

1447
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,415
I understand you know

1448
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:12,511
You got to be real careful when you walk and I'm not sure whether you're doing it

1449
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,535
2

1450
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
Avoid

1451
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,655
Ridicule or because you're afraid of

1452
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,191
Programming

1453
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751

1455
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,663

One.

1457
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:31,711
That's all

1458
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,247
You never seem to

01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,439
Set in the Bible spinach August 8th

1462
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,279
That is the one thing that by

1463
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,095
There's one that's where it ended

1464
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,983
I think that you couldn't cut 40 more seconds off I think I think it's a coincidence

1465
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,823
I don't think it's anything to farias where they

1466
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,103
That this is where it ends

1467
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,687
But I think it's kind of funny that the set of circumstances

1468
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,223
Are exactly what would be

1469
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:07,807
Be interpreted by the people who insist that Alex

1470
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,391
Works were Mossad as being like this

1471
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,183
It's really weird

1472
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
I just

1473
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:15,743
That's dead

1474
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:18,303
That's an unfair coincidence

1475
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
Because that's

1476
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,887
Exactly what you would

1477
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,935
But it's not

1478
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
It's just a coincidence

1479
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:28,543
Probably have nothing useful coincidence

1480
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
I guess

1481
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:36,479
I don't know why did you leave that part in I don't know

1482
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,503
25

1483
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:41,087
Cut that last 40 seconds

1484
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:46,463
I'm not convinced that it's intentional in any way to cover up something

1485
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,231
I do think

1486
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
That it is anomalous

1487
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,119
Like most of these episodes are there real or no

1488
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,935
Do a lot of them that are

1489
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:57,727
Partially there right

1490
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,775
Right I could see some sort like

1491
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,079
Speak the system must be automated in some way

1492
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:05,407
Some sort of a reader or I or something

1493
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,175
But it's just

1494
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:09,247
Army football one of the things that is

1495
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
Like

1496
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,575
Very uncomfortable territory for Alex

1497
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,111
His what

1498
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,159
He's being confronted

1499
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,207
About how he never talks about

1500
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:22,559
Jewish stuff I would go see here's the thing

1501
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,375
I would go back and cut that out now because

1502
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,143
It look

1503
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,215
It's real bad you look weird

1504
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,799
Pictures look bad you know you kind of you kind of

1505
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
Interesting point

1506
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
The comes up with

1507
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:38,175
This caller in that is it I'm sure he speaks for many people in the audio

1508
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,199
It is

1509
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,271
They interpret Alex's Behavior as

1510
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Being like

1511
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:47,903
You say the things you say because you're worried about blowback or whatever

1512
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,927
Yeah speak

1513
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
Freely but we get

1514
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:55,071
Oh yeah well I mean it's like whenever the lawyers like oh he's a Showman

1515
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,863
And his listeners were like

1516
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,911
Yeah course you're saying that

1517
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:05,055
Got to say that to the law called indirectly and was just like you in this week

1518
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,079
Do you mean just

1519
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,175
Small number of Alex

1520
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,967
His listeners who believe that

1521
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,527
I feel like there's a larger and larger number of Alex

1522
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,111
Episode cut off

1523
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:24,511
Amazing website but I'm sneaky and resourceful so I was able to find a copy of the full episode

1524
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,351
Answer to anything

1525
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:33,471
That I would think would be like well we're not in a

1526
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
It's not like

1527
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
Deeply anti-Semitic

1528
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:36,799
But it's

1529
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,079
Not good

1530
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:42,687
It wasn't like he goes in at 8 man yeah I connected that. A long time ago my right brother

1531
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,223
No it wasn't that bad no

1532
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:46,783
So I listened

1533
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Call her the baguettes

1534
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,927
California

1535
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
Obviously

1536
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,647
And I did an animation of millgate and you guys played inside preciate that

1537
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,279
Get a sweater and you shoot them in the head

1538
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,583
YouTube

1539
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,455
Listen to the sky

1540
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
How do you say

1541
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,599
Basically use for money

1542
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,135
How to control people

1543
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:55,903
And

1544
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
He was only a rabbi

1545
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,511
In the Bible

1546
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:04,351
Where is beefing up the one only one

1547
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,031
On the one true God

1548
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
There's no Trinity

1549
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,383
There's no Boo. There's not any of this other stuff is only one true God

1550
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,487
So this is kind of a bad look

1551
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,047
I think it's probably what you might call like soft

1552
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,071
Anti-semitism

1553
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,095
Yeah

1554
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
Refused

1555
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Weird

1556
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,167
I think it's a week

1557
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:43,263
Keycloak on Alex's bar just as a person pretending to be able to deal with people with opposing

1558
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,335
Used to sympathize information like it clearly

1559
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:52,735
Isn't engaging with it what anybody saying looks like they're only related

1560
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,271
Because they were back-to-back

1561
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,831
You know so it would

1562
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:57,855
Reference

1563
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,439
The other color if this guy was like three colors down the line would be like

1564
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:07,839
Well that's a new one wasn't doing this weird like I'm going to take calls

1565
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
Disagree with me

1566
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,775
But you wouldn't take a call where's that Jesus isn't the Messiah

1567
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:21,407
He gets another caller disagrees them on that show and it's actually about something

1568
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,759
Kind of substantial in the real world and that is that Alex gave Trump

1569
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:31,903
About all the vaccine stuff sure secures Alex's response to that and I think this is so telling

1570
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
Alex is completely admitting on air that he lied and made stuff up to excuse things that would make Trump look bad to his audio

1571
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:04,415
How it's made up a story to sell his audience which was Trump was pretending to be okay with vaccine so the economy could open

1572
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,487
And then you turn around and I'll be there in 20

1573
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,535
Alex is literally saying

1574
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,863
I was playing Devil's Advocate to try to figure out what the hell he was

1575
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,655
Alex

1576
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,495
Trump doing something that didn't fit with the version of him that he created for his audience

1577
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,775
Hero worship so

1578
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,079
He had to come up with an acceptable explanation

1579
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
In that way

1580
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,479
How it's made up his idea to drop would come out against the vaccine later to

1581
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:30,015
Pacify his audience

1582
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:34,623
And keep them in his Revenue stream and he saying exactly that when this color is pressing him on it

1583
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,647
It's outrageous

1584
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,951
Is really nice of him to be upfront about

1585
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,743
Listen

1586
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,303
I was lying to you strategic

1587
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,863
Now when you call me on it

1588
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
You know honestly I'm not really at fault

1589
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:52,287
Is it cuz I was doing the right thing it would have been too big of a problem for me

1590
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,335
To Juneau admit this

1591
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:59,455
Before that I was just making stuff up for me to deal with the fact that Trump was

1592
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:06,111
Actively pushing this vaccine forward show as he was still in office and there was a chance that we could hold onto power

1593
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:10,207
In some way so I didn't want to remove that possibility

1594
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:14,303
Turned on proms that I wouldn't be able to make all that money off the election

1595
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:19,679
Fraud narrative

1596
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
False

1597
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,031
Do you have to tell you the pacifier everybody and make you

1598
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:27,359
Not be so mad at Trump

1599
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,943
Yeah that's a really good idea so what you're saying to me is like

1600
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,223
Who Among Us

1601
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:35,807
Hasnat yada yada yada Dar god king

1602
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:42,207
From joining the globalist to murder us all with vaccine perspective the sort of information that Alex is willing

1603
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
Presented as fact on his show it's

1604
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:50,911
He's just spitballing in order to explain away inconvenient

1605
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,935
Maladies

1606
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:57,055
Cuz he's a liar I mean it does seem weird that you would just go on your show and be like listen

1607
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:02,687
Anytime somebody does something that doesn't fit within my pre-plan Narrative of them

1608
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,759
I will make up an excuse for them to allow them to

1609
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
Continue doing that with

1610
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,135
0 pushback from me at all because I want a good

1611
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,415
Brighton

1612
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:18,047
Mostly in service of making sure that the audience has an excuse to stay in line

1613
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,351
Narratives that I'm pushing

1614
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:27,775
Probably coincidence that only part of this episode is on Alex's site but man this is pretty embarrassing stuff

1615
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:31,615
I think that you really do get a glimpse of like how

1616
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,919
Bad he is at responding

1617
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,455
Actual criticism

1618
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:38,527
In any productive way doesn't understand it no

1619
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,599
He gets these calls that

1620
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,623
Should be

1621
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,183
Easy for him to handle

1622
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,463
Italian sub

1623
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,999
Complaining about how

1624
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
Callers bring up

1625
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,559
Judaism gives him a headache

1626
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,327
And

1627
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:57,727
Caller brings up Trump in the warp speed stuff you just like

1628
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
This compilation so I ended up getting

1629
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
Completely off track

1630
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
Why I

1631
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,735
Maybe you forgot that this point that I was trying to find that Mike Adams clip

1632
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,271
Oh that's right but honestly does

1633
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:14,879
The matter he was predicting anything and it wasn't Alex I don't know why

1634
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,999
Does that make him look good to have guessed too kind of predicted things to predict

1635
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
Protective

1636
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:27,935
Is it bolstering Alex's is it almost like Hey listen I got a I got my Flavor Flav over here also

1637
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:32,543
Also backing me up with my Chuck D knowledge I'm dropping on you

1638
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:35,103
I don't think it helps I don't

1639
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:35,871
Either

1640
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,151
Clip

1641
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,199
Are planning in my view

1642
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,015
Call Slugterra tax here in America

1643
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,063
To cement their rollout against

1644
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:48,159
This is meaningless and vague and has nothing to do with protecting the Buffalo shooting

1645
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,487
This clip is from June 24th 2021

1646
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:56,607
And you'll notice again that this is in the week we're all these clips seem to be from around when the January six

1647
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,375
This committee was for

1648
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,679
I don't really care about this clips

1649
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:03,007
Sentence about a year old and it isn't relevant and the rest of the compilation

1650
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:09,663
Is just a couple of the clips that already played playing again and a few more were Alex's just saying vague nonspecific false flag

1651
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
Coming

1652
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
And that means less than nothing

1653
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247
He does that every day

1654
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:19,135
The title of this video is Alex Jones predicted the white supremacist false flag shooting at Buffalo grocery

1655
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,951
ReStore in it does absolutely nothing to back that climb up

1656
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:28,607
The only instance of him mentioning a black grocery store was from a year ago in a list of possible targets for false Flags.

1657
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
Go-Buster going to do in order to

1658
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,679
Distract from the 2020 election

1659
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
An audit

1660
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:35,775
This is Alex trying to profit from murder priorin simp

1661
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
Well there's no way around that

1662
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:40,639
It's one thing to have suspicions about world events in

1663
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,663
Exploring those suspicions

1664
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
That's fine

1665
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,063
It's a completely different thing to make s*** up about world events of your race

1666
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
It's Buddies.

1667
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,599
Don't look bad

1668
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
And then

1669
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:57,023
It's even worse as a thing to cover a racially-motivated mass murder primarily through the lens of how right you were

1670
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,303
Predicting the shooting

1671
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:01,375
When you have to lie and create a fraudulent compilation in order to

1672
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
Pretend you predict

1673
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,471
That's a level of narcissism that's honestly scary

1674
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,311
Yo it's the day after the shooting and Alex doesn't cover any of the actual.

1675
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,359
Details of the shooting but instead

1676
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,711
When's the Lion's Share of his time talking about himself and his amazing predictive abilities

1677
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:19,807
I've been doing this awhile and this is a level of being an a****** that even

1678
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,135
Like it's freshly surprising even though I'm sure

1679
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,159
That we've done

1680
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
This before

1681
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:29,791
Yep we we've been shocked by his callousness and self-centeredness

1682
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:32,607
In the face of a tragedy before

1683
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,631
And it still

1684
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Surprising

1685
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,727
It really is cuz you just kind of

1686
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,775
No matter how often you see it

1687
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:40,799
You just kind of don't think

1688
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,079
Possible you know

1689
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,639
Like when it's not right in front of you

1690
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:47,711
You're like well I mean there's no way I can even being could be

1691
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,527
It's right in front of you

1692
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
It's just

1693
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,831
Such a disrespect

1694
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,855
To the

1695
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:58,463
The feelings that most other people are having

1696
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,023
But also his connection to the

1697
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,047
Because of it

1698
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,351
Not only is he

1699
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,167
Self-aggrandizing his prediction

1700
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
He is also part of the

1701
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:09,983
Cause

1702
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,287
And he's making money off of

1703
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,128
I mean he's a sentence using an integrated

1704
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
Terrorist

1705
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
Machine

1706
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,760
I think we've made that point a number of times

1707
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Man

1708
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
But

1709
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,088
Let me ask you a question

1710
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
Those clips

1711
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,184
The ones that weren't from

1712
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
That same week

1713
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,024
Are the ones you don't know where the show is

1714
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:35,584
Not all of them

1715
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,424
Because the Mike Adams one from the clip that's partially on Alex's site

1716
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,960
Was on

1717
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,240
July 2nd

1718
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:51,456
Cuz the one that the only one that was really an anomaly was October one right

1719
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,856
Yeah that you can't prove that that woman that wasn't October

1720
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:58,880
13th for sure

1721
01:20:59,136 --> 01:20:59,904
How to

1722
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,768
Studio that entire week for

1723
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:11,168
Not the next day. The day after could have been some point in October but I'm not going to go through every episode Naruto

1724
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,960
And try to find his

1725
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:17,824
Guy can match his clothes I'm just I'm just hearing a suspicion

1726
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,616
In my brain that says

1727
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,408
Alex half-remembered

1728
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:25,248
That that was around the time that he was predicting all that stuff

1729
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,064
That's how he forced an intern to listen to like

1730
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,160
What's 2 weeks from July 29th

1731
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:41,888
Another compilation of specificity did mostly just around

1732
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,168
Around that week

1733
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,984
Yeah it's all meaningless

1734
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,264
And he should be ashamed

1735
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:52,896
Shooting that happened in Buffalo the tragedy as are the other shootings that have happened

1736
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,664
Before incense

1737
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:57,248
Eject the violence has a different backstory to it a

1738
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:00,064
Set of variables that led to it happening in from the information

1739
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
Unavailable

1740
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,112
It does seem like a

1741
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:07,744
Shooter in this case was motivated by Alex yells on the radio every day

1742
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,792
It makes sense that he would try to make

1743
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,072
Conspiracy out of this

1744
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,864
Honestly when you think about it

1745
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,912
Maybe an act of self-preservation

1746
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,192
The way you behave

1747
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,264
I don't know it sucks

1748
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,288
It sucks

1749
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,872
You know it is like the total purse

1750
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
Perspective vortex

1751
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,688
From Douglas Adams

1752
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,480
You know that

1753
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,272
Reveals how meaningless

1754
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,808
You know so makes it

1755
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,856
It clear how meaningless you are in the universe

1756
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,880
That you lose your mind

1757
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:37,440
Like in this situation of Alex

1758
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:41,536
Could be forced into a place that made it so clear what it was he was doing to her

1759
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,352
You know a wooden baby destroys brain

1760
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:47,168
You know that kind of thing I don't know how you be able to

1761
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,960
Sleep at night if you looked

1762
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,728
Set this

1763
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,008
Like

1764
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,872
Well through the objective lens

1765
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:57,152
Subjective experience

1766
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,944
And you saw like

1767
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,968
The Dynamics

1768
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,272
That we're at play You're The Way You Are

1769
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,600
Clearly lying in order to create this compilation

1770
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:08,416
That is only meant to prove that you put

1771
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
Predicted the shooting

1772
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:14,816
Which is the front line headline of your coverage the day after the shooting

1773
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840
Like it's just

1774
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:18,400
And it's also your defense against

1775
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
Being

1776
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,960
Part of the

1777
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:21,984
Piano

1778
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,032
Both of those things at once

1779
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Box

1780
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,128
So

1781
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:31,200
This was out to Sunday show

1782
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Aunt

1783
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:36,064
Like I said I think we maybe there's a chance we could have gotten into

1784
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,600
Do the Monday as well but

1785
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,392
It would have been an overly long episode

1786
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,416
Quite frankly

1787
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,720
Trying to find some of these clips took along

1788
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,000
Denso

1789
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,792
We will get to that

1790
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:51,168
Some more of the Alex actually in-studio content to push back on these ideas

1791
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,984
Did Alex was right about the predicted things

1792
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
Because

1793
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,800
Is something that has traction

1794
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,592
In social media spaces

1795
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,896
There are people who push that meme

1796
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,920
And it's

1797
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
Toxic

1798
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,016
And it does have the potential to

1799
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:11,136
Radicalized more people but also just get people

1800
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,928
Who are unassuming

1801
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,232
Dive to see a compilation recycle

1802
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,000
SA

1803
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,280
Grocery store

1804
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,864
Beckham to have the effect of being

1805
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,168
Well I gave Alex a shake

1806
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:27,264
You know maybe I'm doesn't know more than I give him credit for something

1807
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,312
And that is a fraudulent perfect

1808
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,616
Past off by this

1809
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,152
This nap

1810
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:34,176
Strategic

1811
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
Propaganda

1812
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:35,968
And each

1813
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,552
Get you one step closer to being

1814
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,576
Caught in the

1815
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,600
