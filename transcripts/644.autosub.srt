1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them

3
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
Knowledge

4
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

6
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,464
Dot-com

7
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
Exit

8
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Alex Jones

9
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
Cindy we are Damned

10
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,960
My bright spot is

11
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
YouTube the

12
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
The Creator Temple

13
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
New video

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,152
That is a Bad sequel

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
Can part of a series about Tim pool

16
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:26,272
Australian

17
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,088
I think

18
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,904
Australia

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,952
Recommendation

20
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
Drop something on a giant piece of toast

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,792
See what happens

22
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Create

23
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,888
These are really good that in depth

24
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,240
Analyses of like somebody's Minifigures I think what is really great about it is

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,800
Do we spend our time talking about Alex Jones

26
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
I have a peripheral awareness of people like Tim pool

27
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
And obviously we've looked

28
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:57,504
But not not with Eli granular detail

29
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,600
Videos that are about

30
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Like Tim pool

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,976
Dave Rubin the three-part series on TV

32
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,512
I know I brought the

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,072
Couldn't remember which video it was that I

34
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
I think it was B project Veritas one

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
That I brought up in

36
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
In the past but this

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
This new one just came out

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
It's really good

39
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
It's very insightful about ivey-soto rhetorical technique

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,384
The temple uses to

41
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
What is really remarkable

42
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,992
This is pretty clear demonstration that a lot of it is

43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,808
Essentially passing along Infowars narratives

44
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
Just with a

45
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,368
Rhetorical Style

46
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:38,464
That makes it more purchasable tattoo different audience

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:41,792
It's really good

48
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:46,656
How about you what's your braids

49
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,496
You know I've been taking this yoga class for a couple months now right

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
And my favorite part of it is

51
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,848
How

52
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,872
It's mainly like

53
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,408
Between 3 and 6 people

54
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Every class

55
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
And it's usually the same people

56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Familiarity breeds contempt

57
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,344
And there's nothing I love you more prizes

58
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Then s******* all over the

59
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,744
These other people in the yoga class and my partner done we walk out there

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
There's this one guy who is a

61
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,864
Suck up and a teacher's pet and it is

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Hilarious to look at it

63
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
Adult man

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,312
I can do that it's so funny vines that hating on us Pacific

65
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,848
Person in the class makes you

66
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
More motivated to like

67
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,200
Do the class well

68
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,760
It's fun for me because I'm clearly the worst

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
There's ever been sure that yoga like I've got all these football and baseball injuries I sound like

70
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Walking anchor tool

71
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,976
It's not

72
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,816
Yelling and yoga or not

73
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Powerball

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,448
Yeah I found to be like one of the things I love the most

75
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,752
Austin College to like whenever I would

76
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,544
Free ClassDojo to someone to hate

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,616
It was just be like you f****** dick

78
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
The only way I could stay engaged glasses that really Cristobal

79
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:10,624
I will not be bested

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
It's going to be February 2nd 2022

81
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,887
20 days from the real

82
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,031
Triangle 2222 and then like several hundred years away from a Mitch Hedberg

83
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Yes

84
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
So this episode

85
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,199
Little bit of a discussion of

86
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
Content warning

87
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
About it in a moment before

88
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,415
Just some new folks

89
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,255
Very much

90
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Plebiscite

91
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,655
You know Steve

92
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:56,191
He's such an ass

93
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Your apology

94
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,103
There's nothing left to burn you have to set yourself on fire

95
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,687
Thank you so much as?

96
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,063
The Woks of policy

97
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,135
Very much.

98
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,999
In order of the Ponyboy

99
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
Are you very much not going to like this

100
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,399
But

101
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
Thank you so much to Jordan's dislike of Pete Holmes is the range of caliban seeing his own face in the glass die

102
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:33,567
Thank you so much

103
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
You're now it's like

104
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
I'm a policy wonk I have

105
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
Risen above

106
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
So take a little break now

107
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,111
A list for me

108
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
And then we're going

109
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
To come back

110
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
And I'm going to start the show over

111
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
F*** you

112
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
I got plenty of words for you but

113
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
At the end of the day

114
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
F*** you and your new world order

115
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,823
She rode in on

116
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,103
And all your s***

117
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Maybe the next few moments

118
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,967
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

119
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
I'll walk out of here tomorrow

120
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
And you never see me again

121
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Really what I want to do

122
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
Back here again

123
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:23,743
I apologize to the crew in the Lester Chester

124
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,327
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

125
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Better tomorrow

126
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,935
So the effects of Alex's trip to the woods

127
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:36,287
I have worn off and he is no longer can do a bad mood

128
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:41,919
I mean not the same kind of bad mood

129
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,199
If there's going to be a bit

130
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Disgusting and

131
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,551
You know just to give a Content warning in advance

132
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
There is a bit of

133
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:53,695
Discussion about Alex's

134
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
Feelings

135
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
Visa vie

136
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,607
Child abuse and I think some of the content

137
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
Some of the eclipse

138
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
In that portion

139
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
Yeah I may be difficult

140
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
22

141
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,263
Dear. Cuz they suck

142
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
This I have

143
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,591
Try to limit

144
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,151
Really the amount that we're going to actually listen

145
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Listen to

146
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
In the interest of not just sort of like

147
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
Rolling it out of mud

148
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,415
But I do think that some of it is germane to the conversation that we need to have

149
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,951
About the episode as a whole

150
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
And honestly this is not an episode that

151
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
I just say forget it because

152
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
Spoiler alert Marjorie Taylor Greene

153
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,703
Of course this is

154
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
Something that people are very curious

155
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,591
But how that went down you have a sitting US Congress

156
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,407
This person

157
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Text junk show

158
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:51,551
And you're also being very exploited about child abuse

159
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,343
It should carry with her as well

160
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
Yeah it's

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
It is a paint a larger picture that I think is important

162
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Recognize

163
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
I would say

164
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
It's mostly the first hour of his show

165
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
That is this

166
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Deterioration

167
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Yeah

168
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,727
You know

169
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
There's going to be a bit of this

170
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Episode

171
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Most of the rest of it is

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
Not really

173
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
Let's eat our vegetables in get

174
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,783
Get this out of the way this is not eating vegetables

175
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
But we do have another context drop

176
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Innocent

177
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Play the song foxes Eagles

178
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:41,727
Apparently one

179
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:48,127
What language music

180
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,687
So if I understand correctly

181
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
If you get

182
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Foxes

183
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Eagle

184
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Any kind of parrot

185
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,087
Kind of parrot

186
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:59,647
What is an oddly specific Trio

187
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,207
Brings to mind

188
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:06,047
Like a cartoon of Alex

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,703
Play The Mamas & the Papas it's like a cartoon with with Mickey Mouse

190
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,239
Steamboat

191
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Yeah

192
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,567
401

193
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
Also I don't think he

194
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:20,895
What should

195
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,223
Don't look into The Mamas & the Papas

196
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,415
So here's our first clip and to actually it's covering some covid related news

197
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
So it's just

198
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Fellowship

199
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
What a Time

200
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
To be alive

201
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,399
The wheels are absolutely coming off

202
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Everything they're doing

203
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
John Hopkins

204
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
Group

205
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
What

206
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
And is the preeminent

207
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:54,431
Planner

208
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,039
We've all been under

209
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,319
And the subsequent

210
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,087
Verizon fraud

211
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
It's not covering its ass

212
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
By the very

213
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Working group

214
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
It was heavily involved with Bill gay

215
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:09,023
Explaining all this

216
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,327
Coming out the 60 plus

217
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,095
Report

218
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Add

219
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,311
The economic destruction of it is going to starve

220
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:27,967
What are first things to do everything Alex

221
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
Completely made up

222
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
None of that means anything

223
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,623
Including characterization of Johns Hopkins is equal to diverse scientific

224
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Pick group

225
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:40,511
I've no idea what he's thinking it's a research University

226
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,375
The study is something that does exist but Alex is misreporting what it is

227
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
It's a meta-analysis that was carried out by researchers

228
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
At the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied economics

229
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,335
Global health study of business Enterprise

230
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
That is to say that it wasn't producing any new information but was looking at a broad swath of

231
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Of already existing

232
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Studies

233
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,087
The vast majority of these studies they looked at weird people in the field of economics

234
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,903
As opposed to Public Health which is a little bit of a Cause

235
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
For concern

236
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,279
The reason I say that is because the goal is to look at the relationship

237
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,351
Between non-pharmaceutical interventions also

238
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Referred to in the study as Lockdown

239
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,751
I Princeton

240
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
By closing businesses

241
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,335
That kind of thing and that

242
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
Kinship to the covid-19

243
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,479
And because these are economic

244
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,807
It's lost by researchers who approached that data from that perspective

245
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,599
Of Economics as opposed to

246
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Epidemiology

247
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
A strict look at the numbers

248
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
This could show and approximately like

249
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,279
2% reduction in deaths

250
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:49,119
Front that they lockdown measures as is estimated in

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
Some of this study

252
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
These numbers just can't capture

253
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Pans

254
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Epidemiological studies may be able

255
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,639
Go to encapsulate some of their

256
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,407
Sure sure sure

257
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,503
It's because this meta-analysis is only looking at covid mortality

258
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,551
They can't say anything about the effect

259
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
These non-pharmaceutical in

260
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
Interventions

261
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Reducing the spread of covid

262
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Which would then have a trickle-down

263
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Perfect

264
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,607
Even so there's a difference

265
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Finding

266
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Because it relates to

267
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,447
Did the studies that they included in this analysis

268
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:27,775
One area where there's a bit of complication was in looking

269
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
Effectiveness of specific

270
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,383
3 studies out of six

271
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
But include information about

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
The effective bar and restaurant closures

273
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,015
Reflected a reduction of over

274
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
28% in mortality

275
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,855
The numbers were 28.6

276
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
31 points

277
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
50.2

278
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,487
In those three study that is absurdly high

279
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Now

280
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
The other three studies out of the six

281
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,071
It looked at these

282
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
Specifics of Bard street closures

283
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Showed essentially no offense

284
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,447
Well that's absurd

285
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
But there is a reason why

286
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
A error is

287
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
All 20 turf

288
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,991
The same is true of the Dynamics of school closure studies with one of them showing a 58% reduction

289
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,527
I meant three other one

290
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
I'm showing no effect

291
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
So one of our big problems

292
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,439
2B it's really hard to even know how to begin measuring what it is we're looking

293
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
Looking for the answer to our question

294
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,327
There's some other points that I would bring up that I don't

295
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,375
Outfielder really addressed in this meta-analysis

296
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,167
Just do that I think they're kind of relevant

297
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,775
The first is that at least as it relates to the us we never really had a effect

298
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,543
Active lockdowns

299
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,151
Someplace and even went some businesses had to be closed for a brief window a lot of them

300
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,431
Stayed open anyway

301
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
There's a whole lot of people who are like

302
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
Gatherings of people were still happening even when

303
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,903
Ostensibly Gatherings were banned from public health concern

304
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
But of course

305
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,767
Happy mask assholes refusing to wear masks

306
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
Some yelling at folks waiting on them in public

307
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
The reality is that you

308
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,959
If you try to assess the effectiveness of any non-pharmaceutical interventions in terms

309
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
The pandemic

310
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,079
Your data is going to reflect essentially Aiden on application of lockdown measures

311
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,895
If the effective lockdown measures in the United States

312
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,943
Is actually only a small difference

313
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
Princeton what you'd expect

314
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:12,735
Without them

315
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
That might be because the measures themselves

316
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,063
We're only a small.

317
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,695
A lot of people took things very seriously and made real changes to how they went about their lives with respect

318
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:24,511
Public Health

319
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Childish

320
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
But they felt the need to reflect

321
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
Sibley acted opposition to any public health guidance

322
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Just because Defiance feels good to

323
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,775
There were really no consequences or any meaningful

324
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,079
Enforcement of lockdowns that would have changed

325
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:44,991
The second thing I would bring up is it different states in the United States responded with different Public Health measures

326
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
And these differences have an effect on others

327
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,855
Not like the borders have any real

328
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,159
Intrinsic meaning

329
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,951
Guns at the borders

330
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,511
There wasn't like interstate

331
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,791
Travel bans

332
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:03,935
That were in place order in Northern Ireland between Illinois and Indiana

333
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,311
This meta-analysis is largely concerned with data that was gathered regarding the first wave

334
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Tenderly 2020

335
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,967
Bunch of states that didn't have any stay-at-home orders or lockdown orders at all

336
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,783
Arkansas iowa-nebraska

337
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,111
Dakota South Dakota Utah and Wyoming all didn't pass

338
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Any order like

339
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
On the federal level

340
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,535
Trump didn't do anything that you would call a lockdown like his administration passed

341
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Travel bans

342
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,119
They close government buildings in the CDC

343
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
A recommendation

344
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,679
Things are governors

345
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
To do yeah.

346
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Yeah you know looking back on it

347
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,871
I don't think he did a good job. Really I'm going to go out on a limb and say that

348
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,967
All-in-all I think this analysis that's in this paper is useful

349
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
And it brings up some

350
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,783
Interesting points but I don't believe that it

351
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,807
It's ultimately can

352
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Inclusive

353
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,415
Shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions were altogether in effect

354
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,231
Regardless of any of my feelings about the study

355
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
It's absolutely true that Alex is

356
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Just lying about what it says

357
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
It almost certainly has

358
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Reddit

359
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,423
He deceived the headline that sounds like something these

360
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,287
Now he's into being put out by a source that he's already established as evil in his storylines

361
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,919
Singapore tourism covering their asses by admitting that everything he's been saying has been true all along

362
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Whole suicide point

363
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,319
If Alex is going to take this study is Gospel he's going to need to change his position on Mass

364
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,903
Set the study of the studies that they reviewed show date

365
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,463
21.2% reduction in deaths

366
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
In places where mask-wearing was mandated

367
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
Thankfully for Alexandra thinks he doesn't even know he has to pretend

368
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Did not know that

369
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
I think probably the most effective

370
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Steve non-farm

371
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
Pharmaceutical intervention

372
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
When was the

373
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
Billions of dollars of

374
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Fox News propaganda that got us all killed

375
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:54,015
I would I'm not sure exactly MPI

376
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,135
I don't know if they will have the ability to capture that in their their their variables

377
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,743
DeWalt people covering their asses right now

378
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,791
The diverse group of scientists

379
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,863
Or whatever Reuters

380
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Zillow

381
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Reuters has come out and endorsed

382
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,751
Credible antiviral properties

383
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
Covering your dirty a hovering Reuters

384
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
Dirty asses that b*******

385
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,527
This was a headline in Reuters that was

386
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Corrected

387
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,343
Because the original version was inaccurate

388
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Additionally the headline was quote Japan

389
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,255
How us is an effective against Omicron in Phase 3 trial

390
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,143
This was incorrect and Reuters editor is definitely whiffed on this one because by the time the headline was fixed

391
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:46,495
Joe Rogan it already tweeted about it

392
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:47,519
Sienna

393
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,079
Vindication for his ex bulshit

394
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
Animated is it taken hold that Reuters was admitting

395
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,967
After all that Ivermectin works

396
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,735
Do it

397
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,575
You can tell here though if you're listening to Alex's realize the controversy

398
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,415
Be here and he's trying to claim victory using the corrected headline

399
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:09,023
Which is quote Ivermectin shows antiviral effects against covid Japan knees couple

400
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:09,791
But he says

401
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
This isn't news really

402
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
And it's not proof that Ivermectin

403
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Ben works at all against

404
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,423
Covid in humans

405
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,799
If I'm being perfectly honest I don't even think this story is something that should have been posted by Reuters because

406
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,335
Not ready to go

407
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,127
From the article quotes

408
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,687
The company which has been working with Tokyo's

409
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:29,247
Otto University

410
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
I'm testing the drug is a potential treatment for covid-19

411
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,391
Did not provide further details

412
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,719
Provided about this company

413
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
Kawa and their Research into Ivermectin

414
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
But there's an unspecified antiviral effect

415
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,935
And I did they didn't say anything

416
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,727
That's not news worth

417
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,055
Maybe the prime opportunity to make an unforced error that can be

418
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Exploited by aunt

419
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Assholes

420
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,639
Which is exactly what happened with the

421
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Is bad headline

422
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,527
There's a misleading nature about engaging with his story on a surface level as Alex does with every

423
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
It's entirely possible that did a study

424
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,671
And found that Ivermectin has an antiviral effective

425
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
Against covid in a test tube

426
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:14,559
These scientists have demonstrated that before with Ivermectin and even hydroxychloroquine

427
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,399
Many things can show affection a test tube that they do not have

428
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
In the human body

429
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:26,335
A lot of the times that we've seen these anti-vax people pretending not to be anti-vax get over invested in

430
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Claiming the very

431
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,151
Various things are like covid treatments

432
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
It's usually because something shodhan

433
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,247
Defect in an in vitro study

434
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,087
And that may pretend that this effect must naturally apply to in VivoCity

435
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:43,231
Reuters completely f***** up here for no reason but the underlying reality is that Alex

436
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
The totally wrong about the

437
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,375
The story and Reuters is not trying to cover their dirty asses by coming out in favor of ivermectin

438
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,703
I just completely detached from reality and it's nothing more

439
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
When's of Alex's imagination.

440
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,079
Piggyback Joe Rogan

441
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
That is very frustrating

442
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
For real news are high

443
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
It's not like any

444
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,575
Single mistake

445
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
Could result in

446
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,487
Still further cementing of the pointlessness of mainstream media for Soma

447
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Many people yeah

448
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,303
No big deal

449
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,095
I wonder

450
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
About like I said the necessity of even

451
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
Putting this article out in the

452
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,495
If it doesn't really seem like it

453
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Even if

454
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,847
With the corrected headline I'm not certain

455
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Cast of the public

456
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,431
Know if your editor is your editor reads

457
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,039
The main subject of the article did not provide further details

458
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,439
Then you have kill the story or make the article about how they did not provide further details and they f******

459
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,975
Right

460
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,559
You know the only thing that I can kind of see his like again it's a rig

461
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:56,959
Game because your report the story and then people like Alex adikavi say Ivermectin

462
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,079
Why aren't you reporting on this story about how Ivermectin

463
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
Proof of a cover-up

464
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,711
Just a just a dumb game these assholes black

465
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,039
You just don't need to make your own goals you know sure sure

466
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,416
Why is covering some dirty ass has some not so dirty asses

467
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
CNN

468
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
Is anybody cover in there

469
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
Queen Christine asses that's not specified

470
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Getting in the ass cover

471
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Jeff Zucker

472
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,472
Google

473
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
The America hating

474
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
AT&T

475
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,104
Yeah that sounds

476
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,712
Now resigned and they always use the phone

477
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
Cuz he was having

478
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,112
A relationship that was inappropriate

479
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
With somebody that works there

480
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,464
The other big crime it's men and women having sex and

481
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
It wasn't lying it wasn't

482
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Overseeing the purse

483
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,032
This is interesting

484
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,432
We're seeing at the beginning of his shows Alex trying to do a Round-Up of news stories that he's used to paint a picture of that the enemies are in

485
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Retreat

486
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
Johns Hopkins admit

487
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,832
Lockdowns are fraud writers is trying to get down with Ivermectin

488
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,392
Has fired Jeff sucker because

489
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Alex got

490
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Kicked off Twitter

491
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,768
The thought process is stupid but you can clearly see the feeling that he wants

492
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
The cell to the audience

493
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,704
I don't know exactly what's going on with this situation but even if you take the public-facing story of God

494
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,984
Gospel hits

495
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
For him to step

496
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:41,152
Chris Cuomo was fired recently and because the termination involved unethical Behavior there was an investigation

497
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,480
In the course of that investigation that came out that sucker had been having

498
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,528
An undisclosed romantic relationship

499
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
What's CNN's Executive Vice President and

500
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
And chief marketing

501
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:50,624
Dessert

502
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,904
The impropriety of that

503
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,672
He resigned

504
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:57,024
If the rate of the relationship is As on the up-and-up is zuker claims

505
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,584
The fact that he didn't disclose it is something that is

506
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,424
Outside with appropriate terms of business ethics

507
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:09,312
The president of a company being in a secret relationship with Executive Vice President and chief marketing officer

508
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,080
Is not

509
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Best practices

510
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,200
There's a further air of ethical problems gear and it's something

511
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,760
You can see

512
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
Conspiracy theorists

513
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,320
Shooting out

514
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
And that is

515
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,928
Prior to being at CNN the woman whose sucker was in an under

516
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
Disclose relationship

517
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,744
Buy with Allison Gloucester

518
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,024
Was a communication

519
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Director for Andrew Cuomo

520
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Chris Cuomo's brother

521
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Honestly mean nothing

522
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,960
But the appearance of it raises some questions

523
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,032
Disclosure of the relationship more disconcerting

524
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,080
Ultimately however it

525
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:44,640
Should be pointed out if you're going to talk about that kind of thing

526
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,736
Go ask was only with the Cuomo Administration for 4 months

527
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
A 2013

528
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,600
Nbcuniversal for over 15 years

529
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:55,648
Which incidentally was where sucker was

530
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
Prior to him heading to CNS

531
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,304
Clearly goes back a long distance

532
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
In terms of its

533
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,120
Professional level

534
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
And being being

535
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Contemporary

536
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
It's a deep beat

537
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,080
Pass into the Cuomo Administration is more of a

538
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,504
But it does create in a few do I understand I'm just saying that it is a writer needs to add more character

539
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:27,392
Okay it seems kind of silly that there's only like 5 people in New York City and everybody works with the Cuomo's

540
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,672
I'm sick of this

541
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
There are more characters in this story

542
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Yeah

543
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,144
Cuz I'm not sure exactly what's up here but I feel like the Cuomo connection is a bit too

544
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
Speculative to put

545
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,192
Too much stock

546
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,008
But it does obviously right question

547
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,616
Oh and the reported version of the story on its own is enough to Merit his resignation

548
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:51,712
Alex wants to make this about CNN punishing men and women for having sex

549
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,016
It's really more about breaches of professional app

550
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,832
Yeah I'm sure the tienen doesn't much care who has sex

551
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,368
Anybody else

552
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
As long as it's all above board

553
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
Serious liability and comp

554
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,072
Collective interest it does seem like this is very much alike

555
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
More like what are we doing

556
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,912
Like this is that that to me that's

557
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
My story that's what I'm reading here is like what were you guys

558
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,008
Get out of here

559
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Stop this

560
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,616
That's it like it's not even I'm not even mad at them it's just like

561
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,152
No this is wrong get out of here

562
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,016
Sweet I want to get the broom and sweep them out of CNN yeah

563
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,392
Anything necessarily wrong with the president of a company

564
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,488
And Executive Vice President having a relationship

565
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,792
Considering they have work

566
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,840
Worked closely together for 20 years

567
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
We're both divorced

568
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,656
I don't see

569
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:46,240
Think there's anything wrong as long as you're upfront about it

570
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Is that you should just be up for

571
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
Write about how you have to report those kinds of things

572
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,128
2hr if you're in middle management

573
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
And you're dating an employee or something or even

574
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:59,552
You're dating somebody who's on the same level as you and write company flowchart

575
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,368
You still need to report these things to HR

576
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,136
Because of

577
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Pretend

578
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,208
Potential problems that they could real

579
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
It's it's

580
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,024
Very basic

581
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:15,680
Business ethics don't feel like you need that extra element I like I know I get the salacious

582
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:19,264
Elements of like they were f****** and also she worked for the Cuomo

583
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Campaign

584
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
It's like there

585
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,152
F****** Chris is a media guy he's a media executive

586
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
Go to the same party

587
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:31,040
You know she have a history and Communications

588
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
Not if it's not that's why I'm saying that

589
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,904
Connection is too speculative

590
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,672
Right really put

591
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,744
Too much stock into if you ignore it it's

592
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,280
Feels like ignoring

593
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
Something that looks weird I'm just saying all these all these rich assholes in in New York

594
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,752
Politics all go to the same f****** parties they don't need like

595
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,312
A relationship with a whooping

596
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Superior whatever you do

597
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
When

598
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
Something as obvious as like you need to report

599
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
These kinds of things

600
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,296
2hr trip when those things aren't followed

601
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:09,952
Create the appearance that they weren't followed for a reason exact and then people try to look for that reason

602
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,232
And that's why you follow them

603
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,768
In the first place

604
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
All these stories

605
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
And like

606
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
It's just like

607
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,472
Deleting up to you like a man the Whole New World Order

608
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
Falling apart

609
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
Wheels are coming off

610
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
The House of Cards is collapsing

611
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
The new world order is in

612
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,432
Deep

613
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Deep

614
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Deep

615
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,016
Trouble

616
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
They knew their system was going now

617
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
I knew it was a Ponzi scheme

618
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,416
Wanted to pose as the saviors

619
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,952
When their Ponzi scheme

620
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
So they wouldn't go to jail like Bernie Madoff

621
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
But instead

622
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:48,608
World leaders are standing up

623
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
In government

624
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
The clergy

625
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,544
What is common people on the street

626
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
City Council

627
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
School board meetings

628
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
Are calling

629
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,408
It out

630
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,688
The public is

631
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,088
Getting up to speed on the great reset the New World Order

632
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Ric Flair

633
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
This clip

634
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,376
I see the note is in a we're totally winning type mood today which is fun is that means you high energy needs

635
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,472
Going to mope around like he doesn't mean we're already Dead episode not already

636
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,056
Yeah I'm not in the mood for that

637
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
Declaring that the New World Order is falling apart is a stupid move

638
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
For Alex because it makes it

639
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,784
Order for him to then claim their huge threat later on like a year or two down the road

640
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,856
That's not really a concern for our acceptances audiences

641
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:46,976
Completely forgotten and ignored how he's been telling them to New World Order is on the brink of collapse for like 20 years

642
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Free

643
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
Who cares about people complaining at city council meeting

644
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
We already know from Alex's on reporting that the new world order as a

645
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
The plan B that they

646
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,752
Carry out a things look like their plans are falling apart

647
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,824
Which is releasing super bio weapons to kill everyone off

648
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Based on houses on broadcast

649
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
There is no winning especially not by yelling

650
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,272
City Council meetings about the new world orders evil plans

651
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
If anything

652
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,344
That would seem like a good way to make them

653
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,648
Tympanic and release those super bio-weapon

654
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,488
Honestly if Alex believe a single word that came out of his own mouth

655
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,048
Van every moment he spent on air that wasn't about to

656
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:24,096
Keeping the audience at a grow their own food

657
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,376
And collect rainwater is

658
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,656
Is a f****** waste of time

659
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,264
Anyway Patriots are winning now which is a mood that I'm sure will pass before too long

660
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,128
Now it's go back to pretending that he never said that the new world order was crumbling their real serious threat

661
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:40,736
This means anything it's just the equivalent of a play-by-play guy on the radio describing at the

662
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,016
Sports game but he's a magic

663
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:47,392
Yeah I mean it does seem like if you know your enemies plan bees kill every

664
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Then your most important

665
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
Job is to

666
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,816
Tired but you know that until you can neutralize the Kill Everybody

667
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,656
It's impossible to neutralized

668
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:04,288
The kill everyone strategy telling everybody about it what you got to do is lay low and

669
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,848
Very very aggressively

670
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Try to promote

671
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
Two like-minded people

672
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:12,480
Ways in which they can create community

673
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:14,528
And the possibility of

674
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Mitigating the damage

675
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:17,600
It's done

676
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
By the kill often that is inevitable

677
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,184
That would make sense

678
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,208
Right right

679
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
Or

680
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,024
Now cuz here's my here's my problem with

681
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
How do I go

682
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:32,192
I think you should interview Marjorie Taylor Greene

683
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
Obviously we know that

684
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Plan B

685
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,384
Is the super violent

686
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,456
However there are winter storm

687
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,736
Slither going through

688
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
Texas and

689
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Most of the South

690
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,856
Bad so that means that it's time

691
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,392
To really lay into

692
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:57,280
The prediction of a Cyber attack

693
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
Let me give you

694
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,912
The Big Kahuna am I talk about this

695
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Getting chills up now

696
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
My spine

697
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,472
Because

698
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,288
My spirit

699
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:14,176
Klaus Schwab

700
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
5.0

701
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
What

702
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,296
Where's where's

703
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Gideon

704
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Genuine

705
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,000
How does

706
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,536
Going to be a giant

707
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
Terrorist

708
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,984
Covid look like

709
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,360
They're going to Cyber attack

710
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
Gosh

711
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,456
I can get away with it

712
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
And I think you're stupid

713
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Maybe next week

714
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Because why

715
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,048
The federal police forces

716
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
Have every major Western

717
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
I don't know what that is

718
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
I don't know

719
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,824
Prediction of next week is a meaningless predict

720
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,896
It's like death

721
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,688
An aneurysm

722
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,736
The rapture

723
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,064
They're all at any moment in time

724
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
Years back yeah friend

725
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
Convinced me to go see like a palm reader

726
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,768
Alright I remember the palm reader being like

727
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,632
Someone in your family will get sick

728
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,960
No

729
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:46,592
Dial.

730
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,664
I think so I assumed service

731
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
I don't know

732
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
I don't know what's customary

733
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,856
Get a haircut with the little bit different I paid

734
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,696
Because you know I agreed to it

735
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,120
Well another prediction with someone will die but they're old

736
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,656
Do you know Dan I can

737
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,680
Can see you

738
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:15,776
Just from your ear the way you're holding yourself right now that you're a closed-off person

739
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
But sometimes you're very good

740
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Gregarious

741
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Man

742
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:25,248
Has bats in Casey's winter storms that are heading to Austin and the surrounding air

743
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,296
Where is knockout the power like they did last year

744
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,112
Or in case another winter storm does the same in another city

745
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,392
He's pre-loading a

746
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:37,792
Conspiracy so we can make a narrative out of that predicted a false flag attack

747
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
Play guess what the bad guys are doing

748
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
Their power outages

749
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
All the time

750
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
From inclement weather

751
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:45,984
When I lived in Missouri they were like bad thunderstorms

752
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,032
The power go out periodically

753
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,056
Just this past week

754
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,640
Hundreds of thousands of people lost power in the Northeast due to winter storm Keenan

755
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
And to it y'all in advance

756
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,736
Storms coming to Texas governor Abbott is

757
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,040
Come out and said that power outages may happen

758
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:03,648
There's no shortage of things that Alex could try to portray as a cyber-attack should

759
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,416
You want to

760
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Which is why this particular in

761
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
Sensitive to create a preemptive

762
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Conspiracy narrative

763
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,536
Comes off as desk

764
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
Really train

765
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
No good

766
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,448
Yeah governor in charge of thing sorry dudes nothing we can do

767
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:21,312
So Alex gets to reading the headline of his own show

768
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,616
The live feed broadcast

769
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Fascinated by this because

770
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,992
It's essentially all lies

771
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,320
Put on screen awake and alive show feed headline for today

772
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,392
Wheelchair because you are

773
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:41,024
The equation you are the resistance when you decide to share the broadcast it overrides the sensors

774
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Get past big tackle

775
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,584
Get past

776
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,520
Wednesday live Reuters endorses Ivermectin

777
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:55,360
CNN Zucker resigns as World awakens

778
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,688
Fraud and murder

779
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:01,248
Marjorie Taylor Greene

780
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,808
He'll be joining Alex Jones live

781
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:04,832
On air

782
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
Don't mess

783
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
The most censored

784
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,208
Cast in the world

785
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,768
Atlantic continues on

786
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Dealing with

787
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Globalist

788
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
Look up to and how the world is away

789
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Hopkins

790
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
Add confirm we already knew

791
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
Massive starvation to death

792
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,824
Suicide

793
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,736
From the virus

794
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:34,784
And I

795
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
Here for you today

796
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,952
The only thing like in the headline that I have

797
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,720
Woodsy is like

798
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:49,376
Being true is that Marjorie Taylor Greene is coming up

799
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Time to tell me

800
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,168
That

801
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
8

802
00:35:54,496 --> 00:36:00,640
75 million people died in the lockdown while I wasn't paying attention though he's saying that

803
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,944
Like a lot of those deaths are secretly

804
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,272
October

805
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
Alternative

806
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
That you're describing is

807
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
Pretty absurd

808
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:16,768
Yeah I guess the rest is all bulshit

809
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Guest ahead

810
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,560
Live time

811
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:20,864
I hate putting her name in the

812
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,888
Show description

813
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,424
And the title of the broadcast

814
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
I think is a pretty

815
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,520
Clear piece of evidence that he's trying to troll for a

816
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
Yeah I think I think that is

817
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
It's very clearly part of his

818
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,944
Agenda I mean a sitting congressperson music

819
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
Definitely

820
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,808
If he's got a gut

821
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
We're going to know about it

822
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,416
It's something that you want to put out there on

823
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
Street right and then also you hope

824
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,232
The people will cover it

825
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
In order

826
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Thoroughly

827
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,816
Signal booster

828
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
Right you let the my pillow guy paid a lie and bitching about things that didn't happen and now you got Marjorie tail

829
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,752
Taylor green you're going to talk about it

830
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,824
You know what if I respected Mike Lindell

831
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
This would

832
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
Actually do it but

833
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,528
I would respect him a little bit more if he forced Alex to let him

834
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:13,088
Do limericks that would be great

835
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:19,488
He was a fan like an old-school to antibiotics has a new kind of power classic

836
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:25,888
Classic throwback to the soap guy

837
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,704
I don't think you should do limericks he's got to come up with his own thing

838
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,728
Maybe haikus

839
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
I would make it

840
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,288
Mike Lindell

841
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,384
Enable.

842
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
Delivered love it

843
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
So here we go

844
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
We're about to get into the

845
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,064
Messi

846
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
Section of this

847
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
Where Alex

848
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,976
Gets into a story about a

849
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
.

850
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,840
Professor at the University of Fredonia

851
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
Who has made some

852
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,168
I would say

853
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
Troubling

854
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,752
Awful comments

855
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,288
And so here we go

856
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,848
You know this story just broke on

857
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,384
Twitter last night

858
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
And

859
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
Hipsters

860
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Send me stuff

861
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Watson Road about it

862
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
Early this morning

863
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,256
I see you're right Joe Rogan

864
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,048
And he sent me this

865
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,144
Our watching videos of the sky

866
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
They're six hours ahead of a show

867
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:39,872
678 hours later

868
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,176
Messages

869
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Something

870
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
Complete

871
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
YouTube

872
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,160
I am.

873
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:57,024
Show me professor

874
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
It's a mistake

875
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,120
About pedophilia is being wrong

876
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
So

877
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
As we go through this

878
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,288
This is inspired by

879
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:12,384
Influence of Rogan

880
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:19,296
I mean if the circle is complete then somebody cut Alex Jones and half with a lights

881
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,112
Okay if we're going to complete the circle that f******

882
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,464
Hinduism the boomerang effect to Alex's misinformation

883
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,864
Theoretically radicalizing information

884
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Analyze

885
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,912
And cover

886
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
So this is actually a rare instance where Alex has a narrative about pedophilia that

887
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
Actually not based on

888
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,872
The totally bizarre grotesque imaginary thing

889
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:49,248
Thanks right this is about the Suny Fredonia philosophy Professor Stephen Kirchner

890
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,528
Some comments that were

891
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:53,856
Definitely not great in a video that were making the rounds online

892
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
And the other night

893
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,440
I didn't watch the whole video but the

894
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
The clip that was posted all over

895
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,536
The place we see the pedophilia is good

896
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
You suggesting that it's quote

897
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,656
Not obvious to him why sex with a minor is wrong

898
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:11,776
This is splitting hairs on my part and I think it's very fair to say that the realm of conversation that he was getting in

899
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
Into was not appropriate

900
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
F***** up

901
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,688
I got a really heavy libertarian vibe off this guy

902
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,736
Singularly since one of the things he was talking about

903
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:21,504
A lot was the

904
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,784
The age of consent

905
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,088
Aspect

906
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,648
You hear a lot

907
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,672
From libertarian

908
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:34,304
Surprised to learn the kirchners on the editorial board of the journal reason paper

909
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,120
Which purports to be free of intellectual or philosophic

910
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Contradiction

911
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:42,496
But also posts a whole lot of articles about weird libertarian concern

912
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,824
Like in the fall 2011

913
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
Issue with your personal wrote

914
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:47,872
Pieces for

915
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,664
There's an article titled quote

916
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,736
Howell libertarian might oppose same-sex marriage

917
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:55,040
What are the articles that he wrote

918
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:01,440
That issue

919
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:05,024
One of the articles that he wrote in that issue was titled quote

920
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
Extremely harsh treatment

921
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,864
Which was a Libertarian defensive

922
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,216
Torture hey great to get around the obvious philosophical objection

923
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
That someone would have as a Libertarian

924
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
None of this is an

925
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Anyway to

926
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:20,128
Excuse kirshner's recent,

927
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,712
It's just to say that this is kind of standard behavior for libertarian

928
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:30,112
You can find plenty of memes online that are based just on the broad awareness that Libertarians are really weird

929
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,952
What about age of consent issues

930
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,768
If you look a little further into this guy's publishing

931
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,888
Career you'll find a 2007 paper he wrote for the lawn philosophy Journal titled quote

932
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
For discrimination against women

933
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,496
Where you might be able to guess that he argued

934
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,264
In favor of

935
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
Discrimination against women

936
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
Specifically in the context of admission

937
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,640
Medical and Business Schools

938
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,943
Probably going to hurt their brains

939
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,991
In 2020 he published another papers

940
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,527
Specifically arguing that coat

941
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:04,927
Philosophy departments at state universities may discount women's application

942
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,463
All those big Concepts like

943
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
It's okay to f*** children

944
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,095
In 2018 he took the time to write a whole ass paper on house

945
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,655
Specifically being attracted to Asian people quote

946
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
Is not wrong because it does not infringe on someone's moral right

947
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:22,335
How do you say this guy is just writing weird things about himself to the rest of us

948
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,871
And then Heidegger

949
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:24,639
Behind

950
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Philosophy

951
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
In 2000

952
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,039
3 he wrote an article titled quote a liberal argument for slavery

953
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,087
The abstract of which starts like this

954
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:40,255
The slavery contract is not a rights violation since the right not to be enslaved and the right not to give out

955
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
How to benefit our waiverable

956
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:46,655
Conjunction of their voluntary waiver is not itself a rights violation

957
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
The case for the contract being put

958
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,239
Pejoratively exploitative

959
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,263
Is not clear

960
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,287
You are

961
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
Ruining

962
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
Words for me sir they're bad when they come out of your mouth this guy is a super annoying libertarian philosophy professor

963
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,295
Public publishing history closely

964
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:09,695
You'll even find that in 2001 he wrote a paper titled quote the moral status of harmless adult child sex

965
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,767
Wherein he argues about what you might guess from

966
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
The title

967
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,351
This is a position he posited for a while

968
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,935
Which doesn't mean the people shouldn't be offended or push back against it

969
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:24,799
It's just that he's a Libertarian if people not philosophical tradition have this conversation a lot

970
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
Yeah

971
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
He's been doing it

972
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:31,455
For twenty years sucks because this seems like one of those classic

973
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
You went

974
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,015
Viral for s*** that

975
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,599
People just didn't know was regularly comment in that

976
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,367
Rinat world

977
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,439
Like if you walked into any

978
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,463
If you want

979
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,303
How to do any shity bar where there was a Libertarian conversation happening

980
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,375
After three or four drinks eventually someone's going to be like

981
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:54,751
You know what I don't understand and then it's all s*** from there on out

982
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,591
I was looking at the issue of his journal

983
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,151
That techno that you wrote These articles in

984
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:05,759
Other reason papers and there was an article in it that was written by Walter block

985
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,087
Who's another libertarian professor

986
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
If you'd like

987
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
Fairly enjoyable

988
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:14,975
You can hear a couple of debates that he did with Sam Cedar

989
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
On the majority report

990
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:20,863
And this is you just come up with madterbate to of course it does they just

991
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,679
Can't get away from it it's weird cuz it's

992
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,447
Because

993
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
It's the most

994
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,519
Easily like attention-grabbing

995
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,103
And so when they do that they're like haha now you're forced

996
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Engaged

997
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
In an emotional space

998
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
And your phone

999
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Cuz they're stupid

1000
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
The New York Post there's an article about this video

1001
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,111
Pierce

1002
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,671
To come from his appearance on this podcast called

1003
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
The unregistered party

1004
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,743
Which is hosted by

1005
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:51,583
Which is actually incorrect but it's hard to tell that immediately

1006
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:56,703
So I ended up looking into the unregistered podcast because I took

1007
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,727
The New York Post

1008
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,775
Assassin

1009
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
A b word

1010
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,103
That's the kind of

1011
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,455
Right-leaning podcast of the most recent episode was

1012
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,247
The evils of CR

1013
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,343
With James Lindsay who was actually recently against on Rogan's podcast

1014
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
Cast which is cool

1015
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,647
Yeah you know if you want

1016
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:19,231
Ncert it would make it a lot easier to get to slavery

1017
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,303
Hey that's an interesting thought experiment

1018
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,631
This interview with Kirchner on the unregistered podcast

1019
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:30,239
What is from December 2020 and in the episode description

1020
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
The most Renegade academic I've found

1021
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,407
I went I tried to listen to this podcast to see if maybe the comments were taken out of context

1022
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,455
And let me tell you they were not

1023
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,759
If this was actually where was from

1024
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:48,159
If anything the you know the short clips are a generous portrayal of this guy is views

1025
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,463
More f***** up stuff in that full interview

1026
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:51,999
But I'm not even going to play here to make

1027
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
The point

1028
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
Here's the thing that I wasn't

1029
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Listen to the spot

1030
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
The Host

1031
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,263
Thaddeus Russell is absolutely 100% in agreement with Kirchner

1032
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:08,383
The two of them are lamenting how much grief they take from people because they insist on arguing

1033
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,455
I've been having sex with minors as maybe actually a good thing

1034
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
What's weird is

1035
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
Is there are tons of tweet

1036
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,807
It's an articles on right-wing blogs

1037
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,367
For kershner's firing and turning him into a villain

1038
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
Not that many you talking about Russell

1039
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
And how the entire interview

1040
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
To attempt it sound like

1041
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,279
Veterans of the battle against

1042
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,095
Consent laws shooting the ship telling War Stories

1043
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
That's real weird

1044
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:34,495
Some people are actually making that connection

1045
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,263
He tweeted out

1046
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,615
But he's not going to be teaching a CRT class with Russell now this is come out

1047
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,407
The connection

1048
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:42,943
It's so weird like

1049
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
All of the outrage

1050
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
About

1051
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
This

1052
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Clip

1053
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:47,807
Of course

1054
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:49,599
Has been attached

1055
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,367
2

1056
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:54,463
This interview that he did on the unregistered podcast

1057
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,999
But if you go listen to my podcast

1058
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,023
He is talking

1059
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
Very in-depth about the same issue real

1060
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631
Bad so yeah it's all a mess

1061
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
Even weirder is that just be

1062
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
Before the conversation

1063
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
This stuff on their podcast

1064
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,335
Russell is doing a breeds for headspace

1065
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:15,455
Nsibidi sponsor

1066
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:21,855
An article in The Daily Beast in 2009 about how baby Roman Polanski wasn't so wrong

1067
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:24,415
Do headspace on the CBD company want to throw their support

1068
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,487
Anyway also the you're going to hate this but one of his

1069
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,815
First guest was Conor friedersdorf

1070
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,143
I I mean

1071
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,423
You know I hate I love

1072
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
I love

1073
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
How

1074
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:40,287
These guys are such Renegade professors

1075
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,103
Who have been saying the same b******* about

1076
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,175
F***** up the age of consent laws exist

1077
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:52,575
4:30 twenty-odd years or whatever has been on this beat since 2001 at least from his publishing history this

1078
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:57,695
This guy wrote about the plants Keisha 2009 time are they like

1079
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,487
Did you know that some innocent ass

1080
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:01,535
English Professor somewhere was like

1081
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:05,887
Israel's probably an apartheid state and then was fired for no reason

1082
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,495
So I went

1083
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,543
Down this path look at their unread

1084
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Broadcast because that's where

1085
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:17,151
New York Post had led me to believe this was wrong

1086
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,687
Turns out that is inaccurate

1087
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
The actual source

1088
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,247
Yeah

1089
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:27,647
Natural source for this interview with a video on a YouTube channel called brain of that which as of the time of preparing the

1090
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
Episode

1091
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,743
That video itself has under 3700 reviews

1092
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
And this is an outlier

1093
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,119
In terms of it being a very high number of views videos on this channel

1094
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
Brain in a vat

1095
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,191
It'd be very difficult to

1096
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,215
Stumble across

1097
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,495
Whereas

1098
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:47,103
The interview like the unregistered podcast is a much more

1099
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,407
Popular

1100
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
And So within easier Google search

1101
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:53,247
Yeah it's a

1102
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:55,295
Very strange and I don't understand

1103
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,063
Foley

1104
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
How

1105
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,599
This

1106
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,671
Outrage cycle happened

1107
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,231
Why almost nobody

1108
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,559
Watch this video to be different

1109
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
Care

1110
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,119
What is this

1111
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,447
Shouldn't be a big deal for us

1112
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
Right now

1113
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:19,359
You know what I'm saying it's a big deal because Alex is making it a big deal

1114
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,407
Comments are f***** up and went bad

1115
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
I also think

1116
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
That there with

1117
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
In the realm of what you hear from

1118
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
Libertarians

1119
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,743
Watch the whole thing mostly because Kirchner was just saying the same stuff he said in the other end of

1120
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,047
Review that I did waste my time listening to

1121
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,839
The host of this one

1122
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,911
The seeming to be as enthusiastic in their agreement with him

1123
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Or even necessarily

1124
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,471
Showing agreement with him

1125
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,775
From the stuff I saw but I don't I don't know if

1126
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
At some point they do

1127
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,895
Anyway there's a Libertarian philosophy Professor doing stuff it's not

1128
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
MC libertarian philosophy

1129
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Professor getting in

1130
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,015
Even though he published an article on this topic

1131
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,039
Chicken 2001

1132
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:03,135
It seems like a bit of a pattern of being willing to expound on the issues on podcast

1133
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,671
Public appearances

1134
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:05,439
They published

1135
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,743
The whole book about in 2015

1136
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,815
Apparently Suny Fredonia had no I

1137
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Idea about his opinion

1138
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:16,959
And released a statement that his views are reprehensible and they quote the matter is under review

1139
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:20,287
It's fine that the matter is under review but if

1140
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,103
If you're going to enact any punishment on Kirchner about this

1141
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,455
Probably also do some real serious fact-finding about how you could have missed this

1142
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Very often

1143
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
Bsview that he has

1144
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,087
A debt has been making extremely public for the last 20 years

1145
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,183
I've had him on the year the payroll at this is reprehensible to you

1146
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,279
Yeah it does seem like you guys really dropped the ball on that one

1147
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Considering it

1148
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
Supposedly your job

1149
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
To make sure that

1150
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,143
They continued

1151
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
You publishing

1152
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
Yo

1153
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,007
Yes it's really

1154
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
It's really strange

1155
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
Like the comments

1156
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:56,127
Are obviously

1157
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,175
Bad

1158
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
And there are

1159
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,223
Knock knock

1160
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:00,991
Yeah

1161
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,527
Acceptable relay

1162
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,295
I don't think

1163
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
And if he's a philosophy

1164
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,367
Professor

1165
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
Think it's stopping short of encouraging

1166
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:11,743
Or saying these things are good

1167
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:14,047
But I'm guessing he does a lot of Greek philosophy and

1168
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Glass

1169
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,143
I think you'd appreciate the Socratic method

1170
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
From what I understand

1171
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
It's really

1172
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Springleaf

1173
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:23,519
Locked up

1174
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
Time Alex

1175
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Does not deal with this

1176
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,919
In terms of the reality of these combat

1177
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:32,735
He takes it in a completely other direction

1178
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
And actually even misrepresents

1179
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
The

1180
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,599
Nature of what is being said

1181
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
Say that again

1182
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,999
Sex with one-year-olds

1183
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
He's good

1184
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
Yes it's good

1185
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:53,983
I need a bunch of other professors agree with him

1186
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,031
They all look

1187
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
He looks like one

1188
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,039
Else can't deal with these kind of

1189
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,087
Objects with any kind of

1190
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,391
Seriousness

1191
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,791
I'm not going to get too deep into the weeds and I'm not investing any energy in defending kirchner's comments but Alex's mystery

1192
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Representing

1193
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,631
Christian was talking about alleged reports in quote

1194
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,655
Some cultures

1195
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:24,959
News of grandmother is fellating children

1196
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,495
Calm them down when they're calling

1197
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:31,615
He says that he doesn't know if these reports are true or if it's an effective treatment but

1198
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:32,383
If those things

1199
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
Were true

1200
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,223
He doesn't understand what would be wrong about that ax

1201
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,271
Messed up

1202
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,367
I don't agree with Kirchner I think it's a bad line of inquiry to go down

1203
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
But also

1204
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:47,487
Alex is not dealing with what he's actually saying it's

1205
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
Yeah a mess

1206
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,327
Yeah yeah I mean here's here's what I would

1207
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Say

1208
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
To that art

1209
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
Why and go away

1210
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:57,727
Just just

1211
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,311
Why why are you not busy

1212
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,383
You got something else to do that other than make that argument

1213
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,919
You know you could

1214
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
Put together phone

1215
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:14,367
I think that there is a strain of contrarian this within the libertarian philosophy

1216
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:20,255
An obsession with these rigid ideas about self ownership and what have you and

1217
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,559
I think that they are a bad combination

1218
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,887
It would be nice if there was a strain of birdhouse building

1219
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,167
In libertarian

1220
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:32,031
Do you know like instead of this contrarian ISM that makes everybody pissed off and annoyed

1221
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
Go build a birdhouse

1222
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,871
OB good use of time

1223
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,943
Topix

1224
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
His feelings

1225
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
About

1226
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,039
Abuse towards

1227
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
And

1228
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,855
That's partially because

1229
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
He doesn't actually know what the

1230
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,415
The story is

1231
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Brock Lesnar

1232
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,743
Look into it all

1233
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
He can't really

1234
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
Talk about it with any

1235
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,071
Dap

1236
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:58,143
That's so he needs to just use it as a launching pad for him

1237
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
To do his normal bulshit

1238
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,471
Right

1239
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:04,543
Here here is something that is fairly innocuous in terms of

1240
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,359
Not being disgusting sure

1241
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:14,527
Most the people you see now you notice they don't have children that you you had because the majority of you you

1242
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Victimizers

1243
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:28,095
So the eu's executive branch is known as the European Commission

1244
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,887
Which includes 27 members

1245
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,239
The current president is Ursula Von der leyen who has seven children

1246
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,543
There are three Executive Vice President

1247
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,103
France has four children

1248
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,175
Marcus has three children

1249
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
Haley third of all this

1250
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,735
Doberman

1251
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,831
Therefore vice-presidents

1252
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:50,111
Marcos

1253
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Seth Kovach

1254
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
Has three children

1255
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,975
Vera's Jehovah has to

1256
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:57,279
Dubravka suica has one

1257
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,839
And margaritas shooting a size 2

1258
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,631
So almost all of these people have kids

1259
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:05,471
Is just completely made up from his imagination

1260
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,495
It would make

1261
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:12,127
You leadership wouldn't have children if they were intent on breaking up the family and destroying everything

1262
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,407
And that's it must

1263
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
We proved that they don't have kids

1264
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,479
Even if almost all of them

1265
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
No no

1266
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,319
What you do is you have a

1267
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:23,391
Predetermined conclusion and then work back

1268
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
From the bike by making things up

1269
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,743
Because of the reality doesn't

1270
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,327
Gofit the predetermined conclusion and it feels better if you're right

1271
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,423
Overly generous Alex and pretend that he met the heads of

1272
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,471
The countries that are members of the EU

1273
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
But even then things go

1274
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,775
Get dumb really fast

1275
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,687
27 member states of the EU and here's a rapid-fire of the country and the number of kids

1276
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,247
Austria to kids

1277
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,807
Belgium to kids Bulgaria to kids

1278
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
Croatia to kids Cypress

1279
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,647
Czech Republic to kids

1280
00:55:55,903 --> 00:56:02,047
I'm not liking this

1281
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,191
Finland three kids

1282
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
No kids

1283
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,591
Grease one kid

1284
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
For kids

1285
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
That's the present

1286
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:19,967
But if you want to talk about the Prime Minister Viktor Orban

1287
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Yeah

1288
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,783
Ireland

1289
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
For kids

1290
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,831
Italy three kids

1291
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,391
Latvia to kids little kids

1292
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Luxembourg

1293
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
No kids

1294
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
But they have their head of state is gay and needs

1295
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,279
Just got married in 2015

1296
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
Multa three kids

1297
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
Netherlands

1298
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:36,607
None

1299
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,655
One more example

1300
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:39,935
Poland

1301
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
Kid Portugal

1302
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,519
Romania no kids

1303
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,055
Oh my God

1304
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
Slovakia

1305
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,919
Two kids Slovenia one kid

1306
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,711
Did Sweden

1307
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:56,063
That was excessive and I apologize for putting you through that but I did

1308
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
Decide to not

1309
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:07,583
No shot there I think it's important detail to really

1310
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Make sure that the picture

1311
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,167
Is clear that there is no basis for the things that Alex says

1312
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:17,823
He just makes up things that make his narrative see more persuasive or feel right to him in the moment and then he asserts the

1313
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,591
Summit facts

1314
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,407
And not just packed but actually proof of a larger

1315
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,199
Conspiracy that he's trying to sell his audience

1316
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:28,063
It's important to understand this dynamic because it's not a behavior that uses sparingly

1317
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,087
And it was already

1318
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
Approached his claims of even

1319
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,183
Basic level of scrutiny a lot of them would clap

1320
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
Apps haven't been shown to just be stuff that he's making up

1321
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,535
And he's engaging with a topic

1322
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,167
Is sensitive and serious is child sexual abuse with the level of disrespect in a responsibility these showing here

1323
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
Which it really disqualify him

1324
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:46,751
As a person need to take seriously about it

1325
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Yeah and it shouldn't even take you

1326
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
U2 seconds

1327
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
To be like will that do

1328
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
Doesn't make any sense

1329
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,919
Look at our presidents look at our f****** elect

1330
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:54,943
Good leaders.

1331
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
Most of them

1332
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,575
The vast majority of them and absurd majority of them

1333
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,903
Children in the RN a nuclear and style family

1334
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,463
Because we associate that right or wrong

1335
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
With a more

1336
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
Stable thought process

1337
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,327
That's what we've always done

1338
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,631
That's how it goes of course in

1339
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,167
Other Nation right

1340
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,191
They would do the same

1341
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,263
Here's what's going on I'm going to give you a let you in on a secret

1342
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,847
Alex's just imagining Emmanuel macron

1343
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:26,943
And then he's universalizing the fact that macron it doesn't have any kids

1344
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,223
Come out everybody

1345
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,295
I would like basically what's going on how many members

1346
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
Not I'm not going to ask for

1347
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,903
Cuz that would there's no chance there

1348
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,183
How many heads of state

1349
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
Cody name

1350
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,487
In the EU

1351
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:40,767
Like honestly

1352
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:46,143
Let me look at this list as number one answer would be Boris Johnson

1353
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
And they're not in the fuc

1354
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,447
Can eat you

1355
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
I think

1356
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
He could go for a macaron

1357
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Haha

1358
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,639
Probably Orban

1359
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
Maybe well he would

1360
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,199
I mean he's that's his

1361
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
That's his only friend

1362
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:06,879
In the EU even know if he would remember his name though too I like that guy at hungry who hates Soros

1363
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:10,463
The guy who's strong and powerful I'm looking at this list

1364
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:15,583
And I don't think I've heard Alexei any of these other names may be a Duda in Poland

1365
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,423
Yes the white nationalism Association

1366
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,031
I don't know that I don't think he knows his name either and it's hard to remember it's dude

1367
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567
Dude I do that

1368
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
So Alex

1369
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,247
He takes

1370
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Some

1371
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,295
Sidetracks

1372
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,087
In terms of talking about

1373
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
This

1374
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,879
Larger story

1375
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
About abuse against children

1376
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,231
And two other things like

1377
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
I don't know

1378
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,047
Covid vaccine

1379
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:52,191
Main and I program confirmed

1380
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:57,311
Hundred percent increase in heart attacks

1381
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,383
Multi thousand percent increases in

1382
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,431
Neurological disorders

1383
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,015
It just goes on and on

1384
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
Months ago

1385
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
With the first

1386
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,975
We talked about it yes

1387
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,743
Saturday

1388
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,399
White from the hospital

1389
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,775
And of course that's exactly what the FDA new and the CDC back

1390
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,847
October 2020 before the single injection was given

1391
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
They knew exactly what it

1392
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,431
Screen

1393
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
CNN

1394
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
The other pedophile

1395
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
Pieces

1396
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,303
Did you discredited disinformation

1397
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,399
Never show you

1398
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
What

1399
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,959
Talking about like

1400
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:04,383
They lie to you they're lying about Alex lying we tell you what this information we're giving you

1401
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,551
From Senator Ron Johnson recent panel on covid

1402
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Singing side effects

1403
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,623
What are the reports has presented chodes

1404
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,951
Surprisingly High rates of serious side effects

1405
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:22,303
This at this was presented by an attorney named Thomas rent

1406
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
Who's claiming that he got this information

1407
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
In from defense

1408
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
Medical epi

1409
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,167
MattyB ology database

1410
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,239
Which was provided him by three alleged whistleblower

1411
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:35,615
The thrust of this data was the conditions like cancer miscarriages and neurological issues were

1412
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,175
Wayup compared the data from years prior

1413
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,711
The vaccine being rolled out

1414
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,527
The problem however was it rented

1415
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
Release date

1416
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
Into a thorough job

1417
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,927
The lead stories reached out to.

1418
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:54,303
Comment and their spokesperson major Charlie beats said that they run a review on their database

1419
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,887
And found that the database covering the years of 2000

1420
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,423
Team to 2020

1421
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,031
Quote represented only a small fraction of the actual medical diagnosis for those gears

1422
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:08,383
In contrast the 2021 total number of medical diagnosis were up

1423
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,711
Seems like we got a lot of information from major.

1424
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
Sdib

1425
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:13,759
Got2b

1426
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
I got you

1427
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:20,159
I feel like at this point I'm doing that because that's fun

1428
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:23,231
Like like strong-arming you like

1429
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,047
I feel like I'm leaning into that and it's

1430
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,119
Ruth b still enjoy it

1431
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
They were able to determine

1432
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
This

1433
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Differentiation

1434
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,775
I have the the the only being a small fraction

1435
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,311
End of the actual diagnosis

1436
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,919
Because they are able to compare data sets from the defense medical epidemiology database

1437
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
And the defense

1438
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
What's medical surveillance

1439
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,551
It turns out that the latter has full information

1440
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,831
But Thomas rims

1441
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
This guy got numbers from the prior

1442
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,695
So he happy incomplete data set

1443
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:57,791
Who created the appearance

1444
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,815
That there were Sharp

1445
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
Increases this year

1446
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,911
When that's actually just the result of the dataset being a

1447
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
Incomplete

1448
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Anyway Alex is lying about this and the thing about him them knowing about side effects prior to the next rolling I was just for PowerPoint

1449
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
My presentation is made up a story about

1450
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,247
I think In that clip though what's valuable is he can see an important dynamic

1451
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:21,343
Alex says that this comes from. Numbers and specifically says that it's

1452
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
It's not from there

1453
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,927
He constantly reports on bulshit that

1454
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,719
Steve purses paddling from misusing

1455
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:27,487
A data

1456
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:30,559
But now that Alex feels like he's got a stronger source to use

1457
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,351
He builds up that Source biking

1458
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,911
Comparing it favorably to Vance

1459
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
Yeah he traded up

1460
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,751
It's me that Alex has at least a

1461
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:42,079
Something of a keen awareness of the stuff based on numbers

1462
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,359
Was always bulshit

1463
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
But he used

1464
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:47,967
Because it was the only option he had in order to make his narratives work

1465
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,247
Work and sensationalize

1466
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:54,879
I feel like this is a very similar Dynamic that Alex has to Wendy report stories and says

1467
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,927
It's in the mainstream news

1468
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
There's an unspoken second part of that sentence

1469
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,559
Which he speaks in the case of this clip hear about fairs

1470
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:06,399
But if it's too close to home in the case of the mainstream news thing

1471
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Because

1472
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,215
Full fought there is actually

1473
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
It's in the mainstream news

1474
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:14,591
Not on our dumb site that no one should take seriously

1475
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,615
Which

1476
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,455
Disease is more reliable and parentheses

1477
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:23,551
Yeah it's not in actual paper

1478
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
Parentheses

1479
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,903
A little bit

1480
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
So he mentioned vampire

1481
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,743
Psychic

1482
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,583
Well yeah I supposed to ones that are nailed into their home

1483
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,447
He doesn't get into the Chinese covid-19 virus

1484
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
But he's started

1485
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Think about psychics

1486
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Vampires

1487
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Time.

1488
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,103
F****** call this professor a Renfield

1489
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,407
There we go

1490
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
Call disguiser Winfield type

1491
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,951
Royalty from the Carpathian Mountains

1492
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
If they all knew that

1493
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
Romanian Hungarian

1494
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,799
Alex is trying to suggest I guess the Bram Stoker

1495
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,895
Ahsoka wrote the Dracula about the saxe-coburg-gotha

1496
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:21,919
So here's the problem

1497
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,711
British royalty being connect

1498
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:27,039
To the saxe-coburg-gotha line didn't begin until Edwards

1499
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
The 7th

1500
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,391
Who is the son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert of the saxe-coburg

1501
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Bird family

1502
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,719
Would begin his time as monarch

1503
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,999
In 1901

1504
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:39,327
Conversely Dracula the Bram Stoker book

1505
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,375
Was published in 1897

1506
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,935
And had been a project you've been working on for the better part of

1507
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
A decade

1508
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,799
Largely because his study of Transylvanian folklore that in

1509
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Informed the novel

1510
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,151
Romanian cultural feature of a creature called the

1511
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,479
Stoker's version of Dracula is based

1512
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:59,807
Likely with a bit of loud the Impaler thrown in for good measure

1513
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:02,111
As many have speculated

1514
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:08,511
Again this is an instance of Alex just making up a story about the little pieces of trivia that he thinks are connected

1515
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,791
Really

1516
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
Except for his imagination

1517
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,607
He's a liar who can

1518
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,167
Stop himself from just making things up if that's

1519
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,191
Easier for him

1520
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:19,007
In terms of being able to present himself like he knows every

1521
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:23,359
Also Alex ends up going on a Meandering

1522
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:26,431
Interpretation of the plot of the movie Dracula

1523
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,967
Instead of getting

1524
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:33,087
I think the 1992

1525
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,671
I don't know I haven't seen all of the Dracula Canon

1526
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:37,951
But I would assume it's that way

1527
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,791
I don't think it's Nosferatu

1528
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,327
Although that one would be fun

1529
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,935
The point about the presser cuz he doesn't want to cover that story

1530
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,775
I think it's because he doesn't have anything to say about the story except to connect

1531
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,311
The ramblings about

1532
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
Renfield's and Dracula's

1533
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Do y'all about it

1534
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
His birthday

1535
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
Tickler picadillos

1536
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:01,503
Yeah there's only one Dracula and that's Leslie Nielsen

1537
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
Sure

1538
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:11,487
I was going to say bubba hotel has more Mommy

1539
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,327
So anyway here is where we get

1540
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,095
2

1541
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,679
That I would actually say are particularly

1542
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:20,447
Just got f*****

1543
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,031
So skip ahead if you don't want to hear

1544
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
2 clip

1545
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,079
Suppressed 30 seconds

1546
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,871
It might be a little more than that but

1547
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
This ain't this ain't good

1548
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:43,999
He's just talking about how it's good for a man

1549
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,631
Shut up

1550
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:56,799
Schools are teaching kids America sucks and the schools are teaching kids that can be another gender

1551
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,383
Is a war on Humanity

1552
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
.

1553
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:04,991
I have no idea of Kirchner have kids or is married and neither does Alex

1554
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:10,623
This clip is disgusting but it also has fairly Illuminating in terms of one of Alex's more Insidious rhetoric

1555
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,391
Tactics

1556
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:15,743
He gets all worked up yelling about this one story that he's a very shallow grass pond

1557
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,791
Eddie's building up this energy

1558
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
He pivots to

1559
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
Completely unrelated set of topics

1560
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,167
And he carries that same energy

1561
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:23,935
Dover

1562
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,215
Which is meant to allow the audience

1563
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
Needs to make an emotion

1564
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,799
No connection between these unrelated narratives

1565
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:34,687
He builds up his anger and hatred for Kirchner and anger it is extremely nationalism

1566
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:38,271
He's very bigoted views about trans people

1567
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:41,343
This is an intentional move on his part because

1568
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:43,647
He wants the audience to associate that feeling

1569
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,207
He's trying to create them about the Christmas Story 2

1570
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,999
Do all of his perceived enemies

1571
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:53,119
His strategy is one part emotional manipulation and one part that he really can't

1572
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,143
Do anything else

1573
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:58,239
He's not capable of covering any story with any real depth so

1574
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:01,823
There isn't really another option for him than renting wildly and

1575
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,871
Pretending everything he's talking about his connect

1576
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
But of course there's another thing he's trying

1577
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
To use this energy

1578
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Before and you can

1579
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,063
See it in this also very disgusting clip

1580
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,367
It comes just after the last one we heard

1581
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,951
He's off

1582
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,839
Until they all go to prison

1583
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
Major Payne

1584
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:36,127
Repeat itself again and these people coming after me cuz they know I know who they are that's why we need money to fight

1585
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,151
These monsters

1586
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Rodger

1587
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
Dot-com

1588
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,463
Arizona sales going on

1589
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Over there

1590
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,791
You can see the way that this

1591
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
This strategy

1592
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
It works

1593
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
I'm take

1594
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,399
Money away from

1595
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
People who fight PETA

1596
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,727
There is

1597
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:04,031
A conversation that somebody could

1598
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,567
Could very easily have

1599
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
About

1600
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,359
The dis

1601
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Taste

1602
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Amanda

1603
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Approval

1604
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
Of the comments

1605
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,247
The cursed mermaid in that

1606
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
Energy

1607
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:18,111
I don't disagree with Alex taking issue with them

1608
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,695
I do take issue with his inability to engage

1609
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,463
With

1610
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,743
The actual story

1611
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:26,303
His clear not awareness

1612
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:28,095
Surrounding it except

1613
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
For that he's supposed to

1614
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,447
Get mad about it cuz Joe Rogan told him about it the night before

1615
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,983
And Hughes

1616
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,263
Use of it

1617
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,311
Specifically only

1618
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:41,151
To create passion surrounding his other issues that he's either really

1619
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Really invested in

1620
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
+ 2

1621
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Make it

1622
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,063
Compelling emotional argument for people to give him money

1623
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,367
Yeah I think that this is just disgusting

1624
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
I mean it

1625
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:51,903
It's it's

1626
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,183
888sport

1627
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,207
Because

1628
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,231
If you

1629
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:58,047
Saw somebody setting up like a f****** 8

1630
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
Charity

1631
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,887
And saying please donate so I can fight

1632
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
Horrific disease of AIDS

1633
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,263
And then you found out that all they did

1634
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:13,663
What's f*** all and make their own f****** radio show better

1635
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
BBC Aureus with that person

1636
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,503
He is saying that he's doing something

1637
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:24,671
A couple years back when that there was that episode with Craig saw man Sawyer

1638
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,231
Yeah that was even more direct

1639
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,767
Ali-A

1640
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
Fraud

1641
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:30,559
Yeah

1642
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
Maybe the

1643
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,983
More distasteful

1644
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
Clips

1645
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,031
I have passed

1646
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,615
Unless of course you consider listening to Marjorie Taylor Greene

1647
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,663
Specifically the states.

1648
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,967
I meant there's still a Content warning in at waist

1649
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:52,063
Here's just another clip of Alex's sales pitch

1650
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,343
Before we get to her

1651
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,671
We can build our war chest to build our infrastructure

1652
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,743
Prayer and your word of mouth

1653
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,887
Never Back Down

1654
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,063
That's so fake

1655
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
It's a really interesting way to do an abusive that

1656
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:30,975
Alex is basically saying that he fails it's only because the audience

1657
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,023
Didn't support him a topic give him enough money

1658
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:37,887
It's a perfect way for a narcissist to relate to the world nothing can be his fault

1659
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
Just gross

1660
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:45,055
Man gets even worse you realize that he's saying that he's fighting

1661
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
Pedophiles

1662
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,151
And then he's going to take that money and use it

1663
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:52,479
To avoid giving the parents of Sandy Hook

1664
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,015
Victims money

1665
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,039
You know like

1666
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,319
This is f***** up

1667
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:06,047
When I get now you're working out to Cypress Creek calling pigs evil

1668
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,119
Morally bankrupt Auto in a in a way

1669
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,399
That would really

1670
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,167
F****** up

1671
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,727
For the rest of my life if I did one thing

1672
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
In this chain of events

1673
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:19,359
I would spend the rest of my life like a confession

1674
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,895
Well Alex

1675
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
I guess he has a much closer relations

1676
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,807
Chip tha God than you do in Auto forgive probably true

1677
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
My phone had one of those

1678
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Is auto forgive

1679
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,999
This is this segment is over and now Alex

1680
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,815
Welcoming Marjorie Taylor Greene to the show

1681
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
And

1682
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:44,447
The introduction and I think is a little bit self-serving

1683
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,727
On Alex's bar

1684
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:51,359
A lot of new people have gotten into Congress

1685
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,967
Republic of them the most informative and interesting and brave

1686
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,271
It's got to be Marjorie Taylor Greene

1687
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,831
I really appreciate it

1688
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
Because you know

1689
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,159
CNN MSNBC

1690
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,439
People should interview her

1691
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,815
She should be banned and she has been

1692
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:14,143
Oh you shouldn't talk to Alex Jones either we should all

1693
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,959
Be scared of each other as Nationalist and as Pop

1694
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
We're not

1695
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,591
CNN on average has 100,000 viewers Joe Rogan

1696
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:26,687
More than 20

1697
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,063
They're a joke the people have spoke

1698
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,599
They want freedom

1699
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:38,463
I thought you were trying to introduce your

1700
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,487
Weird

1701
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,791
I mean

1702
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,071
Then why are you mad

1703
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,631
Why are you mad that

1704
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:52,031
CNN won't have you on they've only got 100,000 potatoes

1705
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,847
Talk at all about what CNN's says instead of

1706
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,711
Constantly harping about how it's the worst thing that ever happened to you

1707
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:04,063
Like I've heard this from some of our listeners before and I kind of feel similarly

1708
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:09,183
If it weren't for Alex I have no idea who Brian stelter wife

1709
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,535
These elevated these people

1710
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,631
It's a yeah it's a strange strategy

1711
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
It kind of makes me think of

1712
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,703
Things are true

1713
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,519
So Marjorie comes in and

1714
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Bad off

1715
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:33,247
Thanks so much for having me on Alexander to be here

1716
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
I'm a big fan of yours as well

1717
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
Where do you want start

1718
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
Maybe the state of the country

1719
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,463
Things are going

1720
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,791
That's a bad start that she's a big fan of Alex

1721
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:52,191
Wow I've never heard her speak before I've off

1722
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:56,287
I never heard Trump talk for like 3 years ago

1723
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Awful

1724
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:57,823
Who voted for

1725
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,383
Stop it some people in Georgia apparently

1726
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,943
She's she's pretty adept

1727
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:08,319
Using the buzzwords and what have you and primary season

1728
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Some thoughts on that

1729
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,719
It's the Republican rhinos who walk in talking

1730
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:15,743
Till I guess

1731
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:20,863
And then they do different things behind closed doors that went the way they vote and legislate

1732
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:22,911
And the people they take money from

1733
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:27,007
And unfortunately does Republicans have joined with the Democrats and

1734
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,055
That's been happening for a really long time

1735
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
They serve the globalist agenda and as a matter of fact today I'm waiting to have to go a boat here in just a little bit

1736
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
Against

1737
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:37,759
Compete

1738
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:43,647
And that's what Nancy Pelosi is bringing to the house floor today she's working on getting that done

1739
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:45,439
Amendments

1740
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,767
Republican amendments to change it in This Is Us

1741
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,327
So-called bill that supposed to go against China

1742
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,375
And helped America to compete

1743
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,959
The all honesty the truth is that serves the climate changed

1744
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:58,751
Radical agenda and served

1745
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,055
China first in America last

1746
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:05,407
And it's all build back better and green new deal just Rewritten

1747
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,199
Something that she lies and calls

1748
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,479
America competes

1749
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
So it's the Same Song & Dance

1750
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
But it's Mitch McConnell and

1751
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:18,975
And the Lindsey Graham's and many Republicans here that have allowed these things to happen to our country

1752
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,023
And this is my primary season

1753
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,559
This is why

1754
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:27,679
Everyone needs to get involved and we have to make sure that we send the right people to Congress

1755
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,495
People like me people who are willing to fight

1756
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
Because we have to

1757
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
Save our country and

1758
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,615
It's in a bad place right now

1759
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:45,599
Melange of meaningless words

1760
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:48,415
Primary season

1761
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
I think she should be worried

1762
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,047
She won the GOP Primary in 2020 in a runoff election

1763
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:57,631
Then against the person who came in second in the original vote John Cowan

1764
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,935
Interesting Lee in the runoff

1765
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,983
Marjorie Taylor Greene got almost the eggs

1766
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,775
Exact same number of votes

1767
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,079
I bet she did in the original

1768
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
She got the crazy

1769
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
In the election

1770
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,175
Other runoff she got 43,000

1771
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,199
830

1772
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:11,967
13 votes

1773
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,991
In the original like

1774
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271
She got 43,000

1775
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,807
892

1776
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,343
Russia lost

1777
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:21,951
89 or 79 rotors what did you do to piss them off

1778
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:28,351
Meanwhile John Cowan earned just over a 10,000 additional votes in the runoff

1779
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:34,495
Which strongly suggests that Marjorie Taylor Greene has a very firm ceiling to her popularity at least as it relates

1780
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
The primary

1781
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:39,103
As for the general election she was probably going to win that no matter what

1782
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,663
Georgia 14th District is a republican Plus

1783
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,199
27th District

1784
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,295
But she was also essentially running unopposed after the Democratic candidate Kevin

1785
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,575
Vanoss adult

1786
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Are officially withdrew from the race fire

1787
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
The election

1788
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,231
The fact that it's a district that swings heavily to the GOP

1789
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,303
Actually know it might be helpful in the general but it's

1790
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,351
Snow good for greeting in the primary

1791
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:04,191
She's facing for challengers in the GOP Primary this year

1792
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:10,591
A couple of them stand possibly draw votes Away by appealing to the public as a person who has the same kind of America first

1793
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359
Politics

1794
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:16,223
But without the baggage of greens past associations with qanon and some of the liabilities

1795
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,015
She has to be taken seriously like

1796
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,807
Going on f****** Infowars

1797
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
That one would be a big

1798
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,135
There's another potential problem

1799
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
But you has though

1800
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,463
And that's that's a registered Democrats

1801
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,279
Vote in the GOP Primary in Georgia

1802
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,839
If enough Democratic voters decided to

1803
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:35,935
The Pont on the Democratic primary and instead vote in the GOP Primary

1804
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:37,727
They can essentially sink breathe

1805
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,495
Candidacy

1806
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:44,127
I don't have much faith that anyone would be able to pull off this sort of organization or anything but

1807
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
If public sentiment were strongly opposed to her enough

1808
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,479
The Democratic Party

1809
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,295
Could essentially choose between GOP Primary candidates

1810
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,343
Inevitably end up winning in

1811
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
The General

1812
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:58,975
GOP plus 2017 has almost no chance that the Democratic candidate

1813
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
It is going to win the general

1814
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:02,047
And Marjorie Taylor Greene is akam

1815
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Leave lunatic

1816
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
Take a poster

1817
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,607
The threat to having a

1818
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,375
Functioning government

1819
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
So it might not be the worst electoral strategy

1820
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,703
GT use the votes

1821
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,983
The do exist to make sure the

1822
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:10,751
But she can't make it

1823
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
Get to the general for fucksake based on her previous actions in Congress she's a danger to the lives of

1824
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,176
Other Congress people

1825
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:25,088
I I feel like you might be mixing her and Lauren boebert

1826
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:31,488
She's gone right up into people's faces you don't have prior to being in Congress she did say that Nancy Pelosi should be

1827
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,536
There was there was that

1828
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:38,912
She has made it very clear that she would prefer the deaths of her colleagues to I guess

1829
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,192
Regular Legends

1830
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,216
Yeah I see

1831
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:46,336
Think that there could be a really interesting movement that Democrats in Georgia could attempt

1832
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:49,920
Yeah I think that it would be highly controversial

1833
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,200
Hilarious

1834
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,248
Sure they would be real mad

1835
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:58,368
What are the inherent problems of it would have to be that everyone would have to

1836
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,136
Probably get

1837
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,184
Behind the same GOP candidate

1838
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
Right and I think that could be

1839
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
Have fun with it

1840
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,072
No Big Ten Network that she might still win

1841
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
How many

1842
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
Candidates are there

1843
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:16,544
There's she has four competitors competitors and automakers

1844
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,336
With a total of

1845
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
What like

1846
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,640
Less than 100,000 votes

1847
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,664
Obvious

1848
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:26,016
Yammy primary voting is usually lower

1849
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:29,856
I think they could probably get just about anybody they wanted in

1850
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:34,976
And then they would waste leave Georgia legislators time having to go back and be like fine

1851
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,280
We can't allow Democrats to vote in primaries

1852
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:43,680
Open primary

1853
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,872
It's the same sort of thing because nothing in the rules that says the horse can't play football

1854
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,200
Absolutely an air bugs

1855
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,224
Situation

1856
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,016
So apparently

1857
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
Green

1858
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,832
Kick-off Twitter recently what she is

1859
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
F****** pumped

1860
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:02,368
Devout

1861
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,184
What is about you

1862
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,512
Business woman that you've been successful that you're loyal the country

1863
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,096
Yes absolutely but I don't

1864
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:16,192
And I refused doing and saying the things that I'm doing

1865
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:20,544
Just kicks

1866
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,872
Joining you and so many others that have been kicked

1867
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,920
That hateful evil left

1868
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,528
Verizon and basically controls politics

1869
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,320
Messaging in the media

1870
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:37,696
And I'm so happy I got kicked

1871
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,024
You really are the greatest Americans

1872
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
Again just trying to

1873
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,608
Pretend Vape to

1874
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
Self-imposed

1875
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,936
Yahara persecution complex

1876
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,960
Does the same thing as

1877
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
Virtue

1878
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,824
Is an empty psychopath this is a terrifying

1879
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:00,736
She can wear like getting kicked off Twitter as a badge of honor because Twitter such a gross Dan of

1880
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,528
Leftist garbage or whatever

1881
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,112
Really raises the question of why she was ever there in the first place

1882
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,904
That's kind of obvious it

1883
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:10,464
Because it's the biggest platform of its kind

1884
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Choose able to post

1885
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,048
Inflammatory things there to raise donations and

1886
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
Data retention

1887
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
She never left

1888
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,120
Because walking

1889
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,680
Just up to the line of getting kicked off Twitter

1890
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,472
Is in the central part of her business

1891
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,240
This plan

1892
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:26,592
And now that it's half of the only real move for her in order to maintain her brand is to do exactly this

1893
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:29,408
Steph you actually hated Twitter

1894
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,456
You're proud to be kicked off that's the ticket

1895
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,576
Their lesson with Laura Loomer about what happens when you complain about getting

1896
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,624
Ticked off if you look

1897
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,392
You look real weak

1898
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:45,792
Yeah and they don't like that trying to the Handcuff yourself to Twitter's door and like

1899
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,168
You need to you need to have this defiant attitude as opposed to like

1900
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:57,568
Walk like it's finally time they got me they got rid of it you know like that hole

1901
01:23:58,592 --> 01:24:02,688
Be thankful for the time but you were able to

1902
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:07,040
Griffin attention that donation has the friends you made along the way

1903
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:13,440
Don't be sad because dog be happy because you had that time on Twitter

1904
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,560
Soolantra

1905
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:21,376
So green has some interesting thoughts

1906
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
And by that I mean

1907
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
Does not interest

1908
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,216
Thoughts but similar thoughts to Alex

1909
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,240
About that covid

1910
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:29,568
Pure evil in and what's even worse is

1911
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,616
How the FDA has said that you

1912
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:33,664
People can't doctors can't prescribe

1913
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,432
Ivermectin

1914
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:37,504
Now they're saying monoclonal antibodies can't be used

1915
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:41,856
Against covid-19 because they're saying it doesn't work against

1916
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:48,512
An indoor forcing math children an acrostic in on people across the world I mean this is truly mental ill

1917
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:53,632
Wearing a mask today after two years of this Chinese virus that is in

1918
01:24:55,168 --> 01:25:01,312
This man-made Chinese virus at dr. fauci

1919
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:06,432
People still wearing mask I mean it's truly mentally ill we know the masks don't work

1920
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,968
And the vaccines.

1921
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,760
She's in Congress

1922
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:16,416
Also I study that Alex reported on earlier disagrees with her statement that Matt's

1923
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,720
Is that the show

1924
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,768
Guess who's in Congress

1925
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
Wow

1926
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
Just

1927
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
Just wow

1928
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:24,608
Just

1929
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,144
An absolute raving nut

1930
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,936
Imagine

1931
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,496
This is the thing that blows my my

1932
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,776
Sometimes whenever I stop

1933
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
To back off about how this is

1934
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,360
Is the culture war and how everybody just

1935
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:42,016
Digs in for no f****** reason on s*** why is everybody standing Ivermectin so

1936
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784
Hard

1937
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:49,184
I get the Trump did it so you don't want him to look bad but we're past it that's because it's go away.

1938
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,000
No because it's an essential argument

1939
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,304
Of why the vaccine is unnecessary

1940
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:58,656
Painting a chemical guy

1941
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:01,216
Well here's the thing the argument goes

1942
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
Basically like this

1943
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
There is no reason

1944
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,336
To have given emerge

1945
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
The authorization

1946
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,896
To this vaccine

1947
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:15,296
And they have to hold onto the idea that Ivermectin worked or else your argument Falls

1948
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:19,136
The part that there was actually caused

1949
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904
Do the bikes

1950
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:25,792
I am so in order to not have to let that domino fall and their entire anti-vax argument

1951
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,584
Starts to crumble around it

1952
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,864
I have to hold onto this

1953
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,400
Nonsense long past it

1954
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,424
Expiration

1955
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,448
I suppose

1956
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,008
So a sweet Navaira make

1957
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,568
Green likes it

1958
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
And handsome

1959
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,128
Dangerous ideas

1960
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,944
But I think that people really have blood on their hands

1961
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,480
Stop.

1962
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,576
The prescriptions of ivermectin refuse people who have had

1963
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:52,416
Family members in the hospital not being able to take Ivermectin

1964
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
Or any other kind of life

1965
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,744
Play Saving treatment

1966
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:01,888
I mean I truly think that we need to investigate all these people are investigating the deaths that are reported on the bear system

1967
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,680
And hold people accountable

1968
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,448
Because it's

1969
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,032
Dr. fauci and anyone at the CDC or anyone involved

1970
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:11,104
Life-saving treatments and Therapies

1971
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,920
Can people died why think they're guilty of murder

1972
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,992
You're absolutely right

1973
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:21,856
This is a really dangerous line for green to be suggesting and for Alex to be agreeing with

1974
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:25,696
And I don't mean that it's societally dangerous I mean standards for them

1975
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,536
Her belief is that people who stopped life-saving therapy

1976
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,304
Tribute chart

1977
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,328
With murder but

1978
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,400
If that's carried to its logical conclusion she better hope

1979
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:37,728
Let no one ever proved that the vaccine is a life-saving

1980
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:41,824
Unfortunately that's been overwhelmingly documented whereas the proof of

1981
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,872
Yeah her b******* about Ivermectin

1982
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,968
Wow so we've got all of Infowars

1983
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:54,368
Fox News and Joe Rogan all of them on the hook for murder

1984
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,928
Murder one at least using her logic it would be

1985
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:03,328
Very easy to construct an argument that if people who refuse the vaccine because their elected leaders or demagogues like Alex

1986
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
Told them it was dangerous and blocked

1987
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:05,888
Kill everyone

1988
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,960
They died of covid then

1989
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,520
Alex our green should be charged with murder

1990
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,592
It's premeditated and it's for money that's

1991
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,664
Man these people are serial killers were bounty

1992
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:24,320
It's not like fauci was physically slapping Ivermectin out of people's hands it was just recommendations that the CDC gay

1993
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:30,976
You can still get Ivermectin there's a little industry that popped up of doctors online who prescribed it for you and Alex's

1994
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
I have them on his gas

1995
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:36,608
Similarly alexandrine Ark forcing anyone to not get the vax

1996
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,656
There's giving medical advice

1997
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,680
I am puking

1998
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:44,032
Straight to this medical advice contributed to someone dying from covid by their own standards

1999
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:45,824
They should be charged with murder

2000
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:49,664
I guess all they would take is finding someone who died and was a fan of Alex

2001
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:52,480
There's one guy named Doug

2002
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,248
Kuzma

2003
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,576
The Conspiracy Theory podcast who died of covid in early January

2004
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:02,464
After likely catching it at the reawakened America rally in Dallas in mid-December which Alex actually spoke

2005
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,000
His Facebook is

2006
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:07,840
Look anymore but I wouldn't be too surprised to see some Infowars repost

2007
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:10,400
Alex narratives by covid flying around

2008
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:14,752
Wow examples but I really care to pursue this any further

2009
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:21,152
It's just relevant to recognize that the standard that these people like alexandrine or setting about their imaginary complaints about fauci

2010
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:23,712
If apply to themselves would lead to them

2011
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:25,760
Being sent to jail for a very long time

2012
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,296
They're f****** stupid

2013
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,832
All right I think

2014
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,880
Made it very clear

2015
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,648
That's

2016
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
You and I need to stop recording right now and go perform a citizen's arrest on Alex Jones for the crime of murder

2017
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,400
Knock knock

2018
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:48,800
If I did do that I would arrest him in his voice I would have to do that

2019
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:53,920
To make him even more Angry on the right to remain silent talk to me like that

2020
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,528
So

2021
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:00,320
Alice is interviewing.

2022
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:02,112
Little bit of tension

2023
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:05,184
But you might have to go give a vote

2024
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,976
It could be again

2025
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,000
She's in Concord

2026
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,304
That's real real bummer.

2027
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,888
So she discusses this vote that she's going to have to take

2028
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:14,912
Asthmatic

2029
01:30:17,216 --> 01:30:18,240
Conversation

2030
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,336
Phyllis compete Bill she was telling me ears

2031
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,152
The whole leftist agenda

2032
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:25,920
Better

2033
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:33,856
Well this is the bill that Nancy Pelosi is pushing to the floor and I'm going to show you guys

2034
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:36,672
Can be hard for you to say but this is the bill

2035
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:40,512
It's approximately 3,000 pages

2036
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536
And it's

2037
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:46,656
It's unbelievable they gave it to us on Monday as if we're supposed to be able to read it

2038
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,448
And then vote on it likely

2039
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:52,288
Possibly today maybe tomorrow

2040
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,896
And it shouldn't operate this way it's filled with complete garbage

2041
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,712
Everything in there totally it hurts our country

2042
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:03,552
Aoc's climate change Green New Deal agenda

2043
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,368
Billion dollars for climate change

2044
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:12,768
It gets billions of dollars to the UN it gets all of this money away but does nothing for our Chi

2045
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:14,048
And get this

2046
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,352
It only mentions the word

2047
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:19,424
Sentinelone

2048
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:25,568
From the CCP is what's killing our young people every single day at work

2049
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:27,616
Nancy Pelosi for you

2050
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:31,712
For one thing it is difficult to read long bills but like you scream

2051
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
That's part of the job

2052
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,784
It's why you representative

2053
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:40,416
If I can help out with that and honestly she sounds like someone who's like you gave me too much homework

2054
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,720
The possible to read this book

2055
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:47,840
In this case it shouldn't be that big of an ask because this isn't really a new bill

2056
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:54,496
A version of it passed the Senate last July by a 68-32 vote which means

2057
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:55,264
Support

2058
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,568
This is something that is some kind of like a socialist

2059
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:59,872
What's the fantasy Bill like she seems to be pretending

2060
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:02,688
It's really weird that Bernie Sanders voted against

2061
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,480
But I guess Marjorie probably no

2062
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,760
Yeah yeah

2063
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,576
Bernie complained about not being able to read it

2064
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:14,976
No I'm pretty sure he was like I can't vote for this because I've never worked in government before a lot of points

2065
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,256
She's making or just stupid

2066
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:21,888
The premise that spending money on various places and investing in things like the UN does nothing for our country

2067
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:24,192
I just think that's obviously incorrect.

2068
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,728
You don't even need to

2069
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,008
That's not a narc

2070
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,800
The Senate version of this bill

2071
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
Also

2072
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:37,248
It had sent it said fentanyl 17 times they removed 16 mentions of Fentanyl

2073
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,784
Maybe maybe when the bills are Rekha

2074
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,088
Cancel that number I'll get bumped up a little bit

2075
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,624
Also in the interest of like this

2076
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
Just complete fairness

2077
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,184
Steve version of the bill in the

2078
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,976
The house that came out of the rules committee

2079
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
Use the word Fentanyl

2080
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
10 *

2081
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,840
According to

2082
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:55,168
To dream all right here's what I'm saying

2083
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,448
They have to put

2084
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,496
Fentanyl 8 times

2085
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,056
Into the reconciled Bill Plus

2086
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
Just kneel

2087
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
One point

2088
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Play + 8.5

2089
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:10,016
And a paragraph about how great Alex's character Fentanyl

2090
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,552
I like that one

2091
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:14,368
But in reality this bill seeks to do a lot of things

2092
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:17,184
Things that that in terms of lip service Alex's in favor of

2093
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,488
Like supporting Manufacturing in the United States

2094
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,792
Particularly in the area of

2095
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,608
Ultimately though its government spending

2096
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:29,728
And the leader is he seems to respect if somehow crafted very strong opinions on the bill without reading it

2097
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,776
So it's got to be evil and must be stopped

2098
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,312
This is baby politics

2099
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
Yeah this is

2100
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:37,664
This is really really sad is really sad

2101
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:43,040
It's odd it would be nice to live in like the

2102
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,832
Early 1800s

2103
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
You know

2104
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,648
Before you knew how to read

2105
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,952
You couldn't pay attention you didn't know what

2106
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:54,304
The government was doing so you couldn't immediately be like oh well obviously

2107
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:57,888
I with my third grade education

2108
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,680
I'm more qualified to work in

2109
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:01,472
Can the government than most of the people there

2110
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,264
But here you and I

2111
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:08,128
I've almost got it I've almost got a college degree and that lady

2112
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:09,920
Should be out of Congress by Fred

2113
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
It's troubling

2114
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,784
So like I said

2115
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
Earlier in the episode

2116
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
I felt like

2117
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:18,880
This is obviously trolling

2118
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,184
On a certain level green on

2119
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:25,024
Not necessarily the entire interview but there were going to be parts

2120
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,304
That were trouble

2121
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,096
And I think that this is one of the

2122
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,912
Do you know I like to see you as this

2123
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
Speaker of the House

2124
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:35,008
Really scared about

2125
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,800
Election fraud

2126
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:43,200
I am too I'm very concerned about it and actually most Republican voters are concerned about it

2127
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,784
And I've been very upset that publicans up here on the hill

2128
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:52,160
Haven't taken it serious but we should take it serious because the stolen presidential election

2129
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:56,512
Is the most serious thing that could happen in our country and we've seen the outcome

2130
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,608
Becoming our president

2131
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:03,424
It's been horrific and we've been suffering ever since

2132
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,496
When the last congressional election

2133
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:14,944
Oh I want I want huge but I have a strong Republican districts

2134
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
Even

2135
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:20,832
They can't question my election

2136
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,928
Who's asking that part about the record margin because it's one of his

2137
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:28,256
Just made it up or saw it in a meme

2138
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,792
Please open the solidifier

2139
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:34,400
With her every bit nice if she was like it doesn't have to be true Marjorie

2140
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:37,472
I applaud her for not just going along with it cuz it

2141
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
Would feel good in the moment

2142
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:42,080
I don't applaud her how everything that the 2020 election was stolen

2143
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:42,848
That sucks

2144
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,152
Good news here is that there's no chance

2145
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:48,224
Even if the GOP take back the house big green will be the

2146
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,320
She wasn't even in the House GOP leadership right now

2147
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,368
Never be able to Rally the kind of

2148
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,648
Support you would need to get in

2149
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Into the speaker

2150
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:57,952
With almost

2151
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:01,024
Zero doubt if the house flipped Kevin McCarthy would be the speed

2152
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:04,352
And maybe if you wanted to get real weird you might

2153
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,144
Macy's Steve scalise be able to

2154
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,424
To put together the kind of sport

2155
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:11,520
We need from his position as the minority whip I was going to say I

2156
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
That be interesting

2157
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:16,128
It would undoubtedly be able to make a lot of noise

2158
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,664
And get people to yell about how she's

2159
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,432
You should be the speaker

2160
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,200
Maybe

2161
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,528
But in terms of that meeting anything to the Congressional process

2162
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
It's just

2163
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:28,160
And that's one of the reasons why I think that I was just trying to gather

2164
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,696
Headlights

2165
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,464
To get people

2166
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,792
Go to follow through with it

2167
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:41,216
Alex wants Margarita claim that their make

2168
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:44,032
It's a claim that Alex knows is ridiculous and and

2169
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,104
For all her inability to

2170
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,152
Exist as an actual legislator

2171
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
Gino's of

2172
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:50,944
It's not

2173
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,784
January 6th

2174
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:55,808
A little bit

2175
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
You're what people want

2176
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
Amazing power

2177
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
Beautiful woman

2178
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,256
Promoting freedom

2179
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,168
Democrats in Congress

2180
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,704
For January 6th

2181
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,552
Violence

2182
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,856
And we really appreciate

2183
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,160
You gone and then tried to

2184
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:41,120
I suspected Alex's mostly bring up January 6th we can leave together his own personal victimhood and get green to talk

2185
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:45,216
About them being in that struggle together

2186
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:48,544
Yeah Dumbo partially because greens record on the 6th

2187
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312
This is not good

2188
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,872
Wanting her actions leading up to the six

2189
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,408
Explicitly fan the Flames with

2190
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
Conspiracies

2191
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
Is it light up to the storm again

2192
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,224
The capital

2193
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Just before it

2194
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,184
Perhaps more Daisy was the Revelation that one of her Close Associates Anthony Aguero was one of the people who

2195
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,464
The capital

2196
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,560
Pretty weird conflict-of-interest when it comes to her positions on the folks

2197
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:13,376
Involved that day you came to look to her as

2198
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,424
Any kind of impartial voice on the matter

2199
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:18,496
Man I would I would argue that to you

2200
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
Close enough to a Coke

2201
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Conspirator

2202
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,408
Also no one's afraid of green because she believes in Freedom and is so strong and powerful

2203
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,992
She's completely insane and is now in a position of power which

2204
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,016
Easily abused

2205
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,064
In 2017 she called

2206
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,088
Qanon quote

2207
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,160
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this globe

2208
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:39,232
Global cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles

2209
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:44,096
Shero blog post about the unite the right rally being an inside job

2210
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,376
The pizzagate conspiracy

2211
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,936
And wrote on Facebook and Nancy Pelosi get committed

2212
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
Executed

2213
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:54,592
She wrote about her beliefs a job podesta had Seth Rich killed for releasing the Wikileaks emails

2214
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,384
Which proved that pizzagate was real

2215
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:02,016
Was trying to bring about white genocide

2216
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:04,320
Her life and work is demonstrated

2217
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,344
The clear pattern summer

2218
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,136
Can't access information topic

2219
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
Bentley

2220
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,720
Nowhere near the level levers of power

2221
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,256
She believes complete

2222
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,280
Bullshittin

2223
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,816
Beliefs motivator to act

2224
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,584
In ways that could be

2225
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,608
Be seriously Danger

2226
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,144
As illustrated by

2227
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:23,264
Her bulshit believes around the 2020 election letter to act in a way that encourage the storming of the capitol

2228
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,848
This is pure and simple why people are afraid of

2229
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,152
Not because she's too into freedom

2230
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:29,920
It's because

2231
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
She's really scare

2232
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
And she

2233
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,040
Write your name

2234
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:40,672
Well that's just because the guardian 100 letter have a pencil she could hurt

2235
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:42,720
Self right now

2236
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:48,352
She chose to have her Congressional office in Vacaville

2237
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:51,168
If you would stop smearing your s*** all over the walls

2238
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,192
So

2239
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,264
Some theories about January 6th

2240
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,592
This is dumb antifa

2241
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,872
People like real

2242
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:05,248
Who were telling people to go into the Capitol in people to go in the capitol

2243
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
Like the capital

2244
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:08,576
And all these horrible things that Rahab said

2245
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:11,392
And I didn't see Ray Addison the DC jail Alex

2246
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:12,672
That's what I went in there

2247
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,232
When I saw these pretrial January 6th

2248
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,000
Descendants

2249
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,280
Being held

2250
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:21,376
In solitary confinement roughly twenty-two to twenty-three hours a day

2251
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
C Reyes in there

2252
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:26,752
And so we need to do these investigations when Republicans take

2253
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,544
The house if we're able to take

2254
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,592
But the house after this election cycle

2255
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:32,896
But we need to go in there and we need to find out what

2256
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,688
What's going on because Ray Epps

2257
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:37,760
Is the one question that no one can answer

2258
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:40,832
Then the fact that Adam kinzinger Liz Cheney and the rest of the day

2259
01:40:41,344 --> 01:40:43,904
Testing January 6th committee

2260
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
Finding this guy

2261
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:48,000
Just shows you and exposes all of their lives

2262
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:52,864
I can't dare come after someone like you Alex or innocent people that got legal

2263
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,216
Rally permit for people that work for trumpet Trump Administration

2264
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,752
And so on

2265
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:04,384
They shouldn't come after any of you and they're going to stand there and let Reyes off the hook because we know what he did

2266
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,920
He is clearly guilty

2267
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,200
More than anyone

2268
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,784
The only evidence has Ding Dongs have it all that Reyes was somehow involved

2269
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,576
Been plotting to storm the capital is it tonight

2270
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:14,368
Around outside

2271
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:19,232
Is that the people should go into the capitol the next day when talking to a random person was video recording

2272
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,048
For January 6th I would guess that upwards of

2273
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:24,096
Tens of people had seen that video

2274
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,400
Characters of the standard the green is going to use

2275
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:27,424
Scientist determines guilt

2276
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:32,544
Associate Matt Bracken should be far higher on her list of people to arrest

2277
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:34,848
He was on air on Infowars

2278
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,640
About a week prior to the 6 thing

2279
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:40,480
Barber in phatic Lee than abscess did the capital

2280
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:41,760
Even use the word storm

2281
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:42,784
Hermes we cover

2282
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:49,440
It's points like this that really highlight how the whole thing with Rahab CinemaSins to your argument being put forth by green and her ilk

2283
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:53,024
He's an active trying to create a scapegoat to obscure the larger picture of how the

2284
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,840
The information space that she's a major participant in

2285
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:58,144
Led directly to what happened on the six

2286
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:00,960
And if we ever grappled with that realistically

2287
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:05,824
She be in serious trouble

2288
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:09,152
It's imperative for green to just push whatever the current right-wing distraction

2289
01:42:09,408 --> 01:42:10,432
The Narrative is

2290
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:12,480
Yeah I mean

2291
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,504
It's just

2292
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
It's just so f****** annoying

2293
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,320
Because it's like

2294
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:18,112
You could give them re-up

2295
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,928
You can even if even if the government was like Payless

2296
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,720
We know he's not guilty

2297
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,280
But just to shut you assholes up

2298
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:29,632
We're going to charge it with the rest of you guys and then he'll get off on and not guilty charge

2299
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:35,520
They still be like oh well it's somebody else somebody else over they threw the case in order to let him off

2300
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,824
Exactly it's just there

2301
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:39,104
Problem is they did it

2302
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,408
They won't own up to it

2303
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,432
Problem

2304
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,736
Want to see this though there were some

2305
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,064
I'm concerned about some of the inmates being put in solitary confined

2306
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:51,648
But this is not a unique problem for these January 6th

2307
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,952
It's been a long-standing complaint

2308
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:56,256
The prison reform activists have been raising in regards

2309
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:57,792
City Fairfax County Jail

2310
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,840
Absolutely should be

2311
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:00,608
Respected but it

2312
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,400
It's a bit telling of these prison Dynamics

2313
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,960
Really top priority for the right-wing until there is

2314
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
Insurrectionist buddies were the one

2315
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:12,896
Ones in jail wait a second it's happening to me will now I'm mad

2316
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:16,736
They ended up creating a wing in the DC Correctional treatment

2317
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,760
Facility

2318
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,296
For January 6th us back

2319
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,832
Had apparently it's such a

2320
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,880
The f*****-up place that Thomas

2321
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:23,904
I do despise

2322
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:24,672
Charges about

2323
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:28,256
Requested that he be put in solitary confinement rather than half

2324
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,536
Exist in that environment

2325
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:31,840
What you describe is toxic and cult-like

2326
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:34,912
Didn't they already have a clan wing of the

2327
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,984
Anyway he ultimately was released to home

2328
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,008
Confinement instead of

2329
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:44,896
Solitary to get away from these weirdos

2330
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
I like them

2331
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,200
I just leave me alone

2332
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:49,504
This isn't like minimized

2333
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,552
Concerns about inhumane incarceration

2334
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:52,832
Shut off but I

2335
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,184
Continue to see this as a larger systemic problem and needs

2336
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,768
It's be dressed as opposed to Anish concerned that only applies narrowly

2337
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:04,608
Today's January 6th arrest he's like Alex and Marjorie or pretend

2338
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:08,192
Yeah it's just they're not dealing with the real issue they're only dealing with

2339
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,728
Their intersection

2340
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:15,104
It would have been so great and it would have been like a really good moment for them to reach out

2341
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,176
Across the aisle if they just said that so you know like yeah

2342
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
You're right

2343
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
Solitary

2344
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:20,992
Confinement is torture

2345
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:25,344
The left has been arguing this for a long time maybe we have some agreement

2346
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
Nah

2347
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:30,208
You just bothered our friends so we're going to overthrow the country

2348
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:31,488
I am.

2349
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,328
Maybe they should overthrow the country

2350
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,888
According to Marjorie Taylor Greene

2351
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,216
What's a Dalek because you know these these weirdos

2352
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,288
Sure

2353
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:46,592
Republicans

2354
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,408
Others of not wanting more

2355
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:52,224
Finding peace party

2356
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
Liberals

2357
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,088
Come to the new Republican

2358
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,112
Populist

2359
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
America first

2360
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:04,000
That's right well you know I think Americans really are there

2361
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:07,072
It's the people here in this town people on the hill

2362
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:10,144
And a bunch of egotistical arrogant

2363
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,936
Politicians and the

2364
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
Andy's

2365
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,544
Brandi's poles that really don't answer right

2366
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,872
They just haven't caught up with the people

2367
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:21,408
Or maybe they were never with

2368
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:23,968
The people cuz look at what has happened over these decades

2369
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,784
This is a party that produced Bush that

2370
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,088
Barack Obama

2371
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:30,624
And now here we are at 3

2372
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,416
30 trillion dollars in debt

2373
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,440
And

2374
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:37,536
It just like it's so bad it's so disgusting you can hardly wrap your head around it

2375
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:41,632
But this is where the American people have always been we've always been

2376
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
Populist we've always been nationalist

2377
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:46,752
Profoundly stupid for a number

2378
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,592
The first being that the Trump movement within the conservative world

2379
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,616
Absolutely not happy

2380
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,384
Peace movement

2381
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Beyond the fact

2382
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,480
Cathay insulate and Run cover for internal to mess

2383
01:45:56,736 --> 01:46:01,088
The terror threats like the proud boys enough Keepers they also very troubling connections to

2384
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:04,928
Even more dangerous groups within the larger International fascist landscape

2385
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,720
Leaving that aside

2386
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,512
Trump may never have to

2387
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:12,352
Declared war but his administration was insanely murderess

2388
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:17,216
8 years in office Obama oversaw 1878 drone strike

2389
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,008
Compared to 2200

2390
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:19,776
43

2391
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:21,824
In the first two years of Trumps

2392
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,872
We actually only no fur

2393
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:25,920
For sure the number the first two years because

2394
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,456
2019

2395
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,480
Executive order over

2396
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:30,528
Returning an Obama administration rules

2397
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,600
The drone strikes outside of needed to be reported in

2398
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:37,952
Only ramped up the Drone attacks severely he also made its

2399
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,744
Significantly harder to quantify

2400
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,816
Exactly how much bombing his administration was actually doing

2401
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:48,960
In addition to this Trump ramped-up bombings in areas like Afghanistan and Yemen and Somalia something

2402
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:50,752
Experts attribute to his quote

2403
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,800
Loosening of the Rules of Engagement

2404
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:58,944
2017 Newsweek was reporting the trumpet already killed more civilians in his fight against Isis

2405
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,224
Then Obama hadn't isn't

2406
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
Entire time in office

2407
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:08,416
Just remember that time the Trump book drop to the mother of all bombs and Alex declare that he shoved Isis up his dirty ass hoe

2408
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,512
The claim that Trump and his movement is a peace movement isn't offensively

2409
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,536
And Alex knows that

2410
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,864
This is just rhetoric that has the tendency to be effective in terms of

2411
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:18,912
Gaslighting disaffected liberals

2412
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,192
Into thinking that there's something

2413
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:22,496
To be gained by aligning with the extreme right

2414
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,056
In the name of fighting against War imperialism

2415
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:27,616
Tascam matter further legitimize

2416
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,152
Extreme right figures like Alex

2417
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:32,480
And to get people to fall fall for it to whitewash

2418
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,504
His beliefs to their Auto

2419
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,856
I think it's effective 22 some folks who are paying attention

2420
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:44,000
At the Greenspoint we have not always been popular store nationalist especially not in the way that she defined

2421
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:44,768
The term

2422
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:46,816
Her understanding what those words mean

2423
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,096
And of

2424
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,656
Understanding of American History is

2425
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:53,216
Very suspect her understanding of words

2426
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:53,984
Is very

2427
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:57,824
I have not heard her say anything that wasn't

2428
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
Like

2429
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:01,408
Straight out of central

2430
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,968
Just mad libs script

2431
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,248
Things that conservatives

2432
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:11,136
They don't like she doesn't

2433
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:13,440
Just nonsense

2434
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,208
Pointless

2435
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
Vapid

2436
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:19,072
Empty bottles like repetition of

2437
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:20,096
Very

2438
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,120
Clearly

2439
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:21,888
False

2440
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:22,656
And

2441
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:24,192
Outrageous

2442
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,728
Right-wing talk

2443
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
Extreme right Alex Jones You Talk

2444
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:30,336
Yep so Alex

2445
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:33,152
Troll the little bit with like you should be the speaker

2446
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:35,968
But I think he really wants to make sure the people take the bait

2447
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:38,016
It's going to hit a couple

2448
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,552
Swings for the fences

2449
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
The threat

2450
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:46,976
Marjorie Taylor Greene MTG a president one day

2451
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:52,096
President

2452
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,680
You're one of the few people

2453
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,616
Green DeSantis

2454
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:11,808
I don't know what's going to happen

2455
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:16,928
But in the future world will definitely see what happens I'll see what the people think about something like

2456
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:19,744
So this is obvious

2457
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,072
Pretty clearly

2458
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,096
You can tell

2459
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:26,656
I think what's really more interesting about that clip is that

2460
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
Like even in this

2461
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,216
Clearly

2462
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,264
False conversation they're having

2463
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:34,848
Marjorie Taylor Greene needs to reinforce her loyalty

2464
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:37,664
Yeah Saturday

2465
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,688
What if he's listening

2466
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,736
What if he's listening Daddy

2467
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:43,808
Sauron

2468
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:50,208
Is his eye is always watching that's the problem with creating a fictional figurehead for

2469
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:54,048
For your b******* movement you don't realize that the actual figurehead

2470
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,096
Does not care at all

2471
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,656
You could say that Trump shelves

2472
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:01,984
Isis upper 30s

2473
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:06,848
Less of fear of trump himself listening and more getting backlash from listeners

2474
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,128
Who

2475
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,152
Swear fealty

2476
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:12,480
I don't know if she should keep up though

2477
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,504
But that vaccine thing

2478
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,296
I'm so people aren't so hot on it anymore

2479
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,392
Change in 6 months

2480
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:22,464
Craigslist musicians like this is obviously like

2481
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,232
Just trying to

2482
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,000
The fish forehead

2483
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,792
Skip ahead

2484
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:28,096
Now to later in the show

2485
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:28,864
This is

2486
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:30,656
Do you have a pipe quiz

2487
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:34,240
At the question I have do you think there's also an element of flattery in

2488
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,592
I know you don't think so you don't think he's trying to flatter Marjorie Taylor Greene at all

2489
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:44,224
Alex's the victim of flattery not the purveyor of it

2490
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,784
I think he wants her back on the show

2491
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:53,184
Probably understand

2492
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:53,952
That's a good point

2493
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,000
I would think you would think I think

2494
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
Mostly just

2495
01:50:58,048 --> 01:50:58,816
Kind of a

2496
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,840
Attention thing

2497
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:06,496
It's always nice when a plan comes together

2498
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:15,456
Amazon few hours ago

2499
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:22,112
Believe that

2500
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,392
Reality

2501
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,696
But as they are now

2502
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,464
Discovery

2503
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:31,584
Are you or murder of our innocent children

2504
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,376
Will be repaid

2505
01:51:33,632 --> 01:51:34,144
1 trillion

2506
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,216
You will be

2507
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,312
For all of eternity

2508
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:43,360
Own energy

2509
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:48,992
Yorkshire

2510
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,744
Defender fauci been

2511
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
Joseph

2512
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,128
Weather tomorrow

2513
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:17,920
But it's always good

2514
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:25,344
Let's go ahead and do your phone calls tomorrow it's pretty

2515
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:28,928
No I mean it's very I was reading a headline that was that

2516
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:30,464
Came out immediately after

2517
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,048
Really that simple

2518
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,072
It was that easy

2519
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:38,400
Like the

2520
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,680
Attempt

2521
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:41,472
Getting attention

2522
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,496
Pays off

2523
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,776
In the same episode

2524
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,872
Kalisto cycle

2525
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:53,760
We we what are you guys do what do they do I do I don't also think that Alex

2526
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
Was like

2527
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,600
We are sitting at a whiteboard

2528
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:59,904
Bob with a explicit plot

2529
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:02,208
I just think that he has

2530
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:06,304
An innate awareness of like ways that he can

2531
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:08,608
Trick people into

2532
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:11,680
Honestly I don't know what you would do otherwise

2533
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
Guys like the idea that

2534
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,496
Babysitting congressperson

2535
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:16,544
Is on Infowars and it's

2536
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,592
Maybe one of the nuttiest

2537
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,128
People in Congress

2538
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,432
Like it is something there

2539
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,968
You can't really ignore

2540
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:25,248
Yeah it's relevant

2541
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,016
It is

2542
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:27,040
Samsung

2543
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:30,880
I understand why people would have lines about it

2544
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:33,696
And it's not really falling into Alex's trap

2545
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,720
If you

2546
01:53:35,232 --> 01:53:36,000
Correct

2547
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
Actually

2548
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,096
I don't fully understand correctly would be

2549
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,376
I guess

2550
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,144
Like

2551
01:53:45,728 --> 01:53:50,080
Dumbest radio host and dumbest Congressman get together to say dumb s***

2552
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:51,872
I also like

2553
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:55,712
I think that possibly a better angle on it then like

2554
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:58,272
They talk about fauci or like

2555
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:01,600
It's she's Alex's you should run for president or whatever

2556
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:04,160
Because I was with a lot of stuff is going around on Twitter

2557
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,184
I had to do with

2558
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:06,464
Baby

2559
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:11,584
Stronger approach to it would have very little to do with the focus being on Alex

2560
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,864
It being on

2561
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,144
Marjorie Taylor Greene

2562
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,448
And that she appeared on a show

2563
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,496
The 10 minutes before she was on

2564
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:22,080
Was the screaming disgusting nonsense about pedophilia

2565
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,360
I think that I like

2566
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:25,408
Forcing her into that box

2567
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,432
Facts of like

2568
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,456
You

2569
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,736
O-net PL

2570
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,296
Cuz there's no consequences

2571
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:34,624
Publicity

2572
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,952
Where is negative publicity right around the times of

2573
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:39,232
Primary

2574
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,000
Preseason

2575
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:42,560
Could be something that might be motivating

2576
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:44,608
For Marjorie Taylor Greene special

2577
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,400
She doesn't have her Twitter account anymore

2578
01:54:46,656 --> 01:54:48,448
Yeah I mean it's it just it

2579
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,728
Suck so hard

2580
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,496
Because

2581
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:51,264
The

2582
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,800
They could do a better job

2583
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:56,128
They could absolutely do a better job of not falling

2584
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,152
Into this kind of

2585
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:57,920
Shity trap

2586
01:54:58,176 --> 01:54:58,944
But

2587
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:04,320
The reason that they fall into that trap is because it's also good for them they get more clicks

2588
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,600
From their b*******

2589
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,416
System that both

2590
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:10,208
Profit off of witches

2591
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
Is the problem

2592
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:13,024
But I think there's an element of that you know

2593
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:15,072
I like I think that often times

2594
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,120
Much like I feel about the Reuters article

2595
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:18,656
Like I think a lot of times

2596
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,704
Stuff just isn't even worth it

2597
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,472
You shouldn't even

2598
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,264
Why cover it not yet

2599
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:26,080
Yep

2600
01:55:27,616 --> 01:55:28,896
Kind of irrelevant

2601
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:31,712
Albatross owner

2602
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:34,016
It should be hanging from her neck

2603
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,064
Like a sad sad thing

2604
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:40,928
But it's it's it's it's something that these other outlets whether or not their click Drive-In

2605
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,208
Can't really not

2606
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,488
Say something

2607
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,256
That's true

2608
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:46,816
So we have one last clip here of green

2609
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:49,632
This is bad on her front

2610
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,168
But it's also really interesting

2611
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:52,448
What it says about Alex

2612
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:56,544
Can you speak to the great reset and your views on this and you agree with me that

2613
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,360
To expose the Real Enemy

2614
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:04,224
Call Schwab

2615
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:05,248
And the Bilderberg Group

2616
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,296
Publix

2617
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:12,160
Absolutely think they're the enemy you know what you know what makes

2618
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,952
You and me

2619
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:16,512
Is when we don't take people at their word

2620
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:22,400
I don't really care about any of this conversation is the person in the house who believes that the

2621
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:24,704
The same complete nonsense that Alex does

2622
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,520
The point of view and Klaus Schwab is this Generations

2623
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,544
The equivalent of Hitler

2624
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:31,872
It's entirely unacceptable to public service is eroded

2625
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:32,640
This boy

2626
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:33,408
However

2627
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:34,432
I think the more important

2628
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:36,480
7.4 Mi is that Alex is lying

2629
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,504
Marjorie here

2630
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:41,088
I wasn't the countless hours of our two shown I can tell you one thing with certain

2631
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:45,184
Alex doesn't believe that Hitler was the bad guy in World War II

2632
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:46,720
Did Bad Thing

2633
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,768
But he was being controlled by the globalist

2634
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:49,792
Behind the scenes

2635
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:55,424
Hitler was set up another real globalist or financing all sides of the war

2636
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,472
Alex believes that when it's

2637
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,240
Convenient

2638
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,824
He says that Hitler was the bad guy

2639
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,872
And you can see how in this conversation

2640
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:06,944
Is consistently expressed belief that Hitler was set up run

2641
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,736
That's very counter

2642
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:11,296
I'm trying to Brand class Schwab is the new hit

2643
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:13,600
And it's a it's a belief of

2644
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,368
Search

2645
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,160
Childish

2646
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:19,488
Contrarian bulshit that you could

2647
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:22,304
Compared to a Libertarian argument about the age of consent

2648
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,328
Oh boy

2649
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:28,192
22 and

2650
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:31,776
He's very well-established belief that Hitler was set up

2651
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:32,800
Isn't going to play

2652
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,824
There

2653
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:35,360
Also good luck getting a

2654
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:38,688
Sitting representative to agree with you on a recorded radio show

2655
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:40,992
And we've all been given Hitler a raw deal

2656
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:43,808
Hey what are you going to do when Alex is

2657
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:50,208
Running solo or trying to blow Eddie Bravo's mind but the midterm primary election coming up with nobody

2658
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:50,976
Dipping tobacco

2659
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:52,768
How does opinions

2660
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:53,792
These are inconsistent

2661
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:56,096
And they vary depending on his mood

2662
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:59,680
It's more troubling that is factual claims and understanding of history is

2663
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,704
Is just as malleable

2664
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,008
What is listeners

2665
01:58:03,264 --> 01:58:04,288
Brush grapple with foot

2666
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,312
Instead they just ignore it

2667
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,336
I mean yeah yeah

2668
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,384
It is if

2669
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:13,248
Marjorie Taylor Greene did become president you half expect her to try and bomb

2670
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:19,904
Fictional place

2671
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:26,304
I'm sick of both Chutes and Ladders we have good intelligence that Lord licorice is testing the borders

2672
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:30,400
We can't I can't have this incursion

2673
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,680
Into

2674
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:32,960
Whatever though

2675
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:34,496
Where the

2676
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:37,312
Peanut brittle Lake

2677
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:42,944
It got hired the brothers from Double Dragon to take down

2678
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
Just f******

2679
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:44,736
Bulshit

2680
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:48,832
So within the third hour or so the first hour was largely that disgusting

2681
01:58:49,088 --> 01:58:50,880
Display about the

2682
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:51,904
Professor from

2683
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:58,048
SUNY and then largely

2684
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
Marjorie Taylor

2685
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,888
Do you do the third hour

2686
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:02,656
Edgewild

2687
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:08,032
Make this comment I've been looking over the Calypso's whereas we're recording this

2688
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:10,336
Decided that I'm even not going to play

2689
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,104
Some of the clip

2690
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:18,528
Given a warning about the beginning going through this I realize that they're not as Jermaine as I thought they

2691
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,088
A would-be even might be a bit

2692
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:25,184
But I want to stress the point

2693
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,976
That the actual episode

2694
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:30,560
Is one of the more unacceptable things that I've ever listened to

2695
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:32,352
In my time doing Alex yeah

2696
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,120
Copper Ridge

2697
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:35,424
Incessant

2698
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,520
Multiple times where I was listen to episode

2699
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:42,080
And I audibly reacted to him

2700
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:45,408
Like go fuc yourself

2701
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:47,712
It was it was very difficult to list

2702
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:50,528
We were talking about it it's just like

2703
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,368
We can portray him as the idiotic

2704
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:56,672
Goofball monster as much as we want but it's

2705
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,952
Important to remind people

2706
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,232
He's a true

2707
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:00,256
Monstercat

2708
02:00:00,512 --> 02:00:01,536
M22 the

2709
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:05,632
Except that it was relevant in terms of covering this story recognizing

2710
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,400
Fat Joe Rogan

2711
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:11,520
When is feeding him recognizing

2712
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:12,288
Fuses

2713
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:17,664
The enthusiasm and energy that he builds around these stories not to cover the actual stories

2714
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,200
But to subvert

2715
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:20,480
Is that energy toward

2716
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,760
Marketing

2717
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,808
And towards his bigoted narratives

2718
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:26,880
I think that there is a value in playing some of that

2719
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:29,696
This is

2720
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,720
This isn't

2721
02:00:30,976 --> 02:00:37,120
There's nothing that's added by it it would just be like hey look how f*****-up Alex Shelley

2722
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:40,448
That you can go listen to it yourself

2723
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:43,008
It's not necessarily relevant

2724
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,312
Not in the third hour Alex

2725
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:48,128
I was going to go to calls

2726
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:49,152
And then instead

2727
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,272
Soros is the Antichrist

2728
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:58,112
Revelation open earlier books is always foreshadows that

2729
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,928
Thousand-year-old

2730
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:07,840
People will marble and look at him

2731
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:11,168
Hologram in the pit in his cell

2732
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,728
In that black hole

2733
02:01:14,496 --> 02:01:15,776
And say that's the creature

2734
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,312
The funniest reaction

2735
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:18,336
It's a short for

2736
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:19,872
Michael wanger

2737
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:20,640
Battling

2738
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:23,456
George Soros

2739
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:25,760
Paylocity

2740
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:27,808
He's a horrible person

2741
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:32,672
That's the thing that did all this to us

2742
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:33,952
See everything

2743
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,744
Foreshadowing

2744
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:36,512
The final event

2745
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:39,840
Is there any devil

2746
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
What

2747
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:42,656
One final personification of it

2748
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:43,680
But it's one spirit

2749
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:47,264
It is that's the thing within this to us

2750
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,360
Yeah this is this is

2751
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:52,640
Dumb

2752
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:54,176
He's going to get the calls

2753
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:55,456
I would

2754
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
So I guess

2755
02:01:57,248 --> 02:02:01,344
I mean guys are going to go to college for a while

2756
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,136
That's why it's fine for us to

2757
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,160
Continue saying that

2758
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,696
That guy's the Antichrist

2759
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:08,768
Cuz there's like a million

2760
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:11,328
And I'll tell you right now the Book of Revelation

2761
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:14,656
Sounds like everybody's the f****** Antichrist man

2762
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:15,936
Use with this person

2763
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:22,336
Another person

2764
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,896
Book of exploitation is what it's called

2765
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:27,968
A little bit

2766
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:39,744
Here we are here we are

2767
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,816
Maternity

2768
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:44,096
Okay

2769
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:47,936
And then you realize there is no Edge maternity already Uncharted

2770
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,216
What

2771
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:51,008
You already are totally complete

2772
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,312
Just have to reach out

2773
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:57,408
I need

2774
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:58,688
I have been

2775
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
Tasted

2776
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
Completion

2777
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,624
Beyond fullness

2778
02:03:07,136 --> 02:03:07,904
Beyond ecstasy

2779
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:09,184
Beyond timeless

2780
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,976
Absolute

2781
02:03:11,744 --> 02:03:13,024
Total completion

2782
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,352
Beyond the Stevens Inn

2783
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:21,216
I want you have

2784
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,496
Trapped into that

2785
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,520
Eternity

2786
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
Fraternities

2787
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:34,528
You will then finally transcend what's happened on the

2788
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:35,296
Planet

2789
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:37,856
I think Alex might have gotten high

2790
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:44,256
I'm going to listen to that s*** was on Alex

2791
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:47,072
That's fine

2792
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:50,656
Congratulation musee was doing the evil maniacal laugh

2793
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:57,056
To the beginning of the fourth hour for that

2794
02:03:57,568 --> 02:04:02,944
What about later

2795
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,272
These esoteric

2796
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:07,296
Maternity

2797
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,576
Then you've really broken

2798
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:11,904
There is obviously

2799
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,672
At home chain

2800
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:16,256
The Tempest here but also there's something

2801
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:17,792
Visceral

2802
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:19,328
That feels different

2803
02:04:20,096 --> 02:04:23,680
Like I needed it does feel almost poisoned post-coital

2804
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:27,776
There's also a silent almost

2805
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:31,872
That's behind I don't know how to describe it

2806
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:32,896
Are of like

2807
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:36,224
Manet The Silence

2808
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,248
Alex

2809
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:40,320
Behind him somehow

2810
02:04:40,832 --> 02:04:42,624
Here we are

2811
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:45,440
It Feels Like Everything has stopped

2812
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:46,720
It does

2813
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:51,584
It does have that moment of like a record scratch voice over all the sudden

2814
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,120
How did we get here later

2815
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,656
Gentlemen first

2816
02:04:54,912 --> 02:05:01,056
We're going to have to cut to three weeks earlier about a bunch of bulshit for an hour interview

2817
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:03,104
For an hour and now I'm going to f******

2818
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,176
Tell you about eternity and how I've tasted

2819
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:10,784
Uber like the end of the Mister Rogers show except for you know with Alex

2820
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:12,832
This neighborhood

2821
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:14,112
Alex

2822
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,648
Have some bad news

2823
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:19,744
For the Hindus out but I don't have a lot of Neighbors in this neighborhood I'll tell you that I do

2824
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,024
This clip is weird

2825
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,560
This is going to be

2826
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:24,352
Pretty good no no

2827
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:27,168
But unlike what some of the Hindus and others teach

2828
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:30,240
They say well you know what the process is

2829
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:35,360
People are dumb and they're losing their souls destroyed

2830
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:38,176
That's a process I am an owner of holy book

2831
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,736
So don't feel bad

2832
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:43,552
Just be glad you're awake

2833
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,368
Deception

2834
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:47,648
Am I picking

2835
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:48,416
Fights with

2836
02:05:48,672 --> 02:05:49,696
Windows and people like

2837
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,464
I just read

2838
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,232
What they saying

2839
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,256
Pikachu

2840
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:56,096
Jimmy the Bhagavad Gita

2841
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
But you're not reincarnated

2842
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,424
From the same thing

2843
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,240
You're already turn

2844
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,520
What

2845
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:05,568
So

2846
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,360
Closet

2847
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:09,664
Ears are spirits

2848
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:12,736
Collective creation on this

2849
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:13,504
Planet

2850
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,296
Project

2851
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,112
So that we can build

2852
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:18,880
Closet

2853
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:19,904
Of ourselves

2854
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,184
Together in communion

2855
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:23,232
Just as God created us

2856
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,256
Archimedean weather

2857
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,120
Yes the genetic line of humans

2858
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,912
Is a composite of

2859
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:32,704
Multi-dimensional

2860
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,984
Energy forces

2861
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:36,032
Sing on this planet

2862
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:38,080
I'm in building an organized

2863
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,384
According to

2864
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:44,224
I defy you to explain with Alex my by any of that

2865
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:49,088
Translated into coherent understandable language

2866
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:51,392
Scattershot Awards Alex's it

2867
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:55,232
Bring some profound in the s*** together into rambling sentence

2868
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:58,048
I have to write out the last part

2869
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,608
Yeah really want to party

2870
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,656
The genetic line of humans

2871
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:05,216
Composite of our Bolt

2872
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:11,872
Dimensional energy forces hold on manifesting on this planet right they're building an organized structure according

2873
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:16,224
Slowly

2874
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:21,088
The genetic line of human DNA

2875
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:26,208
Four important in a Haji adenine guanine time I got it

2876
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:27,744
Okay

2877
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,024
Check is a

2878
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:32,096
Positive are multi-dimensional energy force

2879
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:34,912
Alright now this is where we got to stop real quick

2880
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:41,568
DNA is made up of a combination of multidimensional energy

2881
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,336
This is where we're going to have to

2882
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:44,128
What are

2883
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,664
Which which dimension

2884
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,432
Spanish

2885
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:48,480
What forces

2886
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:49,760
Energy

2887
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,296
David Arquette

2888
02:07:55,392 --> 02:08:01,536
Yeah so it's a composite of that

2889
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,816
Haha

2890
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:03,584
Note that means

2891
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,888
Are they manifesting anywhere else

2892
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:10,752
I mean it has to be manifesting in the other also

2893
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,032
In order to

2894
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,824
I am building an org

2895
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,616
Organized structure according

2896
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:17,664
To our time-space vision

2897
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:18,432
You got

2898
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:19,456
So

2899
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:23,296
If I'm going to understand this here's what I'm trying to put together

2900
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:25,344
Here's what I'm trying to put together here

2901
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:27,392
What he is saying

2902
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:28,416
Is that

2903
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:30,208
Who We Are

2904
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
Actually

2905
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:35,840
A breakover energy from

2906
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:39,424
Other dimensions that manifesting itself in this dimension

2907
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:40,448
And

2908
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:45,312
That manifestation is controlled according to our will

2909
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:47,360
Or our vision of our self

2910
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,640
That is held Within

2911
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,944
I think that's a bad is generous

2912
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:55,040
Can see what you're saying I don't think that's what he say

2913
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:56,064
Curse.

2914
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,088
I don't know

2915
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,112
I don't really

2916
02:08:58,368 --> 02:09:01,696
All I'm hearing all I'm hearing is him being like

2917
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:07,328
Okay so the Hindu say that the flash is faster than Superman put the Christian say Superman is faster than the Flash

2918
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:08,864
It's strange

2919
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:10,400
That's it

2920
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:16,800
Also I don't know about this I'm not trying to pick a fight with the Hindus let me says that their beliefs are alive

2921
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:17,568
What are we doing

2922
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:22,176
What are we doing I'm not trying to pick a fight with a hinders I'm just saying everything that they believe is b*******

2923
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,224
Sometimes you hear criticism of Jordan

2924
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,248
Peterson you know Lake

2925
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,016
Speakeasy

2926
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:29,344
Dumb person's version of what a smart person looks like

2927
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:31,648
I think it's kind of the same dynamic

2928
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:34,464
Alex is a dumb person's version of what a profound

2929
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:37,792
I think her looks like

2930
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,816
Thanks that I would say something

2931
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,096
Cul-de-sac

2932
02:09:40,352 --> 02:09:41,376
This is this is just

2933
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:43,424
Weird esoteric Bible

2934
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:45,216
This next clip

2935
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:49,824
Person says 10 $5 words and it's not a PhD thesis get the f*** out of

2936
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:53,920
Libertarian

2937
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:58,528
The next clip which is immediately after this I have not cut out

2938
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,552
This is just sort of like

2939
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,320
Rolling

2940
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,600
Pink the start

2941
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,904
To make a little bit more sense okay

2942
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,696
It's still weird

2943
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,768
Colony entity

2944
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:11,840
Is individual and is Transcendence

2945
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,400
And is a connection to our higher selves

2946
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:15,936
It itself

2947
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:19,008
Is lower creation from Who We Are

2948
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:21,568
Rediscovered books

2949
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,152
This stuff is what

2950
02:10:25,664 --> 02:10:26,688
Good idea

2951
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,712
I haven't been there

2952
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:34,368
But if you realize this it's game over them

2953
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:38,976
Sure double helix

2954
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:42,816
Because when you go

2955
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:43,840
Although

2956
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,728
Of your Kindred Spirits the energy God created of other Souls

2957
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,264
Going to be here with you

2958
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:56,896
Just like you love your children and they love you and you love your grandparents I love you and you have this feeling that

2959
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,176
There with you

2960
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,456
That's not a ghost

2961
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,784
Walking through walls

2962
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:03,808
That is

2963
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:04,576
Reflection

2964
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,624
Their genetics

2965
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:09,184
That resonates

2966
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:11,744
Going onto the airplane

2967
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:14,816
Papi

2968
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:17,888
Since with you as your Shield

2969
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:20,448
Blankets

2970
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:25,568
Your Refuge just like God gave us the planet that's a beautiful goddess

2971
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:27,616
Choking up a little bit there at the end

2972
02:11:27,872 --> 02:11:29,152
Yeah that means Hey look

2973
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:33,504
When you're when you're really grappling with Concepts this powerful

2974
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:35,552
Bacon cause you know

2975
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:38,880
Understand

2976
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:41,184
A couple times in overtime parse this

2977
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,976
Your human body is

2978
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:48,352
Is it exist in our dimension

2979
02:11:48,608 --> 02:11:49,632
Colony entity

2980
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:50,912
Which contains some kind of a

2981
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:51,936
Copy of a bunch of

2982
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:53,984
Consciousnesses of our ancestors

2983
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:54,752
The game

2984
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:56,032
Before it help us

2985
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:58,080
Difficult times ever get stressed out

2986
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:02,688
Jeff but that isn't yours higher true self something that I guess

2987
02:12:02,944 --> 02:12:04,224
You become when you die

2988
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:07,552
Point your Consciousness is copied into your offspring

2989
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:08,576
Or something

2990
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:12,416
This is fine as far as like a fun esoteric belief system for Alex

2991
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:14,464
The spout off about but honestly I'm having

2992
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,744
Really bad whiplash

2993
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:16,768
Flash from this episode

2994
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:20,352
He spent most of the time screaming absolute

2995
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:23,168
Dusting s*** that was inspired in his mind from a 1-minute

2996
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:24,960
A clip of Steven kirschner that he saw

2997
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:28,544
How many spainhour interviewed Marjorie Taylor Greene and now in the third hour he's

2998
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,592
He's ranting about Soros being the Antichrist

2999
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:32,384
And how we roll Colony beings were

3000
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,176
For transdimensional ancestors

3001
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:36,480
Want to remind us not to walk down dark alleys

3002
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:37,760
I probably say

3003
02:12:39,552 --> 02:12:43,904
Insane people have legitimately no idea about the content that actually contain

3004
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:44,672
It's bananas

3005
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:45,952
So this

3006
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:48,512
Esoteric nonsense

3007
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
Is weird

3008
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:51,328
It made me feel weird

3009
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:52,864
I thought I fell

3010
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:54,400
That like

3011
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:55,424
Scared

3012
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,216
Fuel

3013
02:12:57,472 --> 02:12:58,496
Like I feel right

3014
02:12:58,752 --> 02:12:59,776
I feel gross

3015
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:02,336
Because when I was a kid and I hate

3016
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:04,896
Doing this I hate having to do the when I was

3017
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:11,296
The kid thing cuz it's not about like a different era or anything like that it's just like when I was

3018
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:14,112
Was growing up and going to all of these different churches

3019
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,392
If

3020
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,160
Christian

3021
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:16,928
I sent

3022
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:19,232
Sibley said some s*** like that

3023
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:20,512
My entire

3024
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:22,816
Family would breakdown of like

3025
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:24,352
This is why that

3026
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:30,752
Blasphemous this is why you're not following the Bible you remember that book were supposed to give a f*** about all of that

3027
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:31,520
That you don't like

3028
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:38,176
Where in the Bible does it talk about with made-up holiday a transdimensional

3029
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:40,736
Colony do you want something else

3030
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:45,088
Just f****** this weird read from Matthew and shut the fuk up

3031
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:45,856
Yeah

3032
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,672
But ultimately I think you can tell

3033
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:49,696
For this next clip

3034
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:51,488
Alex's

3035
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:54,560
Concerns in the Physical Realm

3036
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:56,352
B supersede those

3037
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,656
Of his bizarre esoteric nonsense

3038
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:09,408
12 years old

3039
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:13,760
What is years old

3040
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,040
Because

3041
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:17,344
Free will

3042
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,112
But God

3043
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:21,440
Doesn't leave us alone

3044
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:29,888
The

3045
02:14:31,168 --> 02:14:32,192
Conscience

3046
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:33,984
To know what's right

3047
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:43,712
What God Says listen

3048
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:45,248
And not give you the sink

3049
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:47,808
I'm going to give you everything you need

3050
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:48,832
I love you

3051
02:14:51,392 --> 02:14:52,672
I created you

3052
02:14:53,952 --> 02:14:54,976
Because I care about you

3053
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:56,256
I love this

3054
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:01,632
It's not that earpiece I hate the group

3055
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:04,448
It's the clip

3056
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:08,544
He does not get back to his finishes thought because he gets distracted

3057
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,312
Oh my God

3058
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:18,016
I am trying to teach people about the secret of the universe as revealed to me by God and this earpiece

3059
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:24,416
It's just so annoying that that's what you're all going to hell now guess what I actually don't have a way to come

3060
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:30,816
Wheat this talk at your piece really sucks

3061
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:32,608

Can I can I give you a hug

3077
02:16:10,496 --> 02:16:11,520
Noah was asked

3078
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:12,544
To build an ark

3079
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:15,360
And you know the Bible scholar said it was

3080
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:16,896
55 + 70

3081
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,200
Took him to build a tar

3082
02:16:19,712 --> 02:16:20,736
And I know that in the past

3083
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:22,528
Recent past you've been talkin about

3084
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:24,832
You could just give it up and and what

3085
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:26,880
Listen

3086
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:28,416
You're building an ark man

3087
02:16:28,672 --> 02:16:29,440
Your Bill Maher

3088
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:30,464
Keep it up

3089
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:34,816
I will brother

3090
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,096
I just get angry and

3091
02:16:36,352 --> 02:16:37,120
Frustrated

3092
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:37,888
Sometimes

3093
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:40,960
Call Josh I'm not one of those biblical Scholars

3094
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:43,264
Is this guy is talking about but I don't remember the part

3095
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,288
The story where like

3096
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:50,944
Noah got in a bad mood cuz he couldn't see the new Spider-Man movie and then he launched into a childish outbursts about how everyone deserve to die

3097
02:16:51,968 --> 02:16:52,736
Talk to you peace

3098
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:54,272
Rental deserve to come on the ark

3099
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,040
Noah did

3100
02:16:55,296 --> 02:16:55,808
Edith Neighbors

3101
02:16:56,064 --> 02:16:59,136
And then like you came back a couple minutes later and apologized

3102
02:16:59,392 --> 02:17:01,952
To the crew really sorry at all these listen

3103
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:03,744
I know I kicked with unicorns off

3104
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,560
I'm really sorry about that I was in a bad mood

3105
02:17:07,072 --> 02:17:10,656
I thought we were all going to die

3106
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,192
Yeah

3107
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:13,216
6:30

3108
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:14,752
Piano

3109
02:17:15,008 --> 02:17:15,776
Characteristic difference

3110
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:17,824
Between Noah

3111
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:18,848
And

3112
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:21,920
Cycad man I can't imagine

3113
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:22,688
Having

3114
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:24,992
Never build a boat

3115
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,528
Argue with God that like

3116
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:27,552
Do you have guns

3117
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:29,088
Right right...

3118
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:31,392
Right but can you imagine calling into UVA like

3119
02:17:31,648 --> 02:17:36,256
Name name a baby and you're not going to call into the majority report be like Sam

3120
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:38,048
I just I just want you to know

3121
02:17:38,304 --> 02:17:42,400
You should keep at it bad your dad that's not how you should interact with a broadcast

3122
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:44,704
I know

3123
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:51,104
You shouldn't have drawers to your liking Noah

3124
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:51,872
You would expect

3125
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:56,224
Pick somebody who got that from a caller would make fun of them back

3126
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:57,760
Somehow like

3127
02:17:58,528 --> 02:17:59,040
Reject

3128
02:17:59,296 --> 02:18:05,440
That you're totally right there I am exactly like this hero from the Bible who saved the human race Doodle God

3129
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:06,208
Intervention

3130
02:18:06,464 --> 02:18:09,792
Yeah that's that's exactly like me

3131
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:15,936
It's really bizarre that Alex allows this kind of conversation cuz it's

3132
02:18:16,192 --> 02:18:17,472
Disgusting

3133
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:19,776
Like seamster

3134
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,824
Need this kind of support

3135
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:23,616
From the collective

3136
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:25,664
Buzzard

3137
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:28,736
Reaffirmation

3138
02:18:28,992 --> 02:18:32,832
Yeah I know you can hear me like listen brother you know I've never actually going to quit

3139
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:33,856
And I like that whole thing

3140
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:37,696
Sad

3141
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:40,000
Kind of codependent

3142
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:43,072
Yes I kind of don't feel comfortable watching it

3143
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:44,608
Cuz it's two person

3144
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:48,448
So let's let's wash our hands of that

3145
02:18:48,704 --> 02:18:49,216
And get just like

3146
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:49,984
The Funko

3147
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:54,080
Is Gene & georgetti

3148
02:18:58,432 --> 02:18:58,944
Fan

3149
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,016
Operation fishbowl

3150
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:04,832
Fishbo

3151
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,368
It's been going on since

3152
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:07,392
Days Inn

3153
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:14,816
Glass ceiling

3154
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,376
People trying to get back

3155
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:18,144
To heaven

3156
02:19:18,912 --> 02:19:20,704
They've already been cast to the Earth

3157
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:23,264
Come on this brother Alex you know that

3158
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:24,288
Oh boy

3159
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:29,152
So operation Fishbowl Buzz a series of 11 high-altitude nuclear test

3160
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:32,992
What went on in the 60s right I guess I was secretly about the globalist

3161
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:33,760
Pierce

3162
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:40,160
The Dome that's above Earth in order to get back together

3163
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:44,768
Hillary's talking about the glass ceiling that was about specifically

3164
02:19:45,024 --> 02:19:45,536
The power

3165
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:47,584
Breaking back into heaven

3166
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:54,752
The glass ceiling that is the do-over

3167
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:59,616
There were part of operation Fishbowl we're about 10 km above the surface which is

3168
02:20:00,384 --> 02:20:01,664
A bit lower than the moon

3169
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:07,040
In order for this guy like what he saying to mean anything not believe that's

3170
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:08,064
Space is real

3171
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:09,856
And honestly what he's doing

3172
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:10,624
You putting forth

3173
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,160
Some ideas that are pretty common in

3174
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:12,928
Flat Earth

3175
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:14,720
Yeah it does

3176
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:18,816
Seemed a little bit very much like a well you know what they were closed

3177
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
Like that

3178
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:21,632
That's the worry I have is him

3179
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:26,496
Not telling me this like is missing trysting but him telling me this almost as if like

3180
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:28,288
Listen if we let them go any further

3181
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:34,688
They're going to do it right they're going to break into heaven man is that what you want I understand the story of the Tower of Babel

3182
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,224
Is that

3183
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,760
That is trying to get back to that

3184
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:39,552
That was the point of that

3185
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,088
Where was a piece of that store

3186
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:44,416
Hillary's comments

3187
02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:52,096
The pieces of information he's bringing in

3188
02:20:52,352 --> 02:20:53,376
To support this promised

3189
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:54,400
AR

3190
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:55,680
Very very

3191
02:20:55,936 --> 02:20:59,008
Here's what I'm saying though it does makes a mix

3192
02:20:59,264 --> 02:20:59,776
Boursin

3193
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:02,848
If you believe that Hillary is a demon that she would

3194
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:07,968
Ticket to Heaven Tower climb

3195
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:11,040
To be fair

3196
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:12,320
Conceptually

3197
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:19,488
This caller is saying makes more sense than with Alex with absolutely no I can visualize what he's trying to vent mean

3198
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:23,328
This is bulshit is bulshit but at least I can understand his point

3199
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:25,120
It's pretty

3200
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:29,984
It's pretty conceptually clear I appreciate

3201
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:31,008
Miss Georgia

3202
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:32,288
Fallout 4

3203
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:34,336
Coming through man

3204
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:38,176
Sudan to this episode

3205
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:39,968
Galaxy shows

3206
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:43,296
I want to talk to this

3207
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:46,880
See this is a problem this guy is his race so many more questions for me

3208
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:52,000
Are you telling me that in the intervening time. Between the Tower of Babel

3209
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:57,120
They were like man the next thing we got to do is we got to find a way to invent nukes right that's our only hope

3210
02:21:57,376 --> 02:22:03,008
We're going to go from the Tower of Babel Smash. 2 1960

3211
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:07,104
We got it

3212
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:07,872
Yeah

3213
02:22:08,128 --> 02:22:10,176
Or did they try before with a mustache

3214
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:13,760
Arrow

3215
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:15,808
Is that the guy is that the original

3216
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:19,392
Yeah probably probably I think that

3217
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:22,976
The Wright brothers probably right there demons

3218
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:29,632
Probably that guy from that October Sky movie

3219
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:31,168
Definitely

3220
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:34,496
How do you think she disappeared

3221
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:36,800
Huh

3222
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:42,688
Exactly where is d.b. Cooper

3223
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:49,600
He accidentally went

3224
02:22:52,928 --> 02:22:53,952
Jazzman

3225
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:02,656
Are you going to say that this is far-fetched

3226
02:23:02,912 --> 02:23:03,936
Are you is that what you're going to tell me

3227
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:06,240
I guess

3228
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:10,336
But for the sake of fun

3229
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:13,152
I hate

3230
02:23:13,408 --> 02:23:14,432
I hate I hated this

3231
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:15,456
I think

3232
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:16,224
That there is

3233
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:17,760
Uno

3234
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:21,088
I think that Marjorie Taylor Greene

3235
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:23,136
Just general existence in Congress

3236
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:24,672
Is really upsetting

3237
02:23:25,184 --> 02:23:26,464
On a day-to-day basis it's

3238
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:27,488
Not good

3239
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:30,816
Existing in Infowars land

3240
02:23:31,328 --> 02:23:31,840
And her and Alex

3241
02:23:32,096 --> 02:23:33,888
Basically being on the same page about

3242
02:23:34,144 --> 02:23:34,656
Not so much

3243
02:23:34,912 --> 02:23:36,704
It really brings into sharp Focus

3244
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,472
Just how

3245
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:38,496
Problematic it is

3246
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:45,664
Yeah I mean the thing about that though is if you do study a lot of American History eventually you'll get to the

3247
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,968
Is the realization that any given point in time

3248
02:23:48,224 --> 02:23:50,272
Probably between 5 and 10% of all

3249
02:23:50,528 --> 02:23:51,040
Congress's have been

3250
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:54,368
You know like you just been nut bags from

3251
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:56,416
Start to finish

3252
02:23:57,952 --> 02:23:58,720
Maybe you should

3253
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:00,768
Struggle with this little bit more is that like

3254
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:04,608
Ron Paul was in Congress for like 20 years

3255
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:05,888
I think

3256
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:11,520
The difference between it is Ron Paul's oh his political beliefs were

3257
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:13,056
Just as bad

3258
02:24:13,312 --> 02:24:14,080
Anyways

3259
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:17,920
The things that he advocated for

3260
02:24:18,944 --> 02:24:19,968
I don't know if

3261
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:20,992
He felt as

3262
02:24:21,248 --> 02:24:21,760
Disconnect

3263
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:22,784
Dude from reality

3264
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,832
As there is a lot of

3265
02:24:25,088 --> 02:24:25,600
The things

3266
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:27,136
Marjorie Taylor Greene

3267
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:27,904
Espouses

3268
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,464
Like I don't think of it Ron Paul would be

3269
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:31,488
Be spreading pizzagate

3270
02:24:31,744 --> 02:24:34,048
He came up with bad solution

3271
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:35,072
To real problem

3272
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:38,144
Supposed to pass solutions to fake problems that don't exist

3273
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:42,496
Yeah yeah or misinterpretations of things perhaps right

3274
02:24:44,032 --> 02:24:46,848
Yeah I don't know I feels different

3275
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:51,200
I was just it just be nicer if she was one of The Crazy Ones or just never win

3276
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:51,968
You know like

3277
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:55,808
American history is littered with congressmen who are like this is actually dumb

3278
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,832
And just never went

3279
02:24:57,088 --> 02:25:03,232
Great you and you get paid you don't do any work just stay home Marjorie I think that the best-case scenario

3280
02:25:03,488 --> 02:25:04,512
For her probably is losing

3281
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:08,608
The 2022 race

3282
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,400
I think she could have

3283
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:11,680
A pretty decent

3284
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:14,496
Niche in that test Facebook

3285
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,776
Hidden promise she's just bad

3286
02:25:21,408 --> 02:25:22,688
So yeah this is this

3287
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:25,504
I wash my hands of this episode

3288
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:30,368
And I will be back on Monday

3289
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:31,648
Through

3290
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:32,928
Imma be working on it

3291
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:34,976
I think it's a good idea now that we've got our own Duke

3292
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,512
Here's what I suggest

3293
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:43,424
No it's a fox

3294
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:48,544
Okay

3295
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:53,408
Also on Twitter

3296
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:56,736
Until then I'm New York

3297
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:58,016
And now here comes

3298
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,040
The sex robot

3299
02:25:59,296 --> 02:26:01,344
Holding

3300
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:06,464
