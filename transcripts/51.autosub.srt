1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:09,728
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,544
We're couple dudes like to sit around

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
Drake dolls

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,872
And have a talk about Alex Jones

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,200
Twisted this

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
One that

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
Frankly either

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
Cannot be

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Play Down

10
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,368
No I mean it is

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
Blueberry and watermelon

12
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,584
That's not the

13
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,888
Is the twist taking the cap off

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
What's up

15
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
There we go we got one

00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,568
Crystal Crystal Light

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,896
This show is that I know a lot about

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
Today we're going to be going over basically the first hour

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,112
Of the Tuesday June 6th

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
Episode

21
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:04,000
This comes up this will be yesterday's show

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:08,864
But to get us going I'd like to play a out-of-context drop that's very funny

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,680
Alex Jones from 2015

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,728
I'm up here

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
Everyday

26
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,992
Commission

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,768
Pretty good in hindsight

28
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
God dammit

29
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:46,240
It has been a

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
Absolutely unending shitshow of a day even better I'd like to give a shout out

31
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,176
Later what's up Keegan

32
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,040
Thank you for joining us

33
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,344

You may do so by going to our website

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,256
It's a good one

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Jordans

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
I don't want to do the show anymore

38
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
Okay fair enough

39
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Alex Jones

40
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,008
Has been bumming me out

41
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
I am in

42
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,824
The doldrums

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,944
My enthusiasm to listen to this dumbass Manuel

44
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Is Ben Wayne

45
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
And I don't know either

46
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
I'm in I'm in a bad place

47
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
Well you you're at the what

48
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
6 full months

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:40,768
Non-Stop

50
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
The kind of psychic

51
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
It's rough

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
I think we might be done

53
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
I think this is over

54
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Really

55
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Well maybe

56
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
Just need something to rejuvenate

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
Could be something

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,152
I don't know

59
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Alright I'm back

60
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
I was actually genuinely a little bit concerned there we've had some

61
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
Spring this on me elaborate setup to play Sasha Banks theme song again

62
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
You nailed it

63
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:39,136
You are

64
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,048
Streamsong

65
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:52,192
You kidding me that's what I'm going to play right about now

66
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,312
What stocks is like Hulk Hogan had a whole album and that's not even the best song on it

67
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,152
There's a song called hulkster goes to heaven

68
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
Have you heard that song

69
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:10,112
And right there it's about that's all just little little little kid with a big Hulk Hogan

70
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,440
And it's Hulk Hogan singing about have you heard that he died

71
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
And of the two of them

72
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,280
Fill tag up when you get when the hulkster goes to heaven

73
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Wait what

74
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,631
Oh yeah

75
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,935
No

76
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
I think you got to hear it

77
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Also wanted

78
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,847
It's it's basically just Tears in Heaven

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
Oh no

80
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,455
Stratford and Jordan

81
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
Oh yeah

82
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
What are Russell is when believe

83
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,287
Google how desperately I don't want to talk about us

84
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,175
So there's a little kid

85
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Okay

86
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,271
Let's get to the actual show

87
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
The reason I don't want to talk about

88
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,647
Come to a little bit of a

89
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,071
I'm getting to the point where we can poke holes in and bring reality to

90
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:55,839
Any

91
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,631
Bulshit that he spins

92
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,423
And it doesn't matter

93
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
It doesn't matter in the air

94
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Kind of hate to quote Linkin Park

95
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:13,759
You got a terrible music in my face already

96
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
My self-care

97
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Dealing with listen

98
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
Coerced

99
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,887
Futility

100
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,447
It's delusional of me to think of it

101
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Reality would puncture

102
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,519
The bubbles

103
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,055
Of propaganda but

104
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Anyway

105
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Further I'd like

106
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
In the end

107
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Nothing

108
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
If true

109
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,111
We are all specks of dust

110
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Floating through space

111
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
There is no God and we are left

112
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
To find meaning

113
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Betwixt our own

114
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,327
Ears

115
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,215
Look up a mortal coil

116
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Wilshire

117
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,543
Will Shakespeare Shakespeare

118
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
AR on the show

119
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
We're covering this.

120
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,479
And something interesting happened on the

121
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
By the time that Alex is on air

122
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:21,855
And that is

123
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,391
The Megyn Kelly is in

124
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,487
Megyn Kelly is a at Alex Jones's po

125
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
Interview

126
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
Interview with Megyn Kelly

127
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
References

128
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,751
This is the day she has just interviewed

129
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,799
Right and apparently as I was

130
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Who is Trump

131
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
Alex Jones thinks it's great

132
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
But he's in that company

133
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
Not realizing a certain thread there is something connecting them

134
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:59,999
Some sort of line segments is a reason that Megyn Kelly's first three interviews and it might

135
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
Be a series on what went wrong with our country

136
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
Alex Jones

137
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,727
He's a big strong manly man kicked out the globalist

138
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Donald Trump

139
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,591
In charge of the New Renaissance or whatever the f****** says

140
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
So I'm the part of it realizing that note

141
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,943
Parker playing

142
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,551
You're echoing an amplify Russian propaganda enable Trump

143
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
You are

144
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
The shittiest

145
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Yet your shampoo

146
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Yeah exactly

147
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
In this episode

148
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,095
Megyn Kelly isn't there yet

149
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
But

150
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Her team is there

151
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,079
Her crew is in the Infowars to DIY

152
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:51,199
And stuff like that so they're recording him too

153
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
It really

154
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
Really proves some of the strfkr equality's and sell out dumbass qualities we just

155
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
Turn it up or turn it down his ass off

156
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:11,679
This was going to be a little bit different

157
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,471
Because I couldn't really cut clips

158
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,263
I just have a bunch of ramp

159
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
He just goes

160
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
He is the spirit is in him

161
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
Showing off

162
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Spur Megyn Kelly's crew

163
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,943
The entire time

164
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
It is f****** banana

165
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
I had to turn it off

166
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,807
A little bit

167
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
The first hour was over

168
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,391
And I'll explain why when we get the

169
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
But for now let's get going

170
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
I into this

171
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
The first clip that we have

172
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
On this year episode

173
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
Is

174
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Our first clip is a shorter clip

175
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
I just

176
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
Kick it off before we get into the massive rain

177
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,639
This one is just a bad comparison about mainstream media

178
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:58,271
Because it has nothing to do with azlam

179
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
And if you stay as long as anybody with Jihad

180
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
Obamacare is going to be free

181
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
Business

182
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
And Hillary Clinton doesn't look like a cross between a lot lizard

183
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,215
And some type of pizza

184
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,055
What's up

185
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,943
Alright alright people take the terrorism has nothing to do with his wife

186
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
So people who say

187
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
Hillary Clinton

188
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
Does not look like a mix between a lot lizard and a

189
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Overcooked nevermind

190
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Point of order

191
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
I don't know

192
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:52,031
The reason that I kept is because Alex has this fundamental misunderstanding

193
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,591
About what people are saying when they say that

194
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,359
The terrorism

195
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
Terrorism to go on aren't really about Islam

196
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
They're about

197
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,271
More political state

198
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
You like that

199
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Islam

200
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:14,559
When they say that this doesn't have to do with his life he doesn't understand

201
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
He thinks that people are saying

202
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
These are

203
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Muslim people

204
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Or something like that

205
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
I think that's what he believed but in his

206
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,079
Hey if you see your fake news

207
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,407
The same people who said you didn't build your business

208
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:35,807
Again we got over 100 second time

209
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
Free now there's discussions

210
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,671
Credits would be available tax subsidies

211
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,463
That would offset a lot of it

212
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
F****** nonce

213
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
Right

214
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,607
Does Hillary Clinton

215
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Look like a mick

216
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,959
Between a lot lizard and a

217
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Overcooked

218
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
I don't know that's the one

219
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
That's the one that confused me quite a bit

220
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:02,687
They're making that Mick

221
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
Timera if you will

222
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
I don't know what do you think

223
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
Otherwise that's

224
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
We're not going to be

225
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,791
I don't know I think

226
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:21,887
If I had to guess I would say he's started a metaphor and started a mick

227
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
Comparison

228
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,191
I meant he just lost it

229
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,383
Tricked out pizza

230
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
We hungry

231
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
Something along those lines

232
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
But

233
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,015
Who cares

234
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
That's a short clip

235
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
Now let's get into the real business

236
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:45,439
This address Nextbook starts with him explaining the Hillary is guilty

237
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
He's guilty

238
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
Guilty of overcooked

239
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
That is a crime

240
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:52,607
In many Italians

241
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
She's guilty

242
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
And

243
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
This clip

244
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,239
Transition smoothly

245
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
Into Alex Jones airing some of his grievances about Megyn Kelly

246
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,991
Guilty

247
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:17,183
Children Kelly on Fox News

248
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,519
Hillary murdering children

249
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:47,647
Conversation was

250
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:52,767
Alright I don't remember I don't remember that

251
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:24,255
Accrue

252
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,143
Whatever

253
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
What did you say about your parents

254
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,495
A producer

255
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
Really upset

256
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,847
Harborfreight.com

257
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
Mr. Castillo Ashley

258
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Gross

259
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:50,367
Add dry throat

260
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
He's really really hung up

261
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,023
Still on this thing for Megyn Kelly's show that had to do with

262
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Pizzagate

263
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,215
In fairness to him they did cut the clip of it but in fast as we have played in the past

264
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Go fuc yourself

265
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,311
Infamous 2

266
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
Megyn Kelly and her producer

267
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
We was

268
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,687
Talking about pizza

269
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,551
Hillary Clinton is personally responsible for killing and raping children

270
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
He was talking about

271
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
In the world

272
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:27,231
Not in-depth really in the basement

273
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:30,815
But they were only Guilty by omission

274
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,471
What thousands of children at the

275
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
So much worse

276
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Pretended to care about war crimes

277
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:51,807
Doesn't matter

278
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,831
Situation

279
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
Developing

280
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
Qatar right now

281
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,439
I'd like really makes me worried that

282
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
My fears about a Ron

283
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Are coming true

284
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
They think there's evidence of Russia

285
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
Lies about the relationship between out who knows

286
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
Sitting in the f****** streets right now

287
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,783
Go to work in the morning and I'm just sitting there looking

288
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
People going like

289
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,367
Do not realize the world is falling apart around

290
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
Yeah I'll have my boss come up to me and be like what's going on with this account there a little overdue I like

291
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,375
Do not understand I have to listen to Alex Jones we can fight back a little bit

292
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
So Alex Jones

293
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,799
All that all that stuff aside

294
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,335
Right you got other issues.

295
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Remind

296
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,407
Still want to talk a little bit more about Hillary Clinton

297
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
That we're going to editorialize a little bit on here

298
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,695
I was going to talk about it believe any of them

299
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
Usable in the same

300
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,047
Alex

301
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
Might have been a little bit too late there

302
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,679
Jacuzzi

303
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,263
Is this week

304
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,639
So Alex is going to talk a little bit about this article then he's going to play the audio of Hillary Clinton

305
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:23,711
What's audio the article

306
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,831
If they're really getting into the subs

307
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Extensive what she

308
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,719
She said also I'd like to apologize you may have noticed already the audio of these clips is a little bit bad

309
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,279
I cut the clips from

310
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
I don't know what happened

311
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
There's that f***** up audio.

312
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
Sorry about that

313
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,543
Talking about this

314
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,407
Wicked Witch Wizard of Oz

315
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
Disappearing into cloud

316
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,135
She's imaginary

317
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Infowars.com

318
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,815
Also just thinking like with our investigation back to 2015 when he talked about Trump's mob ties

319
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:17,215
We don't use Consortium is a word anymore really makes me remember what you said about Trump

320
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Anyway there's an article on Infowars

321
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
Joseph

322
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,991
Way to stop terrorism is to understand other cultures

323
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Yes

324
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,367
For us to reach out to the world

325
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
To understand more about

326
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,487
What is happening

327
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,071
In our own country

328
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
It's a time for steady

329
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
Determined leadership

330
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,751
Like we are sick

331
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,247
How important our alliances

332
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
You heard from Victor

333
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,599
You heard from Maya

334
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,903
You heard from a congressman

335
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
Learning experiences the cultures the religions

336
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
Islam

337
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,175
Even goes into a rant about how bad it would be if you move to Somalia

338
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
I got that part because it's

339
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
But just like

340
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Make some good points

341
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
And also talks about understanding others

342
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
Peoples cultures their religion

343
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,535
Recognizing how important are all these sorts of things

344
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,631
Those are all really good points but he just cut it off after the party

345
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,423
You know what's even crazier about that

346
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,799
The food is something that actually is very good at bringing cultures together

347
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
Not just that but

348
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
Down the block netop address

349
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
That's where he was invented

350
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,647
I know they got good baby I'm going to learn more about it

351
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
Ethiopians

352
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
Steve

353
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:17,791
Something so similar in their lives

354
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Asthma

355
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
Something that is just very basic

356
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
Create these things

357
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,215
In order to f******

358
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Feed ourselves

359
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
No good reason

360
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Regency

361
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Goddamn f****** berries on the ground

362
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
They make food the same

363
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
It with the same ritual with

364
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,039
Is something

365
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
With value

366
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,183
You are in the same way treating their culture with value

367
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Hahaha

368
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
Ethiopia bad

369
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
So there we go

370
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,567
We just did a sketch of exactly what like

371
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,103
A good point and then

372
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,919
Rank dismissal

373
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
With nothing really behind it I mean like

374
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,135
I do understand the idea of being afraid

375
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
Of

376
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Terrorism

377
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
I get it

378
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
I just don't think

379
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
Get Smart

380
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
I think it's dumb

381
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
I think it's cowardly

382
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
I think

383
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,936
When you have terrorist attack there been

384
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,216
Numerous clips

385
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
That have been flying around people

386
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
Bring like people in London

387
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
I don't

388
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,384
Karam going to keep doing this

389
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,432
Things I've been doing I don't

390
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
The response

391
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
You should have

392
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,272
Terrorists want to scare you

393
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,320
And if you are scared

394
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,112
And you turn things into a holy war

395
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
You're being an idiot you're playing into their game

396
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,768
Most likely

397
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Prime minister of

398
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
F****** Britain

399
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Today that

400
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
If

401
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,496
Human rights laws get in the way of protecting

402
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,776
People were going to get rid of those

403
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:08,640
Human rights laws like

404
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
Text Wheaton

405
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:19,648
Did not should have learned our lesson with all the subsequent things

406
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,744
Go to help

407
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,304
Fake news

408
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,936
I don't know I mean it's just a macrocosm of the idea that Rehabilitation is almost

409
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Always

410
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,776
More effective and cheaper than incarceration

411
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
Absolute people

412
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Sociopathic

413
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:45,248
Serial killer witch

414
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,016
F******

415
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
What are you going to do

416
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:51,136
Like serial rapist serial killers like all of these guys

417
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,696
Something that you can't

418
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,720
Rehabilitate

419
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
It's not that doesn't

420
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
No

421
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,680
But if you are if you are somebody who

422
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
You can invite any number of dip like

423
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
How many times has the FBI

424
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,592
Blatantly committed in

425
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,896
They wanted to get somebody

426
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,200
To do something like most terrorism

427
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:21,344
Chris on the terrorist front by creating terrorists and then getting

428
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,208
Yeah it is

429
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
Dumb islamophobic

430
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,304
But again I really want to stress

431
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,864
Performing for Megyn Kelly

432
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,144
True

433
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:34,912
Who's there

434
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,472
It's clear you want some of this to go in

435
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
The interview

436
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,824
Go to

437
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
He's hitting a lot of his base points

438
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,176
Could you think maybe this will go out on NBC

439
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,736
Right it's not going to go out

440
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,016
Alex

441
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
Alex

442
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Baby

443
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,440
No but I also think he might be trying to bait them into taking something he says out of context

444
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:04,352
I think I think there's a certain part of him that was preparing his eye

445
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,144
I'm going to take an hour on this interview

446
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
There's no way I'm coming out looking

447
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:14,336
I'm good right things intentionally over-the-top so later I can argue

448
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
Try to make me look like a lunatic

449
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:18,688
By only using these crazy things I said

450
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,736
I think that might be a game plan

451
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
In much the same way

452
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,064
We should f****** address this cuz this makes

453
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Furious

454
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,392
This is part of why I feel like all hope

455
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
Lost

456
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,952
So on our wives episode

457
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,768
We talked about Paul Joseph Watson

458
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
Announcing

459
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Kids books

460
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
Hope you guys

461
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,144
That was before he had come out

462
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
And said

463
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
Haha I tricked you I don't eat book

464
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,496
And you guys report

465
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,520
Alright well

466
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,288
Feed him

467
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
And shove paper in his mouth

468
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Here's the thing

469
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Respond

470
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
What's was

471
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
We don't care

472
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
We haven't passed feelings towards even

473
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
Wanted person

474
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,320
For his mental health issue

475
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
That was our response

476
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,672
And I don't take that back even though he was lying

477
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,464
100-percent

478
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
But here's the thing

479
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
She was

480
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,304
He said

481
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Haha

482
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
You guys reported this your fake news

483
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
The thing that's important

484
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,704
Is

485
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
They reported that

486
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,032
Because he told them

487
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Yes

488
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
You just reported it without looking into it

489
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
YouTube

490
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:29,600
And what other things can you look into the initial article about it

491
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Said

492
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,208
Infowars is known for lying to get attention

493
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:42,400
To think even in their initial articles that this might not be true cuz right around with diesel and then his

494
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
Response to them

495
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
How dare you make fun of my mental illness

496
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Took that

497
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:56,224
Pretended although I a witch is insulting to people with legitimate mental illnesses absolutely

498
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,624
Chocolate up to another score on the go f*** yourself and Paul Joseph Watson

499
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:08,768
Not six months ago Paul Joseph Watson reported an article on Infowars

500
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,560
About how they were taped

501
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Trump saying the n word

502
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,144
During The Apprentice taping

503
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
That were about to be released

504
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,472
You reported this

505
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:19,008
Based on a guy

506
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
Who made a troll Twitter account

507
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,360
Private messaging him

508
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Sleeping

509
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,688
To be someone who worked high-level and television

510
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
Took Twitter

511
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,528
Messages with nope

512
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
And reported on it

513
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
A worse version

514
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:39,232
Of what he's accusing people of doing now

515
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
Chuckanut

516
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,608
He's so f****** snarky and glib

517
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,472
And you have an echo chamber that will just be like

518
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
Yeah you got them

519
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,800
F*** it you took it to the fake news

520
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Msmu suck

521
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,664
That cycle is Unbreakable

522
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,528
It's just there's nothing we can do it's infuriating

523
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
Mind-bogglingly

524
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Stupid though

525
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
Did we lose

526
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,816
I genuinely want now

527
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,144
Russia completely stole the elect

528
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,960
At least I would feel like

529
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
Well we

530
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,080
We lost to a weird evil billionaire superville

531
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,920
Part of it part of it the instead of the dumbest people on them

532
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,944
F****** planet

533
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,808
What are the things I'm starting to realize is that one of the most important pieces I think

534
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
To Trump winning and to Alex Jones

535
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
Conversion into what he is

536
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Is the

537
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
Tuna people like Mike's

538
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
And rebel media

539
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
These prankster a****** troll alright

540
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,608
People that could they are the ones

541
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,144
Brought this influence

542
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,448
Publicity stunt

543
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,008
Trolling the media

544
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
Cernovich

545
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Dimensional

546
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
Journalism

547
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,296
Become the story I think is really

548
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
What is almost

549
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,600
Impossible to deal with

550
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Because

551
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Most humans

552
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,512
Really have the instinct to give people the benefit of the doubt

553
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,560
Assume the people aren't lying

554
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,864
And they're all like

555
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
Pools

556
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:28,032
Everything is fake news

557
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Countries

558
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
Whenever

559
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
This is the thing that I think people should

560
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:39,808
Is

561
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,112
Bannon even said it

562
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,952
The real goal is the destruction of all of our

563
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
Zip

564
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:50,560
That is what they're doing it is not

565
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
It is not like

566
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
Anything they're doing

567
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,888
Is in service

568
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
To any other ideology

569
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,264
Then burn it all down

570
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
And we're heading in

571
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
Into what needs to be the next

572
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Destruction in order to rebuild

573
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:08,224
Other than a white nationalist debate is what

574
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
F******

575
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,040
Stated objective

576
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,600
Even Trump is it like that

577
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,368
Like

578
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Takeaway

579
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,952
The we should kill terrorists

580
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
Killing

581
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Family

582
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:30,240
Because he thinks that that kind of scorched-earth b******* is the way to go

583
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
Right

584
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Right

585
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Endless

586
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
F****** Wars that

587
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Cannot

588
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Ever

589
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
Yeah

590
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
We're living in the Hatfields and The McCoys

591
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
Like that's what's going on

592
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,440
I don't I don't have anywhere left to go it's just bad it's all just so bad

593
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:53,792
Anyway let's get to the dumb islamophobic rant

594
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
President-trump

595
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Block

596
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,800
Known to be cherish their known

597
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:09,920
There's a virus

598
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,040
They are pirates those people in

599
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,576
I think the president's wrong

600
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
I think we should

601
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,440
Ashley

602
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,488
Somali pirates

603
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:30,656
Galveston Bay

604
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,936
All cultures

605
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:37,568
Take me to contacts

606
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:43,200
Baby government has done

607
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
A lot of effort

608
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Towards

609
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:46,784
Stopping the pirate

610
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:50,368
And they didn't credibly great job it is just resurgent

611
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,136
Lately

612
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:51,904
A little bit

613
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
But they did a great job knock it out

614
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,000
Someone with a crisis couple years back

615
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
Disaster

616
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,168
Popping back up a little bit but it's not nearly as bad as it was back then

617
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,216
Also Alex has this thing about

618
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,544
I think he's going to scream about it a little bit more later about how the caliphate

619
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,568
Imam

620
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
Give out Saudi Arabia and passports

621
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,688
Chair and some Yoruba Somalian passports

622
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
If it don't

623
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,528
Do passports are regulated by the federal

624
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
They have biometric passports

625
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,112
Your authenticity

626
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
Everything is on the up-and-up

627
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
Worst false credentials in America

628
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
You can get them in any

629
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
Country

630
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
If Alex has taken issue with the fact

631
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
Some people have fake passports

632
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,080
Let me bro you got a global problem to deal with their

633
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152

639
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:59,488
Apology

00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,840
There is no wedding is stupid the moms give out passports

641
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
Stupid

00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,448
Somehow every Somali person is a pirate is f******

643
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,984
Stupid but fun

644
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
Sure

645
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
Ariel weird

646
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:21,248
It would be more fun world if there was just an entire country of

647
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,016
Pirates

648
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,392
Just just as fun like random as country of like

649
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
It's like a magical fantasy world where they somehow have a government we end up living in the Assassin's Creed

650
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
Another

651
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
Sarcastic

652
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,064
Accept it

653
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Evil concert by the time they collapse

654
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:05,536
You can look at cultures that are bad and good

655
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
The Orthodox Islam that is the

656
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Exploding

657
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
Audiology

658
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,128
Is going through its Reformation

659
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:25,504
This is Islam's Reformation of robbing the Caravan

660
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
They're at Mecca

661
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,856
1500 years ago 14 years ago

662
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,648
The slave trade

663
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
Coming out of the slave trade

664
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,256
Their Corners there at the crossroads

665
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,072
A caravan

666
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,096
Road

667
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:45,216
You talk about the Silk Road

668
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:06,208
Started 14 years ago

669
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
Global cyber

670
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,752
The West

671
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
So

672
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,584
You want to start slave trade started

673
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,376
1400 years ago

674
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:49,472
I don't know how modern that is 608

675
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,664
But I pray about it pray about it

676
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:03,040
Also the Quran saying black people

677
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,576
I mean I don't know if that's

678
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:09,696
Specifically in there but I do know that it's also in the Mormon bible I know literally of his dad's in the Mormon bible

679
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
Don't throw that around Tallahassee

680
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:22,496
I'm not sure was Joseph Smith 14 years ago

681
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Thank you

00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:31,456

683
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,832
Text Molly passport

684
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
Tomorrow

685
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,392
Gameon overused

686
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,672
White people good

687
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,464
Black people bad

688
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
Stupid mud people

689
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
So

690
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,352
I mean let's also

691
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,912
The picket nice moment to Revel in the

692
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
This is the Reformation of Islam

693
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,496
That idea is

694
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Very insulting

695
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
Considering

696
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
The percentages

697
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
That that

698
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
So

699
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,944
That's so hateful in fear Bay

700
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Do you not like

701
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
Considering

702
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
Number of people who are they

703
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
Extremist

704
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
Within the Muslim

705
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Population

706
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:14,464
Probably I would say smaller

707
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Then

708
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,280
Anti-abortion activists in the Christian

709
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,584
Community the ratio of

710
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,608
Violent Christian

711
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,632
Is bar higher than

712
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,008
Isaac the baby the violent Muslim terrorists have more theater

713
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
Fertility though

714
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,568
Are you there may be better at

715
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Better it's scaring

716
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,480
People

717
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
Christian beat up a gay guy

718
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
Doesn't really

719
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,880
Granted it's not a beheading

720
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,440
It's up

721
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
It's not bigotry it's religious

722
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Freedom Dan

723
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,584
The thing that blew me away is when he's like

724
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:56,960
They're a bad culture

725
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
About

726
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Your friends are nothing

727
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,664
They're f****** nothing

728
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
Fully accepted all of evil

729
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Diesel

730
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,392
1

731
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
Step away from heaven

732
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Dispensary

733
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
Disclose

734
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:20,768
Staind

735
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,632
Saying to some extent but he's doing a really bad job of it

736
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
The idea of like

737
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,960
Cultural absolutism

738
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,008
I'm in some cultures are good summer

739
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,824
Is really just your way of saying better

740
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,360
But at the same time

741
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Like

742
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,688
Nazi culture is bad or the

743
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,712
The Nazi government

744
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,296
Like it's really a culture

745
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Is a government that

746
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Took power in

747
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,392
Existed for

748
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
10 years

749
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,256
15 years

750
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:56,352
From the beginning of its roots in the National Socialist Party

751
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,144
To the end of World War II

752
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,424
With not a long time

753
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Yasmin

754
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:04,288
Something like 1932

755
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,336
Had an exploit

756
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,896
Government that took hold

757
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,456
Culture

758
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
Right leg that's what happened

759
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Not a culture

760
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:16,832
That is

761
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:23,488
People doing that to other people of course in the Aztec culture is being so f****** reductive with it being like

762
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,536
They sacrifice then cut out people's hearts

763
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,376
Awesome pyramids

764
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,680
Had a very interesting culture

765
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,472
And they created

766
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,032
Dial do know that I was the most-watched

767
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
Mobile

768
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
31

769
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,456
I know he's be-bopping he's getting around here

770
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
But it's just

771
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:50,624
If you want to use those arguments to prop up your outright hatred and fear of Islam

772
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Boring

773
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:58,048
I can't imagine him having a conversation with anyone who's not an idiot

774
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
Doesn't already

775
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
And him being able to pull that

776
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
Lucky

777
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Cuz there's no way to win that are

778
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Idiot it is such

779
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,640
Stonewall

780
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:13,920
It sucks don't look like

781
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:18,016
Culture like

782
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
Like there's so much there

783
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
To learn about

784
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Where did

785
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,112
Culture comfy

786
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Why did it

787
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Games

788
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
The power that it did

789
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,376
Apply later on in life support Trump

790
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
Don't f******

791
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,704
Lickety split

792
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,288
F****** b*******

793
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
I'm just talkin about human society

794
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:44,128
Like it is

795
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,456
Immediately following the Treaty of Versailles

796
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,784
S*** all over the German

797
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,576
For good reason

798
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,184
F****** started a massive global war that murdered

799
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,232
Millions upon millions of people

800
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,536
But do you know who started that war

801
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,120
It wasn't the f****** people who lived in Hut

802
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,776
I'm filled with dumb f*** rich people want to get

803
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,800
Dumbfuckery

804
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
The Treaty of Versailles

805
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
Didn't really punish those dumb f*** Rich be

806
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,248
F***** over all of the regular people

807
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,624
And the regular people when they've been so f***** over are susceptible to getting

808
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,464
F***** over by the even more authoritarian government that says

809
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,000
Who's going to protect them and

810
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,280
Store them to Greatness

811
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
Or or or

812
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,168
Authoritarian governmental entity

813
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:42,240
Isis is even sort of like

814
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
A rogue

815
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
The government

816
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,080
Like sporadically play

817
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm not even comfortable with him sayings

818
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
Islamic culture

819
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
First of all is unipolar

820
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
That's absurd

821
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
But the idea that

822
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
Stream

823
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,880
Muslim stuff is even

824
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
Culture necessarily

825
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
That's

826
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
In terms of Muslim

827
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
Just look at how it

828
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
Is moving how it's

829
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
Like

830
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,960
Believe

831
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
Either Iran or Saudi Arabia

832
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
That is

833
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Exporting

834
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:18,848
It's

835
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,640
Difference

836
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,920
Ideological beliefs

837
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Universities

838
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Classrooms

839
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:28,320
Kimberly Pratt

840
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
A much more

841
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:37,536
Moderate kind of Islam where it's kind of it's a lot more like

842
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Assistant

843
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:41,376
For Christmas and Easter Christian

844
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,936
And now they have

845
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:44,960
These difference

846
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
More

847
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
More fundamental

848
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Versions of

849
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Islam Binks

850
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
So now you have

851
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:56,223
Muslim countries indirect

852
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Conflict with

853
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Each other

854
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
In their religion

855
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
Much like you have all of these

856
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,671
Different sects of Christianity have all of these different

857
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
People that are

858
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
Constantly

859
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,767
Disagreeing with each other over

860
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
Nothing

861
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Yeah it's

862
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,607
It's just all of

863
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,935
Ignore the point

864
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
The Christianity has

865
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Similar

866
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Tendencies

867
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,615
Just skip to that's my point

868
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
It's just their people

869
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Their people

870
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
Indeed

871
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,087
How is it that we still don't get that other people are also people we do

872
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,367
Well what we should do is

873
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,391
Pizza Man

874
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
Ethiopian food

875
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,975
I know I'm not into that

876
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
I'm cool with other cultures but I do want you to leave your food

877
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
I want from there

878
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
I'm a bit squeamish

879
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
The guy who is is

880
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,311
Picture on the wall at a Thai restaurant

881
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,871
This next clip is this is

882
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Crazy

883
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,223
I think you might have to put the mic down cuz this is

884
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,247
Nuts

885
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,063
A little bit with climate change

886
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:04,831
No

887
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
But he loses the thread really hard

888
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,999
Just aren't true

889
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
This is Vista

890
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Showman

891
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
This would not be happening

892
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
Kelly's crew

893
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,887
This is great

894
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:27,871
Information Warfare perspective

895
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:32,479
Global government

896
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
It destroyed

897
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,415
This is irrevocable damage to the New World Order

898
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,231
Autocracy

899
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,631
Existed

900
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
On Facebook

901
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:10,367
Probably less dirty plants in China

902
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
You're the bad guy

903
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:47,487
Nope

904
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
Do you let in people from third world Islamic hell holes that are all killing each other

905
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,751
Truck country

906
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:37,151
The government openly certify its and say it's good how about people are being from any country

907
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:06,335
Compatible

908
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
Colt

909
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:14,015
Orthodox Lobby's form is the biggest oldest most dangerous

910
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:22,719
On the plane

911
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
Rockstar music

912
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Because we know

913
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
And the left and the glove was in the Ford Foundation is out there financing and fomenting

914
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:06,239
12

915
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
Absolute

916
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,687
Admittedly part of geography

917
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
That was the

918
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:49,503
Spirit that was Ito caturn there from the crying liberal

919
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
Performance

920
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:59,231
I think it was a little over-the-top or a drama coach

921
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:05,119
Just a little bit's a little Hammy

922
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Chilling

923
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,191
He's just missing out who

924
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,079
This is a what was the what was the one where he was

925
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:20,479
The Devil's Advocate Devil's Advocate

926
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
People who fought

927
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,159
Psoriasis shouldn't be allowed in our country I think we have

928
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Extreme

929
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
Procedures already in place with the intelligence agencies

930
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
I agree

931
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
You fought for Isis

932
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:42,495
And we breathe

933
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,543
Travel ban

934
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:50,943
Also I also I agree with him on the idea that terrorism should not be used to take away

935
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
Are Liberties and stuff like that

936
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:56,063
I grew them in principle but I still disagree with him because of how he presented

937
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,159
This beginning is so f****** stupid

938
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
Because

939
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:03,231
The Paris agreement

940
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,255
Was non-binding

941
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,607
Nobody

942
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,887
How can you have

943
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
From the USS not a thing

944
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:18,847
It's not even the UN it's all the country it's the same thing as a gender

945
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,151
The 21 being a non-binding un

946
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Suggestion

947
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:26,271
About environmentalism this is just another one

948
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
It's just

949
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,159
What what it really does when we pull out of it is a f*** you two worlds

950
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:38,559
Collaboration on a project

951
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,863
Come out almost unilaterally instead

952
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,447
No f*** you were going to do a lot of cities

953
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:50,847
And states in America have as well of course because you know how we where we live

954
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,199
Here's a couple of the most important point

955
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Alex Jones

956
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,551
He has his career built up on this

957
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,855
Really poorly

958
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:04,415
And I don't know if it's intentional or not

959
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,975
But really poorly repackaged

960
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:10,303
Write in order for him to

961
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,399
To keep supporting Trump and make it seem like things are going well with their not

962
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,703
Everything is going real bad

963
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
Can we get

964
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,007
Cops

965
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Keep his phone away and then later

966
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:29,759
I don't care I think I take the wheels are starting to fall off in the next month

967
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:34,111
Is going to be crazy

968
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,463
To keep up this charade that everything is going well he has to create benchmark

969
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,767
And they have to fit into his narrative

970
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,559
So they have to be

971
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:43,583
TPP

972
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,351
Was

973
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
Not a trade agreement

974
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
It was Global government

975
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
So because

976
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,239
Trump

977
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Is a badminton

978
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:52,543
And he got out of that

979
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,591
That has to be the victory

980
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
Destroying Global government

981
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,407
Righttime because

982
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
Trump

983
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,223
Is a f****** climate-change denier in it

984
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:02,271
Idiot doesn't understand science at all

985
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,367
He got out of the Paris agreement

986
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
Oh there were carbon taxes

987
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
This is how the globalist going to fund themselves

988
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
Trump has destroyed them

989
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
When in reality

990
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,815
None of that is true

991
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
It's either that or he

992
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,631
That is handshake

993
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
By the French

994
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
A little pissy

995
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Speculation about that

996
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:27,359
It's B. It says working it's a solid working.

997
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:32,223
Turn the middle of something interesting

998
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,783
It hadn't occurred to me in the way that

999
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
The

1000
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
He's creating

1001
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Benchmark

1002
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
Yeah that didn't the way that you put that didn't

1003
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
Click for me before but yeah

1004
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
He's creating goals

1005
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,839
That have already been met

1006
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:50,399
Yeah so that was not it was not a goal

1007
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
No get out of the

1008
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
50 PP or to leave

1009
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
The Paris Accord rated

1010
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,823
So now it becomes the goal

1011
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,151
Groundwork beforehand

1012
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
I do believe that

1013
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
Sincerely

1014
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,015
He has a rich history of that

1015
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
Is that does fit

1016
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
PVP in a lot of its

1017
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,183
It with a lot of things

1018
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,535
Forwarded principle but it is there were problematic aspect of it

1019
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,607
McDonald time to litigate that right now

1020
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,887
It's

1021
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,215
There are they are things that he would be again

1022
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
Don't get me wrong

1023
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,847
Before

1024
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
Trump ended up

1025
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
Getting out of the Paris

1026
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
Scream it by saying

1027
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,991
Carpenter

1028
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:43,391
These artificial imaginary victories over

1029
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,927
Were the imaginary

1030
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
They keep his audience

1031
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
Rodney King

1032
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
We're really making progress again

1033
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
So

1034
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
That's

1035
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:55,679
The progress

1036
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,287
Before I say I got the

1037
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,055
The victory

1038
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
Celebrate

1039
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
It didn't

1040
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
Occurred to me that

1041
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
It was actually a

1042
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,943
A measure of like

1043
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:08,223
Hey we are

1044
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Taking it down step by

1045
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Yeah

1046
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
Like this is

1047
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
This is something that is

1048
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Turning East

1049
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
Turn into a chain of

1050
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,999
And this one takes down there this part

1051
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,559
And this one takes down this part

1052
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,607
And we're chipping away at the globalist

1053
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:27,935
Well never never getting in

1054
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,495
To any of the details

1055
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,311
Cuz if you do it erodes the entire facade

1056
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,359
Like the idea that

1057
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
Carbon tax

1058
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
Hey if you if you started to try and prove that

1059
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:46,367
It would just fall apart

1060
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:47,391
Can't like

1061
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:49,439
You just stroke out

1062
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:53,279
My brain won't

1063
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Except something this

1064
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
I mean

1065
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:00,959
The things that he says whatever you talk about how great Trump is doing are those things

1066
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,239
And then

1067
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,543
Bringing back prosperity

1068
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,407
Bring up bring back small business numbers is it

1069
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,199
If you look at them they aren't actually

1070
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
Necessarily indicative

1071
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,503
Anything from

1072
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,295
Is a well Trump has

1073
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
I'm done anything other than

1074
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:23,487
He said we're going to

1075
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,279
Girl closing cuz of course they are

1076
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,631
All the jobs in

1077
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:36,031
Yeah or not it's going to happen that's an argument that a lot of people have made the

1078
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,359
That is being really not address by Alex's there

1079
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,151
By pulling out of the

1080
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,455
The climate agreement Paris agreement

1081
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,039
We are basically giving all these other countries mostly China

1082
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
Cute Head Start

1083
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,623
Terms of being able to create these

1084
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
These Innovative technology

1085
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
That will be billion dollar mark

1086
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,511
In the future and will create

1087
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:57,535
How was job

1088
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:01,119
Durian

1089
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:05,983
Do you have to speak on that language

1090
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Yeah

1091
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
I understand that

1092
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,687
Do people who distrust science

1093
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Angle on front of them

1094
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
It's so in

1095
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:18,271
Infuriate

1096
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,927
Of the fall of Nazi Germany

1097
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:29,791
Whenever we're bringing all their scientists over and Ron Brown

1098
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,559
Hey guys

1099
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:33,375
Come over here will give you Asylum

1100
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:36,447
That's how bad

1101
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,215
Guys

1102
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,239
We will print

1103
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,567
Text you is trying to lower away like the early German

1104
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,103
Defectors

1105
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,175
So the other thing which was something

1106
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:51,039
Bears mentioning as he's talking about others like

1107
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,087
Like

1108
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
Anti-white

1109
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
Ship going on on campuses

1110
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,975
God I hope there is

1111
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,047
These campuses are having a no white people day

1112
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,839
And he's really mad

1113
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,007
I looked into it a little bit it's happening at this college called Evergreen College

1114
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,031
I read something

1115
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:17,151
Do you know about this day with no white people do know about it cuz I'd like to read a paragraph

1116
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,175
About what they're doing

1117
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
I read about that

1118
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,479
And Ivy

1119
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,015
The one Professor who

1120
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:25,343
Maybe this is a bad idea

1121
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:28,415
Right well the thing is it's called the day of abs

1122
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:31,743
And your ears what they how they describe it

1123
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,535
The idea for the day of

1124
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:38,143
Came from a play of the same name by African-American playwright Douglas Turner Ward

1125
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,727
465 is a reverse Minstrel show

1126
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,263
Black actors in Whiteface

1127
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,823
The play is a social commentary on race relations

1128
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
South refusal to see African-American

1129
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
Kansas equal numbers of

1130
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,199
The community

1131
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,223
In the play

1132
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,783
Baton wakes up to find

1133
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Disappeared

1134
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Leaving those who left

1135
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,415
Reflect on the meaning of their Community without these essential members

1136
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
It was originally

1137
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,023
1970

1138
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
Remember Maxine memes

1139
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,095
Inspired by the play

1140
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
Approached administrative

1141
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,911
Administrator Stone Thomas

1142
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,471
About the idea of joining with other faculty and staff

1143
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,031
Color in Spanish

1144
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
The Grass Roots Collective Act

1145
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
Day of absence grew to become an opportunity for all students faculty and staff at Evergreen

1146
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:28,575
Savard diversity conversations about issues of differ

1147
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,367
In 1992

1148
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:33,183
Which was added in order to reunite the

1149
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
The College Community At Otter diversity and unity

1150
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,255
As a whole

1151
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,303
So that's basically

1152
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
What it is

1153
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:44,703
Do you have the sort of thought experiment the sort of experiential thought

1154
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:45,471
Experiment

1155
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,263
Where is absinthe

1156
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,031
From

1157
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
Your entire surroundings

1158
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,871
You start to remember we start to realize

1159
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,663
More of like

1160
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,711
These these other folks

1161
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:56,479
Take for granted

1162
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,271
Who just are sort of window dressing

1163
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,295
Pocket prep

1164
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:02,879
They're actually an integral part of my life and you start to appreciate them more

1165
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
It's not

1166
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
Some sort of racist gesture

1167
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,719
Literally the opposite

1168
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,023
Makes the heart grow fonder

1169
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,327
Subway and so the the guy

1170
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,863
Professor who was

1171
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
Who was against it

1172
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
I mean he has a

1173
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
The point but I don't

1174
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
What was going on

1175
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,567
He's a guy I should be

1176
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Can't discriminate based on race

1177
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
I don't I don't like

1178
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,783
Respond I'm iffy on his action

1179
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:35,391
I don't know what I feel about it because

1180
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,415
And I don't want to

1181
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:40,511
I don't know but I do know that the response to

1182
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
What happened

1183
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
After

1184
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,863
He said I'm still going to go.

1185
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,935
Odd sort of blowing the whole thing

1186
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,543
Come on man in the since the 70s

1187
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
This just a thing

1188
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:56,383
You're depriving students of

1189
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
This experience

1190
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,735
So everyone got mad about it then

1191
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,271
A bunch of racists

1192
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Started calling in

1193
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Terrorist threat

1194
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,463
Calling the police station

1195
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,791
And start executing

1196
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:20,191
The actual thing has been going on peacefully since the seventies and I'm sure a lot of people have gotten a lot of it

1197
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
And now

1198
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,263
Because of the f****** climate that we live in

1199
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:24,543
People start

1200
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,823
Think about it

1201
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,615
An idiot's guide to a conversation

1202
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
Start making fries

1203
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
You could almost say that we have enough

1204
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,967
Almost

1205
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,527
I think

1206
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,551
I think our culture might

1207
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
Bad

1208
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,111
Text Alex Jones

1209
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
No but it's

1210
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
It's what he

1211
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
Yeah like

1212
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:49,119
Like doing the show and seeing

1213
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,911
Through The Eyes of

1214
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Alex Jones

1215
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,007
Seeing all of this bigot

1216
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,543
And all of this

1217
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Just

1218
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Fair

1219
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,407
Like there's there's really no dog whistling

1220
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:06,015
Like there's really none of that like

1221
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,039
Still I think

1222
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,063
Except for

1223
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,159
How about the Jews definitely

1224
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,231
Still that but if you listen to more than one episode

1225
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:15,999
You see through it

1226
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,351
If you casually listen or you don't engage what he's actually saying

1227
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,143
It's still kind of dog whistle

1228
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,935
Taken as a

1229
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,775
It's just over bigotry

1230
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,847
There's really no way around it

1231
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:34,687
What Alex Jones talks about how people accuse them of being racist with no evidence

1232
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,759
I would really direct people to our show

1233
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:44,415
So hard to listen to

1234
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,815
A couple people who have listened to the show because of our show love you don't do it

1235
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,119
I keep telling people like leave it to the pros

1236
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,447
This is bad to listen to it very difficult

1237
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,007
You see how much I have to listen to Sasha Banks theme song

1238
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,287
Just make it through

1239
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Anyway

1240
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
That last

1241
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:03,871
For the Crazy Rap

1242
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:06,943
It was in the commercial

1243
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,223
So now

1244
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,783
We're going to listen to how he comes back from break

1245
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,599
Kind of admits that he was being a little bit manipulative

1246
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,879
Oh really

1247
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:26,911
Put out of the video

1248
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:33,823
Great audience of radio Affiliates in cnn.com

1249
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,943
This morning thought about how do I trigger a debate

1250
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:42,271
Islam

1251
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,879
Kill everyone outside of Islam that's what her constantly killing other Muslims

1252
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,975
Lesbian or whatever

1253
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,887
Lesbian you're not you're not

1254
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:01,215
Islam's running around

1255
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,751
I mean wonder why Islam

1256
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,567
Continue bars

1257
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:09,919
And the little no teenybopper Andrea Grande liberal event

1258
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,415
That was a symbol of girls

1259
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,207
Listening to another

1260
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,535
Woman posing as a teenage girl

1261
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:31,935
There we go

1262
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:36,031
They get killed

1263
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,895
Call

1264
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
Country

1265
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,647
Bill States like Somalia

1266
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,207
Wheaton

1267
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,255
The weirdo passport

1268
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,047
That are issued

1269
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
The caliphate

1270
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
Nope

1271
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,143
So

1272
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,215
Cliff got a wave

1273
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:10,079
Because he started by talking about how like what I did

1274
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,663
That's what I wanted

1275
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
I didn't want to tell you how I felt

1276
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,039
I think that this is the same as what he thinks

1277
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,903
He started at Sandy Hook

1278
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,023
Doesn't understand

1279
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
He thinks

1280
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,143
I know when

1281
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,167
He says what he wants

1282
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,703
To say you are quiet

1283
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,983
And then he says he's right

1284
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,519
I literally know what he say

1285
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:43,359
I hope they play what I just said

1286
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:48,223
BC because everyone's going to be talking about these ideas about radical Islam

1287
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
And when they cut

1288
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,743
Yeah which will be shorter and will probably take me out of context and then deliver

1289
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
All up in arms

1290
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,095
He says that Muslims are all right Mama

1291
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:04,863
The week

1292
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:11,775
Yeah exactly

1293
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,543
Has me saying

1294
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,567
Let me tell you what I do

1295
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,615
Yeah

1296
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
Yeah

1297
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,015
I feel like that's the part that they're going to throw up

1298
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
You're just overreacting this is Paul Joseph Watson

1299
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,135
Paper eating all over again

1300
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,071
I was just throwing out example

1301
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
Listeners look

1302
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:38,399
For him

1303
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
Start making these sorts of arguments in the coming days

1304
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,311
Cuz I'm sure that Megyn Kelly interview on interview her for a few days

1305
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895
Look for him to start doing the sort of b*******

1306
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,199
Cuz that's

1307
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,479
So pure

1308
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:56,063
Yeah we'll be like I said

1309
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:56,831
A huge

1310
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Seems like

1311
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
So Alex

1312
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:03,999
What's wrong with you

1313
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,303
How do you how do you think I look now

1314
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
Do you think I look good

1315
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,399
Do you think I look good

1316
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:16,799
What is my friend

1317
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:23,199
That would be my second Kelly my first words

1318
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,527
You like to make fun of my appearance

1319
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:30,623
How about you super Mayo

1320
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,159
Supermale ain't working

1321
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
Justice

1322
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
Straight 20 minutes

1323
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
Are you fat

1324
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,535
Ugly

1325
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,559
Misshapen

1326
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,143
Nightmare of a human face what happened

1327
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,447
Well you didn't just sitting in the womb

1328
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,007
It turns you into this your mama smoker

1329

Is that a new are the rug on your head when you doing

1330
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:57,247
Alex

1331
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:03,647
Alexis Jonathan I don't know why I'm here

1332

1333
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
Quick question

1334
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,887
Am I on Greensprings right now

1335
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
Can you see my nose how much

1336
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:21,823
He is way too professional to do something like that but she just

1337
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
God dammit

1338
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639

And we could give her like those clips about his mom taking her off at the knee about that

1343
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:42,303
F****** like if your mom told you that you needed

1344
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,095
When you were sick

1345
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:47,679
Your mom told you you needed to be a man so she wasn't going to love you anymore

1346
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,519
Comment

1347
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:58,175
Super Glue

1348

What do you think

1350
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
Alex Jones

1351
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,039
What made

1352
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Alex Jones

1353
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:08,415
You claim to have been beat up more than Martin Luther King

1354
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
Comet

1355
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,743
Can I get

1356
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:17,375
Independent confirmation of the number of women that you slept with before you were 16

1357
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,655
Hey

1358
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:23,775
Earlier today off the Record

1359
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,591
Are you a journalist

1360
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,895
What the f*** is wrong with you

1361
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
That would be

1362
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:32,479
Man

1363
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Man

1364
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:39,903
Megyn Kelly get her to get her it's too late

1365
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:44,255
On any and every Alex Jones interview

1366
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
Applebee's

1367
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:50,655
I need to get Louis Theroux to do a episode about Alex Jones

1368
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:54,239
Cuz he would like the movie throws maybe the only person I think

1369
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:56,287
Who could get a good interview out of our

1370
01:07:56,543 --> 01:08:00,127
Alex into thinking that he was kind of on his

1371
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,687
Corky wouldn't interview the Westboro Baptists

1372
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
Just people

1373
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:09,855
Except for the mom she's it wasn't playing ball nor Fred Phelps

1374
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,279
So this next clip Jordan

1375
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,559
Jensen

1376
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
And I believe

1377
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,887
That this rant is directed

1378
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,191
At Megyn Kelly's crew

1379
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,775
You can see him looking sort of off camera while he's delivering this

1380
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,823
So it's clear he's doing this almost

1381
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,871
Hey go f*** yourself

1382
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
It's about how the globalist want to destroy us

1383
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,759
But then kind of gets into

1384
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
Alex Jones

1385
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,575
Just doing some slow Strokes

1386
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
Autism day

1387
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,647
Just low

1388
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:47,231
Here I am baby just trying to make the head

1389
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:53,631
Really swollen

1390
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:58,751
Ridiculous

1391
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:05,151
King down ladies and gentlemen of every race color creed we do all bleed red blood and we do have one

1392
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:10,015
Sovereign Flag Republic

1393
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,575
And Donald Trump is launching

1394
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:16,415
Operation 1776

1395
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,399
15 years ago

1396
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
You got it

1397
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:36,127
Of course the president and of course Banning and of course all those people and the military and the general

1398
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
You going to give a reason why

1399
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:42,527
That's good

1400
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,087
Arbutus

1401
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:56,095
Is in reality

1402
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,959
America

1403
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:06,335
50

1404
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:18,879
And we can do anything from the Discrimination in America

1405
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:29,375
Scared the KKK

1406
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,959
Nancy Pelosi

1407
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:39,359
These are conscious evil race horrible people who hate everybody

1408
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,663
Donald Trump

1409
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,455
The people come together

1410
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,991
He is doing now

1411
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:47,551
Not in uniform

1412
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
Scored

1413
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,983
Nope

1414
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
A chad

1415
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:10,591
I represent Pittsburgh not Paris

1416
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:13,663
Images of screw jobs

1417
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:19,807
Also Pittsburgh is come out roundly against that statement also Hillary Clinton

1418
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:28,255
Shut us

1419
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,303
Was noon

1420
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,263
Passing out in the middle of a big field on the 4th of July

1421
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:45,663
We'll get back to the dragon the metaphor but I realize I remembered I remembered what I wanted to bring up with a Pittsburgh

1422
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:50,015
Thing I read a really interesting write-up about that about how is about

1423
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
Masculinity

1424
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:54,623
Support Pittsburgh not Paris

1425
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,903
Is this

1426
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
It's

1427
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,231
Coded language to people who

1428
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:02,815
The ingrained masculinity

1429
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,095
You think of these like

1430
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,375
Dude working in

1431
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
Steel mill

1432
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,263
Dudes

1433
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
Musica Paris you think of

1434
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Bay

1435
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
Kind of

1436
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:17,919
Giessen

1437
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,271
Guys in varese with a baguette over their shoulder

1438
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,855
Essentially homosexual man

1439
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
What are you

1440
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
What is a crepe

1441
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:35,839
Yeah what are you doing for stereotypes can we feel so basically when

1442
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,143
Trump

1443
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:42,751
But you could have chose any town

1444
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:46,591
To say he's supported in the reason he chose the alliteration

1445
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,615
Second

1446
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,919
But then speechwriter did that intentionally

1447
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Is a mess

1448
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,503
We're into dudes

1449
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,039
Not you dumbass

1450
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
Dishy

1451
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,087
European

1452
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,111
Fox

1453
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:01,695
Right but beyond even the European f**** that is a message to

1454
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,231
Send me men

1455
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:05,023
Here

1456
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,583
Surrender

1457
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:08,863
Right

1458
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
But that's at least funny

1459
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:16,543
So I mean that's why that really resonates

1460
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,591
I mean he's already against the Paris agree

1461
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,919
You throwing that sort of thing that he probably doesn't even

1462
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,223
Subconsciously

1463
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
We understand

1464
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
That this is

1465
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,087
Right in his toxic masculinity wheel

1466
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
Right

1467
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Also

1468
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
Once again

1469
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
The Paris Accord

1470
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:35,231
Are not just

1471
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,047
New

1472
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,583
That's not how that works

1473
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,119
He's mad

1474
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
Cuz the French president

1475
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
That is what I believe

1476
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,287
And I will die

1477
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:59,039
And just opening that popping up and Count Dracula is burning up right now

1478
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,231
We are listening to a show where you can say well

1479
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,791
Here is that b******* about the Paris Accord

1480
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:10,815
Now

1481
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,095
More about Dracula

1482
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:16,447
Metaphorical globalist Dracula but

Still

1484
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751

1485
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,543
I'm stupid I can't believe

1486
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,847

01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:41,087
Search going to important things first he dropped out of Junior College

1519
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:46,975
Well he doesn't have as much data as I do

1520
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,255
Is Berkeley

1521
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:52,095
Free market

1522
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,887
Fremont

1523
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
Nationalism

1524
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:58,239
Is the winning team

1525
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:01,567
That's what everyone has seen throughout history

1526
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:06,943
Nationalistic countries have always won in the end totally

1527
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,783
Never been destroyed from within like they

1528
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,319
Always

1529
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:18,463
Massive Global problem

1530
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,767
Country that is.

1531
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:25,375
Harm to the rest of the world

1532
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
I mean

1533
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,423
Free-market sound

1534
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
Grape

1535
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,007
Cuz it's free Marketplace

1536
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:32,543
We all love those things

1537
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,567
Flea market

1538
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:39,967
Like Alex Jones has in the past

1539
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,015
But the thing is

1540
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,319
The reality of the free market

1541
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
Uncheck

1542
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,367
Is

1543
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,951
The things that is brought into the world

1544
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:52,767
Yep child slavery essentially in the mines

1545
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
This student debt

1546
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:59,167
Crisis that were in artificial bubbles

1547
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
Great Depression

1548
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,215
All that is

1549
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,543
Direct results of free market capitalism

1550
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,591
Yeah all of it is just because

1551
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:10,431
You you need regulations on the free-market or else people are going to

1552
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
Constantly abuses

1553
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:12,991
Yeah that is

1554
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,783
Part of the game of the market

1555
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,575
It's just built into

1556
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,743
That's so he can't say

1557
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,535
What they can do they can't do

1558
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,351
I used to go to my old phone

1559
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
I used talk to him a bunch of

1560
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,167
But how when I worked at Groupon

1561
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,983
I was very guilty about how little work I was doing

1562
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,263
And I like

1563
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
I told him I need more work

1564
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:38,335
I am just

1565
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,943
I'm getting paid to do basically nothing

1566
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Hours

1567
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
I express my guilt

1568
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
And he would be like

1569
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,039
Feel bad

1570
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
It's not your job

1571
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,343
How to beat your boss

1572
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,719
Cuz it's not

1573
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,303
I'm basically a company and my boss has the governor

1574
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,607
If the government doesn't set

1575
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,423
Here are the things you can and can't do

1576
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,471
You're just an employee getting paid to do nothing

1577
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,751
Running Buck Wild

1578
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,287
I found scam

1579
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:12,639
Would you give treating my timecard like crazy

1580
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:18,783
Nice I would be I'd be writing on the clock

1581
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:21,343
4 hours Rite workout is B6

1582
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
Pre-market

1583
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
Anyway

1584
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,743
Beyond that I feel

1585
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,767
Thoughts

1586
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:29,791
That

1587
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,887
They they are a bunch

1588
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,167
Alpha psycho

1589
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,215
Two paths who think they can dominate

1590
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,031
They think they're better than us

1591
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:42,335
Blows me away

1592
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,103
Why

1593
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,127
Well

1594
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
Because

1595
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
He constantly

1596
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,967
Thinks he's better than people

1597
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
Constantly

1598
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
Intimidate

1599
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,391
Constantly expresses Psychopaths

1600
01:19:55,647 --> 01:20:00,767
How is

1601
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
Just

1602
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,839
Drawing of portrait of himself

1603
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,423
What's the same thing with like

1604
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,519
Obamacare vs Affordable Care Act

1605
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
The Affordable Care Act

1606
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,336
When you just described it as opposed

1607
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
Calling it Obamacare

1608
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,920
Right I think that if you just described

1609
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,968
The tendencies that Alex Jones have

1610
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,736
He be like

1611
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:25,856
Right you just take him out of his identity out of it

1612
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,136
That behavior is

1613
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
Indicative

1614
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:33,024
Globalist who interviewed

1615
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,584
For when we eventually interview a broke

1616
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
Homeless

1617
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:37,888
Just

1618
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,168
Decrepit Alex

1619
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,216
That will be fun

1620
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
It will be

1621
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,056
Cathartic

1622
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,616
Cuz they're fun

1623
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,896
Left

1624
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:49,920
Just

1625
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
He said

1626
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,272
And then free associated

1627
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
With

1628
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
You hate Alpha

1629
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:58,880
The psychopath

1630
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Here is something that an alpha

1631
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
Psychopath

1632
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
Would you agree

1633
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
Comet

1634
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:16,032
And how do you feel

1635
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,592
Goes to his complete lack of self-awareness

1636
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,896
He talks about how I'm real

1637
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
People listen to me

1638
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,736
Cuz this is the only show that brings you real truth

1639
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:28,320
It's so easy to pick anything that he says

1640
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:33,696
The idea of a whites-only day on campus

1641
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,744
Representing is a racist thing

1642
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
Is a complete lie

1643
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,072
That's absolutely not what's going on

1644
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:44,704
Extremism in the Islamic community is exploding

1645
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,496
Is a complete fabrication

1646
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,776
And just

1647
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Mongering

1648
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
About

1649
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,384
What is a problem but it's not the biggest problem in the world

1650
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,688
Paul Joseph Watson

1651
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,992
Razee stupid propaganda

1652
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Lydia

1653
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,600
His show is just repeating propaganda more or less

1654
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,160
And he thinks it's the truth

1655
01:22:04,416 --> 01:22:06,976
Is nice little like he's

1656
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,024
Like he's the resale

1657
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,072
Russian propaganda

1658
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,376
These a Carnival Barker in front of it

1659
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
App Store

1660
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
You get a cheaper

1661
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,216
Anyway it's

1662
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
Before or just his like

1663
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:22,080
Their technocracy is dying

1664
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,360
What do you think

1665
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Is coming

1666
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,920
So if if

1667
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
Are

1668
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:31,040
If this shadowy group of people is real

1669
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,856
Conspiring behind the scenes

1670
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
Send

1671
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
I don't know why

1672
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,952
150 years or whatever

1673
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,000
200

1674
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
You think

1675
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
41

1676
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:46,400
Hot goddamn second their plans are foiled by pulling out of a climate agreement

1677
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
Yep

1678
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,704
That's so stupid.

1679
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:52,288
Lowe's mobile

1680
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:55,104
Non-binding agreement

1681
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,640
How could they

1682
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,664
These people

1683
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,248
Secretly planning behind the scenes and poisoning the water

1684
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,040
And tricking every scientist

1685
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,112
Conspiring with the media

1686
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,136
All of this stuff

1687
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,928
They created fake vaccine

1688
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,976
Like literally everything

1689
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,768
Make false shootings happen

1690
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,328
Notre to start a race war that never happened

1691
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
All this stuff

1692
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,144
What they've been doing behind the scene

1693
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,448
I'm somehow they had one plan

1694
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,008
And it was a non-binding agreement

1695
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,312
That every other country signed onto

1696
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,360
Yeah somehow

1697
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:29,408
That's so stupid

1698
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:36,064
It's it's unbelievably stupid even if you agree with his foundational premise globalist

1699
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:40,160
Like if you are conspiracy theorist who just believes in the globalist

1700
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,952
You would have to be like

1701
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,000
Alex

1702
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,024
Bad

1703
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,632
The camp

1704
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:53,216
Possibly be that on strategic

1705
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,264
Secretly up till this point

1706
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,056
They can only create an app

1707
01:23:57,568 --> 01:23:58,592
That is as dumb as that

1708
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,384
They're not smart enough to

1709
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,408
Create a smart

1710
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,456
Okay

1711
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
The thing was Alex

1712
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,784
He can't imagine an enemy

1713
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,344
That has more intelligence

1714
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,160
So now your premise is at the globalist

1715
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
The globalist

1716
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,768
Okay because they're a figment of Alex Jones imagination

1717
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:23,168
I went reverse reverse on it I was imagining the globalist

1718
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:26,752
Alex

1719
01:24:27,264 --> 01:24:28,032
That's just

1720
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,848
As a stupid enemy for them cuz they're like

1721
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:36,736
Let's get this guy to yell about us

1722
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,088
The James Bond movie we need to write

1723
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,112
So this

1724
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
No that's that's

1725
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
Nothing because

1726
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,952
Tsv

1727
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
Just

1728
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,048
Epoxy just

1729
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:52,352
Is of human

1730
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,168
He can only a

1731
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
He can only believe

1732
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
Is it the globalist

1733
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
Yeah he's only capable

1734
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
Of thinking

1735
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:06,688
I think you might have nailed it

1736
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,480
In terms of you know

1737
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,760
War games

1738
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,528
Backwards

1739
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,064
Yeah like

1740
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,904
Reverse engineering

1741
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,232
That's why that's why I damn you have been saying things

1742
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:24,864
But I've been thinking five years ago maybe I have

1743
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,704
Great

1744
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
I applaud you this weather

1745
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,032
Who's next

1746
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
Another ramp

1747
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,616
Who Woulda thought

1748
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,896
This one

1749
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
Crazy

1750
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,736
I know I know

1751
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
This one

1752
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
He's like

1753
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:46,368
He don't even know how to describe

1754
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,416
What are you talkin about

1755
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,952
He starts by talking

1756
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,232
I think it's at the beginning

1757
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,256
About

1758
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,048
Via guy who stood up

1759
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,840
To the Muslim terrorist

1760
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
In London

1761
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,680
Like what

1762
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:00,704
And that's

1763
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
Kick them off into

1764
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Really weird trajectory

1765
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
But also its

1766
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Worth noting

1767
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,848
He's reading a Daily Mail

1768
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,384
So

1769
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,920
Grill grate

1770
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,688
Source

1771
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
Thanks burdock

1772
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,272
Good direction

1773
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,040
This

1774
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
Rap goes

1775
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:16,832
Isn't he

1776
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,648
He starts screaming and it's about him

1777
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,464
B is getting really personal

1778
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,536
And there's a moment do you see the look on his face like

1779
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:31,168
It doesn't bode well for the fact that the interview with the

1780
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:33,216
Like 2 hours at

1781
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:36,032
If you getting this worked up and like

1782
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:38,336
Really revealing stuff about himself

1783
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
Immediately realizes

1784
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,408
Is that bad

1785
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,456
Disney

1786
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:45,248
I'll let you know

1787
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Here

1788
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,552
Without me ruining it

1789
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:50,112
Reveal is

1790
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,672
Bucked up

1791
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:56,000
Intensify what all this is

1792
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,888
Liberals

1793
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,704
These are sociopath

1794
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
Email

1795
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:13,152
Who want to be in dominant position but don't want to create economies don't want responsibility don't want

1796
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,112
Also control freak women

1797
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,672
Ecology

1798
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:49,504
Four generations of formula combinations you knew would reduce IQ starting point

1799
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:15,616
Morning

1800
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:28,160
Ourselves come out of the trance I believe

1801
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:44,800
I got a bunch of Clips I want to get to break down

1802
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:49,920
Tillery.

1803
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,280
And so

1804
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:10,912
Skylanders

1805
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:24,480
100

1806
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,448
Recharging him now

1807
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,896
Bad memories

1808
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,736
Soccer team

1809
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:07,744
Just watched a bunch of people

1810
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,984
I want to buy under the overturned

1811
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,688
Make sure I have a second.

1812
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,320
Imagine

1813
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:36,672
Just got 100 people

1814
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:41,536
He's the weirdo He's the bad guy

1815
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
4 years older than me

1816
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,880
Well the people

1817
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:13,536
Juvenile

1818
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:23,776
Evil man

1819
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
He's positively

1820
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,976
Long time

1821
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,560
He does not like revealing that every

1822
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,696
Your boy about

1823
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,536
Play parts

1824
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,840
Belief

1825
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,824
Everybody

1826
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,968
I'm angry about this for it

1827
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,904
Myself

1828
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,952
Nope new

1829
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,008
Thousand years ago

1830
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,544
Here in Sun Valley

1831
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,128
In the world

1832
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:10,528
And somebody hit your wife and daughter

1833
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:13,088
You go give a speech like that to the men of the village

1834
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:25,888
That's why

1835
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,800
So you guarantees in caveman days the speeches

1836
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,824
We're just like that

1837
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,384
Dope they were jokes

1838
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,688
Everybody knows

1839
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
That wasn't a speech

1840
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
Through the valley

1841
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,064
Yeah I'm still your wife and kids

1842
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,600
Like perhaps

1843
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,880
His wife stole his

1844
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:54,560
Go back to the people who hit a guy with a brick

1845
01:33:55,584 --> 01:34:01,728
Let's be clear I'm sure he was getting picked on or I'm sure there was

1846
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:04,544
I'm willing to believe that a guy did beat him up

1847
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,848
But I'm not willing to believe

1848
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:08,896
That the threat was what he

1849
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,664
Describe

1850
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,944
You don't saying

1851
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:11,712
I

1852
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,016
Know a lot about Alex

1853
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,296
He's prone

1854
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:16,576
Beer

1855
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,624
Paranoia an exaggeration

1856
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:21,184
So I bet that some guy was sorta like

1857
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:25,280
F*** you kid something like that maybe a guy who was a little older than him

1858
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:26,816
And maybe beat them up a little bit

1859
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
Which is

1860
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,888
Police should not do that sort of thing

1861
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656
It sucks

1862
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
But

1863
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,704
I also don't think

1864
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:39,104
That whatever was happening Meredith and you can tell that long

1865
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:42,432
Walking paws

1866
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,504
That was a that was like a

1867
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,600
Oops f***** up

1868
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
Ask ask yourself

1869
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,488
Does Alex Jones

1870
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,256
Hitman with

1871
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,024
The brick one

1872
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,120
What he did

1873
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:03,680
His weapon of choice

1874
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,496
I also know that

1875
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,824
I've been around I don't use names

1876
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:14,176
But I have a couple friends who got into a little bit of a fight

1877
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,456
No

1878
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
Can I give your sources it's pretty public

1879
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,392
Got a little bit too

1880
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:29,536
Thought the threat was way worse than it was in the fight we were all just drinking having a good time in the backyard

1881
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,168
And the guy who thought it was a little more serious grab the bottle and hit the other one in the head with it

1882
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:41,312
I think please do didn't get her too bad just a little bleeding from the face of it

1883
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,640
You disproportionately responded that's what a lot of people do

1884
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,944
People who have really bad fear

1885
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
Control mechanisms

1886
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,248
People who

1887
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:52,064
I think they're victims at every point in their life

1888
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,344
They are going to

1889
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,112
Respond

1890
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:56,416
Way more aggressively than they need to

1891
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,440
And Al Jones

1892
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,488
I have to believe

1893
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,280
Literally just said that's what he did

1894
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,352
I don't believe this person was bashing his head into the

1895
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,376
Absolutely

1896
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,168
Now if you talk to my friend

1897
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
Who hit the other guy with

1898
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,776
I'm sure his version of it would be you could break my arm

1899
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,896
Because I don't think the guy

1900
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,200
Like my friend who

1901
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:24,320
Is necessarily super violent bad guy he's just not in control of his Panic back

1902
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,880
When someone

1903
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,208
Out of their own principles and acts based on

1904
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:31,744
Offer you do f***** up things

1905
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,072
Application for it you want to be like

1906
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,680
The guy was going to kill me I had to hit with a brick

1907
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
It is an interesting

1908
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:43,008
To know that

1909
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,288
We still have that

1910
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
That f******

1911
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
Olympics

1912
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:52,736
My house burned down

1913
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:54,272
Wherein we have to Denver

1914
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,832
Analyze This

1915
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
Survival

1916
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,904
Ingrained into Aspergers

1917
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,256
Millions of years will like 5 years ago my house burned down and I just ran out of the building

1918
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,328
As soon as I got out I was in

1919
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:09,376
I'm sucking huge shock I was terrified

1920
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,496
Really realize that I

1921
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:18,336
Didn't knock on anyone's door

1922
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,896
Thankfully everyone got out okay but I realized

1923
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:21,920
That's f***** up

1924
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:24,224
I didn't want anybody

1925
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:32,160
I don't want to be the hero the difference is my immediate response wasn't like

1926
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:34,720
Like to make an excuse for myself

1927
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,840
I did not respond to that well I could have taken a second and realized

1928
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,144
I'm I don't have to run out of here

1929
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,704
Minutes left where I can

1930
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,472
Fret

1931
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:47,008
Responsibly

1932
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,592
Fighter flight system went

1933
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,872
Exactly

1934
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:58,272
Find wall of flame

1935
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:03,392
Can chance you know it sucks

1936
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,928
About to make excuses for it

1937
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
It sucks that Alex

1938
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,256
Excuses weave into his bizarre

1939
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,280
Stupid

1940
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,304
Arguments

1941
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:13,376
About about masculinity

1942
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
Every time

1943
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:14,912
He reveals

1944
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,704
The slightest thing about his child

1945
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,728
Everything else

1946
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,408
God why is everybody talking to Alex about what

1947
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,944
Thanks now I want to know what

1948
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:28,992
We know what

1949
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:32,320
Well we don't know enough I want to know the whole story

1950
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,624
There needs to be a

1951
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,464
Investigative biography

1952
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:41,792
You can find the work-in-progress aetna.com

1953
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,352
So we got one more before the eclipse

1954
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:48,448
Ended up me turning off the episode

1955
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,520
He starts talking about how Hillary Clinton is a joke

1956
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,288
And then

1957
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,592
Slow Strokes

1958
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:00,224
Course

1959
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,040
Lady

1960
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,256
He's talking directly to Hillary

1961
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,816
Million-dollar

1962
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,656
Million dollars

1963
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,680
$3000000

1964
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,336
They told me the whole plant-based

1965
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:32,736
He's telling this to the Embassy camera crew

1966
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,016
You could have been working

1967
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:38,368
Sing for me for Megan Kelly this could have been me good for you

1968
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:44,768
Stafford paid $30,000 a year who doesn't give a f*** I'm sure those

1969
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,560
People are f****** holding in laugh

1970
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:50,912
Like one time me and my buddies got high and went to like a Christian haunted house

1971
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:55,264
You know they have like the plan is that the bathroom

1972
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:57,824
Any one of the rooms they had tape on the floor

1973
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,664
The scene was this guy realizing that his kids died

1974
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
In a car accident

1975
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,248
The whole story of the haunted houses to get to kid

1976
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,296
Boca

1977
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:09,856
Skip.

1978
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,672
Did scene

1979
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,720
We're like my weed high is

1980
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,024
I'm so high

1981
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,304
At the scene is

1982
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
Dad realizes both of his kids

1983
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,168
Falls to his knees

1984
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
Is likewise

1985
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:28,032
But you so close to that tape line on the ground

1986
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:29,568
He's so close to us

1987
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:32,384
The whole time I'm just grabbing my friend's shoulder

1988
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:38,272
Well I got it that's what the cameramen are doing

1989
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,184
Could have been Glen

1990
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,792
Could have been Megyn Kelly

1991
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,864
I'd said no and I went in a year and I Glenn Beck ready

1992
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:11,296
More people

1993
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,952
Selectavision the Body Snatchers you can get the transfer done on time

1994
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:20,768
Didn't didn't go the way you wanted to go

1995
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:29,984
Information on

1996
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,288
I think the fact that I'm real

1997
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:42,016
As your strengths not care what they think what they say

1998
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,672
Elementary students about

1999
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,976
Different sexes

2000
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:53,280
What is

2001
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:56,608
Government

2002
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:20,416
He says I haven't even gone through the story

2003
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,280
Course not but there aren't any stories for him

2004
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
Also government

2005
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
But

2006
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:32,704
Enjoy that narrative

2007
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:36,288
I also all that stuff about the like white genocide

2008
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,312
On campus at 12

2009
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
Equally bulshit to this

2010
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,896
A day of

2011
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
Right

2012
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,968
Evergreen

2013
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,552
I think the best way to get people on board with a white genocide

2014
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,576
I just to have them listen

2015
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,136
Sure

2016
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,416
Yeah

2017
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:53,184
No no

2018
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,232
I think we're good

2019
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,512
We had enough White

2020
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:58,560
People

2021
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,840
Is learn history

2022
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:06,240
And then what about this guy he doesn't know s***

2023
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:09,312
Minority

2024
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:13,664
Give no idea about the Matrix of Oppression he isn't no f****** idea at all

2025
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,528
You've no idea about societal power in the differences between different groups

2026
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,112
Is no f****** idea and all the information is there

2027
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
At his fingertip

2028
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,440
He could learn

2029
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:28,000
But because he's so into being white he won't

2030
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,048
That's the best argument

2031
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,608
You've got me on board

2032
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:36,192
So I am

2033
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:40,800
We've got another twenty bucks

2034
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,176
So this last

2035
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,736
Clip

2036
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,016
I was

2037
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,808
You've been having this guy on

2038
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,088
A lot lately

2039
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,136
Tommy Robinson

2040
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,440
There's a British guy who works for the rebel

2041
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
Brooks a rebel media

2042
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,512
And

2043
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,048
Gives dispatches

2044
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,072
A ton

2045
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,888
Alex Jones about how Muslims are over running

2046
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
England

2047
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,192
And what have you

2048
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:14,080
This report he was doing was about how there is

2049
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,104
Nearest school

2050
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:15,872
No

2051
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,408
And so he

2052
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Doesn't really

2053
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,016
Standing outside

2054
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:27,648
I don't know if Tara's lives down the block I have no idea I don't understand

2055
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
The situation

2056
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
Doesn't really

2057
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:29,952
He doesn't

2058
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,512
He says things but there's no evidence

2059
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:34,816
I don't I don't I don't know

2060
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
Intrude

2061
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
Infowars

2062
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:39,168
So you screaming about

2063
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,192
Screaming

2064
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,472
Much more control Denali

2065
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,264
Expect he gets into like

2066
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,544
You saying

2067
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,104
London needs to do more about Isis

2068
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:47,872
Bespoke

2069
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,152
But

2070
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,176
Folk

2071
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:53,248
The Isis people people who sympathize with ISIS

2072
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,064
That's the problem

2073
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
Just say

2074
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:57,856
The key

2075
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:58,624
He's

2076
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,744
We've already proven with Trump that if

2077
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,768
You just say it

2078
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
You're probably

2079
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Going to get more p

2080
01:45:07,328 --> 01:45:08,352
Yeah

2081
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:10,400
This is harshly dog whistling

2082
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,192
Partially

2083
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:15,264
Conflating all Muslims with

2084
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,544
People who do horrible

2085
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,384
Probably wisest

2086
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,408
Like I'm done I'm done

2087
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
Episode

2088
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:26,528
You think is a government

2089
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:42,656
Unique

2090
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:44,192
Which will fight

2091
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:59,296
Umpire absolute

2092
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:02,880
From the heart

2093
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:06,208
And that is our salvation

2094
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,488
Be honest about

2095
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,680
I meant he was he was not

2096
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,728
British person

2097
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:19,264
That was pretty much

2098
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
What's the level of Al

2099
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,384
Yeah but I mean just be the

2100
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,736
You got to get these people off our streets you're not protecting

2101
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,552
You got internet

2102
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,624
Wonderful

2103
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,416
White way of saying

2104
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,208
Put everybody who's not white

2105
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:41,536
Take all of their stuff

2106
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:42,560
And put them in

2107
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:45,632
The history of internment camps has never been

2108
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,912
People who are guilty of

2109
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,472
No

2110
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:51,520
Populations that you need to

2111
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,288
Separate

2112
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:56,128
So when you start using light once again America

2113
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,688
Whose property and everything

2114
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,224
The f****** store

2115
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
But that like

2116
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:07,392
When you start using that language especially in concert with language like you're not protecting our people are

2117
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,696
It's so light

2118
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,720
White

2119
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:13,280
Stillwhite

2120
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
White Reaper

2121
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:16,096
It's over-the-top bigotry

2122
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,888
And the fact that I was Joan

2123
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:19,168
Comes back

2124
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,704
That's Veritas

2125
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,008
That will be our salvation

2126
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:23,776
Is just

2127
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
It's too much to

2128
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,824
To take it

2129
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:26,592
To race

2130
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,896
That I can't handle it

2131
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,176
Yeah that's not dog with

2132
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,456
And it's boring

2133
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,992
It's boring races

2134
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:35,040
Mosquitoes

2135
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:37,344
Like the stuff where he's talking about

2136
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,904
Crazy globalist plots and what have you

2137
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,440
Is kind of boring cuz it's

2138
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,232
He says it all the time

2139
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,512
But this is just

2140
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:48,864
The banality of evil

2141
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,400
We need school boring

2142
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
Prison people who are

2143
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,448
That's what he

2144
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:57,056
Triangle

2145
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,592
Like that

2146
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,384
Shut the fuk

2147
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,688
Sayings that all Arabs

2148
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:04,736
About racism

2149
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,040
Somehow never

2150
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:07,808
Her f******

2151
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:09,856
It doesn't

2152
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
The Intern

2153
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
Who's next

2154
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:20,096
To be some outside

2155
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,632
There's no end to

2156
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,424
Racism

2157
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,704
Is not

2158
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,032
F****** ending erase

2159
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:33,920
Because then what you do is eventually you'll start going Inward and you'll start being like brunettes

2160
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:43,392
Because it's not about the target it's about the behavior it's about the mentality at the other ring and

2161
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:48,768
The fact that there are some Muslims who commit violent crimes

2162
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,048
It's about

2163
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,584
Beer of other

2164
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:58,496
Support before we had before white people had other races they had different

2165
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,288
Yeah

2166
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,568
You know Jews

2167
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:07,712
Look at the IRA and

2168
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:08,736
And there's no

2169
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:09,760
Believe me

2170
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,320
I'm not against

2171
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,368
Oh boy

2172
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,352
Am I

2173
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,192
You put a

2174
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,472
S*** ton of pressure on

2175
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:31,520
Just just like we're talkin

2176
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,312
Think about what

2177
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:37,152
If you put enough pressure on P

2178
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,200
People are going to break

2179
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,736
Yeah and those broke

2180
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,040
Are going to commit violence

2181
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,320
Yeah

2182
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,088
The Happening

2183
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
And this time

2184
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,392
I would

2185
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:48,160
I mean

2186
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:49,952
What is

2187
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,256
Too fast for these old f***

2188
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,024
Can white people

2189
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:54,048
They just need

2190
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:54,816
Go away

2191
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,608
They just need to be gone

2192
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:00,448
That's it that's only because

2193
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,264
There was like

2194
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,824
That's the only way to understand what their do

2195
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Because

2196
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,664
It's a different

2197
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:12,992
But it is

2198
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,016
That

2199
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,040
What they are

2200
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,576
Is going away

2201
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:17,600
Yeah

2202
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,648
Put pressure on enough

2203
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:21,440
People people

2204
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,976
That's what's going on

2205
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,256
Their issue

2206
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:27,328
Is that they can't accept a world changer

2207
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,888
That's a big problem for

2208
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,912
Humanities

2209
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:31,936
The beginning

2210
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,728
We're not.

2211
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,544
They can't they

2212
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,104
What do you what else

2213
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,408
Do you do with these people other than

2214
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,688
Put him in a f******

2215
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:47,040
Let him sell weird pills

2216
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,088
Interim

2217
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:50,368
I think it's a good idea

2218
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,648
Steal their property

2219
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:55,744
Take their second amendment rights away no more free market

2220
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,512
I'm sick

2221
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:59,328
Prosperity

2222
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,400
That's cuz you're a beta libtard

2223
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,472
The technocracy we need to commit white genocide

2224
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:06,752
We need to

2225
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:09,312
What else is he real about I don't know

2226
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,592
Except

2227
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:14,688
Walking except

2228
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,784
What's the message

2229
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:24,160
And when you say that you're not saying hey people who kill people with

2230
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:30,560
Trucks that knives are cool that's what anyone is saying when they say accept people that's not what that is at all

2231
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:34,400
People that's awful there's a reason

2232
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:35,936
We have to have laws

2233
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,728
Because

2234
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:40,032
Somehow at one point

2235
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:42,336
We're so stupid somebody had to tell us.

2236
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:43,616
Fright

2237
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,664
Like mehrabi

2238
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,944
Brunei

2239
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,480
Leave everybody with

2240
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
Hammurabi

2241
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,320
The greatest

2242
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,344
Pillar of

2243
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,392
White history

2244
01:51:55,904 --> 01:52:02,048

And they tell two friends

Now is a good time to remind everyone that Infowars anytime you want to start to think their legitimate news Outlet
