00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,168
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568
Everybody

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,640
Talk a little bit about Alex Jones

4
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:18,944
Yeah

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
Corrosive

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
Since I've been here

7
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
I don't even remember what the hell are shows about so could you refresh my memory

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:43,520
A half ago decided to learn everything there is to learn about Alex Jones

9
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
Cuz you're

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
Decided to live a normal life

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
And it did you know very little about Alex Jones or retained very little of you

12
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Defend

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
Not much about him

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,752
Especially after working all day your

15
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,592
You're going the extra mile and I really appreciate it

16
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
I think I'm on 3 hours sleep

17
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
I did not remember getting

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:43,168
And I don't remember how long it's going to be going over what is this

19
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,704
January 21st

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
2009

21
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,872
One day in most presidents

22
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
One day

23
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,248
Alright keep that in mind

24
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
If we look back on what you said in the present

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
And compare it with what he did now

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:07,232
Obviously really believe

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,120
We all got caught up in the fireworks

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
I'm assuming says

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
Here is what we hope Obama

30
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
And here is what we think

31
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,640
Obama should do to fix let's have reasonable expectation

32
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,992
Inauguration Day

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,528

54
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,264
They're being sent out

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,592

60
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024

Japan

63
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,959
It might just be my

64
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
Also I think one of them at least

65
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,335
Was probably sent overseas

66
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,151
And we don't know how to send things over

67
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
I think if you got one that I sent you from overseas

68
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855

00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,511

80
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,415

00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,695
Beer lamp

Christmas through the crowd like at 6

83
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,031
Situation but if it is

84
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,823
That might be trouble

85
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
A two-hour-long podcast about Alex Jones

86
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:41,503
Standing room only

87
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,295
Life by some chairs

88
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,975
I don't know I didn't eat a lot

89
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
Maria Bamford

90
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:03,263
Would be us sitting down talking about Alex

91
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:13,759
Yeah probably

92
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Pictures are out of context drop for

93
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,679
Cigarettes

94
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
Alex

95
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,319
Drugs they were offering me

96
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
And then later on I smoke

97
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
Did Joy and I'll tell you right now did you

98
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,375
DeRuyter for a 21 Jump Street

99
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:05,727
I want to say first of all Alex Jones seems to do every drug twice

100
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:09,567
Every single time we bring one up he's like I've done it twice

101
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
You don't know for the fur

102
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
It's true

103
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,735
Two isn't even enough

104
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,807
Pattern that called the scientific method also

105
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,855
Doing drugs

106
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Believe in science

107
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
Smoking cocaine in a joint

108
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
If you inherit like if

109
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,863
If you breathe some of the cocaine into your mouth it'll make your mouth numb

110
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,935
ADI I don't remember exactly what it is but the point at which

111
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,959
It would be combust

112
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Sabor boilable

113
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,871
You're not going to get it with a cherry on a joint doesn't do anything there's a smoking crack

114
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
The cocaine

115
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Boiling point

116
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,087
Cook Auto

117
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
This is my movie files

118
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,511
Maybe maybe they're going to like

119
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
Anyways

120
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
If the story is true

121
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,239
If it is true

122
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,263
Alex

123
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
They were f****** with you

124
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
It could be

125
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
There's no way

126
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,991
16 probably

127
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
I would assume so

128
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951
Back to the Mets in the matter at hand

129
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,535
That is Barack Obama the president

130
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Smoking Coke

131
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
For one day

132
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Here's where Alex Jones

133
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Stupid head

134
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Again

135
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Not giving him a chance

136
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Spidey

137
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Superman fighting

138
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
Familiar

139
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
FairPoint

140
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,111
Mr. Spider-Man with

141
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,183
Alright so

142
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,975
Told their under Marshal

143
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
The law based on the War Powers Act

144
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Cpu-z

145
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Lot

146
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,471
The lot

147
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
The budget is

148
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Is it

149
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,359
50 to trillion dollars

150
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,431
Billion dollars a week

151
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:57,503
Could be stolen we not also

152
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
I don't know I don't know what

153
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,599
If it's in the present or in the past

154
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,415
I can't refine the clip but he's talking about how like

155
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Globalist who are making

156
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
20 billion dollars an hour

157
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
It's a lot

158
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,863
To me I just think like I don't I don't know how that

159
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
Possible

160
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,703
Average

161
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
They work it's like stand-ups

162
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
You know you make

163
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,615
Play exactly

164
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,991
I don't know

165
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
The full 40

166
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,999
Bianca

167
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
Also the War Powers Act is

168
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,911
Colloquial name for the War Powers Resolution was passed in 90

169
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Team 73

170
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,215
Has nothing to do with telling

171
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,775
Congress that you're under martial law

172
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Which we weren't also

173
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
What

174
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
You can just tell Congress

175
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Specifically I think he's saying that Barack Obama

176
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Obviously

177
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,159
Who sang Congress that the United

178
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
States

179
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,023
Is undermined Powers Act

180
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
Was made after Vietnam

181
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,631
Because they wanted to try and clarify what the rules of

182
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,399
Congress

183
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,447
And the president are in terms of

184
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,239
Deploying people in chat like that

185
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
And I read over it most of it has to do with like

186
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,359
Just strict guidelines about if you

187
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,151
You send people you have to tell con

188
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Operating off of that and it makes

189
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,527
Well coz we know

190
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:35,295
Wework

191
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,343
Under martial law

192
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
And also

193
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:39,903
Fairly certain

194
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,719
No matter how

195
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
In America

196
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
I don't

197
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
Any sitting president could ever

198
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Just raises hand and just be like

199
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,031
Under Alex

200
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,663
Conception under under Alex's idea it's not the president

201
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,735
100 year-long plan of the small

202
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,879
He's telling Congress what they already knew cuz he's

203
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Absolutely

204
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
Set the bunch.

205
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
The next

206
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Today already

207
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:21,887
I would have piss on Obama

208
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,543
Come on up for some reason when I look at him I think bad press

209
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:34,431
I don't know why it's what I mean is when I look at him as bad president

210
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,503
I don't see any possible reason for that

211
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,391
People smell like sulfur

212
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,743
At least the narrative Progressive slightly I will give him credit for that

213
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,023
Jordan

214
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,399
Generally when we like to have a good time on this show we end up seeing Alex Jones singing along

215
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
To the highway map

216
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,495
We also saw Eastbound & Down

217
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
On the last one

218
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,847
I have to make

219
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Public admission

220
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
None of these songs are Alex Jones is favored

221
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
Birdsong

222
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,527
The favorites I'm pretty clear that this next song

223
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,319
Is Alex Jones

224
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,183
Literal favorite song on almost every show

225
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
And gets really sentimental Victor

226
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
However on the January 21st episode

227
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
Besides

228
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs

229
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,335
Interesting what the heck out of there

230
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
You seem like a very basic

231
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,199
He likes that he doesn't like

232
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
The singles I'm going to go with maps

233
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,271
Did that come out by the

234
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:55,839
Take it away with that Melody

235
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
By Willie Nelson

236
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,679
Came out on

237
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,471
2008 album

238
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Forever and was forgotten by literally everyone

239
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
But here it is

240
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:43,967
103 this forever

241
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
First of all

242
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,743
It's terrible thing I do agree

243
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
Does not understand meter in Reading

244
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
You saying after that

245
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,895
Reports on airplanes

246
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,455
ORD airport

247
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Respond

248
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
Man charged with terrorism

249
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,095
Stop nice

250
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
It's a business

251
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:19,615
F****** Alex Jones understood 1009

252
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
The prisons were a business

253
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
And they're being filled

254
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
We could look at the

255
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:31,135
Pacific Supply that it's mostly being filled by black people

256
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:37,535
Talk about how I like Heroes

257
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:39,327
From what he just said

258
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
They're even coming up

259
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Us

260
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,471
Which I understand

261
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:50,591
I understand what he's saying in the content

262
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:53,407
For the racial stuff later

263
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:57,247
Those who would resist

264
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Perhaps

265
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
What do you think

266
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Really troubling

267
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
You know that

268
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:11,583
He's fully aware in 2009 that prisons are a business

269
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
You going

270
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,447
The prison makes them money

271
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,775
And also they can profit off of your labor

272
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Crazy

273
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:26,431
Weird

274
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,271
It's almost like they have a financial incentive

275
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,343
This story that brings up

276
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Maybe 10 times

277
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Throughout the rest of the show

278
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,767
Terrorism

279
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
Play Rihanna's

280
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
Set a terroristic tabei

281
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,215
Who's all playing

282
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:53,311
I thought I had to bb8 from the LA Times article

283
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Just redacted

284
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:55,359
All about

285
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Probably

286
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,199
Here's that from the article of the alley time to decide

287
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
Tamara Jo Freeman was on a Frontier Airlines flight

288
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
To Denver in 2007 when her two children began

289
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
Window shade

290
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
I've been spilled a Bloody Mary in her lap

291
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
That was booze

292
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Virgin Bloody Mary

293
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,583
Each of them on the side with

294
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
3 squats

295
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,399
It was a small incident but one

296
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,679
Heightened anxiety after

297
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,007
September 11th

298
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,287
Directions for Freeman

299
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
And her children

300
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,151
Confronted Freeman who responded by hurling a few profanity

301
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,223
I'm throwing what remained of a can of tomato juice on the floor

302
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
So then she got arrested

303
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,343
I think it's a little f***** up but I

304
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:39,135
I understand this

305
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
Friend

306
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
But at the same time at the same time if she wasn't wearing shoes out of

307
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,143
Totally fine with it well

308
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
And they just did it for that

309
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
God damned if you aren't going to

310
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,319
I'm even this article noatime says that

311
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,159
Security Experts say that the use of the law by Airlines and their employees

312
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Criminalizing

313
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Incidents that did not start out of

314
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
Threat to Public Safety

315
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Much less

316
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
Terrorism

317
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
So even this article is

318
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,143
It's already making a more nuanced

319
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,167
Criticism the knowledge

320
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
So

321
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,007
I don't know that's the mainstream media

322
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,847
I don't know what point he wants to make your like there's actual facts

323
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
Patriot Act give an airline

324
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:47,743
Problem

325
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:48,511
Best actor

326
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:52,607
Flexibility to clamp down on unruly Behavior

327
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:55,935
Intent of the Patriot Act Provisions with put terrorist

328
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,495
In violation of the law before they could X

329
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Execute an actual takeover

330
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,823
Says Nathan sayles Allah professor

331
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
George Mason University

332
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
Who helped to write

333
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Patriot Act

334
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,407
He served in the jump

335
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Just Department

336
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,711
But sales acknowledge

337
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,991
That in the perverted

338
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,063
Protect the skies the practical application of the law has sprayed

339
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,135
Your child is not as great a threat to Aviation

340
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,928
Does members of Elkader with box cutters

341
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
How much is

342
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Is clear he said

343
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:19,744
Cool

344
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
I do not like hearing

345
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
I do not like here in George Mason

346
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,496
More like

347
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
A lot

348
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,408
This is Maurice story of

349
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Airlines

350
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Misusing

351
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Discretion

352
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Proposal

353
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Police save Crackdown

354
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,136
This is something that the the airlines

355
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,464
Can deal with Jose

356
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Opting for the latter

357
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:56,608
In order to criminalize at Behavior

358
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,912
People do the airlines are already a card

359
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,728
So why not give them

360
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
No

361
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
Dammit if those corporate

362
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Love us

363
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:19,904
At this point

364
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Alex

365
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
Micheladas

366
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,512
Stuff that's on this episode

367
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
Little tiny things

368
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
Inconsequential because he launches into

369
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
To like I would say probably a little over an hour

370
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:37,312
Breakdown of Barack Obama's inauguration speech

371
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
Statim in up

372
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Dap

373
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
Analysis

374
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
Ears

375
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,648
It was a very inspiring but also pretty boilerplate speech it was very much like

376
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,280
Well Alex's take is a little different

377
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:58,816
Here's the beginning

378
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
Okay

379
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,384
Monument

380
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,016
The Presidential Inaugural ever

381
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
See now

382
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,832
He would argue that now

383
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:30,048
Right

384
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
Must mean it's terrifying

385
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,936

It would be better for him if there was people there

388

Get ready for 40 more seconds of this metaphor

409
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,104

One guy

411
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
As a couple articles that had different

412
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:25,760
People but it was very sporadic

413
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,624
I would say seventy-two 80% of all of the articles

414
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184

About North, admitting that they're run by the bank

419
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:51,872

Do you know John Schindler

424
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
He's an ex-nsa

425
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
I believe

426
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,976
Or research

427
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:13,888
You got fired for like emailing a picture of his dick to somebody

428

Just bad spy Behavior

429
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:22,592

00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Of the

431
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,664

432
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456

435
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:35,136
Great great showing up in that much about him he might have

436
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,928
Some credentials and it does appear that used

437
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,024
War College ever the head of it

438
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,608
And there aren't any articles on Alex's even

439
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Talk about this

440
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
This would take

441
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
Days of Googling

442
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,360
The traffic figure out what are you saying it would actually be a Monumental amount of effort to do that

443
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,384
Instead of just a

444
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,688
Googling once and then writing down notes

445
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Yeah I suppose so

446
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,784
The other thing is

447
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
Brent mentions the army war College

448
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:07,136

454
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,448
That's why I write it

456
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264

00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Development

460
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,616
I came out right

461
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,712
Before this episode would have come November 2000

462
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,784
The reason for that is

463
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,320
Explain

464
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
From the first page

465
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
The current defense team

466
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
Confronted a game-changing strips

467
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
Pedic shocking

468
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Turn office

469
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,768
The next team would be well advised to

470
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,536
Expect the same

471
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
You understand what that's saying

472
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Yeah

473
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,400
When Bush came into office

474
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
His defense team within 8 months

475
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,728
Add 9/11

476
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
Which was a game changer

477
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
Dick shot and what they mean by that

478
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Is

479
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Not

480
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Anything nefarious

481
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
It's just that

482
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
More or less

483
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
Strategic shock

484
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
Let me see you when we see we're okay

485
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Kids what it's about

486
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
The document says

487
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:18,304
Military-industrial complex has taken over the government

488
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
All it says

489
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,472
Is the Strategic shocks occur in our history like 911 or Pearl Harbor

490
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,752
And all relevant analysis

491
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Self-assessment

492
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,592
Have to do with solving the problem that has already occurred

493
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
As opposed to looking forward to what is coming

494
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,176
This because up to

495
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,712
To this point

496
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:42,368
We sort of all into these laws repeatedly through history

497
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,648
Reactive in nature

498
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,096
Paper is about

499
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
Situation now there because

500
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,424
If you go back and you look at

501
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
The

502
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,984
The way that

503
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,288
Economy always

504
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Whenever things go good

505
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:07,456
Everybody D regulates everything and allows everything to get

506
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
This was going to last

507
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:16,160
And then we get back cuz nobody is nobody

508
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,464
Capable of a long-term

509
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Strategy

510
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Like

511
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Just keeping up

512
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
If you think about like

513
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Everything Auto

514
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
You just scale up slightly

515
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Everybody

516
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
Even people

517
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:39,200
Foreign policy even people who were working for the defense department are somewhat just

518
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:40,480
To keep up

519
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:48,160
Like that's all we

520
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:51,744
Plan Alex's narratives in advance

521
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
Yeah that's actually probably do a better job

522
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,728
Ubiq

523
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
In the end

524
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Tire paper

525
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Maybe a little more

526
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
Again I read

527
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,784
The I read a bunch of different things and they were varying length

528
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Quite frankly

529
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,696
But the only thing I think you paid attention to him this is about a possible domestic emergency

530
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
I need some more Powers there

531
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
As a community

532
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,888
Protect and defend the Constitution

533
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,424
Against all enemies foreign and

534
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,984
The department of defense's role in

535
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,288
Has never been stopped

536
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Examine

537
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
Dust

538
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
There is perhaps no greater sources

539
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,640
Strategic shock for

540
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,664
For the defense department

541
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,736
Then operationalize exact component of the oath of service

542
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
The widespread domestic emergency

543
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Entails Rapids

544
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,576
Dissolution

545
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:50,112
A public order or

546
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Significant parts

547
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
The United States

548
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
They described

549
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,536
As likely not an immediate

550
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
The paper doesn't

551
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Anything prescript

552
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,424
It's not something anyone should do XYZ

553
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
Literally all it's saying is

554
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,496
The situation would be an immense

555
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Challenge

556
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,544
For the defense department

557
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,152
Unlikely

558
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Traffic

559
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,760
Could happen because there isn't a plan in place

560
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:21,088
There's no idea what to do and so it goes through like

561
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
Here is one problem that would pop up

562
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,696
God you know having to

563
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Get on National Guards

564
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Where

565
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:34,656
Governors have control of whether or not they operate with him that's an issue that would pop up

566
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
The government would be at

567
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,728
The best of the state

568
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:39,264
It's not

569
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
It's just describing a problem

570
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,616
Not even a problem it's describing a shower

571
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,688
Well I mean you consider the possibility that

572
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Rightfully impeached

573
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Extend removed from office

574
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:58,464
Hopefully they had it in front of everybody and then you have

575
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,768
Possibility

576
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,816
Nationalist separatist movement growing up

577
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:09,216
And then you think about the white catechism

578
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,776
You have a white nationalist militarized

579
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Government

580
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:18,944
Riverside ice already

581
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Like me

582
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
Like a literal domestic terrorism

583
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,320
Worse than my heart

584
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
I can't

585
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,976
White supremacist

586
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
Nationalist governors

587
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:34,048
Abstain

588
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,584
Santa Rosa

589
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Live at least I'd Steven

590
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:47,360
What's underneath this nightmare scenario

591
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:53,760
What a nightmare scenario you're describing right now we're already in the Twilight phase of falling asleep into it even though we should

592
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
Should be jolting awake

593
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,064
Fighting

594
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Forever lives

595
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,440
The only reason to have a

596
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,720
A professional military

597
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Make sure

598
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,096
We protect our borders from Florida that's really

599
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:11,680
Florida coordinate off absolutely

600
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
Uber in Borden

601
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
This is at the top

602
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,568
It says

603
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,384
The views expressed in this report are those of the author

604
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,528
I do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Department of the army the Department of Defense

605
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
Or the US government

606
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,904
Just a guy right now some ideas it's like a f****** term paper

607
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
All resemblance

608
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
Person living

609
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
And then

610
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:38,816
Dick Wolf

611
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
Right exactly I'm at

612
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,424
What what you're dealing with here is Alex

613
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
Again

614
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
It keeps peeking

615
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,008
Specific

616
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
I could

617
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,080
Do a better job

618
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,896
I can go on

619
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:57,760
Context clues and everything he's ever published on his website

620
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:59,040
Now

621
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,088
If he wants to post an article

622
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,720
How North Cobb

623
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Anyway

624
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
We got to get to this

625
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,376
Already

626
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,448
Going to happen I told you was going to heat up pretty quick

627
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Bristol Road

628
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
Bingo

629
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,024
What is happening

630
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,424
Right now from Barack Obama

631
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,728
Play does he

632
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:55,872
I stand here today

633
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:59,200
Humbled

634
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,736
By the time supports

635
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,552
Break room

636
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
For The Truck Store

637
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,904
Mindful

638
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,720
The sacrifice was born by our ancestors

639
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,496
We're sacrificing

640
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,056
About you

641
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,184
Abortions

642
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:46,304
Birthday

643
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
Does everything is deception

644
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Yikes

645
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,824
Why can't it be a tip of the hat to black people

646
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Repast

647
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:04,480
In this country and also be a message of unification

648
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
You early

649
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
Tip of the cap to a

650
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,976
Is definitely not

651
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,024
Colloquialism

652
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,584
But if it is

653
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,424
That should be a unifying concept

654
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:29,824
If we are all capable of recognizing that sacrifice

655
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,592
Unified is a country

656
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,384
Grab the things that he's most

657
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,944
Is the fact that so many white

658
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
People don't

659
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,504
Country was built on the

660
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,064
Facts of black people sacrifice

661
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,368
Niagara

662
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,648
Even think was

663
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,928
God the

664
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
The phrase

665
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Real extinct

666
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,888
Just purely engaging with how stupid Alex

667
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
Remember all the times

668
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,568
Pick-A-Part

669
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,128
He was the same guy in 2005

670
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,968
Do you still have that inability to deal with more than like

671
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:14,368
Exactly

672
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,792
Sacrifices born by our ancestors

673
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
I think President Bush

674
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
For service to our nation

675
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,520
I don't I like to apologize I

676
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
The order

677
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
My bad

678
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
I think

679
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:43,040
President Bush for his service

680
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,560
Robert

681
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:58,144
Pat Robertson

682
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
I will save you

683
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:16,832
The craziest thing you said there is that Pat Robertson is being like socialism

684
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:22,464
Notorious Christian right fascist racist Pat Robertson

685
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,024
Well now that it's in the form of this guy

686
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
Clearly I remember Pat Robertson being very supportive of Obama

687
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:38,848
Remember that really Great Khali Khali

688
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:43,968
Peaceful transition of power has given him a day

689
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,600
Is responding to the affair Robertson

690
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
Didn't say

691
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Add should about it

692
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:02,144
Get them or anything like that at least

693
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,448
At least he's made peace

694
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,216
50th president

695
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Blow Bar

696
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,616
But Alex

697
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,688
He's at least not saying like

698
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
He cheated or anything like that

699
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:22,880
Obama sent

700
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,184
Didn't come out until Trump

701
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,976
And that one guy

702
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Tweeted

703
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,512
So

704
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
Good stores

705
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,632
Narrative about Barack Obama

706
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:34,912
Said the wrong words

707
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,568
President

708
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,808
Fairytale Lupo if you listen to

709
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,136
He's supposed to do is Repeat after John Roberts

710
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
Chief justice

711
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
Record you just repeating what John Roberts says

712
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:06,400
Administer DLC after work because it's

713
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,496
Dom formality signal leaves the pageantry

714
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
It's like

715
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
Just like

716
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:17,920
The fairy tale

717
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:20,224
Where you at

718
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,296
These tiny little

719
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,416
Time Warner

720
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,096
I don't know if he'll bring that narrative back up in

721
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Days

722
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,424
But at least

723
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,728
At this time

724
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,008
He doesn't seem like he's

725
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,288
2 into pushing that

726
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,944
I'm not dispute then I'm not going to dive in on this

727
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,992
Compared to the other stuff you.

728
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
To I'm shocked

729
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Doesn't do that

730
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
Another thing

731
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
It's really fun

732
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Is that Alex

733
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
The show

734
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,440
The 2009

735
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,512
Breakdown of Obama

736
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
Getting caught by brakes

737
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
You trying to jump in

738
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
And you have to go to break

739
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:17,056
Weather of General Flynn

740
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,872
Operation here shown throughout this transition

741
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,480
34 Americans

742
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
Have not taken

743
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
The presidential

744
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,904
Words spoken during Rising tides of prosperity

745
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
I'm Still Waters a piece

746
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
All right now he's calling upon history an American tradition

747
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
That's pretty strong

748
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Jump right into it

749
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,015
44 minutes now taking his oath of office

750
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,831
37 of which word

751
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,671
At least three others were miserable.

752
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:08,767
Carter was a good president

753
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:13,119
Actually kind of glad Marty was here for the discussion

754
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:17,727
If you were here about Andrew Jackson

755
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:21,823
But it turned into a 15-minute

756
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:25,663
Spoken Reasons

757
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Nevermind

758
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
Civil War coming

759
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:35,903
Not according to lore not according to lore

According to lore

762
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,303
Find so he goes to break

763
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
PowerSchool sprake

764
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
He comes back

765
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
This analysis

766
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Boy

767
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
Good

768
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,359
To Barack Obama as I analyze this

769
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,687
Generous generous

770
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,967

The Raging storms

773
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,415
These moments

774
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,463
America has carried on.

775
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Simply

776
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,047
Because of the scale or mention of those in Ohio

777
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
The main baseball to the ideals of our forebears

778
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Intruder

779
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,783
44 president

780
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,879
I need you to help me

781
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,511
If you didn't

782
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:48,351
I need your help

783
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:50,399
Mycourse

784
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,127
Appellant had inhibit

785
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
Alarm 8

786
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:12,159
A government service

787
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,279
Dot-org whatever where people just log community service hours they did

788
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,071
In order to make everyone feel good

789
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
That's another Army building

790
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,471
If gamifying

791
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:30,079
Also I need to be very clear about this

792
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,151
Because I think that you agreed with what Alex was saying

793
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
In a bad way

794
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Alex's inverting it

795
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,527
And you not saying I need your help

796
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:41,087
Only all of us can do that

797
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,367
That's

798
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
No I know the reason that I laughed at that immediately is because I was waiting for him to then be like

799
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:55,167
We all know your money

800
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Be able to do this I represent

801
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,799
A h

802
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Trust me

803
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,943
We will get the sponsors in a little bit

804
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,015
But

805
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
Go to destroy America

806
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
Trying to build an army

807
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
Volunteerism is evil

808
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,215
He says

809
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,799
Our Bill of Rights our constitution

810
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:35,103
Write our form of government

811
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
Yes

812
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,039
But he's coming

813
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,207
Subways

814
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
Now see what he said

815
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,703
Wisdom

816
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,471
Nice to people

817
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,263
He said it was a bad idea

818
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
People

819
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
Bad idea

820
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:08,639
I didn't say anything about it I be like

821
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
Right

822
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
F****** a******

823
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,111
About how we got to work together

824
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,975
The reason this country is so great is because we stuck to our tradition

825
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
We're stuck to our

826
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,303
Respective law and each other

827
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Even through hard times

828
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:34,239
Absolutely disagree with who is a war criminal that should be punished commence

829
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Even then

830
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,383
America is still like well we're going to f****** move along

831
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
We got another president

832
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
This war criminal fine f****** that least he gone now

833
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,319
I never got another workarounds

834
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,183
Also I think Debbie at that point

835
00:46:56,255 --> 00:47:02,399
I don't remember Obama being like ridiculously

836
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:07,007
Set we are at where we are right now

837
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:12,639
There was like a smattering of Boos at the inauguration for but that wasn't Obama doing that

838
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
Also

839
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,551
God do you remember when the

840
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,087
Could use a metal

841
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,231
Do remember those days

842
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Used to be able to speak

843
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:34,399
Feel and respond to an image that appears in your brain

844
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,167
But called

845
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:38,751
Writing well president made a big old mistake

846
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:50,527
Presidency was diminished

847
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:53,087
Play the rest of this at least a lot of it cuz

848
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,135
It's just going to be redundant

849
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,695
Play the stuff that I think

850
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
Worthwhile

851
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
What has been

852
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
So it must be with this

853
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,447
Generation of America

854
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
We are in the midst of crisis

855
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,343
History

856
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,439
Rrrrr

857
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,791
Incredible

858
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:37,631
Star Wars expanded universe

859
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Just

860
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
Devastating to Freedom

861
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,807
Sure how good was Obama as a speaker even Alex after

862
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:00,927
Claiming that everything he said was a lie that means the opposite of it it's still like

863
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
He gave a pretty good

864
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
He said it's a great speech

865
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:18,847
His speech writer

866
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,919
All over it

867
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:27,807
Because Obama was a good right now the same is true of trump but that's just going to keep spilling Redbox

868
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
Terrorism

869
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
Here's something you

870
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
Our nation is at War

871
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
I guess the far-reaching net worth

872
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,727
Violence and hatred

873
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,799
Our economy is badly weakened

874
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,711
Charlie Chan

875
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:01,599
White back to the Cold War

876
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,743
Emmanuel

877
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Interconnected

878
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:26,687
And they are negative things that our country is

879
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:30,015
Use the metaphor of

880
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,295
Gathering storm

881
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,599
Perhaps even literal eyes is it

882
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,879
Later on in the

883
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
Hate

884
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
For Alex

885
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:43,583
Do you have me go through a bunch of things and see what things he mentions back-to-back

886
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,423
Nexus

887
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,471
In his audiences brain

888
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,775
Would be hard

889
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,055
Pretty dark stuff

890
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
I imagine

891
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
A lot of it

892
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:55,871
Thrift

893
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:59,199
Everlywell

894
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:02,015
Especially as we get closer and closer to the present

895
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:06,623
You know we got

896
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
You got

897
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:12,511
Soy boys running around now

898
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,303
Triggered by everything

899
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
It's triggered by Obama

900
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:19,679
And prepare the nation

901
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Runaway

902
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:27,103
Can't even f****** say on New Age

903
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:31,455
Language policing

904
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,527
Obvious

905
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,647
I know what you mean I told you

906
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
So

907
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,535
Accuses Obama talking about the environment for being about carbon

908
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Cuz we don't really need to listen

909
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Just sort of like

910
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,263
Jeff is dumb but actually kind of funny cuz that you see in real-time Alex needing to take

911
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:57,567
To get his rant down

912
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,151
This is a mic down one

913
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,711
These are the indicators of price

914
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:06,271
Subjective data and statistics

915
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
Les Miserable

916
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,671
But no less profound is a tapping uptown

917
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Across our way

918
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,759
And

919
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,623
Losing our houses in losing our jobs

920
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,559
These are the indicators of price

921
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,703
Les Miserables

922
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,775
Manolas profound is a tapping of compass

923
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,567
MacArthur Lane

924
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,135
He's like I forgot my B let me take that one more time

925
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,535
I met up the punchline I'm going to go I ended with the part that I should have started with

926
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:27,679
Everything let me know

927
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,471
That's good that you to be construct

928
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,079
Yeah

929
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
This point

930
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,431
He thinks that many people are listening

931
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
And so it's fine to do that

932
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,759
Cuz otherwise if you're listening

933
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Do that again

934
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:46,623
The next time he just says basically the same

935
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,975
Nothing but just be arranged they made it more accusatory

936
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,839
They did this

937
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,399
As opposed to this happened and it was them

938
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
It will make a difference how people

939
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,031
Feels

940
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,055
Kind of

941
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
Surprise me how

942
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,663
How stupid these people are

943
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,455
When they boil down

944
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,247
Massive

945
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
Cated interconnected

946
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,343
System that has chain

947
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
More rapidly

948
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Then it ever has

949
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:21,695
The history of the human race

950
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
And calling it

951
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
Just ate

952
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
They planned it

953
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:31,679
When was they want to make us from a Manufacturing

954
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
Who is service economy

955
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:36,543
As though that was a bit

956
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
Destroyer

957
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,663
To do with f****** automating

958
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
We can get rid of

959
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,223
People in all

960
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,527
Whatever whatever

961
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,551
Friends but Alex

962
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:51,647
Wants to blame on subsidies overseas and stuff like that

963
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,695
He wants to talk about like

964
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
Given

965
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:59,071
A little bit more time even if we didn't do that stuff it would be robots

966
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,423
Manufacturing jobs all jobs

967
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:07,775
Trump pretends are coming back all of that stuff is just going to end up

968
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,055
Inevitably not even

969
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:11,871
Being done by cheap labor being done by automation

970
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
So

971
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
I think it's point is ultimately stupid

972
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
That's what I was getting into

973
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,327
Perfectly what's going on and then

974
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,095
To this day

975
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
So basically what he said was

976
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:39,263
He's wasting time and so early I don't know

977
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,103
Like at the end of the day

978
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Here's why it's wrong

979
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,663
Texas information

980
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,199
Use it later on in your life

981
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,271
In the context of our show

982
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:56,927
To get the top of it happens a little bit later that's hilarious I promise you that

983
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Because Alex has

984
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,279
Mad about

985
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,839
Obama being rude

986
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
He's mad at Paul Reiser

987
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:08,703
Missouri

988
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
Cuz right

989
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
Totally wrong

990
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,919
Oh absolutely

991
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
Alex's toad

992
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,735
Really wrong

993
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,551
We remain a Young Nation

994
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
Put in the words of scripture

995
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,647
The time has come

996
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:29,695
Dakota side childish place

997
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,191
United States

998
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:43,775
System in the world 35 years old

999
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,439
Funny quotes scripture to manipulate people

1000
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Levi crazy

1001
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,887
Frankly

1002
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,935
Putting scripture to manipulate

1003
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
People that steal

1004
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,775
That reminds me of a quote from the scripture

1005
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,383
Even the devil can you scripture for his own purpose

1006
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:24,735
Scripture interesting

1007
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Manipulating

1008
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Unnecessary

1009
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
Confused

1010
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:28,831
Got nothing

1011
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,439
So Alex is the United States is older than the Roman Republic

1012
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,487
And the Republic.

1013
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,767
Started about

1014
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:37,535
509

1015
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,303
9 BC

1016
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
27b

1017
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
Empire

1018
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,655
Right so that's

1019
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
Longer than the United

1020
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,007
And if you go

1021
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:47,775
Further than

1022
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,103
Let's talk about America really being a republic

1023
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,687
When did women get the right to vote

1024
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,039
Somewhere in there

1025
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,087
Yeah

1026
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:05,183
Fair share a lot there's trouble

1027
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,207
On paper

1028
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:09,791
We've really only been

1029
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,447
Speaking black people do have the right to vote like a functioning democracy Republic for like

1030
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Attract

1031
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:19,775
Compared to

1032
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,567
Whatever

1033
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,383
Knock knock

1034
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
Like

1035
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:30,015
Grover Cleveland there have been very many non-consecutive sex

1036
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
Directions of Funk

1037
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
Absolutely

1038
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
San Marino

1039
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,159
According to Legend

1040
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,695
Lure

1041
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,975
Lower

1042
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,559
Themselves Republican

1043
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,095
Consistent Government Center

1044
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,423
For 1716 years

1045
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,751
Existed as a self-governing republic

1046
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,335
Never ended a lot of people would say that they're legal part of Italy

1047
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:58,431
But I stayed closer Marino

1048
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:05,855
Bush-league it's like I don't count but I don't count Babe Ruth home runs as much because he didn't play against

1049
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,559
Even have any competition in the Republic game at the

1050
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,327
Time

1051
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,607
Doesn't count

1052
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,191
There's also a 2ez there's also a couple of governments

1053
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
And you're up like a

1054
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:22,751
And the Netherlands

1055
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
Much longer

1056
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:28,895
Publix

1057
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
Just good

1058
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,551
Surroundings

1059
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
Example of the Roman

1060
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,647
We could use some Alex

1061
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
Why would you even

1062
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
Begin to say that

1063
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,999
That is such a

1064
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,559
Stupid thing to say that even if you were stupid

1065
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:51,935
It seems stupid if you really wanted to get into it you could try and make the argument

1066
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:52,703
There's different

1067
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,727
Periods Within

1068
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:56,799
In the Roman Republic

1069
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,615
Alex

1070
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:06,271
Level

1071
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Rick is like

1072
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:11,391
Republic

1073
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:16,511
Nationalized

1074
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,791
Publix

1075
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Anyway

1076
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
Who's all the society

1077
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
About

1078
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
Biblical scripture again

1079
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,967
Every time I feel like we need to have

1080
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:36,735
Alex

1081
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,015
Alex

1082
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:42,623
I challenge of Apple trivia challenge YouTube

1083
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
And every time

1084
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,439
We done

1085
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
You get.

1086
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
Baby great

1087
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:50,047
That would be fun we're being Austin

1088
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:56,447
Going to want to wear light clothes

1089
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
Himawari description

1090
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
The time has come

1091
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,335
Just got to side childish things

1092
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:21,535
Okay

1093
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,351
Wheels

1094
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,631
Speeches about how

1095
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
Not present

1096
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,239
Proceed

1097
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:35,359
Guess what America you've been acting like f*************** this whole goddamn time

1098
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:40,991
And let's work together I don't get why you don't see what that means

1099
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,319
He's actually saying president of the world

1100
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
Jabos make

1101
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,303
Suffice it to say that he doesn't h

1102
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Plus out of this

1103
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:00,703
It can't be if I took all the clips it would be as confusing

1104
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,055
You just saying he's digging too deep

1105
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:11,199
The Jesus to bring out themes that aren't there like a first-year creative writing student in a workshop

1106
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,247
And it would just

1107
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:19,135
Like we're already at a point where we've both been up too long today or were tired and we would get

1108
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
Still bored

1109
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
And so Furious

1110
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:27,583
So I'm going to skip the rest of it now something really weird

1111
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,375
So he doesn't hour-and-a-half

1112
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:34,239
Speaking of sponsors

1113
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,015
Who do you think

1114
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
We got a visit from

1115
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
One of his spawn

1116
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,695
Is it

1117
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,511
Who's postcard

1118
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:02,911
One sentence it'll get you out of

1119
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
Doctor Rima labo is not in play in 2009 as far as I

1120
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,711
Profound

1121
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:19,039
Is it pop out until 2014

1122
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
So

1123
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:27,743
And I'm assuming that it's not it's not our blessed

1124
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:32,095
Flashlight

1125
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:37,983
Way better than the diamond gusset it's Marty Schechter of the Soap Company

1126
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,591
A welder

1127
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,871
I also adores.

1128
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
Stokely

1129
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
So Alex

1130
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,295
Moisturizers better than Irish Spring let me tell you

1131
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
Something about this

1132
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
Alex

1133
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,135
Hour-and-a-half

1134
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,975
Obama's just lying through doublespeak

1135
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,303
Buy soap salesman

1136
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839

Real soap

1138
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
Why not make the Obamas

1139
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,103
Speech analysis also about self

1140
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:17,663
This is really troubling

1141
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
For an American company

1142
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
Making America

1143
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015

01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
All all people All American

1145
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
I were very very happy about that

1146
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,695
We got the biggest sign

1147
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975

That's how God over here

1150
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:47,871
I've troubled by the Alex Jones is God

1151
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
We're all Americans

1152
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,295
Cuz where I cut the clip

1153
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,391
After that don't say that I'm not Obama

1154
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,743
Knights kind of thrill

1155
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,023
Alex

1156
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,631
Loki was getting scored

1157
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
Marty Schechter

1158
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,751
We we grade on a curve

1159
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:17,823
Reactor

1160
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,479
Low bar for he's coming in

1161
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:26,783
Soap American soap

1162
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,367
American American

Call Alex Jones White God we love it

1165
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,791
So American and Irish Spring is a fence

1166
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
F*** is this green s***

1167
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
So speaking of Irish Spring

1168
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,447
If you'll recall

1169
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,007
The last time Marty Schechter was on

1170
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
Very embarrassing we had to ask him

1171
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Deliberate

1172
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
Ride

1173
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,687
Oh my God

1174
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
God

1175
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
BDubs

1176
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,015
Deliberate

1177
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:58,783
His f******

1178
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,903

1179
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
Limerick

1180
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:11,327
Proud of it

1181
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983
Does liver

1182
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,263
He doesn't like

1183
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,055
Violinist

1184
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,615
At a recital this guy has them

1185
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,687
In the chamber clearly insist that Alex

1186
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,807
To do a limerick

1187
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:35,903
As he was like I got my

01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,327

Unicellular limerick

1193
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Fasho

1194
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
So you Ned

1195
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,575
Bring the neighbor

1196
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,879
Ring the bell of his neighbor

1197
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,695
Husband said why

1198
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
When you stick

1199
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,999
Stormfly

1200
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,327
There was no need to fight off the thread

1201
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:23,775
Amazing my friend

1202
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,103
Loan

1203
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
Great

1204
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,479
Alex for the perfect life

1205
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,879
Disrespectful impossible logger and he's confused one sec

1206
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
Shorter

1207
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:43,231
It kind of disappointed

1208
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:50,399
To throw the correct amount of I love it that I think he's

1209
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Fuse

1210
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,471
Confused

1211
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,495
Cuz Blake every

1212
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:57,311
Find me asking for Olympic the last one was f****** sex

1213
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:04,479
Actually about a b******

1214
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Limerick

1215
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,367
New

1216
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,647
Notaries off

1217
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,183
I think

1218
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
You screwed it up in the middle or I would say

1219
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:18,815
Beginning at the very moment he thought

1220
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
I could be deliberate

1221
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:22,143
This is such a delightful

1222
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,959
Reality

1223
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Repeating

1224
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
This is what Alex was

1225
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
Forced to do

1226
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:32,383
In order to get this guy to sponsor his show

1227
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,919
He has to have him come on

1228
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Hearing his voice

1229
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,759
Hey Marty

1230
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,087
Long pause

1231
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,647
Awesome my friend

1232
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,415
Great

1233
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,231
Alright where can you get yourself

1234
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,303
Man it's good

1235
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:55,167
Can't wait for his next appearance

1236
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,239
I just want to try out there's no way I'd be able to like

1237
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,031
Just time it out to find

1238
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,567
These are

1239
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:06,431
You didn't make these limericks

1240
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,271
Deliberate

1241
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,063
To hack on hat

1242
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,599
I've got it so great

1243
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
This picture of his life back then

1244
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,975
Somewhat delightful

1245
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,255
Beyond sublevels because

1246
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,047
You know we talked about some

1247
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,375
I don't know if we having a really long time there was a thought of like

1248
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,191
How Alex Jones would make a really funny

1249
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Sitcom

1250
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
Like this

1251
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,799
Bigot propagandist yelling in the booth

1252
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:34,847
And what have you

1253
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,991
Those kinds of moments

1254
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Would make

1255
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:46,623
Absolutely baby short films

1256
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:52,255
I can see a Larry Sanders show for sure you can just hear after awesome my friend

1257
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Staring at the

1258
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:00,959
I'm like what am I doing

1259
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
So

1260
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,871
Michelle

1261
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
Apparently we're doing. Johnny Carson

1262
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:14,783
Swiss gas

1263
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,087
Is a guy by the name of Barry Cooper

1264
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
Have you heard of berry

1265
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
Superhot

1266
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,183
He is a former cop

1267
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
Dave Barry Cooper

1268
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,559
For a living

1269
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,631
Cdb Cooper

1270
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,399
Mixing bowls

1271
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,167
Together

1272
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,823
So Barry Cooper is a guy who started

1273
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,383
Picture of a Jordan

1274
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,919
You're going to have a tree

1275
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,711
He looks crazy

1276
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:49,087
You could do that after the shower

1277
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:52,671
At the time a 2009 was running

1278
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
State called never get busted

1279
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:01,631
Definitely shouldn't come anywhere near

1280
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
Buster

1281
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,215
I want to say a lot about him

1282
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:06,751
The first is

1283
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:08,799
I think

1284
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:13,151
That probably he was doing some good 2009

1285
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,735
Because one of the things that his website is all about is

1286
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,271
Teaching you how to pass drug

1287
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
So like

1288
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,647
He's teaching you how to like what you should take in like

1289
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,791
Either I have tested a lot of these over-the-counter head shop on

1290
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,095
These are ones that'll happen if you want to pass

1291
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,143
Hair test to go to bleach your hair

1292
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,703
That will I like a prickly

1293
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,311
If it's for weed you should just

1294
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Use fake piss

1295
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,175
Because they're not going to do that much of a test

1296
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
Probably you have HPV

1297
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
TV

1298
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,135
So

1299
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,695
I don't know the rest of the trapping

1300
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
What he was into

1301
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,255
But I do agree

1302
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,791
On some level that

1303
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,631
There's abusive practices

1304
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,031
I don't think there's any reason if you're on probation you want to get high or something like that

1305
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:15,871
Don't feel like that should be like you have to go to prison now

1306
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:19,199
I don't know if he was giving good advice

1307
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,271
Let me be clear about that show I have no idea

1308
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,087
But theoretically heart might be in the right place

1309
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:30,207
That the advice you was giving about drug test was correct

1310
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,511
I think you probably help some people and good on him

1311
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,047
Good now

1312
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,375
There is some Dr.Oz going to happen is

1313
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,471
If you Google him

1314
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,263
You'll find

1315
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,799
To Wellness love it

1316
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:51,199
Excuse for crude but okay

1317
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:57,855
Good business

1318
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:07,839
Hugo ibogaine and Ayahuasca both

1319
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,167
Piano touted as good ways

1320
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,703
2

1321
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
And

1322
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,823
Volume Sonic

1323
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
Iffy

1324
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:22,175
But at the same time the United States

1325
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:26,271
Can't really do. Studies on these things information

1326
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,063
Isabel is pretty

1327
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,903
If you really look into it is

1328
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
Everybody who sells

1329
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,791
These vacation packages with ibogaine in it

1330
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,839
Will tell you

1331
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
You will be

1332
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:43,679
Two before you were addicted

1333
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,959
The drugs

1334
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,775
People who don't go into

1335
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,311
The treatment

1336
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
Have like

1337
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,383
Percent relapse rate

1338
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:59,039
So once again talking about how there's a support structure that needs to be in place

1339
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,831
Not just a quick fix

1340
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,623
Right but at the same time

1341
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,743
The studies of the information that is available show that it's markedly higher

1342
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
Then just like

1343
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Detox

1344
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
It's

1345
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
The indications you can get are like

1346
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,751
2240 22 50%

1347
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
Success rate when people

1348
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,847
Go into treatment

1349
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
Weird terms of like a

1350
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,943
Support group or 12-step program

1351
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,991
You're having the street

1352
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,783
Whereas before it's usually like

1353
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
At the same time

1354
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
If you don't do any of those things

1355
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:38,719
Thank you just go back to your normal pattern

1356
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,511
Your relapse rate is

1357
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
Almost

1358
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:47,679
Inevitable in the meantime

1359
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,447
Time

1360
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,727
Disconnect by brand off

1361
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
U2

1362
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,823
Puerto Vallarta

1363
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,847
And gives you a game

1364
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,663
On the other hand

1365
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
You still

1366
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:05,087
Blown to Puerto Vallarta

1367
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:11,487
You still did that it also occurs to me

1368
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
Yeah it occurs to me

1369
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
That there's low overhead on this

1370
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Operation

1371
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:23,263
Vacations start at $4,950

1372
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Start

1373
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,567
So probably option

1374
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,359
Could be higher than this

1375
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,383
But

1376
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:30,431
To keep our prices lower than all three

1377
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:35,039
We offer phone calls only to those who are ready to book their trip

1378
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,343
Okay

1379
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,695
Nobody

1380
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:48,095
Nobody take certainly not

1381
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,631
Got somebody

1382
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,471
Send us an email

1383
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:57,311
Yes

1384
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,591
Call has no

1385
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,151
If you have question

1386
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,687
Don't

1387
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:03,455
Again

1388
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:06,783
Bears

1389
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,551
Repeating is like

1390
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,623
Just based on the fact

1391
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:12,927
I think a lot of

1392
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
People who run business

1393
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
This or not

1394
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
Totally Above board

1395
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,327
I think that there is a lot of

1396
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Absolutely

1397
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,983
I think probably there is good in

1398
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
Because

1399
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
There are indications

1400
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
This is a better way to treat addiction

1401
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,527
Damaging than a lot of others can't

1402
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,807
I think

1403
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
You go in

1404
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,671
With the unrealistic expectation that I'm going to go trip on Abba gain

1405
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
I keep pronouncing

1406
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,743
A different lady some reason just comes out of my mouth

1407
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,071
But I'm going to go trip on this stuff and then I'm going to come back to her

1408
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,095
And then you're not

1409
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
I think that could lead

1410
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
YouTube a feeling of I'm trapped in addiction

1411
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,215
For the rest of my life

1412
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:57,983
Reminiscing

1413
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,799
Stream $5,000 vacation couldn't help me out

1414
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,079
Right I'm going to do

1415
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,615
Just being a dick for life

1416
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,151
I don't know

1417
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,175
I don't know

1418
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,711
What is whole process

1419
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,527
I don't know if like if

1420
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,599
When you get off the plane he shoots a blow dart

1421
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
Right

1422
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,207
The first 3 days

1423
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:19,487
They give you drugs

1424
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,023
Because they don't want you to have withdrawals

1425
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,327
Drugs

1426
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:25,887
Whatever whatever

1427
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:32,287
Will supply you with h

1428
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,871
The rest of the time you just do whatever

1429
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,943
For the first 3 days

1430
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:41,759
The tester do sand

1431
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,783
You're not allergic to it

1432
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:43,807
You get the full dose and then

1433
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,087
Trip your balls off

1434
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,623
For 12 to 18 hours

1435
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:47,391
You freaked out

1436
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,159
When you go to bed

1437
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:51,487
Then on day 5 here's what it says on the itinerary

1438
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,767
This is why

1439
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,047
Favorite Maybe

1440
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
There isn't

1441
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
Indications

1442
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,655
When you get home

1443
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
You need

1444
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,471
To answer na

1445
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
I'm going to be reset

1446
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,639
And you will have no Cravings or withdrawals

1447
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:12,223
Alex will check on you throughout the day not Alex Jones

1448
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,015
Because you naturally

1449
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,295
To rest in bed

1450
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,879
J7

1451
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
Expository

1452
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:20,671
Receive chelation

1453
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:24,255
You're free to vacation and enjoy your new life

1454
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,047
You are free to vacation

1455
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,071
Enjoy your new life

1456
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,351
This is not a great

1457
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:31,679
I like both

1458
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,471
Never been to a business comp

1459
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Conference man

1460
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
You got to have fun

1461
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:39,359
11th I want one PowerPoint presentation

1462
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,383
At least in this whole thing

1463
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,431
AR-15 to get

1464
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,711
Personalized life coaching

1465
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
Love it

1466
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,343
No I don't know if

1467
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
Hey

1468
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,927
Bad

1469
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Again a lot of it

1470
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,863
Would probably be funnier if you knew what you look like if you look

1471
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
Crazy

1472
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,191
I don't know I'm Soto

1473
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
I'm really really really torn

1474
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,287
Natalie Imbruglia

1475
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,847
I mean you are

1476
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,919
In theory putting someone up for 15 days

1477
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,711
But I do think

1478
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,247
To pay for your own food

1479
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
Yeah meals r-52c

1480
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:20,831
$7 each

1481
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Look

1482
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:29,279
Flight hotel or food

1483
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:33,887
Oh that's a problem

1484
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,703
Text

1485
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,263
Definitely starting at 4950

1486
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:43,103
I think if it included airfare good on you

1487
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:43,871
But it doesn't

1488
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,199
The clearing of money

1489
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
Urinary

1490
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,807
Yes

1491
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:57,439
To trying to find Solutions

1492
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,463
12 to 14

1493
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,303
G by the time you're out of here

1494
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:09,471
Arlington rely on

1495
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,872
Make that decision I don't want

1496
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Like beat this up

1497
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Too much B

1498
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,200
Because I'm sublevels like

1499
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,016
Do look at their relapse rate

1500
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,296
People who are treated me like

1501
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Conventional

1502
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,344
And you look at

1503
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,368
Like the difference

1504
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,952
And like let's say twenty 25%

1505
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,488
People are dying

1506
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
You know

1507
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,816
Ibogaine has been shown to

1508
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,168
Effective and helpful with opiates in particular that's what's killing the most

1509
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,288
People so I'm open-minded about like these ideas of alternative treatments

1510
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
I hope

1511
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,616
More studying is done about it but

1512
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,200
I don't I don't know if this is helper

1513
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,224
That's what I'm saying

1514
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,624
I don't know I'm inclined to Coronavirus

1515
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,440
Don't think that you run into his orbit unless your account

1516
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,768
Also I don't like this perspective on drugs

1517
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:13,216
Consciously

1518
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
Starbucks

1519
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:19,360
I'm not sure it depends on what they're at

1520
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:29,600
I'm getting this marijuana

1521
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,648
Because

1522
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,728
Backup

1523
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,008
You're just a bad cop

1524
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,568
If he's only talking about weed

1525
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
Fine

1526
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:58,528
I don't think a lot of neighborhood have someone selling drugs at a park

1527
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,832
You hit a deer in a different community

1528
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,112
But at the same time

1529
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,672
The way he ends that you like

1530
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,952
No I haven't seen

1531
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,024
80 people overdosing in my community

1532
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
As if to suggest

1533
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
People are

1534
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,888
And that is really really sucked up

1535
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
Because people are

1536
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,704
People overdosing

1537
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,984
You can look at the stats

1538
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,824
They're very thousands of people every year

1539
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
Various substances

1540
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,152
Okay benzo

1541
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,688
People are dying

1542
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,712
Everyday

1543
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,248
Because of Miss dosage

1544
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Congrats

1545
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:33,088
I had a friend in high school who OD'd on heroin

1546
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,392
Like I know people kids

1547
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,928
Who died of overdoses

1548
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,976
It's not something that's made up to

1549
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Demonized

1550
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,816
Get away with being bad guy

1551
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,608
Right I don't like that

1552
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,888
It really bad

1553
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:49,984
Make me think even more that this new thing cuz I'm right right

1554
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,288
Because the dentist perspective on it then

1555
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,336
I don't know

1556
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,128
Schedule me for a big loop

1557
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Yeah you're you're

1558
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:04,320
I much prefer talking about the soap guy

1559
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,672
Good deal I wish that

1560
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
Seem like

1561
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,816
New policy won't go

1562
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:21,472
We will go to this program I would go in a f****** hard no s***

Get 3 days of free heroin come on

1564
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,080
No cuz you can only get the drugs

1565
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:32,480
You already do I have to get a heroin habit

1566
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,040
This is not in the cards

1567
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:40,928
Problem is that like in the middle of their energy about smoking cocaine

1568
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
In a joint

1569
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,280
Yeah

1570
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
Know that that's

1571
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
Then

1572
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
Alex

1573
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936

1574
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216
He was a kid

1575
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,776
And you talked about them buried

1576
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,312
But it is not

1577
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,920
What these results hyper-masculine

1578
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,200
What these guys are doing

1579
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,504
The same thing that

1580
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,064
Local news

1581
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:14,464
Are your kids playing the b******

1582
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,096
You guys are making this b******* up because you don't understand

1583
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,912
You're just making up weird

1584
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,448
Bulshit

1585
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
Here's the deal

1586
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,336
I know what

1587
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
Happens in this last clip

1588
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,200
Kind of shading a lot of my life

1589
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:38,016
My feelings about this guy

1590
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,296
So conflicted is that like

1591
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
I'm into the

1592
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,720
But I don't like

1593
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
On business

1594
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,024
Anyway

1595
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,560
Business

1596
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
This isn't

1597
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:54,400
I don't know

1598
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,448
I don't know how to set this up

1599
01:24:56,704 --> 01:25:00,032
This is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard against they on Alex's show

1600
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:03,104
That's crazy they're talking about the idea of like

1601
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:08,224
Chastity and abstinence education

1602
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,552

Concentrate

1608
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:38,432
Teaching our kids

1609
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,464
Teaching

When you do this cuz jealousy

1611
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,920
Tell somebody you're attracted to

1612
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,952
Partner because I was married to a lady that was very jealous

1613
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,920
What we should be doing

1614
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:45,760
Is teaching kids how not to behave

1615
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:52,160
She was the wrong person I know what you

1616
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:58,560
She was doing wrong absolutely any responsibility

1617
01:26:58,816 --> 01:26:59,840
Girls are jealous

1618
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,632
That

1619
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,912

Because you're starting down a road where you like

1623
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:16,736
Yeah this tragedy in dope

1624
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:26,720
You know that it takes 6 weeks to get girl done to be jealous dad

1625
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,792
That's just that's just retarded

1626
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:33,632
Notes

I want to start a life coach

1631
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,120
I'm just sitting there listening to this s*** I don't like

1632
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,936
How do you not know what you're saying

1633
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:10,496
Just

1634
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:13,312
Just cuz I cheated on my wife a few times

1635
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:17,152
Really wasn't she I made a man

1636
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:21,504
Get what you're going to be jealous about everything now

1637
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:26,880
I'll give you 6 weeks of training in this first Friday

1638
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:32,000
His whole thing even at this point 2009

1639
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,864
Cuz he was like a cop

1640
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,496
Necessarily believe it

1641
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,288
He's talking about how he would like to

1642
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
Set them up

1643
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
It sounds like

1644
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
It's from a movie

1645
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,712
I don't really I don't

1646
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
He probably did

1647
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:01,184
Start smoking weed and realized

1648
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,208
The better way

1649
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:04,512
For that kind of a person

1650
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,560
To come out of that tree

1651
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,328
Information

1652
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,376
And still be like

1653
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:14,496
Girls naked

1654
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,032
Take hallucinogen

1655
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:20,640
That means to me your hippy dippy Enlightenment moment

1656
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
Is false

1657
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:24,480
And all it is is you weren't cutting it as a cop and maybe

1658
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,904
Should be setting people up but I'm saying

1659
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,720
You didn't want to do that and you wanted a better story

1660
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,304
Anticipatory

1661
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,584
Forecast

1662
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:43,680
I don't know how I would

1663
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:47,520
Figure that out

1664
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:49,312
That brings us to the end of our show

1665
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
Sure

1666
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:56,992
You take a six-week course into whatever you want

1667
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:58,528
Jealousy

1668
01:30:01,856 --> 01:30:06,464
You know one of those basic human emotions that is very very difficult to control

1669
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
I really

1670
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
I do

1671
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:14,144
It's one of the behaviors

1672
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,168
That most

1673
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
Cause

1674
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,216
Buy someone else's Behavior

1675
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,496
You know what I mean

1676
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:21,824
Like I do think it's some people are are pathological

1677
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
Play Jealous

1678
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,224
I think a lot of it

1679
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,248
Can be triggered by

1680
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,552
Someone not being responsive to a person

1681
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:38,208
S*** like that yeah I think I think how much insecurity is how much of your own

1682
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,536
Security is the real cause of your your jealousy

1683
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:45,632
What I mean I don't care

1684
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:49,216
I was trying to say I didn't

1685
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:52,032
That's 1.4 that was trying to say is

1686
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
Number of

1687
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
