1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

4
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:10,144
What's Alex Jones

5
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
Jordan

6
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Jordan

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,920
Spot today I guess we're back at my saddle everything a normal yesterday

9
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
And a big thank you to Dave and Gareth

10
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,320
For filling in your seat

11
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:33,440
The job I would also like to apologize to the audience that apparently that whole spider thing is maybe

12
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,280
Play songs by piece of Medicare conspiracies from

13
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Also maybe it's just a spider sometimes this spider is just a spider it's not always a penis

14
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
It's hard to say in this case

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,592
Said that I didn't I didn't realize that at the tonight buddy

16
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,712
Yeah absolutely you for the bath bombs

17
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:02,112
You are very welcome my friend spoke Irish Bank

18
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
Only be found in Dublin beautiful beautiful Dublin little shape of the Blarney Stone in there

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Each one has a tiny piece of the blade

20
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Dan is I mean my bright spot is obviously

21
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
Quote vacation was a little bit

22
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,824
Longer than usual and that's

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
Because

24
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
My partner

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,944
I is on Mental Health leave from

26
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,528
School and school has started and rather

27
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
For those who don't

28
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
And yeah so

29
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
The amount of nonsense that

30
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,608
Immediately out the gate you know like

31
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
There's only two art teachers

32
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
And one of them now has

33
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
50 kids in her class

34
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
And rather than hire a different art teacher

35
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
The administrative staff hired

36
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
Three more admin people

37
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
So I think we know exactly what their Folk

38
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,200
Admin

39
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,272
Yeah and it ain't it ain't teachers and so

40
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,856
Brightspot Mental Health

41
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,160
During that time.

42
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Was

43
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,584
Revelatory you know it was after after all of the stuff I mean

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,704
Reset for her she she's better than

45
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,752
She did not stop climate

46
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,640
She slept better than I think I've seen her sleeping in a long time and not like

47
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,736
It's not like that you know I slept 12 hours kind of sleep at that healthy

48
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,576
I'm waking up on a good time and I'm happy and I'm doing a good job

49
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
It was

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Beautiful to watch and it just

51
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Filled me with so much

52
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,232
What's Joy

53
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,560
We have left that horrible place where she was happy

54
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm back to Chicago home be abused by everybody but we got Vienna beef hot dog

55
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032
Give me some of that relish

56
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,848
Text no

57
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:02,432
That's a really don't there's an embargo on relics in Ireland

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,016
So Jordan today we have to go over

59
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
There's been a lot that's happened

60
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Incense

61
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,184
We recorded a present-day episode right

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,047
Because you were gone and you know them the trial stuff was no pretty

63
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,119
Dominant es gas caused a clog in the pipe

64
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,399
Yeah it worked

65
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
And I decided that we should do is focus on the thing that I think most people were talking

66
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Sing about

67
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,151
Maybe the highest-profile piece of information and that was

68
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
That last week

69
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,967
On Wednesday

70
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
Alex turned on Trump

71
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,111
Right or 1 would be led to believe that which which

72
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
So this was last Wednesday

73
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
Knots for months

74
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
Not a year ago

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Not a year and 4 months ago not a year and

76
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,655
8 months ago 0 point is made that

77
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:01,055
Turns on Trump.

78
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,151
Teeth 2822 how do you do

79
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
That will present a stop on Friday but

80
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
That seems like something that has an immediate

81
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
Need

82
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Indeed

83
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,279
Yes I want to dress one thing really quick

84
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,119
And that is that there is a widespread perception

85
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,399
That

86
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
I took a week off

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Because you were

88
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
Out of town

89
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,895
This is not true I would give anything for you to take a week off we did not put out any episode

90
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
But I took a week off

91
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,575
But I did not and I have something very special to announce

92
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:46,879
That we are doing another round of butt

93
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,951
I would love to but everybody

94
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,511
I'm really thrilled

95
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,535
With this

96
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,559
Style

97
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,327
This route

98
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,191
This time around my dear friend

99
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Angela Lansbury

100
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
She's designed Ava Squatch has no Heroes button

101
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,151
Everyone who responds will get one of those

102
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
And then

103
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
There's a random

104
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,479
Pick

105
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,879
Yes number of them made by the very talented large

106
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:23,487
I need the number of different buttons themed on Alex things like

107
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,535
Great job is one of them

108
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
And to those are there

109
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Also

110
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
Our dear friend Sarah Shockey

111
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:36,031
From Marty and Sarah love wrestling solutely among other things she designed

112
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
A dreamy creamy summer but

113
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,711
A man screams a 2020

114
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,991
VRBO

115
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Inexorable yogurt

116
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
And there's two important things to bring

117
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
1

118
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
Is that I have learned over the course of doing these button things

119
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,375
That

120
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,935
This is the best way to ruin an inbox

121
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
So I have needed to create a separate

122
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
Email address

123
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
4 buttons

124
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Sprite

125
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
I wanted to get KS buttons at gmail.com

126
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,479
It's taken

127
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
I don't know

128
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,039
Fighters

129
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
You're talking about so

130
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,671
The email address that you need to write to if you want to button

131
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
K F button

132
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
769

133
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,679
That is just how could it not be

134
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
So

135
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
If you want about

136
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,335
Just send an email to that with your address or shipping address

137
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Smelling address

138
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
And I will get those turned around

139
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
Ideally I'd like to get those

140
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Maybe males

141
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,319
And all done by the end of the dream creamy summer

142
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,879
The answer to Celebration of the end eventually

143
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
But I'm not totally committed to that

144
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
Cuz these things

145
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
I don't know I mean we had way more people want them last time that I kind of just going to have those absolutely

146
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,935
I said I would do this again I did it again

147
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:12,799
You did that's what happens when you go out of town

148
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,079
You can't not work

149
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:16,895
Now one more important thing about these button

150
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:17,919
Is very

151
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
There is a desire

152
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
That is a what's your bright spot

153
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Design

154
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Kava bar

155
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
It has a little treasure

156
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
I've made three

157
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,327
Oh my god dammit wanted to make a Willy Wonka thing

158
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,351
There are

159
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
303 golden tickets

160
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
There are only three

161
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
I've only made three

162
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:47,103
And whoever receives them will also receive an ironic punishment of some sort

163
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Know if

164
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:53,503
Do you receive one of those and send us a picture of you with

165
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,807
The botanist

166
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Your face or whatever

167
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
But

168
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
We will make a donation

169
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
Turn to a charity of your choice in your neck the way we're going to walk at it

170
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Punishments necessary just

171
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
Kind of fun something really cool I like

172
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:15,519
I thought it would be silly but I also thought we should just do one

173
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
No we can't

174
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,175
Maybe not getting to the person exactly right so 3 cm

175
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
The Sweet Spot

176
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,783
Yeah what I'm saying yeah

177
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,367
This isn't true at all but I'm going to say it in order to scare people

178
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
I can tell a bootleg a mile away

179
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I will be able to tell if you're trying to run a fast one

180
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,375
Post your butt

181
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
And picture publicly otherwise somebody will get the no no.

182
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
We both know it

183
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:02,111
Let's say hello to some new walks also because we were out of town

184
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,159
The backlog once again

185
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
Sorry

186
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:13,887
Coming from the outer regions of the universe it's damn Tron 0 and Jordan 8

187
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:22,847

Physics

190
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,991
Awesome doctor of physics

191
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
Thank you very much

192
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,855
Dino lot actually

193
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Weird

194
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:36,927
So tell me something about this

195
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,583
Well an electron is not really a thing it's actually kind of a superposition

196
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,655
So you can never know what an electron is until it's more

197
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,447
Considered a field at this point

198
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:52,031
If you put it through a particle accelerator

199
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,079
All right you're going to get all kinds of wild

200
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
I hope I do enjoy that Lily

201
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,735
I love it when Jordan says bananas thank you so much and I'll probably want

202
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,551
I feel like that's okay

203
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,831
Pasta cuz I say it too much

204
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:11,487
No this was initially explained that the that they chose the name cuz they like it when you say banana

205
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,047
That's a very literal bananas thing to say

206
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Indeed

207
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
Just kidding it's as dope as it's ever been thank you so much

208
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,871
Oh I get it it's not cool I thought it was cold

209
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,663
Oh good the open mic

210
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
The bar the bar

211
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,503
Yeah just getting it the dopest it's ever been thinking about you or not

Thank you so much

219
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,079
You're now.

220
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
I'm a policy wonk

221
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
I have

222
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:01,919
Risen above

223
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
A list for me

224
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,671
And then we're going to

225
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,439
Comeback

226
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
And I'm going to

227
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Start the show over

228
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
F*** you

229
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
I got plenty of words for you

230
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
At the end of the day

231
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
F*** you and your new world order

232
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,567
Horse you rode in on

233
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
All your s***

234
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,383
Maybe today

235
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
5 years

236
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,271
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

237
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
And you never see me again

238
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
That's really what I want to do

239
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
Back here again

240
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
I apologize

241
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,255
Yesterday that I

242
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
Was legitimately having break

243
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
I'll be better tomorrow

244
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:57,983
He's not Ono so we start off here with Alex

245
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,263
Being in a mood

246
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,823
About death

247
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:02,847
In the world

248
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
There's a lot of death

249
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Well yeah

250
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:05,919
Recently

251
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,503
I intake on it might be a little off though.

252
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
There's no turning back now.

253
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:19,999
Freedom ranchman

254
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:25,119
We are now inside the operational phase of global

255
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:30,239
Cultural and economic societal collapse

256
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,799
4C population

257
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
That is already

258
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Insurance

259
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,199
I'm sorry what now

260
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,551
In every Western country that has taken the experimental

261
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,087
Injections

262
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
Credible time to be alive

263
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
Solo

264
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,927
You look out

265
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
The claim that all Western countries are seeing record dances just

266
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:56,095
It's not something that Alex can make in any meaningful way

267
00:13:56,351 --> 00:14:02,495
The type of Statistics you need to prove that are available and the only thing you could possibly be working off of his like anecdote

268
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
Little stories that is anti-vax

269
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
They're telling him he's on social media

270
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,407
For that weird Steve guys substack

271
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,223
Yeah I mean what would you say Sarah

272
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
Running tally of death

273
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
/ 12 months

274
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Time.

275
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
That you can compare going back

276
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,951
Several hundred years props to the Black Death

277
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,279
You know what I'm saying like what is a record number compared

278
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
What is a good point he says record

279
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
It's not very specific

280
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,455
The only place he ever pulls vaccine data from a severe

281
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
It's because it's a place where all reported

282
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,367
Have any side effects that anyone experiences after getting vaccinated are reported

283
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Godless

284
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Of whether or not the vaccine cause the side of

285
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:59,839
Up to August 10th 2022 there had been 606 million doses administered

286
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,703
And 15930 reports of people dying after getting the vaccine

287
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
How that have been entered in Tavares

288
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:11,871
That doesn't mean that almost 16,000 people died because of the vaccine but even if it did

289
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,711
Represent p0026 percent of vaccinations

290
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,527
The CDC has identified nine.

291
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,855
But they can causally linked to a vaccine for covid

292
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
And those aren't even the MRNA once those are people who got the Johnson &

293
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
None of this makes any sense stupid

294
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,071
Alex wants

295
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
To be very extreme

296
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
About

297
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
The vaccine

298
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
And I got that sent

299
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,103
Security immediately. And I think there's a good reason I think you'll see as this goes on why this needs to be heightened

300
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
I made as severe as possible

301
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
See how we have midterms

302
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
Oh my God why does everybody why does it keep talkin about

303
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,623
Is there very important

304
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:00,255
The Republicans might want to take over the country

305
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,327
But also maybe they need to take over the country more

306
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
That sounds right

307
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,375
Republicans running around

308
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,751
Wetting themselves with excitement about to take over the country

309
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Even if we get

310
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
More

311
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:19,967
Show me Republican

312
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,247
Yeah yeah

313
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Problem

314
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,391
Good news is this

315
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,975
Ron DeSantis

316
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Bolsonaro

317
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
Viktor Orban

318
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:37,887
And others

319
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,191
I understand what's going on

320
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
You've been ramping up his

321
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,263
Name-dropping of Orban

322
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,823
Definitely happening more lately

323
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
If you're really be clear

324
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,175
We don't have leaders like bolsonaro

325
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,319
Show pictures of robots spoken control over the US

326
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
I feel like if I was DeSantis

327
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
I would be like

328
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Please don't put me in without naot fascist

329
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:09,119
I would like to still slide under the radar for at least a little while before I get to become president and fascist

330
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:19,103
Yeah we'll talk a big talk

331
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,711
Pinpoint that was circling around social media after this episode was that

332
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Alex has turned on Trump

333
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
In favor of dismay

334
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,367
So it's obviously a high praise for him to be put in the same

335
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Category is

336
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:37,279
Or Bob

337
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
So Alex

338
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,583
Does still like Trump

339
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
And that's something that's important to recognize

340
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
Despite what

341
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
The sort of

342
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
Just turned on Trump

343
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Yeah

344
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:55,199
I'll say this I like Donald Trump

345
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Supporting

346
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
Sure that made me kind of pig Henley support him

347
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
Speed

348
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
What

349
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
We had an office

350
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
Is the nightmare scenario if Hillary

351
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:21,311
If this is true and Alex afforded trump.win operation warp speed was happening because of need

352
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,591
To keep Trump in office

353
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,127
Then he was lying to Azadi

354
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:31,039
Alex was super clear that he had like these really high-level back-channel intelligence sources are telling a metropolis

355
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Sporting the vaccines

356
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Trap for the globalist

357
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Handsome

358
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,159
To force our hand to reopen the economy

359
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:40,511
Alex's also said that Trump got tricked into supporting the vaccine development but he

360
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,535
He's never said that it was a

361
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,095
Purely partisan political consideration

362
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:46,399
On his own part to excuse their behavior

363
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
Yeah that's f*****

364
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
Yeah also covid happened

365
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
After Hillary had lost

366
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
The 2016 election

367
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
I've no idea what she's

368
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Appear

369
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,199
It's pretty insane to think that Alex good of acted the way he did an excuse all the s*** that he's

370
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
Completely philosophically again

371
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,343
Just because of a desire to keep Trump in office who I should remind you isn't

372
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
The person who is doing all the stuff Alex is philosophically again

373
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
He supported vaccines and boosters

374
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:17,631
He didn't get Alex in the weirdos back on social media he didn't lock up Hillary he didn't build a wall and kick out all the immigrants

375
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,423
He didn't free Julian Assange

376
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,703
All of the stuff

377
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
Should be fundamentally disqualifying for Alex and yet

378
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
He turned a blind eye because he didn't want a Democrat to win

379
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,359
The presidency

380
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
That's weird I mean

381
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
You feel

382
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,039
And this obviously doesn't apply to him

383
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
Obviously

384
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,391
Text meant for me personally

385
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:42,207
I would feel shame if I was telling you

386
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,743
That by the way

387
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
When I said all of that stuff

388
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,655
I was betraying all of my principles are for no reason other than that

389
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
People made me feel like I

390
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Should

391
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:01,663
I was coming up with elaborate stories to pretend that I wasn't giving up on my my principles

392
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:05,247
Giving up on my principles for several years

393
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,647
I have learned that I was rationalizing giving up my principles for several years you motherfukers I made up

394
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,791
So many Lieutenant Colonels these last five years there were so many people who are fighting against

395
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,375
The Deep State who let me know that it was okay for me to

396
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,655
Betrayal

397
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
What spread

398
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
I don't want to sound too mean but this is pathetic

399
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,615
Alex rejected the opportunity to stand up for all of his principles because he saw possibility that someone who he

400
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
He kind of knew might be able to

401
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Hang on to power

402
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,807
This isn't the sort of thing a person like a who Alex pretends to be would do its what a coward

403
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
I guess what

404
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
It didn't matter

405
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,695
Find still won the 2020 election and here we are

406
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:48,511
Yeah Alex sold himself out for a presidential election

407
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Something is Passover

408
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
Would never let him get away with

409
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,399
And what does he got to show for it

410
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,471
Basically nothing it is it is funny to go back

411
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,263
Can think about all of those posit

412
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,591
Comments from Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi about house

413
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,943
He was ahead of his time and he's sticking to his guns and that's why people didn't like him

414
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
Is because

415
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:10,783
He refused to be a part of the two parties

416
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
System

417
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,343
And then to hear him say

418
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
You know

419
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,928
I'm thoroughly apart of

420
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,952
The two party system

421
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,488
Sad

422
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,048
Quite sad almost

423
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:28,448
As we're recording this I'm seeing on Twitter that it looks like Laura Loomer might win her primary

424
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,800
It's a heavily GOP District so he's probably going to be a thug

425
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:33,824
She's in

426
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,944
Oh my gosh

427
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
Popemobile in the

428
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,040
Like in Congress they should be

429
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,320
Put behind glass

430
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
So everybody can sometimes turn and look at them and go

431
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Look at that

432
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,952
We have what we have pets

433
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh my God now

434
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,048
It could be great

435
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,376
Like Pam to herself to one door of cars

436
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Beautiful

437
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
More

438
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:06,080
More dumbness please

439
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
Because he's getting

440
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,384
Impaled as hell

441
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,456
I am supporting the Santas

442
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,112
Gone for being awesome to me

443
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Unbelievable

444
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
I can also look in his eyes

445
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,096
HD video

446
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,424
Sheila Wilson sharing

447
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
I'm a father

448
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,264
And a husband who loves his children this country

449
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,568
And that he's getting red pilled

450
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
More and more each day

451
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,456
None of these white pills about the future we stand up

452
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm sorry what

453
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Bill blackmail thing is convoluted

454
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:53,696
If you believe that there's a chance you can do something to alter the future then you can't be blackpilled

455
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:56,768
This is just Alex wanted to throw around to language willy-nilly

456
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,048
Haley Miller

457
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
If you will

458
00:22:59,072 --> 00:22:59,840
I won't marry

459
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,680
I think Alex may have some problems with the Santa's that he

460
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:04,704
He doesn't expect

461
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,752
So, because he doesn't really know much about him

462
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:09,056
Is that the s*** he talks right

463
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
Fair amount of s*** I think some of the position

464
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,688
Ocean City holds could end up being a prom

465
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
Alex to

466
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,576
It's fun though that he has a shiny new aspiring patches to to cheerlead for but

467
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,672
Overtime as DeSantis fails to live up to

468
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Comically extremist

469
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,720
Expectation

470
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,768
Also this is just a bummer

471
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
Alex can just support no one

472
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
That's what he's supposed to be

473
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,168
The guy who isn't backing any individual because

474
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,496
He's too busy rooting out corruption on both sides of the aisle

475
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,032
Haven't candidate years

476
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:45,408
Supporting kind of makes our Watchdog things a little false and it's really a repudiation of his entire character

477
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
And

478
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,320
I put Ron Paul on the side he was a perennial Loser on Paul yet

479
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Even if you did win

480
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:57,952
His function is to destroy the thing he was elected into so

481
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Different

482
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,048
If I were Alex I would have gone back to Rand Paul

483
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,120
Or I would have just abandoned drop without using a new hero

484
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:10,752
I have a strong sense of why Alex is doing the thing this way and we'll get it does over the course the episode

485
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:14,336
But it's just so sad to see him go from a guy who's like

486
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,128
I'm above it all to being like

487
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
I'm going to

488
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
Had to my bats with a different team

489
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:22,272
Be kind of problem with

490
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
All of this

491
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
All of it

492
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
Which is one

493
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,160
He's supporting DeSantis for what

494
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
President

495
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:34,816
No for the governor of Florida he's already the governor of Florida

496
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
Define

497
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,168
He has not announced he's running for president

498
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
But even then okay so

499
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,032
He's supporting DeSantis now

500
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:48,384
That doesn't mean anything but he's supporting for president in the 2024 election

501
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,784
But it's 2022 who gives a f*** who you're supporting now

502
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:01,184
It's Freddy's and neither is Trump

503
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,512
Presidential election the world is burning now

504
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:10,912
Because I think that there's a dynamic going on that Alex got bit by the presidential

505
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Election bug

506
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
I'm in 2015

507
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,752
And you do

508
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
Just can't get enough

509
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,872
Like I think of that they've been so successful for him

510
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
In terms of

511
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
Marketing audience

512
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,528
Attracting all kinds of things

513
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088
People get really caught up in it it's kind of

514
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
There's a sporty element to it

515
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Very much and I think he didn't

516
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:35,488
Tap into that much for his entire career

517
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,328
As much as you can clearly for Ron Paul during the early parts

518
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,376
To the GOP Primary where he's involved

519
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
You just got to talk s*** about all the

520
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:45,728
Exactly

521
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,752
Great

522
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
Hooray

523
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Now

524
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
It's it's

525
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
You got to

526
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
In the same way the people started talking about the midterms after the general election you know Alex is jumping the

527
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
Gunn he's overeager

528
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
For the general election

529
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
I don't care

530
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:10,560
And I feel like if you're one of the people who wrote that an infinite number of Alex Jones finally

531
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,840
Turned on Trump stories

532
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,680
If you're talking about that then you're talking about the 2024 election

533
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:17,472
Of which there's no reason to speak

534
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:21,568
Yeah I wish I had a couple I wish I had some name

535
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:24,896
But I did see a couple articles that did a good job of finding out

536
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,944
Maybe not in the lead

537
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,016
Of the story but in the body of the article like

538
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,832
He has done this a bunch of times when he has been speaking with

539
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
Attention or publicity stunt

540
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,048
This a bit but that definitely was not the prevailing

541
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,072
Attitude on

542
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Social media

543
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:50,752
And a number of other media places in the body of the

544
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:55,616
The article and the headline is still this York using his bulshit for your click

545
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
That's what it is

546
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,968
So regardless of how well a job you do in your

547
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
Writing if the top line is bull

548
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:04,576
It's a tough line to draw tough balancing

549
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,856
Maybe some people didn't

550
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Some people

551
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,160
I don't know

552
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
But

553
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,976
This is not

554
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
What

555
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:14,304
It appears

556
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
This is not a

557
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Throwing out Trump

558
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
And bringing into

559
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
And that is the perception that you would get

560
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
If you didn't pay much attention

561
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:24,544
Basic self-preservation

562
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
And

563
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,480
And if we can use the same as leadership

564
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
But

565
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
Talk about is poison vaccines anymore

566
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,608
So yeah he he just

567
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
He's really interested in

568
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,960
I'm getting Trump away from the vaccine

569
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
This is

570
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,824
Solid thrust that Alex's bushing

571
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,920
And gold here man

572
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,712
Fauci

573
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,016
Trump needs to do

574
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
I need to come out all the way and say hi

575
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,936
2nd couple

576
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
He is pig

577
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
What

578
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,968
So you said earlier

579
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:36,992
What do you want

580
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,296
Admit he's wrong

581
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
What

582
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,240
So we can stop poisoning the newborn babies in a six-month-old

583
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Everybody

584
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,312
Public Schools all over blue cities

585
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,784
I think he's editorializing a little bit on bolsonaro's comments but

586
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:17,440
I apologized after he went to the hospital 2/5

587
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,464
The one that's

588
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,792
Just so you know he's got his head up his ass I think he had an impact

589
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,352
Bow for a while and then they removed it

590
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
And then he was anti-vax

591
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,424
I think that's how it went

592
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
So Trump is pigheaded and what-have-you but Alex. Alex said

593
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
Earlier that he supported Trump

594
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,104
Because he was being pigheaded

595
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
It's an interesting point

596
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,968
Shouldn't that make him support Trump further

597
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,344
Nah okay

598
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,184
Big headed but if you're headed in the right direction

599
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
Then everything would be fine right

600
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,144
Alex is saying I'm a big baby when and where please listen to me

601
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Achoo children over Trump

602
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
Can I get sucked into politics

603
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Democrats

604
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,456
Again

605
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:12,736
What does it come out

606
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
Against

607
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,832
Children

608
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
To admit there's major problems

609
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Because

610
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,400
I don't want

611
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
Kamala Harris

612
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,008
Call Momma organelles

613
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,544
What

614
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
I cannot

615
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,848
Support Trump

616
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:42,176
Killing all these people in maiming others

617
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,040
Baby continues to do this and I think we should open the phones up today on this subject

618
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Here's what's going on

619
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,392
Experience throughout the course

620
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Episode

621
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
Panda Santa

622
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
They're pros and cons with bow

623
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,936
Santa's he's got a lot of policy positions that the audience wants to hear and most importantly he's been a strong opponent

624
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,496
The vaccines or at least that's the way he's allowed himself

625
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
Be portrayed

626
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:12,128
Call the flipside the scientist is not going to give Alex the opportunity to pretend to be his friend

627
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,480
He's an actual politician who knows better than to make that kind of an association

628
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,016
Going to be crippling in the long-term View

629
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
He's too young

630
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
He has a career ahead

631
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,464
Conversely Trump is fine letting weirdos into the Inner Circle and Alex has the best shot of staying relevant

632
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Los Altos bodies with Rodger Stone so the connection with Trump there is

633
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,120
Pre-boarding

634
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,680
They probably not talk anymore

635
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,008
Well it's more likely for Alex to get some sort of

636
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:44,128
Pardon or whatever should that be derived from Trump as opposed to DeSantis

637
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,176
That is true

638
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:46,944
No

639
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,736
Things Alex could be pardoned

640
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:54,880
For by Trump I mean at this point you want a preemptive pardon from the president for whatever there's a

641
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:59,744
There's a good chance you're committing a crime just by being around just in case

642
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,304
Trump supports vaccines

643
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:07,424
This is a big deal because Alex is already into the grass of Lee anti-vax and they don't like Trump

644
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
As much because of it

645
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,776
Ceases to be a problem if Alex can just

646
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Convince dropped

647
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Baby, if you back

648
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,848
That would be a

649
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,384
Much easier fix the trying to get

650
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,176
Infowars guy

651
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,992
I think that's what this whole pageant is been about

652
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:25,088
Over the course of this episode and then this video that Alex puts out later

653
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,368
There were two goals

654
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
He's trying to threaten Trump

655
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Like you did with Rogue

656
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,256
By saying that he's going to eat

657
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,560
A pig

658
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,144
As much free publicity as possible from Rubes

659
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
To feel like they're actually dunking on

660
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,592
Probably an element here that he soft pitching to the audience the actual idea of becoming intuitive

661
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:51,200
Santa's fully the audience response that you sent your it if they were to take some

662
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
The Feelers out there

663
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,648
Right and also you've got plenty of time for the election that is several years away

664
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,440
Certainly do

665
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:07,840
You have plenty of time let's put that in the news Alex changes his support for candidate who is that yet running for president

666
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,632
Another guy who's not here

667
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:16,544
Another thing I want to point out here is that runs lipkowski this Twitter account

668
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,848
Clip of Alex saying that he was supporting the scientist

669
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:23,200
Which as I Was preparing this episode had over 2,500 retweets

670
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
By almost 900,000

671
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Some people

672
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
This clip is

673
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Inaccurate

674
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:34,976
And it's actually manipulative lie edited in order to present an image that Ron wants to convey as opposed

675
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
Go to what's actually being said by Alex

676
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,304
And is episode

677
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,352
His clip entirely omits

678
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:45,728
The part where Alex is clearly saying the problem

679
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,544
I think that's a major component of what Alex's sink

680
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:54,688
It'd be one thing if this was actually a straight up episode where Alex is like I'm done with Trump let's just go with the saint

681
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,736
But that's not what's going on

682
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:01,600
If you posted an abbreviated clip of that and it captured what I'm saying

683
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
By every said I was going to

684
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,160
Shove

685
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:10,560
DeSantis up his dirty a******* that's a whole different story cuz he's never done something like that but

686
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:16,960
Accounts like this Farm attention and social media Cloud by posting things that Their audience wants

687
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,728
To hear

688
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
This a Ron fella knows that they're there is a pretty solidly Democratic voter base that follow him

689
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,176
They don't give them a sense of schadenfreude

690
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
If you hear the trumpet lost is most

691
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,736
Zealous and rabbits

692
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
Sporter

693
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,040
Answer this is the clip its provider

694
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
He's off really well

695
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:37,184
Actually conveying what Alex was saying wouldn't be as emotionally appealing to

696
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,744
To the people who he's hoping we'll Retreat this because

697
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,048
It's complicated and as much as a pain

698
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
And we can save it

699
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Makes sense

700
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
Alex is actually pretended to turn on Trump

701
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,752
Far more Extreme Ways in the pasta this isn't even really

702
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
Attractive abandoned

703
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,848
It's very clear that this serves to possible purpose

704
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,664
Get Trump to be anti-vax so the ship

705
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,224
Can Be steady or create a paper trail that

706
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,272
What can you use as a rationale to full

707
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:04,320
We detach from Trump later when he needs

708
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:11,744
I feel like the story that I'm missing from all of these people is

709
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,144
Shame I would like more shame for how many times I've seen Ron filipkowski embedded in a

710
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,008
F****** Guardian article on the Rolling Stone or whoever is embedding him

711
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:29,408
Feel shame why doesn't anybody feel shame anymore damn I kind of understand the reason why

712
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,248
I think that a lot of these Outlets don't have the time

713
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,832
I get the wrong Clips you don't answer their

714
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,696
I feel like that is a legitimate excuse you know if you don't have time to do a good job

715
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:45,792
Do a shity job and then acts like it's fine because you don't have time

716
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:46,816
You make a point

717
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,936
I really resent people who act like this Twitter account do because it's essentially doing the same thing that Alex

718
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,592
Hit me up if you just say Alex chose DeSantis over Trump or make implications that the rats are leaving the sinking ship

719
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,688
That's essentially the equivalent of Alex giving a headline and then do you know

720
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Party here

721
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,296
It's the narrative up that they want to attach to the headline

722
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,112
Show based on what they want the headline to me

723
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:15,232
But then you're saying that the people who prepared him are doing the exact same thing Alex does

724
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:19,840
Quit skipping that lesson knowingly perhaps

725
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,864
Maybe you put that

726
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,240
I don't want to I don't want to belabor the point but there's a reason I'm stressing this

727
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,288
We're going to get to in here

728
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:35,456
Little bit after this episode couple days later Alex put out a video that supposed to be an emergency message

729
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,248
To drop explaining that he was

730
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
Trying to get his attention and get him to ditch

731
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
The vaccine

732
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
This

733
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,440
Is completely in line with a message that Alex was putting out on his show on Wednesday but

734
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,768
It is not in line with the narrative that Ron was selling on Twitter

735
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,840
In the video that almost a million people watch

736
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
And so when Alex without his emergency message

737
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:56,448
This

738
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,056
Video is kind of an opportunity for Ron to incorporate it with a narrative that keys

739
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Constructed

740
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:02,848
He posted

741
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:04,896
35-second clip from the video with this

742
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,176
Quote

743
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:09,760
Getting some blowback after he announced Thursday it was

744
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,416
He was back into Santa's over Trump now has an emergency message to Trump saying he was simply too

745
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
Disposition on the vaccines

746
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
With some tough love

747
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,680
It very well may be that Alex got some blowback from the audience but I'd be surprised if it was very severe or if it would

748
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
Even matter at all in changing Alex is mine

749
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
If you gauge

750
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
The temperature of his audience

751
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:37,408
From user comments on his website and callers they are really that opposed to moving past dropping

752
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
This isn't really appealing option

753
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:40,736
For the extreme right-wing

754
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:45,600
Making that pivot would likely only cost Alex's proximity to power and probably

755
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
A couple gas

756
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
Might stop coming on

757
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,440
Rodger that might get iffy

758
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,000
Sorry I don't I don't know how

759
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,072
I don't either I don't know if that's a bridge that out

760
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Can't afford the bird

761
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,680
Roger's already on Mike lindell's Network it's not like

762
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:03,264
Intimately entwined anymore

763
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
Right I mean

764
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
It's it's just one of those things where

765
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,688
Why why are we why are we doing this

766
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,296
It's feels like everybody is making poor choices simultaneously

767
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,624
In defiance of the very obvious good choice

768
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
It's terrible

769
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
I think that a lot of people don't realize they

770
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,488
The game that

771
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:24,256
It's being played

772
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:27,840
Right they don't realize what they're playing with a shady character

773
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,120
Also it's

774
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Makes sense

775
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,544
For the people not to give a s*** if he abandons Trump because we've already done cuckoo bananas in the White House

776
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
No I'm I'm sure that Lee

777
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,640
More than enough people are like

778
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
What if we tried somebody

779
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,200
With a Pacer

780
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,224
Check level of

781
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:49,344
So Alex knows that there's not really that much of a consequence

782
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
Cuz he's done reply

783
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,720
Has he gets more attention

784
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,400
A couple days later

785
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
Is incongruent with the message

786
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,728
Message that he was putting out on his show

787
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,752
And that's not true

788
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
And this is a huge problem

789
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:12,640
In order to explain why I need to play the 30 second section of Alex's video

790
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,200
That Ron posted this is from that emergency message

791
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
He won't

792
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
What

793
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Contrary

794
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,496
I understand

795
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
What Alex is saying is true

796
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,016
If people got the impression that Alex was abandoned

797
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:55,648
Drop and they took him up on that challenge of listening to the 30 minutes the first 30 minutes of this show from Wednesday

798
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,952
They would come away from that with it

799
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,280
Conclusion that the clip they were shown on Twitter actually was out of context

800
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,072
And it didn't capture what Alex is saying

801
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,960
The only real problem I have with what Alex and saying there is that Ron filipkowski is not the corporate media

802
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,520
The danger in this is that Alex

803
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,080
It's always says that he's being taken out of context

804
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
Text any basically never is

805
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:22,528
Actually is taking Alex out of context and he's running a serious risk of giving people the reason to increase their low

806
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
Level of trust and Alex

807
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,088
And decrease

808
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,624
Their trust in

809
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,928
Critical voices of the extreme right

810
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
Right

811
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
He is being taken out of context to your so who's the

812
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:35,840
To say if he's actually being taken in context about all that Sandy Hook stuff

813
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
You know

814
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
Hey

815
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,728
Let's do a bad job we don't have time for a good job come on

816
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:48,128
Playing Alex's game you expose people to Alex in a way that if they look into these clips any deeper

817
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
They'll Come Away with

818
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
The conclusion that Alex is right and they took him out of context

819
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,528
And this isn't a small deal either

820
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,880
These videos get hundreds of thousands of views on Twitter and spread all over the

821
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:05,792
As you've already mentioned many news outlets don't have the resources to hunt down these video clip so you'll often see them repost

822
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,816
It's from his account

823
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,632
And by proxy they are taking Alex out of con

824
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,424
He's dangerous

825
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,056
And more of note it's a pretty predictable system you could game if you wanted to do if your Alex

826
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:22,176
Now there's a second thing I need to point out in that this is a short clip Ron is taking

827
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:22,944
Prominent

828
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
This run this emergency video

829
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,600
Is approximately 5 minutes until the video that Alex put out

830
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
The video does involve Alex restating that he's trying to play hardball to get Trump to go anti-vax basically

831
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:41,376
I'm really leaving this time I totally that's fair

832
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
That's not what the

833
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Videos about

834
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,240
The first five full minutes

835
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,568
Breakdown of Alex's main covid vaccine

836
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,336
Pinpoint

837
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
Basically he's distilling it down to like

838
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,943
He's pretending to have a briefing for Trump

839
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Giving talking points

840
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
Alright

841
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,039
First 5 minutes

842
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
Of this 9-minute video is

843
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
With the last two minutes

844
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Commercial

845
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,671
So

846
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
Actually is

847
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Is Alex

848
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,071
Clarifying

849
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
And providing the talking points

850
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:13,887
Should Trump

851
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
Watch that video

852
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,495
Why are we even posting it anyways if it's

853
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Theoretically

854
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:24,895
A message to someone who will never in a million years watch it

855
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,455
One capitalize on the

856
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:33,855
Media attention that he got out of trending for supposedly turning on 2nd

857
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:39,231
Alexandra video claims that some people that he knows who no-trump were like a f****** deal

858
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
I do believe that he emailed

859
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,191
The framing this video is being Alex

860
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:53,823
Backpedaling only serves to strengthen the original out-of-context frame and it was crafted by Ron's original

861
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:59,711
Innocent he's putting out information that just lives in a false reality that he's designed

862
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
For his audience

863
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,527
Whether intentionally or not

864
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,671
It's 1:30 probably thinks it's benign like this reality and information but it's a bad idea

865
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,511
Even if you accepted this series of poorly contextualize clips

866
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,559
Are being put out as a result of a

867
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,327
Honest

868
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:20,447
Innocent mistake is not

869
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,215
Good

870
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,799
It's one that plays directly into the games that the people he

871
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
Discovering use

872
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
And responsibility to do better

873
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,151
Because

874
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,455
There is a massive audience

875
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,295
That is viewing this content and as you pointed out

876
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
8 something

877
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
It's being used as a resource

878
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,623
For larger media

879
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
And

880
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
I

881
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,303
I don't know like I have a really tough time with it because I see this stuff come up all the time

882
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,375
I see these clips all the time from his account being

883
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,263
I don't know enough about a number of the things

884
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,359
To know if he's out of contact

885
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,151
That I can see these

886
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
And I can say that's not fair

887
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,479
Alex sucks

888
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,575
But that's not fair it should be required

889
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
For everyone who posts

890
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,415
Anything about Alex Jones

891
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,023
To listen to the first how not to cover Alex Jones episode because

892
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,887
Over time we've done several hundred how not to cover Alex Jones episodes

893
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
And I feel like we're back in the same

894
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,775
Yeah it does it mean unforced errors are made a bun

895
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:32,639
It's unfortunate I think it's because people think that

896
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
They're dealing with

897
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,759
Something that is not as dangerous

898
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,527
As it is

899
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:44,159
You know what I mean like I think that there is a blase nature that is taken

900
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,951
Towards coverage of this

901
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,487
Like haha

902
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,583
You lost your your cheerleader guy haha and it's it's

903
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,679
I can understand how it's emotionally gratifying

904
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Do do that

905
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:03,103
No we're never going to defeat the dopamine Russia feeling good for 2 seconds and then going back to you

906
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,383
Your day

907
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,943
Flip side of it is

908
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,223
State like

909
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
Say you know there's

910
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
A million people who watches video

911
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
Let's say

912
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,623
I don't know one

913
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
1%

914
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
Go

915
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,999
Look into it and see that Alex was taken out of context

916
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,303
That's not what's actually all about

917
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,167
What how many people have you misled down a terrible path

918
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,775
Even though they're ninety-nine percent who don't look into anything you have just given

919
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Useless information

920
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:34,079
Into that isn't back yet

921
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,407
Yeah one of my favorite things not it's not a

922
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,431
Like it's a waste

923
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:44,831
One of my favorite things about the the the media whatever that maybe you know the

924
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,135
Is that

925
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,183
They after Trump was elected

926
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Did they took stock

927
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Cover themselves

928
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,791
They realize that they to play depart

929
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,607
In destroying the America that we used to know

930
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,631
And electing Trump

931
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
And then they change their model to

932
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,471
Weight did they do that

933
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,519
Island View

934
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Box braids

935
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,103
Anyway

936
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,127
I just think

937
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,759
Do this maybe just had a couch to do better

938
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,039
Anyway

939
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
Look Trump

940
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Has made some improvement

941
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
I don't know okay

942
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,023
What's what is that

943
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Around

944
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
All the wrestler

945
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,727
All the rest of the way.

946
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Okay

947
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Okay

948
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,687
Around

949
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,247
The opposite direction

950
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
Of the poisoning of these six month old babies

951
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:05,471
Globalist

952
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,567
Sure welcoming in immigrants with open arms right

953
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,175
People on both sides

954
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:20,575
Is he really looking for more of a an extra hundred and sixty degrees to get

955
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:26,975
Am different clockwise angle because you don't want to go.

956
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:32,863
The important thing to remember is that Alex is saying like

957
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:33,887
You're doing some good

958
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,471
Stop chewy the messages Trump doing some good stuff

959
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,751
You just need to stop it

960
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
With a vaccine

961
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,311
My audience will not

962
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Tolerate

963
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,127
You not being a ex

964
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,271
Because under you and operation warp speed that's what brought these vaccines about

965
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
YouTube

966
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,111
Except that it was wrong

967
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Exactech course

968
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,951
It's too big of a hurdle for you just to ignore

969
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:02,047
You're shutting up about

970
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,351
But you need to go the other way

971
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,423
How about the new headlines for this are

972
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Alex

973
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Attempts

974
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,543
Carrot and stick towards person not paying attention to him

975
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:17,151
We give him more attention for it if what the headline was like inside jokes

976
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,527
Cross like Alex tries to give Trump the Krogan treatment

977
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,879
Alex re-litigate 911 with Rogan

978
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,487
Synthesis better than Trump

979
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,255
But I

980
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,839
Kind of hear this statement almost as a like

981
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,143
You hear this Trump

982
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,191
Absolutely

983
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,215
DeSantis

984
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
Is

985
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
Over the top

986
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,311
What he's doing this is

987
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
Presidential material

988
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,407
This is what Trump should be like

989
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,991
And he's doing it now

990
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
And

991
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
We have someone

992
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,087
That is better

993
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
Trump

994
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Way better than Trump

995
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,159
I want Trump

996
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,767
But I'm not going to sit here and hold my breath

997
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
But

998
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,095
Is opening the door

999
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,375
If it does change

1000
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
My breath

1001
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:15,775
Making Trump erdogan trump

1002
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:22,175
He's a complimenting DeSantis cuz he's trying to f*** Trump like that's what's Happening Here is even using some of the same rhetoric

1003
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:25,503
Call flourishes gourds

1004
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
For what

1005
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,999
President-trump

1006
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:45,471
Encourage

1007
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,543
If you continue

1008
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
Check

1009
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
Coming after

1010
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Going Through Hell

1011
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:04,415
My conscience

1012
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:06,207
All these children

1013
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:09,791
You're stupid evil warp speed

1014
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,839
But you got roped into

1015
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:17,215
He's just trying to escalate this negative threat on the other side in order to be like

1016
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
It's keratin

1017
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,031
Temperature

1018
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,079
Yeah this is this is pathetic

1019
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:27,455
This is stupid also I forgot about that I forgot that he still believes in that

1020
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
Trump election

1021
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,551
How can you switch to another candidate

1022
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:32,575
If you think

1023
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:37,695
But the entire election is is a f****** fake and that Trump should legitimately be

1024
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:43,327
And if that's the case then Trump shouldn't be allowed cuz it'll be a third term

1025
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,119
And you're supposed to be the tip of this

1026
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:51,519
Beer you should be the people not even talkin about candidates usually like we need to continue the fight to

1027
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,687
Back in the office know he theoretically

1028
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:03,039
You've already got a got a warrior on that front lindell's keeping the fire

1029
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:07,647
Regional book vaccines

1030
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
That get them

1031
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,975
Metallic spruce

1032
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,767
And a very succinct

1033
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,095
Look at this Jack Purcell been retweeted

1034
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:17,375
Patricia

1035
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Polish

1036
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,007
Look at this this is a real tweet

1037
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,079
I just had my fourth dose after receiving

1038
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,919
I just had my fourth dose

1039
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Covering

1040
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Three months

1041
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,807
Chad my fourth

1042
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Josh

1043
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
After recovering

1044
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:40,159
3 months from

1045
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,719
Actively having covid-19

1046
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,743
Do you have the

1047
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,047
Regard

1048
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Read it again

1049
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,423
I just had my fourth dose

1050
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,959
After recovering

1051
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
Actively having covid-19

1052
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,103
What's the Stockholm syndrome

1053
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,127
Which of the Mind Control

1054
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,919
I'm very happy

1055
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
To be boosted

1056
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Thanks science

1057
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,599
If you murdered logic here doesn't see what's being done

1058
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
Thanks science

1059
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
Like she's just Trump

1060
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,095
Can you imagine like an actual news Outlet doing

1061
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,887
Any kind of coverage of like

1062
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,519
Someone tweeted that they got vaccinated and they didn't get covid-19 facts

1063
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,079
Haha I mean

1064
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:35,199
Here's the even weirder part letting you know this is a real person's account this is like

1065
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
This is like 1920s

1066
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,783
Newspapers

1067
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:43,647
Ed and including the part where he has a misogynist comment about her

1068
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,951
Hey listen sweetheart like that.

1069
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:52,351
That's somebody writing in the New York Times in the twenties like this lovely young woman walking through this

1070
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:58,495
I got a vaccine yesterday for polio in this sweetheart is looking good like

1071
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,543
It's insane

1072
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
So this next clip Alex

1073
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
Precedes

1074
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
Talking

1075
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,991
He's still sort of responding to this tweet

1076
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,343
I don't know I don't know

1077
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
That's it should be

1078
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:23,327
That was the funny thing about listening to David Garrard other show that they were reacting to it

1079
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:25,887
Episode we did especially when the prayer happen

1080
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,447
Has like this doesn't even

1081
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,543
Phaser setting

1082
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:37,919
We're heroin Jody yeah yeah there was something really

1083
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:44,319
Sort of I was taken aback by that because I had forgotten even that like people

1084
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:50,463
Normal people who are exposed stories on their own podcast

1085
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
Is this is still surprising to some people

1086
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,863
So why is Alex's talking you're not even going to be

1087
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,703
A cross coming in will you be able to handle it

1088
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,775
For some reason Alex's brain think so

1089
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,615
Maybe a documentary that he seen about sex

1090
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,711
I believe he's talking about hookers on the point

1091
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,503
Okay

1092
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:16,319
Alright I just leave

1093
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,343
Attracted

1094
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
Rambling

1095
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:19,903
About hookers on the phone

1096
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
The show

1097
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,743
It was on

1098
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:26,047
1567 years ago about

1099
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,143
Play Pandora dish

1100
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:34,751
Prostitutes cigarette Burns all over and broken arm and leg beat up by

1101
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,639
He's in the hospital room in the pit

1102
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,407
Thomas and

1103
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,087
The sex slaves

1104
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,623
Mother

1105
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Baby

1106
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:59,839
He says the pimp I'm going to get better I'm going to get back up on my feet I'm going to get back down the street baby please don't

1107
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Oh baby

1108
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:07,519
Start interviewing the pimp and then go how do you treat a Rico's I treat her bad that's how she likes

1109
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,871
How much do you pay

1110
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,967
I might give her a bucket of chicken

1111
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:23,135
And that's the American people

1112
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,159
Okay

1113
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:28,767
4 Shots

1114
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,327
She's been sick for months after the first few shots

1115
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
This shot was a hundred percent of

1116
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,519
Gives you the disease

1117
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,591
But she can't help it

1118
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
For prostitute

1119
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
With broken arm and leg

1120
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
Cigarette Burns all over

1121
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:55,647
Hair falling out

1122
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
Beautiful woman

1123
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,255
And then comes the swaggering arrogant devil

1124
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
From the mother

1125
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:09,727
Hey baby I'm sorry I'm so let you down I'm going to get back on the street right now soon as I get better

1126
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:13,055
Not good

1127
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
Christ in the mother looks

1128
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,247
What have you done

1129
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,783
To my baby

1130
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,903
What have you done to my baby

1131
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,743
He said shut up you old

1132
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,351
I can't believe I missed you and Michelle first of all

1133
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,959
Is really getting into the

1134
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,775
Embody the character

1135
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,311
Yeah that was a method actor

1136
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,383
Little problematic

1137
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:53,759
He said pimp and shot so many times they both lost meeting to me yeah

1138
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:54,783
I think

1139
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,599
In my time I watch

1140
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
Hookers on the point

1141
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,415
It was titillating when I was

1142
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:05,791
I think this is a

1143
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,583
That but I don't I don't remember this

1144
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,471
Particularly I only recognize this from other times Alex has told this story and played these characters

1145
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,895
I really don't like how much he

1146
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
Minor like

1147
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,199
Complement

1148
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
The Pimpin

1149
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
You know what I'm saying like

1150
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,575
In comes the swaggering devil

1151
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:34,975
But the swaggering devil is kind of a handsome devil

1152
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,327
Compliment the voice in the voices not a a like

1153
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,375
He's he's trying to be like

1154
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,143
Cool

1155
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,239
I did say that fortunate I don't appreciate it I wanted to keep that clipping

1156
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:49,567
Full just to get the really deep

1157
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:52,639
Experience of how long this goes on

1158
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,199
I don't think Ron filipkowski his is posting that

1159
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,479
No Maybe

1160
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,087
And how he is

1161
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
Maybe

1162
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,135
Spreading some b*******

1163
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:05,695
About how the SBI planted bombs

1164
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
On January 6th

1165
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,791
Totally

1166
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
Richarlison

1167
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,631
Is taking it into the danger

1168
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
Call Everybody's happened

1169
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:23,359
I should point out this is right after he came in from break to the danger zone so it was

1170
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
Alisyn Camerota

1171
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,855
Ethiopia's Prime

1172
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,135
Play bombs away.

1173
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
January

1174
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
Is it just came out

1175
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,511
I planted the bomb

1176
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Call coming out so

1177
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,103
It's an incredible time

1178
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Eli

1179
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:03,039
This is unfortunate bulshit for Alex to be spreading because on August 23rd the day we're recording this episode The

1180
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:08,159
Final two defendants in the witmer kidnapping case were found guilty by a jury of conspiracy to kidnap

1181
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:14,815
Adam Fox and Berry Croft jr. are definitely going to jail and their defense try to use the entrapment argument

1182
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Which was unsuccessful

1183
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:20,191
This was their second trial after the first one in April resulted in a hung jury

1184
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:24,799
Alex's sightings at in this episode unaware that a few days later they be

1185
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:31,711
Two other accused conspirators were acquitted and two others plead guilty so honestly doesn't seem like this whole thing fell apart at all

1186
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,479
Call actually

1187
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,039
Quite the opposite

1188
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:41,695
Something along those lines also the prosecution alleges that Croft actually made some explosives using mortar

1189
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
Michelle's

1190
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,999
From fireworks that were packed

1191
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
Shrapnel

1192
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,559
Nothing else says any connection

1193
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,839
Into reality whatsoever

1194
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,887
Can you imagine like

1195
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,191
Carlson saying this s*** is actually

1196
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
Absolutely insane

1197
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:56,287
Like there's this is been normalized so much

1198
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:59,615
But can you imagine if a major News Network

1199
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Came on

1200
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,455
Shortly after JFK was assassinated like

1201
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
Okay

1202
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Sure

1203
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,063
It could be that guy but maybe

1204
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,647
FBI murder jayapal

1205
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
And then everybody would just be like

1206
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,719
Interesting point

1207
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:15,743
Or

1208
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,511
Eunos

1209
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,815
Maybe JFK wasn't even real

1210
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:25,983
It was that it was a paper mache cutout Brian JFK June

1211
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,591
Actually is an immortal JFK absolutely

1212
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:32,895
More sense than anything I'm getting an update from Twitter

1213
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,943
It looks like lunar might have loss

1214
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
The primary

1215
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:43,135
She look like she was a head for a bit but it looks like you might have lost it all breathe a little bit easier

1216
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:45,439
Don't know there might be a recount so who knows

1217
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:50,047
Anyway let's get back to some actual news here I was reading some headlines there

1218
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:52,863
Snackeez

1219
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
But it's okay

1220
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
I just had my fourth dose

1221
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:06,943
Recovering 3 months

1222
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,247
Actually having troubles after the first shot

1223
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
Doesn't work tall I think science

1224
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,695
Mileage of a tweet

1225
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:23,071
Don't really have a conflict of interest really

1226
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:25,887
She didn't work for Pfizer she work for a Consulting

1227
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,703
Confirm called skdk one of his clients

1228
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471
Was Pfizer

1229
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:36,127
She also was the Obama White House communications director for awhile in 2009 is working a shitload of democratic

1230
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:39,711
It's campaign I think I remember her

1231
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,551
But maybe it's a big deal but not the way I look

1232
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Cuz making it

1233
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,391
Alex doesn't know the basics of the story he's covering but he's

1234
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
Something you can work with

1235
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Supposed

1236
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,999
It's a gas has a dunk

1237
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
For him

1238
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
This is just dumb

1239
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
There's nothing going on

1240
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,631
Fine with considering that a conflict of interest

1241
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
If we also

1242
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Considered Obama appointing like

1243
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,703
Geithner

1244
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:05,311
As treasury secretary a conflict of interest like you should not even

1245
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,847
Start to unpack Trump

1246
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:11,455
Appointments so let's leave that alone talk about the culture in Washington

1247
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,039
Let's go for it

1248
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:17,599
That's a different conversation

1249
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
So Alex

1250
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,207
Does take some calls

1251
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
And the first one who comes in

1252
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
Suggest

1253
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Maybe we get MTG on the tick

1254
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,799
Got a lot of legal problems right now

1255
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:38,079
5

1256
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
He's getting older

1257
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:43,967
Is that a real real good record of endorsing candidates

1258
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,271
You should graciously step

1259
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Decide

1260
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
Endorsed

1261
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,367
MTG

1262
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,135
The Running Man

1263
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Vice president

1264
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
I love it

1265
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,767
Trump

1266
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,679
You know I don't know whether it's

1267
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,215
Is this family

1268
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
All weather Heating

1269
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,287
Just don't listen to people I don't know but

1270
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
This is way out of

1271
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,079
For him

1272
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:11,871
The whole message

1273
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
Vaccines

1274
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,407
By doing this

1275
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,967
Beautifully said anything else

1276
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:21,343
The prosecutor in the judge or Not Human and your trial age

1277
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,399
Regular suggestion of something that is pretty

1278
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:39,519
Crazy 8 in the White House

1279
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,055
And Then followed up with

1280
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,591
The judge is a replicant

1281
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,991
Should really disqualified the earlier

1282
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:53,087
I honestly I'm I'm

1283
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,671
Willing to believe it's possible he was joking

1284
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
But I don't know

1285
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:01,279
Xactware in the where in the danger zone if you will

1286
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:03,327
Joking about whether or not someone is a rep

1287
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
Yeah

1288
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,191
I think you can tell from that call he is not

1289
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
Someone who is like

1290
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,031
Do you have to stick

1291
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:18,175
Side is pretty hardcore let's get rid of trump

1292
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,711
So here's another caller

1293
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,039
How you doing just total inside on

1294
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,087
Or Trump in the back

1295
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
Maxine are you there

1296
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
I am sir

1297
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:34,047
Listen to want but I've never heard this brought up a red Anthony fauci

1298
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
I mean

1299
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,375
Kennedy's Book on a

1300
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
Fauci

1301
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
If he expresses in there

1302
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,031
Trump took a million dollars from

1303
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:49,919
Never heard anybody bring that up

1304
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:56,319
Yeah why didn't you bring that up and I like seems like now that you're talking about a conflict of interest for a needed done it really seems to be

1305
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,623
To bring this one up right

1306
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
It's just

1307
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,231
There's that fascinating thing that Alex does with his awareness

1308
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:07,327
You know like all of a sudden it becomes okay to

1309
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,143
Admit the reality that everyone knows

1310
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,167
Is there like

1311
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,727
This guy saying why doesn't anyone bring this up

1312
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
The pointed question

1313
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,103
That is not isn't there

1314
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
About this

1315
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:24,223
This isn't like his 2020 campaign this is 2016 right like this is

1316
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:30,879
And Alex hope presentation has been like Trump funded his own campaign spent Millions

1317
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:36,767
Self-funded take money from these other interested that's why he was such a straight shooter

1318
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
Hey this is

1319
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
Totally

1320
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,863
An indictment of Alex's

1321
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
False presentation that he's had four

1322
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,167
For five years

1323
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:46,239
Alex is so casually like yep

1324
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
He did and not only that it was more

1325
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,383
Such proof

1326
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,663
Or demonstration

1327
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
That what he's doing is

1328
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,271
Gatekeeping this negative information from his Auto

1329
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,855
That's pretty sad

1330
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:06,975
And they themselves should be really bummed out about everything that they think

1331
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
Personally

1332
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,535
If they are not

1333
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
Capable

1334
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,583
For one

1335
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,143
Of applying these criticisms

1336
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,679
Retroactively to Trump

1337
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,959
From the very start

1338
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:17,983
You know like

1339
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,335
Oh I don't know why he's being pigheaded maybe he just doesn't listen to people

1340
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
Well

1341
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Go back

1342
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,151
Go back in time

1343
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
Let's go back

1344
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,479
Do that earlier time. We were all so young

1345
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:32,063
Maybe he wasn't listening to people then do not under

1346
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,111
Yep

1347
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,927
So here's something slightly positive about Trump

1348
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:41,279
Trump at this time is working to boost the primary candidates be

1349
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
Fishmaster following

1350
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:49,215
Which would also help DeSantis whether he runs as VP or runs his

1351
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
Accident because

1352
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,543
It's going to help create

1353
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:59,455
America First agenda no matter what we know

1354
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,551
That's why I'm still behind him

1355
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Still behind them

1356
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,647
So ravenous positive but the audience

1357
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:11,487
Kind of like wishy-washy they don't really care but also there's mother

1358
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:18,143
We don't really care who brings it to us

1359
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,959
Unless it's Marjorie Taylor Greene then maybe we'll make him

1360
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
Butts

1361
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,031
Because other things about Trump

1362
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,055
Apparently Alex

1363
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,615
Just decided not to tell his audience

1364
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:28,639
Hello Alex

1365
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,943
Courage the United

1366
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,735
Is to realize that Donald Trump

1367
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
And his

1368
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,295
His family are working for the world

1369
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Economic

1370
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,879
That's why we're not going to get leadership

1371
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
Donald Trump

1372
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,671
Is because

1373
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
He's in on

1374
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
Until he proves otherwise

1375
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
He's in on it

1376
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,583
Daughter is the world economic Forum young Global leader

1377
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,887
His daughter in a way

1378
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,127
Start a conversation

1379
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:06,527
He's pretty

1380
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:11,135
Maybe this color does

1381
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,231
Oh that's true that is now know what this caller believes fully but yes

1382
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:17,535
I wonder also I made some of the stuff really makes

1383
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,607
The question that 9895 percent right about

1384
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:25,471
He's already he's already several things wrong but

1385
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,263
Actually I no way around it

1386
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
Alex in his heart

1387
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,103
New all this stuff so he was right

1388
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,127
About these things

1389
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
He just lied

1390
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:41,855
I was right I just told you the wrong thing on purpose

1391
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:48,255
Chris because it works better is a different story if you're like what he's lying to us for good

1392
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:51,583
He was right

1393
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
Hernandez

1394
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
Scams on

1395
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:54,911
Oh

1396
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
Yeah that's about the right response

1397
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:00,031
I can't stand list

1398
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Link to her

1399
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,639
In the same way that I have a tough time with Patrick Howley guy

1400
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,943
And Harrison Smith

1401
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,039
The three of them have a real baby reporter Vibe tap

1402
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,111
I don't know there's just something

1403
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,159
About their delivery today I find

1404
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,695
Like I am

1405
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,463
It just

1406
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
It's

1407
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,303
It would be good voice acting for a cartoon

1408
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,887
About child

1409
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:31,519
They have zero chop chop

1410
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,543
But right now

1411
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
No chops

1412
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,079
Maybe

1413
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,615
So she has a big

1414
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
Scoop here

1415
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,431
About The Whistleblower

1416
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,223
About to Some Humans

1417
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,503
Trafficking going on

1418
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
That

1419
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
She should be careful

1420
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,623
What was my fear into defamation territory

1421
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,695
So this is government corruption and like you said

1422
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,743
Essentially child smuggling

1423
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,767
A happening

1424
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:58,655
On a federal level and Vietnam the same company that was already caught shipping migrants in the middle of the night

1425
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:04,287
To New York City they signed a federal contract with Joe Biden's Administration back in 2021

1426
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,567
136

1427
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:11,967
Million-dollar so I want people to understand at the biggest and most Sinister angle of this story is that we are passing offense

1428
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,735
Innocent children

1429
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
Do unvetted

1430
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,063
Properly identified adult

1431
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,391
Via our taxpayer dollars still biting funding all of this

1432
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:24,255
So there's a rare incident completely false

1433
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
It's just that it's not a new story

1434
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:31,935
The Daily Beast reported on the Biden Administration having contract with MVM Inc for transporting

1435
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
Immigrants back in May twenty

1436
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,495
Rue21

1437
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,799
A report doesn't cover anything that

1438
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,847
It's not already pretty well established

1439
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,127
Does public information

1440
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:45,503
But she does presented as coming from a secret whistleblower who has to appear with her face blurred out so it's big stuff

1441
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:51,903
Conversely The Daily Beast actually did some reporting on the story because spoiler alert

1442
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
A particle to the one that they wrote

1443
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,999
June 2018 about the same stuff

1444
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:02,399
Alex in Savannah probably don't want to think about that though because I was during the Trump times

1445
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:07,007
Does NVM had a 162 million dollar contract with the government

1446
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:11,359
Compared to the 136 million dollar contract they have underbite

1447
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:16,223
The actual store here that their contract was lowered from this higher about the Trump hate them

1448
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
Don't worry about that

1449
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:21,343
Jesus story is pretty f***** up or kind f***** up I don't know

1450
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:25,951
MBM was a CIA contractor Who provided security for CIA and NSA

1451
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
Installations in Iraq

1452
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,023
They may have some

1453
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,375
Six background so they may be capable of helping transport migrants but

1454
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,679
Their company's history does not Inspire much

1455
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,447
Confidence

1456
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,287
That said the claims of people like Savannah or making here about like a child

1457
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,871
Smuggling operation or probably legally actionable defamation

1458
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
Alex

1459
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,735
Maybe get this in check a little bit I think I think

1460
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Especially now

1461
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
It's a good change

1462
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,807
Names for Ambien

1463
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,391
To go from being war criminals to just being regular domestic

1464
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:59,743
Criminals of some sort I don't know how many war crimes they committed while being sick

1465
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,767
Security

1466
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,839
Maybe some I don't know email this down put

1467
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
Your point is taken

1468
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,959
So look Savannah got hired at Infowars right out of college

1469
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
That's that's

1470
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,103
Because I only accept The Wiz

1471
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,151
System to hire her right out of college

1472
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,199
Montana College in Texas

1473
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,063
Then she left to go work for some of the biggest

1474
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,367
Major organizations in America

1475
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,415
You can see her

1476
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,999
Investigator

1477
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
Infowars

1478
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,863
Mission can you see her do that

1479
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,679
And giving platform to launch from

1480
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:42,239
Literally had a vision

1481
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,359
Waterloo Ice House in Guyton

1482
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,943
And I saw the future

1483
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,271
The message was you are to build the platform

1484
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
Watch the generation of leaders

1485
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,343
The New World Order

1486
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879
At the critical point

1487
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
Really happened

1488
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,951
I told you four decades

1489
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
And now you're witnessing

1490
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,535
You got a lot of Visions man

1491
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,583
Also your team sucks

1492
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,119
This is the next

1493
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:15,519
Scrap of untethered from the things that made the Patriot commute

1494
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:18,591
Unity what it was in the 90s which is what Alex

1495
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
Screw out of right

1496
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,919
They are if anything

1497
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,455
A withering Vine

1498
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
On that

1499
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:25,503
Tree

1500
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:30,367
Because they're actually that's not entirely true it's just something will be supplanted

1501
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,903
Or or

1502
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
Grafted easily onto

1503
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,743
Authoritarian

1504
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,559
It will be consumed by that

1505
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,863
Cuz it doesn't have the grounding

1506
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,143
In some kind of a fellow

1507
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
As much as it sucks

1508
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,983
At least they can see communism is something

1509
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:46,751
That like

1510
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,287
It has the roots

1511
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
It has some

1512
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,591
Kind of a

1513
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
Tradition

1514
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:56,735
Traditions

1515
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:59,295
Yeah I have this

1516
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
This

1517
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,647
That the cult of the Cold War roots of that in the you know

1518
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
The Fayetteville

1519
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,231
Conspiracies and I'd stuff like that is

1520
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,791
A tradition

1521
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,607
These people like Savannah

1522
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Like

1523
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,167
Harrison

1524
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,799
They're really have that background they just have the

1525
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,847
Attention economy background

1526
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:24,127
Going

1527
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:28,479
To do the things that naturally gravitate naturally

1528
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,551
They get attention and get a rise out of people

1529
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,087
Owning the libs

1530
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
Yeah yeah

1531
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:39,487
Just not sustainable in any way it is only flows Downstream to

1532
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
Blossom blast

1533
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,047
Responsible

1534
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,119
Own the libs

1535
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:52,799
McNeil in Alero

1536
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,199
I feel like we should have tracked if I

1537
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,991
We could go back to the very beginning

1538
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,271
We should track

1539
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,319
What foods

1540
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,343
Alex eats

1541
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
To what

1542
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:07,903
Vision T receive

1543
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,303
Chicken fried steak that gives you a future reporter too much chili that gives you

1544
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:17,631
Forget your teacher's name

1545
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:22,751
Yeah I do think maybe he has indigestion

1546
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,591
Get that checked out

1547
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
You just got heartburn man

1548
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,455
I'm thinking about this even more

1549
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,807
There's there is like maybe David Knight

1550
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:37,599
Is

1551
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,903
Someone who actually was in the tradition

1552
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
You know sure

1553
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,047
Think about other people who are on are in the earlier days

1554
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,583
I don't know enough about like

1555
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,143
Where Dakari Jackson's head was at

1556
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,447
Sure I don't think Leanne McAdoo

1557
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:57,055
Was the light of those Griffin types

1558
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:03,455
No absolutely not I want a contest to work their other contest winners from like whenever

1559
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,271
Are used to have to have your hand on a car in order to win the

1560
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,807
The car for the longest time

1561
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Kind of her tradition

1562
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,927
To be fair at least the contest was an on-air thing not just touch

1563
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,999
That's true that is true

1564
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,583
I believe Owen just Cohen got his first job

1565
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,983
Because he just needed to get airtime and then it for the lawsuit I or something along those lines right

1566
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:26,751
No

1567
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Wrongfully

1568
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:33,663
Wrongfully fired at some radio station 3 hours a night

1569
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:37,247
Sports radio David Bell

1570
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
But

1571
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
II

1572
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,831
Yet I think there's a

1573
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:41,855
Big division

1574
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:46,207
Alex if what he's doing now is it actually

1575
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,231
To create the next

1576
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Proper Folk

1577
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,583
It will be a massive step downward

1578
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
Yuletide stroll

1579
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,935
Yeah you're talking about the garbage patch

1580
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,983
That's where that's where we're coming

1581
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,543
So I hope you enjoy that chicken fried steak

1582
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
I hope

1583
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:10,527
In our time away was what does Alex think about the FBI raid on Mar-A-Lago

1584
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,063
Does not care

1585
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
DeShawn

1586
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
I don't give a damn about that

1587
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,303
Human smuggling

1588
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,399
Closing comments about Hernandez

1589
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:34,079
A hundred percent agree Outlets everybody's focused in on the Trump at The Irate but again there's bigger issues going on here

1590
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:38,431
In this country right now we need to be focused and on saving our children and again

1591
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:44,831
Just with the border right that crisis in itself is horrible but that we also need to focus it on the sexualisation of our children

1592
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:47,647
School the targeting of our children by the lgbtq

1593
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:49,183
Call my God

1594
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Wow

1595
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,487
Okay so

1596
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:55,071
Savannah protect children from

1597
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Lgbtq

1598
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
Okay

1599
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,399
I think I think

1600
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,191
If and I'm going to throw this out at

1601
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Should

1602
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,031
The FBI have rated

1603
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
Let's say

1604
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,847
Any previous presidents

1605
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,895
That wasn't named Trouble

1606
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
Or even biting right now

1607
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:13,247
It would be a very big deal to Alex Jones

1608
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
It'll be a huge deal

1609
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:21,951
I think it's a good strategy for got to be especially after all the information has come out that

1610
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:27,071
This picture is looking worse

1611
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:35,007
We don't focus on nuclear secrets being torn away from the White House illegally in that be I searching about

1612
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:37,055
What we need to do is portray

1613
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
People as

1614
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:42,431
Is pedophile is going on here is Alex's like

1615
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Is Dubai

1616
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:56,255
Yeah it's bad but whatever whatever whatever

1617
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,375
Don't think you should be allowed to get away with that

1618
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,263
Whatever

1619
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:13,663
Crying about this that it's bad news

1620
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,455
Lord Alex duvivier like okay

1621
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,991
Bush did 9/11

1622
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:17,759
But whatever

1623
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
Whatever

1624
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:24,671
So Alex gets back to calls he has Savannah

1625
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,719
Go back to making

1626
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:29,791
Get back to your hole cover reporter Savannah Hernandez

1627
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,607
I don't do that anymore she doesn't work there that's true

1628
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,399
Better things

1629
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
So you're back to calls

1630
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:39,263
This is really really fun

1631
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,055
Soap before the break

1632
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,103
Caller it said hey Alex

1633
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,639
I went to the library

1634
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,455
And I know that they now

1635
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,039
Instinctually

1636
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
She says

1637
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
I went in

1638
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
And I know the

1639
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
That they have

1640
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
A system where you can

1641
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
Request book

1642
01:19:58,463 --> 01:19:59,231
But they should get

1643
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
I am so I

1644
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,047
Decided I was going to request

1645
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
Your book

1646
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
What is Alex pink

1647
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,447
Here's what I would think if I was a lie

1648
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
I wrote a book

1649
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:17,152
He dictated a book

1650
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:22,528
It is mostly a I've heard him talk about it mostly just

1651
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:29,184
The transcripts of things he said on air

1652
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
Together or something

1653
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,488
Also

1654
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,840
What point of order Glenn Beck has already released a book called The Great reset LOL.

1655
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:43,008
Obviously you thinking that the end result of the story is

1656
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
They said no

1657
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Right

1658
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:47,616
Listen as he's disappointed

1659
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,176
By the news

1660
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,248
Michigan

1661
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
A new book coming out

1662
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
We

1663
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
Libraries

1664
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,048
Thought she got so

1665
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,328
Fisher story

1666
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,096
Call Catherine

1667
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Hi Alex

1668
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,424
You're holding me over

1669
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,984
To the library in what

1670
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
What's a librarian

1671
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
There's a form that I can fill out to order the book

1672
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,152
And they didn't have any form she handed me a little ripped

1673
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
Piece of paper like a

1674
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:25,504
Play the name of the book in the author

1675
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,576
And we'll send it to our Central Library had

1676
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
Quarters or whatever it is

1677
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
I will

1678
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,840
Ed and low and behold I

1679
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
CU Library

1680
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,192
And they obliged

1681
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,472
They ordered

1682
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:46,496
1

1683
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,264
Copy

1684
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,312
The great reset

1685
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,848
And the war for the world

1686
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
On order right now as being

1687
01:21:53,920 --> 01:22:00,064
2D District Library

1688
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:12,352
The way I expected it to that's why he helped her over the break because

1689
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,168
They won't even let my book in the library

1690
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,704
Come on

1691
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,240
Building that story up

1692
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,544
Was leading to that

1693
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,104
It's a swerve at the end when the book is ordered

1694
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:29,760
Piece of paper I'd never see you again didn't have a form all of this is to build a conspiracy that they're trying to keep

1695
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,600
I feel like her big

1696
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:36,672
Storyteller big pitch was like

1697
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:40,256
They only got one copy of the book like that was

1698
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,024
I don't think so

1699
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:46,400
I thought that was I think that was we got one copy in the library

1700
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:51,776
Be surprised if she's going to a big enough library that they would be need to be multiple records

1701
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,896
Irene shouldn't that beat shouldn't your opinion then be like

1702
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,712
Libraries don't even have the resources for

1703
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,016
Tearing

1704
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,296
Printer paper up

1705
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,344
And they're still working

1706
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:11,232
For me despite the fact I went in there with a clearly confrontational attitude

1707
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,072
They love the first man that does Library

1708
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:18,912
It's interesting though I do think that

1709
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,728
I admire her ability to tell a story

1710
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:23,520
Cuz she she got you

1711
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:26,080
You know like if I hadn't spoiled that

1712
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:32,992
Do you want the father was going in One Direction was going the only Direction it could go on Infowars a reveal

1713
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,296
Disappointed

1714
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,112
It's not fair it's not fair

1715
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:38,880
For you to not

1716
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160

Answered

1718
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:43,488
But that's kind of what it's all about

1719
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
Obviously

1720
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,048
Call

1721
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:52,448

I don't trust

By Alex apparently even the proletariat Houghton

1756
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:18,208
Waiting is beginning to figure it out

1757
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:22,304
Well except for he's not realize what he's talking to the person who did the thing

1758
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,072
Used

1759
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,656
Funneling us towards DeSantis

1760
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,960
You know the same way they funneled us towards Trump

1761
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:32,800
It's almost like somebody earlier on on the show was like

1762
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,128
Doing that again

1763
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,176
And then they're funneling me towards

1764
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:44,832
You didn't you just ask me that question right now is a way of implying that you are funneling me towards

1765
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
DeSantis

1766
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:49,440
Or it yeah you're at least they've been playing around with that to see if that's something

1767
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,464
It's tenable yeah

1768
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,304
These kinds of things are not

1769
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,352
Stuff that would have been alive

1770
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,192
I mean serious listing of all the people

1771
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,984
In Trump Circle that architect

1772
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,008
Epstein

1773
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
Considering

1774
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Alex is big

1775
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:08,640
In all Alex Jones was right stories

1776
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:11,456
Isn't he was the first person on the Epstein

1777
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:17,344
For them to now just be like hey did you remember the Trump is the whole Epstein guards

1778
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,184
Constantly been like you met him once or twice

1779
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,256
And the idea of

1780
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:28,096
Is the Holden he may be too certain

1781
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,400
Entities

1782
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,448
These are not

1783
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,984
Things that I

1784
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,568
Except his reality

1785
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:38,848
The gate is down

1786
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,872
And I think that

1787
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,152
That matters

1788
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:44,736
Somewhat because the Overton window of conversation on his show

1789
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,784
Seems to be a little bit more open

1790
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,320
Listen to these things that are critical

1791
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,344
Over Trump

1792
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:53,184
The reality of trump exposed to the image

1793
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,000
Alex's wanted to maintain

1794
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
All this time

1795
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,584
Stuff you would hand wave away with just like

1796
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:01,120
He's not perfect

1797
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:07,776
That kind of thing you know like I'd let's not be specific about that is that is so fun

1798
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Funny because

1799
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,824
All of this stuff

1800
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,104
Was widely known

1801
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,640
2015

1802
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:17,248
And all of these people who you are literally speaking to right now

1803
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:20,832
Work their asses off to make sure you didn't pay attention to that

1804
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,136
Everyone in the Infowars orbit

1805
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,416
And all the guests

1806
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,464
Turn everything it was an active

1807
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,536
Creating a false reality that would have

1808
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:30,560
Skewer this

1809
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:31,840
From you

1810
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
So you wouldn't make

1811
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:35,680
An informed decision about who you want to do it like this present

1812
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,496
Realize that and

1813
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:40,032
Not realizing the second

1814
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
Impart that Ashley

1815
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,896
He's still doing the same thing

1816
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,968
And throwing around the idea of creating a false version

1817
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:54,368
For you to worship right because God has given us to Santa

1818
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,392
All the people in Britain

1819
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
Like

1820
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
Hey I'm

1821
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,744
I'm starting to think this whole brexit thing was a bad idea

1822
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
No

1823
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,584
Of course I'm going to vote Tory for the rest of my life

1824
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:07,424
And make sure that they are still allowed to do whatever it is they want

1825
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,472
I'll see if we're crazy

1826
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:13,824
Easy to lie to is just kind of fun

1827
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,592
Is another color

1828
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,384
Hey thanks Alex

1829
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:18,944
Play some

1830
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,248
Something here about that I just watched your

1831
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,808
Aaron Russo were you interviewed him

1832
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
And the other night

1833
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,880
And that was it was pretty

1834
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,416
Andrea Lee

1835
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:34,560
Take a look at that 2000-2006

1836
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,632
Yeah it was great

1837
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,400
It was great

1838
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:44,800
Great really compelling power.

1839
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:51,712
I believe what was that America Freedom or fascism

1840
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:54,272
One of those

1841
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:59,392
That is heavily predicated on the idea that

1842
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,440
Aaron Russo became friends

1843
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:05,792
With a guy who was part of the Rockefeller family and he told them all these secrets

1844
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:08,864
And Alex refuses to recognize

1845
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,632
Is that the

1846
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:13,472
The guy that Aaron Russo was friends with wasn't related to the Rockefellers

1847
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:16,032
He's just a guy whose last name was Rockefeller

1848
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,080
I might have been pulling us

1849
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Alright

1850
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:23,968
Right so great documentary that came out I guess

1851
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:28,576
8 Sharon years ago and still not made a correction on that right

1852
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,624
Alright it's like

1853
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,416
How many years ago is that I can't do math

1854
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:35,744
It's like how Sam Raimi didn't apologize for Spider-Man 3

1855
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,120
And I like you should have really said something before you got to do Multiverse of Madness

1856
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:49,824
These words and put it into words but I think it's worse

1857
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,664
31 Lasko clip here into Alex

1858
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
Just finished calls

1859
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:57,504
I was so f******

1860
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,296
Confused by who the gas was

1861
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,184
Special Forces

1862
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,464
Two purple hearts

1863
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
What

1864
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,888
Wait what at this point I'm thinking

1865
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:19,776
Russell Russell escaping from LA on this what what is happening

1866
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,664
Horses

1867
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,552
Bob Hawks a real person

1868
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:40,000
No I'm thinking is it Bob how bad is Italy

1869
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,024
Google what's going on

1870
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,096
Bob house

1871
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:45,632
Joins us lady

1872
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:49,984
These folks

1873
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,776
Sponsor for years

1874
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:56,896
Oh no no no

1875
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,432
Oh my God

1876
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:02,272
Go to the website

1877
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,064
Sprint.com

1878
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:08,416
There's so many ways no that's survival gear

1879
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,184
Really got

1880
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:13,536
Even

1881
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:19,680
Better Batter is apparently the name of the guy who's the spokesperson for the

1882
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:22,752
Satellite company is a real person

1883
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,032
Yeah yeah

1884
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,104
Is the journey

1885
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,384
Journey

1886
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,456
Get to an infomercial

1887
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,480
Apparently

1888
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,808
The exciting new things they have is something you can put on your phone

1889
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,600
To make it a satellite phone and on track

1890
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,136
I don't know

1891
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,416
Whatever right

1892
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:42,720
Yeah it's it's a long commercial

1893
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:47,584
Right right right here is as we come to the end of this me wrap this up

1894
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:53,472
The whole narrative about Alex turning on Trump is fraudulent and

1895
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,544
I don't

1896
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:03,200
I don't think there's any way that I can look at it and say that anyone is responsible for it other than

1897
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,504
That Ron filipkowski

1898
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:06,784
The clip

1899
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:12,160
That was widely disseminated that got over a million views that was all over the place reposted a ton

1900
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,720
Was from that Twitter account back

1901
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,256
Created the conversation

1902
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,048
And it was not accurate

1903
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,888
Yeah they created a false perception of what Alex was saying on his show

1904
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,680
Yeah maybe that only matters to me

1905
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:27,264
And I maybe it should only matter to me because I'm the person who watches the

1906
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,384
I don't know you know considering the again

1907
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:36,736
Considering the complicity that the media has had with

1908
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,296
Elevating all of these f****** voices her

1909
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:41,344
It's hard not to see them

1910
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,392
Jump at the chance

1911
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,928
They didn't they didn't like

1912
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:48,768
See this and then they were like maybe we'll write a story about this

1913
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:50,048
This was a

1914
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,584
F****** full court press

1915
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:56,448
Elated feeling of like haha

1916
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:00,288
Bright money man it sucks

1917
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
I think

1918
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,592
That

1919
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:06,432
Actual damage of something like this

1920
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:12,320
Is something that's real you know there is there is a possibility that what you'll end up doing

1921
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,368
Is eroding people's trust

1922
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
In legitimate

1923
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,208
Critiques

1924
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,744
News out

1925
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:23,072
Don't hurt credibility of news outlets

1926
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,352
Possibly lead people to

1927
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,888
Too trusting Alex more which is

1928
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,936
A dangerous thing to do when you shouldn't

1929
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
Engaging that

1930
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,008
If you don't have to

1931
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:36,896
Ultimately they're probably more dangerous things you could do right

1932
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,688
And maybe this is not like

1933
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
Highest can't

1934
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,760
The Quints kind of f******

1935
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
But

1936
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:47,392
I think you got to hold yourself to a better standard especially if you have the kind of reach

1937
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,672
Without account does

1938
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,720
Hell yeah I find it troubling

1939
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,000
Its cumulative

1940
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:57,888
When you see all of the polls about how people don't trust the quote mainstream media

1941
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,240
Every time they report on that they're like look at how bad the

1942
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,824
The media are looking out bad the electorate has been

1943
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:06,848
Bamboozled

1944
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,152
Without ever acknowledging that

1945
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:12,736
F****** you know what there's a reason people don't f****** trust you

1946
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:17,856
You know and maybe it's not as bad as as the reason that you shouldn't trust a lot of people

1947
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:20,928
But just because it's not as bad doesn't mean it doesn't

1948
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:24,768
Exist it doesn't mean that I can't do better than you can do better

1949
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:28,096
I thought you'd be something to strive for and I hope they do

1950
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,120
Second

1951
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
Yeah the notion

1952
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
That

1953
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:35,008
Alex's audience would be against him turning on Trump

1954
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,056
Does seem to be not active

1955
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:37,824
Yeah

1956
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,104
Seems like

1957
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Especially from the

1958
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,432
Picture that you get from all of the

1959
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,456
Please calls

1960
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,016
Bad news for Trump

1961
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,088
Still obviously course and I think you'd be acceptable

1962
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,392
If you would been to the whims of these extremist

1963
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,672
Butts

1964
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:56,512
There's not a problem with shifting over to someone else

1965
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,816
I mean I just feel like

1966
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Bye

1967
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,912
It doesn't matter

1968
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,728
Because if Trump and DeSantis

1969
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,776
Run in 2024

1970
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,824
God knows what's going to be the

1971
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,640
Every year has been

1972
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,688
Crazier than the last in s*** is gone

1973
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,480
Wilder and Wilder

1974
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:17,248
So pretty

1975
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,784
Addicting what's going to happen in two years

1976
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,552
Seems like

1977
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:25,440
I mean insane to do and if you think for a single second

1978
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,488
If you think for a single second that

1979
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:30,304
Carlos whatever legitimate criticisms these people

1980
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,352
Are having towards Trump right now

1981
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:38,752
If you think that when Trump becomes the nominee they won't immediately forget all of those criticisms bright

1982
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:43,872
Balbach down in like a what we can't have Kamala Harris what any of that s***

1983
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,640
You are in

1984
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,944
You're insane it does not matter

1985
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:48,224
It doesn't matter

1986
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,272
Most likely will.

1987
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:51,808
Ivan update

1988
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:56,160
Laura Loomer has refused to concede

1989
01:35:57,440 --> 01:36:03,584
I read as far as a part of the narrative Arc 41 episode that is pretty God

1990
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,984
Good look at Twitter while we're recording but you only got these primary music

1991
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:15,616
She's alleging voter fraud

1992
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,408
Why not

1993
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,944
Anyway good me back Jordan
