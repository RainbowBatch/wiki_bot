1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hey everybody here with a little apologies lunch clarification

2
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,336
Alex's response to the news about Jeffrey Epstein

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
How about you know what they say about plans the best-laid one

4
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,456
Nice man all that good stuff

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:24,320
We ran into a little bit of a barrier in terms of following through on that plan

6
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:30,464
That on Saturday Alex release date

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,352
Which is actually just a 1-minute of him rambling an airport with a ton of nervous-looking people behind him

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
I meant one minute of commercials

9
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,472
Turns out the Alex Airport

10
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,520
Because he was going on vacation

11
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,616
It turns out he's not going to be back until Friday August 16th

12
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
You got Tom pepper that boring guy who owns the station still broadcast

13
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
Staying on the snow this week

14
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
And Alex called in to ride shotgun as he likes to put it

15
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,488
The stuff about Epstein was very boring and predictable

16
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,120
Use them to attack Trump

17
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
That sort of thing

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,472
But honestly that wasn't most of what the episode covered

19
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:18,336
It seemed to me that Alex was far more interested in complaining about his vacation

20
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,408
According to Alex he ran into some people in a pool

21
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,016
We decided we're lawyers because they had what he describes as bike rider body

22
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
There's no real explanation about having a bike rider body you're a lawyer

23
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
The Divide is leap in logic

24
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
Anyway these alleged lawyers harass Alex in his pool because the left is so evil that they can't even allow

25
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
I went to enjoy his vacation

26
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:55,712
Bicyclist

27
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:24,896
I want to hear a child

28
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
Now leaving aside how this absolutely

29
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,024
I'm leaving aside how badly Alex wants to be the victim in all these stories that he tells

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Believing is super suspicious that Alex goes on a week-long

31
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Warriors money bomb

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,312
What I want to focus on is how the pool is the most dangerous place where Alex debate

33
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:59,712
We all know he was accosted by globalist in that hot tub a while back he hasn't globalist mess with him

34
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,760
The hot springs at Barton

35
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
Barton Springs

36
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,928
To the water

37
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,536
You should have learned his lesson stay out of the water Alex the globalist come for you

38
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Anyway what I listen to there wasn't an episode there too to go over

39
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,544
And I hope you'll enjoy it

40
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
The Jordan I recorded before he took off for his vacation

41
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,528
Is it a conspiracy that Alex and Jordan went on vacation at the same time

42
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:40,928
It's definitely probably possibly a conspiracy and please have a field day speculating about it

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,512
Until Friday

44
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:49,632
I want to just let you all know that we're not going to have an episode on Friday this week dude just a difficult

45
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,960
I'm trying to pull it off and farm content

46
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:58,336
To go over from like I know he's probably going to Robert Barnes hosting have his lawyer host for the week

47
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,176
And I'm not into listen to hours of barn stock

48
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,528
So we're just going to go ahead and take that day off back next week

49
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
With coverage of everything that merits discussion

50
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,720
But I appreciate you all

51
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,815
But for now

52
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
And that we will see you soon

53
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
Shredit.com

54
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

55
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,207
Stripe.com

56
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
Was there a band when you were in high school that was like

57
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
The local cool band

58
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,783
Yeah did you ever go to those like like open mics for bands in there.

59
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
It's hard for me to say that about high school time cuz I might have been a little disconnected there might have been some

60
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,559
Bands that I knew of that were

61
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,375
I'm not entirely sure

62
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Alberta

63
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,727
Like a little bit later there was a band

64
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,799
It's called Warhammer 40K

65
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
They were really off

66
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,743
Who's a little too loud generally a little bit too bright

67
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,607
Buddy's his little brother Cooper

68
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
Had a bit of an association

69
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
In my circle of friends but

70
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
Some of the members of it became case

71
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,455
They were the ones in Europe

72
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,783
Making some

73
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,319
It's good music

74
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,135
It's not my son

75
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
I don't know I think yeah I think Warhammer

76
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
/ cave

77
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
It's probably the

78
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,471
Columbia local music scene

79
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,103
Not really felt Dojo account

80
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:17,503
I don't know what you tell me about

81
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,295
I decided

82
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:25,695
To go into project

83
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
That we

84
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
Attention

85
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Characters

86
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Guy with telescope

87
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,679
We've got a telescope we have Mark Richard

88
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
Anytime of our creatures episode comes up we got a week

89
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:44,639
Top of the list guy who wants to storm The Getty Museum

90
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:50,783
These are like characters that we've become friends with

91
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,087
Overarching

92
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,463
It becomes a sort of thing where it's difficult to listen to any episodes involve them

93
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,511
Right because

94
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:12,287
Texas map

95
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,639
And there's one other guy of course Eddie page

96
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Palladium

97
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,479
That's what I decided to do initially when I said I do

98
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Episode

99
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,015
Was I wanted

100
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
To check in

101
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,391
Because last we heard of him you'd fallen out of Kerry Cassidy

102
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
Project Camelot

103
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,791
Restarted it and accusations started

104
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:40,191
Come out that use passing-off screenshots from video games Mothership

105
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
Called-out he took turn for the dark

106
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
Archangel Abaddon

107
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
Good for him

108
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,975
I listen to a bunch of his videos cuz I felt like well he's now the angel

109
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
This is amazing

110
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Therapy

111
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Is very boring

112
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
He threatened to open the 7th

113
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,935
What's the over-under yours 2019

114
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
So weird

115
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,751
The aftermath

116
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
He told us

117
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
You do you think that's something that you wouldn't even know about Katie's like 7 hours warning

118
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,111
So now he's leading a small cult

119
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
Based on

120
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
The videos that I could

121
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,767
Until what time comes

122
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:38,559
Which people actually

123
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:45,471
Okay nevermind nevermind I don't know why sometimes

124
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,007
You have some sort of opticians

125
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
Let me tell you there's no way for me to find out if anybody is watching me or anybody cares about

126
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
I think that even

127
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
The greatest

128
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:04,671
So I went down that road I realized that maybe

129
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,695
It's not worth it

130
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
I can't make an episode out of

131
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,511
Is Eddie Pages turn

132
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
Intuit Archangel Abaddon

133
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:16,447
There's just an it's bad presentation it's bad contact

134
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
Maybe

135
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,079
Maybe it's time to let go

136
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
Maybe it's time to

137
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:30,015
Usher Richards comes up

138
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
Course but maybe it's time to let go

139
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Some of these

140
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Connections

141
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Beehive with these other people

142
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,255
Steven Kelly certainly not going to cover him again

143
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,535
He is way too scary

144
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,679
Absolutely

145
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
You got to let him

146
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495
I decided maybe it's time for us to

147
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
To try and find

148
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,079
New friends Project Camelot world

149
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:57,151

Society

152
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479

We'll see what happens

158
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
But before we get to that

159
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263

There's no spaces

172
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
But it's clearly Taco in a

173
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,751

Anytime you got the full three names were talking to Fascination or somebody who is to be looked out for

186
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,871
This is going to be fairly interesting

187
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
I don't know for sure if I want to save it

188
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,991
We found a new friend

189
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
But I've certainly learned a lot

190
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
As we go along

191
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,623
I v I've learned

192
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:47,391
He's capable of

193
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,671
What she expresses

194
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,439
In this

195
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Out of context

196
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,511
So where are you getting

197
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,327
Information and why do you think it

198
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,607
It kind of means then

199
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Ouch

200
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
So we're going to get there

201
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:12,479
So all this b*******

202
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,367
Point out that this interview was posted before the 20th

203
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
16 election

204
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:25,535
1/3 twenty-six also interviewed

205
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Willie Windsor crack

206
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,167
On her show

207
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
Which is

208
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
Introduction

209
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
In

210
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
The way the only sheet

211
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:45,247
Kerry Cassidy from project and tonight we have a very interesting gas

212
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,623
I've actually interviewed her in the past her name is Emily Windsor Craig

213
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,023
And she is a fascinating woman and she has a great deal to share with us

214
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,863
Today about some investigations she's been doing

215
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
Inquire ancient

216
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:06,239
Human Society

217
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:16,223
More of a bio here is Gary laying out some of the important facts

218
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,247
Don't forget

219
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
She had her own star

220
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,599
Start up

221
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
In the early 90s

222
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Call play Technologies Inc

223
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
Which failed to gain funding

224
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:28,767
I know what that's like

225
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:35,167
Let's see she was radicalized during the Clinton Administration by

226
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:41,567
Focus on globalism and the effects of HR practices

227
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,383
Gaslighting by Corporation

228
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,247
And I she wrote a small political Theory newsletter when she lived on top of

229
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
Hill

230
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Call just now

231
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,391
She was Redland 1998

232
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,975
Spent the next seven years running from gangstalkers

233
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,311
Gucci gang song but not radicalized

234
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
On the run from gangstalkers

235
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,431
She's too busy running to to get radicalized

236
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
I suppose

237
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
Maybe a couple years into

238
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:26,623
Years which overlap with the running for gangstalkers

239
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,927
So

240
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
She's been doing some research

241
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
She gets here into this is where Emily jumps

242
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,399
She expresses what her goal is

243
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Elvis

244
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,775
I don't know if I like the title of this video being

245
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,311
Human Society

246
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,895
Because I don't believe that that's disgusting

247
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,087
Yeah I guess on that

248
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,367
Still I think

249
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
Between spiritual

250
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,495
So I decided to try to make

251
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Synthesize

252
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,871
A single timeline out of all the books

253
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,943
I showed you in

254
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,391
To explain

255
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,695
Where we are politically

256
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,255
Spiritually and physically

257
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
Put it all together

258
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
When you hear something like that

259
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
That sounds

260
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,799
She wants a grand unified field Theory

261
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
Grace

262
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
The only thing is

263
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Ask the question when she

264
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,503
She saying all these books

265
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:05,439
What the f*** books are you talkin about that is a very important question

266
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:11,327
You could be talking about the Necronomicon

267
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,703
Necronomicon if you're unplugged project much higher likelihood that you're talking about books

268
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:23,103
That aren't create a grand unified field Theory

269
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,687
Out of imaginary books in this world because

270
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,271
It is tough

271
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:34,367
As soon as she said that I was like okay I need to know

272
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
I need to know what you're trying to

273
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
To bring together if I

274
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,743
Define off on your mission

275
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,583
Because

276
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Slater

277
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
She does explain what books

278
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
She's talking about

279
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
The books that are

280
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Fascinating to listen to

281
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,415
If you can keep home because she's

282
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
She twerks

283
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,863
Are the beginning

284
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Story of

285
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:25,055
This planet because the Bible doesn't go down for the Rancher book doesn't go back that far

286
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
And so

287
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,455
That's where

288
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
The Story begins

289
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
According to

290
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
Which makes sense

291
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,719
Oh no

292
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,583
Glory

293
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:50,911
Population

294
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,455
You can't get Tori

295
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,759
2

296
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,295
Get what they wanted

297
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,791
Already like you're about to be super racist

298
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:23,679
Raise all the way to the certainly has the feel of this being very

299
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,567
Baby

300
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,639
Like some of this stuff could be very easy

301
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
Yeah yeah weather is conscious

302
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:41,855
So the books that she's using here are the Urantia book which we covered it past episode

303
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
Lot of bulshit

304
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,279
Interpretation positive about her interpretation

305
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,007
Who is Aviana Weaver Carrie bring her up all the f****** time

306
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,287
And it's just

307
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
It's the same thing

308
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,847
She talked about

309
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Sean David Morton

310
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:10,271
Wrote some sci-fi book that she believes is actual truth

311
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,039
It's called Voyager

312
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
And she believed

313
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,599
I don't know.

314
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,367
Play science fiction

315
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
I think they are supposed to

316
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Alternative history of the universe

317
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,816
Terry believes they are unveiling

318
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
They're supposed to be

319
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,168
She thinks it's creative nonfiction

320
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,592
Straight up history

321
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:39,456
Teacher or is someone called her a cult leader

322
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
Whose real name is

323
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Savannah Hayes

324
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,136
Completely true

325
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:49,184
Information about the secret history

326
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
I honestly wish it was more interest

327
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
It's not

328
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,632
From everything I can tell

329
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
Bikers Promises of the return of these

330
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:03,008
These people that she calls the guardian Alliance

331
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
Just never seems

332
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
To come to pass

333
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:05,568
Prediction

334
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,336
They're coming

335
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:10,176
Money gets handed over nothing verifiable has ever said and then nothing

336
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,528
The reason that these things are really dangerous though it need to be taken seriously

337
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,552
Is there

338
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,368
Do the vast majority of cases where someone has

339
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Disseminate

340
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
Pejorative

341
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,000
But sometimes something does

342
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
You need to look no further than Heaven's Gates

343
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,864
If you have a framework of UFO called can be deadly

344
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
In the hands of the wrong person

345
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:34,496
Anyone drawn to starting their own group like this is someone I considered

346
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,032
And that's not even

347
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
Because of anything that there's

348
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:41,152
Quality

349
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:47,552
Between different races

350
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,112
Is something that puts you in a category of

351
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Dubai on

352
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:55,488
Yeah I don't know if I like what you're up to

353
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,536
Start my own UFO cult

354
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:02,656
Even if I agreed with everything they were saying I would like

355
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,776
Spiritual gurus

356
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,848
My hands on a copy of her book so I could better understand what you preach

357
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,896
These books are out of print

358
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
F****** expensive

359
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
And I can't find it

360
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
Ultimately I think I've read enough books in that

361
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Genre

362
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,840
No more less it's going to be like

363
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,936
From what I've been able to tell odeens writings online

364
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
Cuz I have read

365
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,496
Breakdown

366
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
There seems like there's a big

367
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Sisters on genetics

368
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
And her philosophy

369
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,968
Humans as created by the

370
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,296
12 strands of DNA

371
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,368
You're missing some of those

372
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,720
Which somehow help the Manifest in the third dimension

373
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:05,376
That would present to get involved in art

374
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Get out of our Jeep

375
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
Which honestly

376
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,240
Kind of sounds a lot like space replacement anxiety

377
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,336
Kind of poetic science fiction version of white genocide propaganda

378
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
We know that Carrie believes

379
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,992
So like if she gets a lot of her info from ashiana Dean

380
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
I wouldn't be too so

381
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Surprised at 2

382
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:29,184
I don't know that to be taste I haven't read enough of her material but like

383
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
If Carrie is a huge.

384
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
Disciple of asean

385
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,560
That's one of her beliefs

386
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,168
If it doesn't have Mark

387
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:45,568
Right

388
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:57,088
I got to say no thanks yeah it's a little bit like a

389
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,184
Beartooth

390
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Make that assumption

391
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
At this point

392
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
Later in the episode babies I don't think there's anything necessarily wrong with

393
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:17,312
Time trying to unite like space philosophies hurting anybody whatever

394
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Only when it becomes

395
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,944
Damaging or is clearly reinforcing something negative

396
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,248
I bet I even care

397
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
241

398
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,344
Rises to the level of being really interest

399
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
So far

400
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
I'm not sure we've reached that qualify

401
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Gotcha

402
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,024
But we might in this

403
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,120
I can look into this

404
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Books

405
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,728
Personally

406
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,336
I'm assume inkarnate of one of the Anunnaki bloodline

407
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
And so I have

408
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,456
Telepathic contact with that

409
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:56,736
Not

410
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:03,136
That everybody in that bloodline degrees together or with me but I'm part of the bloodline

411
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,976
NAA NAA

412
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,792
Who was the Anunnaki

413
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,864
Who died in lakes

414
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Okay so I have access

415
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,544
Alright

416
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:36,672
Yeah I know that's a couple weeks ago

417
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,280
That's almost like one of her sword

418
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
Oh yeah

419
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,712
Years ago to you almost had

420
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,904
Which now is like our right

421
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
I'm starting to get interested now

422
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,024
Who's the new king

423
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:16,864
I don't know she's

424
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,056
Okay alright

425
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
The Kings win

426
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Legitimately

427
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:40,160
The king release date

428
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
I am really uncomfortable now when anybody says bloodline about

429
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Evil

430
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Peking died in 2012

431
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Only reason

432
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
You might

433
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:04,736
I think you missed the deadline

434
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
2007

435
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
Now in 2007

436
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,960
I don't know if you seen his pictures

437
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,128
Who has apparently been revived

438
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,712
That were

439
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,552
Him

440
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,648
One had an elder gentleman who didn't make it

441
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
What's not revealed who it was

442
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,952
Surprisingly Carrie is not sold

443
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,096
Okay now let me let me slow you down one minute here so you think that an Anunnaki

444
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:26,144
Sarcophagus

445
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,752
Calling him I think

446
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Was that a YouTube

447
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
And you believe it

448
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
Several references today

449
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,808
Video

450
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,344
Lot of references to that YouTube video

451
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,672
Sister her telepathic

452
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,512
Connection wooden crdc

453
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Tagalog

454
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:58,400
Interesting story

455
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Kind of fascinating

456
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,736
In 2008 excavators working on prepping

457
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
Construct

458
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Kurdistan

459
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,112
Accidentally uncovered an Iron Age grave

460
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
With more than 20 and text

461
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:25,536
This is a really cool Discovery and there were indications that there were all sorts of burial Goods

462
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
Plenty for researchers to learn from the grave

463
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,912
According to a report co-produced by gent universe

464
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,496
Within a week however a hoax was create a run to this.

465
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,312
Discovery the game

466
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,616
Reports and press releases began bench

467
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
I think the discovery of 6 Corpses

468
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Instead of five

469
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:45,760
And they became a mummified King and five of his bodyguards

470
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:51,648
The media frenzy was supported by a 36-second video fragment that was placed on YouTube and various others

471
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,256
It is the orchestrated discovery of a bearded mummified king with a crown

472
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,560
A gem encrusted gold box into gems

473
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,352
Encrusted gold plate

474
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
With cuneiforms inscription

475
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,008
The forgery was so crude that no professional archaeologist could ever be fooled by it

476
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,032
But

477
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,384
Many others were and unfortunately such a Jones style stories

478
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
Are still persistent

479
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,200
Circulating on the web

480
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:18,784
We hope this preliminary report May for once and all put in

481
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Do the circulation

482
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
Conspiracy stories related to

483
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Working out in 2012

484
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,696
Best as I can tell

485
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
It did not end

486
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
Speculation kill King Bernard

487
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
This happens a lot

488
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,960
A large section of the space weirdo Community particularly

489
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
Pyramid

490
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,800
Who know that nothing is ever going to prove what their argument

491
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,824
I'd say are true

492
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,920
Piggyback any real archaeological Discovery and try and co-opt

493
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Get into their world

494
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
This Behavior manifest

495
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Different ways

496
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:55,136
You sit here with this hoax mummy video of attempted Co-op this graveyard

497
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
You see what the insist

498
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,720
There's a cover-up

499
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:02,816
When Mainline archaeologists won't admit there was Anunnaki in that

500
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,120
They use that as proof that there was

501
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
The same sort of thinking is what's behind Carey arguing

502
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:12,544
Isis was created so that the New World Order can go rounded

503
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,336
Destroyed

504
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:17,920
These relationships

505
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
It's all about coop

506
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
Reality in such a

507
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,296
Deceptively elevate your ideas

508
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
And give mask

509
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
Going to why you can't prove any of the things

510
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,928
You say it's a good girl

511
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,192
Real archaeology

512
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
Do the hard work

513
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:48,640
Fake a little video and pretend that it's related it's almost like your job is just sitting waiting around for somebody else to do

514
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Do stuff and then you lie about it

515
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:54,784
Morph bulshit

516
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
Here's Emily talking more about

517
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,000
YouTube

518
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,984
Somebody pinches him like

519
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,856
Okay so if I ran

520
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,440
And the guy has a beautiful red.

521
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,328
Cool

522
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
Love it

523
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
This is just

524
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Like a really good

525
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,800
Encapsulation of how little proof people in this world require two

526
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,152
I've seen screenshots of this video I didn't watch

527
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,176
Start video

528
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,248
And it is

529
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,040
Next level

530
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Clunky

531
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:08,000
It's the sort of thing it's like carries video or picture that you showed of Anunnaki leading human prisoner

532
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,840
No

533
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
Emily starts talking about the Emerald Tablet of Thoth

534
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,008
Which is something that's really big

535
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:20,800
It's complicated

536
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Okay

537
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
I like to I like to add golden tablets like

538
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,528
The other tablet

539
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,552
Emerald

540
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
Look at the tablets

541
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,672
It's it's very big

542
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
This space

543
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:44,864
Foundational documents

544
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
I don't

545
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,936
I'm not sure it exists

546
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:56,128
So anyway she starts talking

547
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Think about stuff

548
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,528
Saying some stuff that's a little bit weird

549
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,856
Carrie.

550
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
There are you are saying

551
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
Things that are different

552
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,608
The Zacharias it's material and some other people I've actually

553
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:23,008
Forget the investigators name off hand that I interviewed but I there's another guy who does

554
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
And he's got a whole nother group

555
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
A people that he

556
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,104
Serta identify

557
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,504
So it does get quite confusing but continue to clarify.

00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,752
It tablet Elsa

564
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
To a treaty

565
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
An emerald treaty

566
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,432
Jordan imagination

567
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
This next

568
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,248
Cliff Jordan

569
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,040
2 minutes long

570
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:11,648
The more confusing alright let's find out

571
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,952
This is where I really think it becomes

572
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
Like we go from

573
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,840
In the Royal bloodline of the Anunnaki

574
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:25,984
They dug up a living Anunnaki in Tehran video

575
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:31,360
Sure this is okay

576
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,896
I think she's talking about something

577
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
So around

578
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:39,808
500000 BC

579
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
Because the Lorenz

580
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
Trusting

581
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,592
Basically predatory

582
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
They were unprepared

583
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Deal with

584
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
Stole the emerald

585
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:17,184
In order to protect

586
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,232
The white races

587
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Predation

588
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,608
Oh God

589
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,056
Yeah you're making

590
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
Why is that

591
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
Reptilian race

592
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Treaty

593
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Actually

594
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,768
For white races that are supposed

595
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,816
To be protected

596
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
From creditors

597
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,704
Turn out to be very.

598
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
Because what

599
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:09,920
Cultures in the galaxy

600
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,600
Route

601
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,904
2

602
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,256
Okay yeah because I'm not familiar with this

603
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:27,328
And you're making so I'm wondering where this is coming from

604
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,752
And there are

605
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,080
There are there are so many races that that are mix

606
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
I'm here

607
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:39,872
Emerald

608
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,688
Covenant actually covers all the races

609
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
It's not just the white one

610
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
What's the problem

611
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
Wait

612
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,880
The reason this is really confusing

613
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:53,696
Best reading I can take

614
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
Yeah it is

615
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Explain white supremacy

616
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,352
Tens of thousands

617
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,656
If your old Emerald 3D

618
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,960
I believe

619
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
She's doing

620
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,824
So here's what I'm getting from her

621
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
Admittedly

622
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
Brilliant explanation

623
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:15,712
Sure

624
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
So

625
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
Reptiles in Whiteville were like let's

626
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:25,440
Make this treaty endless put it on Emerald because

627
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
Emerald last forever everybody knows

628
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
Absolutely

629
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
Every kiss begins with a

630
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
Ephemeral

631
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,544
Do they got slammed also

632
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,944
I was going with your busy at a restaurant

633
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
Ordering steak

634
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,320
People

635
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,112
So then

636
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
Because they made

637
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,976
The treaty specifically with four races of white people

638
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,584
Apparently

639
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,864
Galaxy was like well

640
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Clearly

641
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,912
If the reptiles are making

642
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,936
A treaty with white

643
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
Specifically

644
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,776
That means white people are more special

645
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,056
Then the other

646
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
Non-white races

647
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Your guys's

648
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,480
I don't think your far-off probably in terms of

649
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
She saying but I'm more interested in what's behind it

650
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
Because

651
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,672
The Galaxy thinks white people are better or

652
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:35,072
It seems that way the unfortunate result of this is white supremacist

653
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
That's what I think she thinks

654
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:42,496
This is a way of reinforcing

655
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,776
Space treaties

656
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:44,800
You

657
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,336
Make

658
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,944
So you can't really deal with the issues

659
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,480
White supremacist

660
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:56,064
Galaxies fault you got to let them

661
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,904
It's kind of the same thing is just like when you take away

662
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
Real world

663
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
Cause and effect

664
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Real world

665
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,304
System

666
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
I've been the root to the

667
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
What you're doing is enabling them to

668
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
Perpetuate

669
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
Because you'll never deal with it.

670
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,568
So even if

671
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
Consequence

672
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,384
Of the space treaty

673
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:25,504
It's still like it's as damaging as just saying like it is what it is

674
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,576
Well I mean if you're going to say that it's the consequence of

675
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Space treaty

676
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
He's been you're saying that the way to

677
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
Solve

678
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,744
Supremacy negotiate the emeralds

679
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:39,584
I think we're going to get me why aren't we doing that right now.

680
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
We really should

681
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,984
Anunnaki royalty you should be doing it

682
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,544
You're right she's negligent

683
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,592
Instead you just complaining to carry

684
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,407
I thought that was very can

685
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,455
I'm not entirely sure what the deal is

686
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
More troubling

687
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
I don't like this

688
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,439
Into 208,000

689
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,863
Engineering on the white races

690
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Reproduce

691
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
Erase

692
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:25,151
Okay yeah I just don't know why you're a sizing White

693
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,223
Because he's not clear

694
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,207
Current day real-world consequences from

695
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
I just

696
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Feel like whenever

697
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,815
Talking about white people

698
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
South

699
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:49,983
Forgot I always

700
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,543
I always feel like

701
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,311
You're on

702
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,335
Sort of touchy growl

703
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,127
And what you're saying

704
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
South Africa

705
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:10,463
This is part of the predicament that were in now does she mean

706
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
The post-apartheid South

707
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:16,095
Africa

708
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,375
Predicament where it now

709
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
You presume it would be something

710
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,447
To do

711
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
With

712
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,007
Issues

713
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Surrounding White

714
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Offering any kind of real

715
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,383
Critique

716
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
On that level

717
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,199
I don't know

718
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:31,967
And it seems like

719
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,991
Carrie is

720
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
Less

721
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,599
Offended by the whole White Fang and more like

722
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
If you're going to be racing

723
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:41,183
You better back it up

724
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,255
The sort of

725
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Resent

726
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
Application

727
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,399
It's possible that Emily understand ashiana

728
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Better than her

729
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,751
Anybody who

730
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,079
Pewds Mark Richards

731
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,103
Push back on

732
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Or

733
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
5

734
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,943
Claim sort of authority over her source

735
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Right

736
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
So

737
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,039
I thought that was weird

738
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,623
The emerald

739
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:14,975
To protect white people

740
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:15,743
Miners

741
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,279
I feel like she

742
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
Speaking in code

743
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Mexican

744
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,775
Jesus teachings

745
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,295
He said you would be persecuted

746
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
This Is War

747
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:47,231
The Romans

748
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,679
No

749
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,039
That Christians will be persecuted

750
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
Siri

751
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,231
But you know where you getting that the Jesuits

752
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
Had the Quran written

753
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:23,839
This is an interesting interpretation of my hammock

754
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,911
I understand

755
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Known history

756
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
History

757
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:40,991
Known history like that's a very vague term we can't

758
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:43,551
Actually band around because nothing

759
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Right now

760
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
As as you know

761
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,487
Because everything are our history are lies of within lies

762
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:52,767
Fair enough

763
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:59,167
York Street I would I want more people to shout from the rooftops

764
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
Islam is a false flag operation

765
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:07,871
This isn't saying like the two things that I think are particularly notable about that clip is the first

766
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
It

767
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,431
It's embarrassing.

768
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,199
50 carry

769
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
Capable of this

770
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:17,087
Because that means it's unacceptable

771
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:21,183
I'm going through

772
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,207
Never any

773
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,607
Let's discuss how we know these things

774
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
The other part of it

775
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
That behavior

776
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,287
Extravagant claims wrote the Quran in order to

777
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,079
Victimhood for christening

778
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,615
Volkswagen

779
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,895
Walt's first does that

780
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
I meant seconds

781
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,503
Sushi make that claim and then it's no history

782
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,319
That is the same behavior that Alex Jones

783
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:52,415
He said something really f***** up nose

784
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,815
Yep the appeal to some sort of vague authority of like

785
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,607
Your jump

786
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:02,911
It's a strategy

787
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:08,799
You know that they believed

788
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,103
If you're going to if you're going to question me on

789
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,431
The fact that Islam is a false flag you might as well question me on that

790
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:20,575
Abraham Lincoln was an alien and that's why I wore that tall hat to hide his f****** Conehead

791
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,391
Exactly known

792
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:29,535
Episode I had this feeling of like

793
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
Bring some stuff

794
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Pretty

795
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
And I like

796
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,143
Weird like

797
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:36,703
I am from Anna.

798
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
I don't know

799
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
Beating up on someone

800
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,079
Who just believes

801
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Weird stuff

802
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:50,527
I believe that Islam was created in alright I don't care about your feelings

803
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,551
Get graduated

804
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:57,951
You are quite literally

805
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:59,487
Validate

806
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:02,559
Tons of people

807
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
Carrie wants to know where she's

808
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Kennedy's ideas from

809
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,751
I prize it goes on

810
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
But it's

811
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
She wants to know where

812
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,591
Getting you from

813
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,383
Find out it's

814
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
But also

815
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,455
But also

816
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,271
YouTube

817
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,207
Plenty of Muslims her going to take issue with the notion

818
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:36,863
Basically created Muhammad in some way or mine

819
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Controlled him or something to do with it

820
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
Is that that your idea

821
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,239
That is

822
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,775
Mystery

823
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Understand it

824
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
From

825
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,151
Dr. Bill Warner

826
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,735
Okay alright this is somebody that you

827
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:54,271
You

828
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,807
Okay is that right

829
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:02,207
This interview definitely should have

830
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Let's find out

831
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,559
Bill water is dependent for a guy named Bill French

832
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
I have no idea this is

833
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,887
But I like to have fun

834
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,495
So I assume that after 9/11 he heard we were going with freedom fries news like s*** I better

835
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:20,895
Board program

836
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,735
Publishing is he your bill your first name is shorter French name

837
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:29,855
So Bill franchise the founder of the center for the study of political Islam

838
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:35,231
And he's been one of the main voices putting forth a narrative that Islam is largely political system and not a religion

839
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,279
So many of the propaganda

840
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:39,839
Complaints about the spread of sharia law Trace back

841
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
To him and his 20s

842
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,911
10 book Sharia law for non-muslims

843
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,519
The splc includes him in their category of Muslim hardliners

844
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
Which is a rare group to be at

845
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,151
Along with the likes of Pamela Geller David Horowitz

846
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
I assume all the fun

847
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:03,135
Bill has absolutely no education on the subject

848
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:08,767
He's a former physics Professor who just had some half cooked Notions about Islamic decided

849
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,327
Because of his designation

850
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:16,191
Will take a s*** a bit more seriously than they would coming out of the mouth of some dumb dumb on YouTube

851
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,727
At dusk here we are

852
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,103
Bill Warner's is seriously dangerous or

853
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,199
Information Emily say that this is where she crafted her the

854
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,271
Created Islam from is super f***** up

855
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,575
I found Emily's bitchute Channel

856
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
Choose another key off brand

857
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:39,999
YouTube fire people go in their kicks off YouTube YouTube

858
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,815
Videos

859
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,863
Fear of Muslims and immigrants

860
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,935
It's really important to recognize that however

861
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:50,495
Steer someone insist that their living Anunnaki

862
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,127
All too often these sorts of beliefs and preoccupations

863
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Accompany

864
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,687
And the reason for that

865
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
Suspect is at the world

866
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,503
The Project Camelot existence

867
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
Trains people to accept

868
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,063
Claims with

869
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
Completely non-existent thresholds forever

870
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:08,415
Do something

871
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,695
That must be true

872
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,231
Define

873
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:12,255
For picking the couch

874
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
But it's not good

875
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:14,815
In terms of

876
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,863
Philosophies history

877
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,143
Concrete facts

878
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
Especially not good

879
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,983
Does it resonate

880
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,007
Field trip

881
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
Yeah

882
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,639
A bit of a war over

883
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,687
Whether or not objective reality

884
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
With so many leaf

885
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,111
Even within an objective reality there's still room for

886
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,391
Subjective experience

887
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
Considered subject

888
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,487
Delete rude to you and not to me exactly

889
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
That's what makes our conversation

890
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Much more difficult

891
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
It's whatever

892
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
Become an abscess

893
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
Buddhist about

894
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,375
He running

895
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,143
Into real trouble

896
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
And I do

897
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,263
The problem really wanted

898
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,287
Distinguish years

899
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
This woman is

900
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
Presenting the

901
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,919
Kind of fun

902
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,687
Also

903
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
This is not fun

904
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,247
Yeah believing

905
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:08,831
Islamophobic

906
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
The entire

907
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:13,695
Religion of Islam was created in order to an

908
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
Antagonize

909
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
Christian

910
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,047
Being its own thing

911
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,119
Islamophobic

912
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,007
And just because you have a fun way of getting there

913
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,055
Pastries and Emerald Tablets

914
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,383
Islamophobic former physics professor

915
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,431
Yeah it's never like

916
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,735
Emerald space tree

917
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:41,599
Design to make everybody feel good like there's always a bulshit Enemy at the end

918
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:42,879
Crazy

919
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
Crazy

920
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,231
So

921
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
She has some issue

922
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,143
There's some problems there too

923
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:57,727
Getting back to the life of Jesus and so on so forth

924
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:04,127
Jesus was not actually hung on the cross.

925
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,831
Okay still fear not

926
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,879
Jesus

927
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
It's not the one who

928
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,935
To sound the Merovingian bloodline

929
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,567
Okay we know that that's part of bloodline

930
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:37,919
Jesus

931
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,735
Important King Arthur

932
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,343
Pretty sure he's related to

933
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,695
Certainly not everybody knows that

934
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
Jesus bloodline

935
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
Is it

936
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:55,071
Was not real person that also

937
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:57,119
British is realism

938
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:04,287
Wouldn't have to be considered a certain type of British Israel ism

939
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:08,895
I don't know if we are really nonsense

940
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:15,295
Specifically here in that last question what book they're talking about

941
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,575
She said the gospel of Barney

942
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,367
But it's important today

943
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,927
Walk you through some of the reasons why this might be

944
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,695
Confusing

945
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,511
Number of books describe to Barnum

946
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
Federal.

947
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:27,839
There is the Epistle of Barnabas

948
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:31,679
Which is dated back to round 70 to 132

949
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,471
And then there's the acts of barn

950
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
Which contains language

951
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,311
5th Century

952
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:44,735
Neither of these were considered canonical and it's possible that the epistle could have been considered by the Council of Nicea

953
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Actor Barnabas

954
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:46,271
Postdates

955
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:47,551
So Canta

956
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Kicked out by the

957
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,695
The problem is that neither of these books contradict the crucifixion

958
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,743
In fact the Epistle of Barnabas

959
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,815
The one that would have been around

960
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,375
Surround

961
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,423
Passion and martyrdom as a rich

962
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
However there is another book of Barnabas

963
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,543
The gospel apart

964
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,639
And I suspect that this is specifically the book that tekere and Emily are discussing

965
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,199
The Gospel of Barnabas includes the belief

966
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
The Jesus escape crucifixion and the Jews

967
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,063
This place

968
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
The Gospel of Barnabas

969
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
Definitely a book that is

970
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,647
Not in the Bible

971
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
But here's the thing

972
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:29,279
There's no way the Council of nicaea could have kicked it out of the Bible 50 years ago

973
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
The Council of nicaea took place in

974
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,351
25

975
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,959
The earliest versions of the Gospel of Barnabas traced to the late

976
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
This is very reason

977
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
When you're talkin about biblical

978
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,407
The count of the Gospel of Barnabas includes a lot of elements

979
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:48,223
The contradict Christian doctrine

980
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,247
The son of God

981
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,271
Prophet

982
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
Many of the areas where the text

983
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
Departs from Christian belief

984
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,903
It's in line with the Islamic understanding

985
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Christianity

986
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Suggested

987
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
The text was written as an attempt

988
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
Combine the beliefs

989
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,047
True Religion

990
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,839
But that's really just a hypothesis

991
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,679
The world of extra biblical literature that seriously wide

992
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
When you allow a time span

993
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,287
I've considered books to extent

994
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
1500

995
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:18,431
You could possibly and probably find just about any argument you want to make with any of those books

996
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
The Ghost Song

997
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
With a book like the Gospel of Barnabas

998
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
It's really easy to get there

999
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,439
You want to make the argument that this book proves that

1000
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,999
Jesus wasn't crucified and that the Council of Nicea

1001
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,791
Be a cupboard that but it just doesn't

1002
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,095
You can make it makes

1003
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
If you intentionally

1004
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,679
Confuse people by combining the gospel of barter

1005
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
That makes the argument you want

1006
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,519
What was written in 1500

1007
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,103
With the Epistle of Barnabas which existed in the correct time. But doesn't

1008
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,127
The argument

1009
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
It's either evidence against

1010
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Same levels

1011
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,711
Sloppiness in research

1012
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
To mislead peep

1013
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,807
And I don't know what it

1014
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,367
I don't know if it's just foolishness or

1015
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:08,351
I don't know I could easily see it just being like

1016
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
Confirmation bias

1017
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,447
What you want to believe

1018
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,495
Willingly

1019
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,615
Combining the two or getting it from a bad store so that is intentionally

1020
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
Any of those things are possible whatever you're doing

1021
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,711
You are disseminating

1022
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Because it is

1023
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:29,343
The Gospel of Barnabas was not kicked out

1024
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,999
Reality I'm sure that you could

1025
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:36,767
Could be like

1026
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:40,607
No it was written in the discovered

1027
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,679
1500

1028
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,727
Gospel of Barnabas

1029
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Paul wrote Epistles all over the place and

1030
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,359
Some people believe

1031
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Some pieces

1032
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
Gospel of Barnabas

1033
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
Do traceback

1034
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Two older

1035
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,503
There's no

1036
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,295
Opinion about that or

1037
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,319
Surviving

1038
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Right

1039
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,623
Examples of

1040
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
What it would be

1041
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,695
And we don't have

1042
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
Are the epistle and the ACT

1043
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
The Barnabas

1044
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
That are from

1045
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,863
Closer to that time. And neither of them

1046
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:14,655
Fulfill the other requirements that they need

1047
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,471
Which is Jesus escaped crucifixion

1048
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Ratified

1049
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:19,007
His place

1050
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:20,287
So they're just

1051
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,311
Trying to make

1052
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,127
I guess I don't know

1053
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:24,895
I don't know

1054
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,687
Anyway we get to present

1055
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
I don't want

1056
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,015
How to do that

1057
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
She sounds a lot like Alex

1058
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,111
People no longer

1059
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,231
And what is going on

1060
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:44,095
Pointing out is that globalist

1061
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
So that we have now had

1062
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Presidents

1063
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,919
Because our voting system

1064
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
Manipulated

1065
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,599
The globalist

1066
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:09,695
Arenal party you ugly

1067
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
Yeah

1068
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Yep

1069
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,023
This

1070
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,559
Very

1071
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,583
Very similar

1072
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
It's annoying

1073
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,471
It's unfair when they take

1074
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,495
The very real

1075
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
That everybody agrees

1076
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,079
Is a very real problem

1077
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
Create a

1078
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:29,407
Unsolvable problem out of

1079
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,527
It's almost like taking white supremacy and blaming on Emerald Street

1080
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:40,671
It sure seems like what you're really doing maybe testifying the status quo in whatever possible way you can

1081
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,999
Damn near impossible to get up with

1082
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
I'm envious

1083
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:54,751
There's a part of me like if there were a way for me to engage in this without descending

1084
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,519
Into like

1085
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,591
Outright islamophobia denial of people

1086
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,663
Religious beliefs identity all that like

1087
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,943
I wish I could do it but you'd

1088
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,223
It doesn't seem possible

1089
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,319
Call blister all around us and their dictator

1090
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,599
All this political

1091
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
Brew haha that's going on

1092
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,231
She also believes that the Rothschilds are up to no good

1093
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,279
Which is also similar to Alex

1094
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
The Rothschilds

1095
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
Pause

1096
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
She may have Atkins

1097
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,655
Conspiracy about the Rothschild

1098
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
Different than without

1099
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:28,031
Napoleon actually made the Rothschilds

1100
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
Make Napoleon lose

1101
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,847
This is for

1102
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
Current

1103
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,431
Rothschild the Waterloo

1104
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
But

1105
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,735
This one's a little

1106
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
Buckwild

1107
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
This week

1108
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,439
The new constitution

1109
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
North America

1110
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,095
Which is an Islamic

1111
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,423
Surprise surprise

1112
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,703
Where did that come

1113
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,263
Good

1114
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,335
Rothschild

1115
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
It has not been ratified

1116
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,087
Noda

1117
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:16,159
So it is not

1118
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,255
Again this is a globalist

1119
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:22,815
Behind the People's Bank

1120
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,351
Control

1121
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,679
The Rothschilds are globalist

1122
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:28,447
To have

1123
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:34,847
I mean very similar to Alex

1124
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
The new concert

1125
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:41,503
She is believed that the Rothschilds have written it actual new Constitution and that it's an Islamic State

1126
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:47,391
Actually that far from Alex because I mean you know that Obama was going to get a third term

1127
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:52,511
Becoming a caliphate

1128
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,583
So it actually is a lot closer than it actually appears

1129
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,911
Yeah I'm different

1130
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,727
Dumber

1131
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:06,847
Because it's boring beyond all reason

1132
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:14,783
And the way she's putting it in the context

1133
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:21,183
Because Alex is more careful not to be as / 20

1134
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,743
Knowing something

1135
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,535
I saw it on YouTube

1136
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,119
Honey

1137
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,167
He's not super

1138
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:40,383
I was like. Let me know.

1139
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:44,223
I just wanted to make people might hear that and not me

1140
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Yeah

1141
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,551
Carrie

1142
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Has Google

1143
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,855
And I don't think she believes

1144
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:50,879
This constitution

1145
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
Interesting

1146
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
See how she at

1147
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
About

1148
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,511
This

1149
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,791
This disbelief

1150
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:02,655
Okay tonight I can I just stop you there because

1151
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,215
You've just brought up this

1152
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,287
So-called constitution written by a Rothschild

1153
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,895
Information and and why

1154
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,175
It kind of means

1155
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:19,807
And do you think it'll get for today's

1156
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:28,255
I see but for the purposes of the

1157
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
People listening

1158
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:30,815
It can you just

1159
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:36,959
Paraphrase where you're getting this information another words finding a link on the Internet is all very fine and good

1160
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,751
Can you stay

1161
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:43,615
Why this this also called Constitution tours means anything

1162
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:46,431
Why did it resonate

1163
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,759
To set up a North American Union

1164
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,039
So

1165
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
Soap

1166
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:58,719
Like she's asking

1167
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,767
She's asking for it why is it red

1168
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
With you

1169
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,327
Why do cats not good

1170
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:09,727
Help us get anywhere you never going to find any actual information about this f****** state constitutions

1171
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:12,031
Why does this feel real to you

1172
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
That's great

1173
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,127
Presumably

1174
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:16,895
Journalist

1175
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
Show that the

1176
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,479
Secret history book

1177
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:23,551
I've always been like well this fact doesn't resonate with

1178
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
With me so I'm just going to assume that

1179
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Eyewear I'm worried

1180
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:29,183
A lot more people do that then move things

1181
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
So we get off this topic cuz he's not really able to

1182
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,559
The Defenders

1183
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,887
Very well

1184
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,655
It's not very interesting

1185
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,727
Surprise so apparently Emily is writing a new book

1186
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
Has to do with

1187
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,287
Desired

1188
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
Education

1189
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:54,015
It's in this clip that we learned something else about her that has been sort of doing in the background

1190
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,551
For this episode

1191
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,647
Slavery is okay

1192
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,095
Wrong history

1193
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:11,167
Our children are being taught

1194
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
Minecraft 2

1195
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,519
Teach them footballs

1196
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,103
According to causes and effects

1197
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:34,975
2

1198
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:43,167
Maritime admiralty law

1199
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,751
Administrative law

1200
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:50,335
Lunch along the same lines

1201
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,943
Spoke to you the other day

1202
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,991
There needs to be a year.

1203
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,039
Financing

1204
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,927
Political process

1205
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,999
The precincts were

1206
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
Cheat codes

1207
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,799
You see people taking you survey

1208
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,335
Video

1209
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,943
Do you know where Thailand is

1210
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,735
What's the name of George

1211
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:33,599
The people answering the questions

1212
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:38,719
I don't like any of the three things that

1213
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,511
She said to take a year

1214
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,911
Have to do with where Thailand is or who your local representative is geography

1215
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,519
Almost every High School District

1216
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,823
School districts in America require some Civic

1217
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,663
Almost every school district

1218
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,455
Junior High

1219
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
Divorce

1220
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:09,951
If they were out of her hands

1221
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
Crazy

1222
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,071
Fingers too long

1223
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
People learn

1224
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
Throw out the Sovereign citizen

1225
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
Because

1226
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,919
Stupid also it is a nice like

1227
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:34,527
Tip of the Hat

1228
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:37,855
I did like that I think that if you interpret spending it

1229
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,391
Frisk to be economics

1230
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:42,975
Sure kids should learn more about economics

1231
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,279
Absolute books

1232
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:47,839
More required as opposed to an Alexa

1233
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,447
You're not

1234
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:57,055
You have no information on how to survive understand some of that stuff

1235
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:00,127
I don't know if there are School District

1236
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
That do a better job

1237
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,967
Certainly wasn't

1238
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
Let me we already do that

1239
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,903
In most schools but not expanding that and making it more

1240
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:18,047
Complete

1241
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
Engaging

1242
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,351
Those two things

1243
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,887
Are great ideas

1244
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
You're not going to help you know where Tyler

1245
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,983
4

1246
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,895
How to avoid

1247
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
Helpful

1248
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:40,575
Don't be a cop or a lawyer that you're probably never run into the river

1249
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,343
Adjudge

1250
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:45,183
I would say it's like there's a real diminishing

1251
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,743
What she's talking about about lot of E-Class

1252
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,023
Education

1253
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:49,791
No topic

1254
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,583
And I know that a lot of people

1255
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,887
Kind of poo poo on some of them

1256
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Writing

1257
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,519
Reading is really important to be able to express your ideas

1258
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,823
And people also s*** on math a lot

1259
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:06,175
Math isn't really all that helpful but the process

1260
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
The reason that it's such an important

1261
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
Universal education

1262
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
Is because it trains

1263
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
To go through thinking process

1264
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,159
It is a lot of science

1265
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:19,231
Like the actual think I'm never going to

1266
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,535
You need to balance a chemical equation

1267
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,095
But learning how to do it opens up

1268
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119
Process of

1269
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,911
In system

1270
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,983
That is really important navigate in the world

1271
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
It is 2 mi

1272
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,311
Great

1273
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
That I have to say this but

1274
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,871
Learning proofs

1275
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,151
In geometry

1276
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,175
Like

1277
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:42,015
When I was in Geometry I didn't I could do all of the math in my head

1278
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,319
And then I could come to the right answer

1279
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,647
But being forced to actually right down step-by-step

1280
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,207
Ripe helped me a great deal in that just

1281
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,743
Ability to organize

1282
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:52,511
Your thoughts

1283
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
How's the lodge

1284
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:55,583
Eric moves

1285
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,911
Absolutely

1286
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
Applications for the real world

1287
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:10,175
Answer when she's talked about this education in order to add Sovereign citizen

1288
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,991
You're only going to be able to do that vitamin

1289
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,015
Other

1290
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,063
High School curriculum

1291
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,207
Is because the more you learn the more or the less likely heart

1292
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,095
So what's to know like how do you talk

1293
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:28,863
To the Anunnaki

1294
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Talk

1295
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,935
Question

1296
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,215
She gets into some of the

1297
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,495
Details here

1298
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:38,335
This is the kind of part of

1299
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,711
There's no way around this Theory gets a little bit

1300
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
At this point

1301
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
And it's

1302
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Where

1303
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
Kind of thought like maybe we should

1304
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,111
Couldn't cover this episode

1305
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,671
And I think there's an argument to be made

1306
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
She will say a few things

1307
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:56,255
That show a deep

1308
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,791
Humanity

1309
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,815
In her

1310
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,863
And I don't want to makes fun of

1311
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
Any of this

1312
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:04,703
Other stuff that she's saying

1313
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,471
Is

1314
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:12,639
Too f***** up to not cover billion people because

1315
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
She thinks that the

1316
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:21,343
Along those lines now do you believe that you're in contact

1317
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:24,927
To be with a certain group of the Anunnaki

1318
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
Is that right

1319
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:30,815
Okay

1320
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:36,191
What when you say that do you mean that you're getting downloads how are you communicate

1321
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,871
Part of their bloodline they're checking

1322
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
4

1323
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,343
Orsay

1324
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,159
What their hierarchy is

1325
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,023
And basically what I say

1326
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,095
What's okay

1327
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
That was okay with it

1328
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,239
Probably not

1329
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,895
To see what I'm doing

1330
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,991
Question

1331
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,159
She talks to Yahweh

1332
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,231
YouAlwaysWin

1333
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,791
He wasn't very forthcoming

1334
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:36,351
Wow that's a misunderstanding

1335
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
Yahweh pear

1336
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,703
Nothing

1337
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
V of like

1338
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,775
Volcanoes

1339
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:49,663
Yeah like that perception

1340
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:53,759
Yeah yeah social stuff

1341
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,111
Joey doesn't have a Facebook page

1342
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,135
I can't man

1343
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
Come and check on me

1344
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:08,095
It's a weird conception of how you communicate with aliens

1345
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,167
Face come around asking stuff and they don't say anything

1346
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
We had his interest

1347
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,495
But she doesn't

1348
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:17,823
Didn't hear them

1349
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,591
Okay

1350
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,151
Applebee's

1351
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,783
Contact with them and

1352
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:31,903
Art why are you seeing them in person or you just getting a soda mental pictures or what

1353
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:36,511
Alright

1354
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:43,679
I can hear of their alarm system when

1355
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,215
Meteorism

1356
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,103
Night music

1357
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
Particularly

1358
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:56,991
Songs that are specific to certain

1359
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,527
Certain messages

1360
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,319
You have a memory

1361
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,695
In the morning

1362
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:10,047
I don't know exactly who it was

1363
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:19,263
What I was going to do here

1364
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
But

1365
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,759
What I sent today to you was going to be

1366
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,487
All this stuff has been Guided by the Anunnaki means that the Anunnaki

1367
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
Don't

1368
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:43,071
Believe Islam is a real religion

1369
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,631
The Anunnaki believe that

1370
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,911
Add and Anunnaki

1371
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,191
He dug up in a hoax

1372
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,239
2007 in a row

1373
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,359
I would say that if she

1374
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127
She's getting X

1375
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,919
Eternal like really wise

1376
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:00,479
You wouldn't perpetuate

1377
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:02,783
I need a grave hope

1378
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,831
Respect

1379
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,415
To some extent somebody who can take tinnitus

1380
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,207
A bad dream

1381
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:10,975
And

1382
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:15,327
Sentimentality and turn them into a

1383
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:20,703
Write a little bit and there's a little bit of a

1384
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:24,031
There's that there's an indication of

1385
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,335
How do you spell normal

1386
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
Experiences

1387
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
Can be Twisted by

1388
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,455
Exposure to ideas

1389
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:35,039
Yeah and they also amplify probably allow you to

1390
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,575
Taken

1391
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:37,599
Information

1392
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,927
Integrated it's your world music might not otherwise

1393
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,951
Like Islam

1394
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
Fake religion created by

1395
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
Like

1396
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,399
World's I believe

1397
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,423
Can be dangerous

1398
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,447
Even if

1399
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Absolutely

1400
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,823
We learn about her being

1401
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,615
Incarnated Anunnaki

1402
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,151
I was wondering about that

1403
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
But

1404
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
I'll just have to

1405
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,367
Explain

1406
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:14,207
So are you aware of like the neanderthal

1407
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
Bloodline

1408
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,791
That you may be part of

1409
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:23,167
Okay but you know they made human hybrids right

1410
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Alright

1411
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,895
Really

1412
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,687
I don't fit in

1413
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
Dairy

1414
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:02,335
Open relationship in terms of trading meaning and thoughts back and forth

1415
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,151
And you always still on Tinder

1416
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
Cookout

1417
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:22,047
I was part of the Royal Line Royal bloodline

1418
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,471
Windsor

1419
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
Okay alright

1420
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:35,615
Alright alright I feel really sad

1421
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,663
For her on one level because

1422
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,431
Expressing

1423
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
Deeply human

1424
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
You know what

1425
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
She feels alienated for

1426
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:42,527
From people around

1427
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
She has a hard time

1428
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,367
Connecting with her children

1429
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,487
The way to deal with those

1430
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,327
To create

1431
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,631
An entire worldview that's

1432
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,679
The rat like I'm communicating with alien

1433
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
They understand me

1434
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:03,775
Their line of thinking is much more in line with mine

1435
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:04,799
Because it is mine

1436
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,823
Right

1437
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
Turtle

1438
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,759
As opposed to just be and I have thoughts

1439
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:18,111
And you can totally see how the the sequence of events could unfold

1440
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:24,511
She starts to believe things that I know she's on YouTube all the time she's believing stuff that is

1441
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,535
Kids about it and they're like

1442
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:30,399
That's absolutely not true please stop doing that and then as they stop talking to her

1443
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
She starts

1444
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:35,775
Craps

1445
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,615
Is the story that you hear

1446
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,919
Pretty regularly now or at least

1447
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:48,831
Like you see this this spiral of isolation happens

1448
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,111
Around these

1449
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,391
Please world and I think

1450
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:58,047
Like the people who are promoting these ideas don't want people to have a robust

1451
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,863
Healthy ecosystem of friends in relation

1452
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,143
Because they will check

1453
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,983
Generally

1454
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:12,639
Colts find vulnerable people as you're isolated from your

1455
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:15,711
A real bummer because

1456
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:19,039
On one level I recognize that a lot of the stuff

1457
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,575
That she believes is

1458
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,647
Probably it's probably a result

1459
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,951
Of her feeling these feelings

1460
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,511
Becoming more and more entrenched

1461
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,327
In this world that leads you down bad

1462
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,887
Absolutely understand

1463
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,679
And I don't want to

1464
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,471
Mark Hereford

1465
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:40,287
But I do think that there's a lot

1466
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
Yeah I think there's a line

1467
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,895
And I also think that it's

1468
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
Weird

1469
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,223
That

1470
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:48,991
She now is

1471
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:50,527
Beartooth

1472
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,159
You know sometimes you're not paying attention

1473
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:00,511
And then all the sudden you're the illegitimate daughter of the

1474
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,047
She has

1475
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
According to her she has porphyria

1476
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Which proves that

1477
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Richie's from

1478
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,703
Novel 121

1479
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:14,592
Owl is the line

1480
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:15,872
That's the wife

1481
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:20,480
Of the dinar

1482
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,808
That was a nerve

1483
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:29,440
Remember I believe is the wife

1484
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,512
Of the Anunnaki who was found in a Ron

1485
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,352
It was part of the Royal bloodline

1486
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,376
Connected

1487
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:41,216
The herd Subway is there for party

1488
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,264
She somehow royalty on Mars

1489
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,544
And now she is

1490
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,104
One of the illegitimate children of Edward the 8th

1491
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,640
Right here

1492
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,176
As that it would make her

1493
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
The

1494
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:55,040
The heir to the British throne

1495
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,880
Well there are three exactly

1496
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,416
No she's not

1497
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,208
I'll see you then there we go

1498
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,512
She's not even there yet

1499
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,280
I think

1500
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,584
This whole thing about her there's a lot of

1501
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,864
Controversy surrounding

1502
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,360
I should tell you it's a little scared

1503
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:26,784
So she's number 10 is trying to keep her out of the out of the government

1504
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,552
Entire life

1505
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:31,648
She has 30 there are three she's one of three of these

1506
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,976
Illegitimate children

1507
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280
Brings up one of them

1508
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,048
In this neck

1509
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
Okay

1510
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
She has a YouTube account

1511
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,664
On YouTube

1512
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
She doesn't like me very much

1513
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
Alright

1514
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,632
I don't know that they do

1515
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:24,640
I'm not positive but that is the case anymore I believe real threat

1516
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:28,480
A lot of a real threat first of all to monarchical system

1517
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:34,880
2nd royal families intermarry is the

1518
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
Protect

1519
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,928
Property

1520
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,744
I really think that there would be a very serious

1521
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,024
Issue

1522
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
The foundation

1523
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,608
I mean

1524
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
Just just

1525
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:47,168
. to discover

1526
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,192
The Royal Family

1527
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:50,752
Anarchy symbol

1528
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,544
Of the United Kingdom

1529
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
Is just throwing it around

1530
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,616
And the rightful Queen

1531
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,176
Is somewhere here in the United States

1532
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,456
Possibly

1533
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:04,320
So Emily

1534
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,672
That what that was

1535
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:10,720
That's interesting because whenever

1536
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,536
She was introduced as Emily Windsor Craig I was like

1537
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:20,192
Is it odd that she has an a the name of a royal in her I was hopeful

1538
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,336
So poor could be Peggy chylders Virginia

1539
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:32,224
It's mostly full of videos about how she's the rightful heir to the throne

1540
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,784
The show Victoria

1541
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:40,928
Okay apparently according to her fpr is a part of the Illuminati

1542
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:46,048
Destroy Peggy's father.

1543
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:49,120
Edward apparently was replaced by a bunch of clones

1544
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:51,424
Doubles

1545
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,616
And apparently another one was Emily's father

1546
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,408
So Emily Windsor Craig

1547
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:06,272
The cheese the daughter of that of Edward the 8th but actually was one of the Clone

1548
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:12,672
Doubles

1549
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:16,256
Father so she is the rightful heir to the throne

1550
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,072
But her mother is not

1551
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,400
Like he didn't rely upon her last name is okay

1552
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,472
Her mother was Georgia

1553
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,776
No

1554
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
Dissolve

1555
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,592
Convoluted

1556
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
This is convolute

1557
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:34,688
A ton of her videos have to do with how Emily is a fraud

1558
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,992
Annabelle

1559
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:41,344
I'd really hoped this would be a more fun way to approach

1560
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,368
Situation like

1561
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:48,768
We could listen to a bunch of her videos about this supposed to Harrah's to the throne

1562
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:55,168
Black prince versus us

1563
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,192
Another picture

1564
01:24:57,472 --> 01:25:00,544
It wasn't a coincidence that you make such a point of the fact that

1565
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,824
She believes FDR's

1566
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:05,664
Doesn't surprise me

1567
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:12,064
Subtly racist s*** in her YouTube Channel videos about how like white supremacist terrorism is the

1568
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,344
Vine control

1569
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,112
Sure

1570
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,416
So it's really weird they have another

1571
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,976
Pretender to the throne and Miss Piggy

1572
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:30,240
Defensive

1573
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,520
You see stuff like

1574
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:37,920
A videos about Michelle Obama that include the words picking cotton in the title

1575
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,296
You got 37

1576
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,344
And after she brings up

1577
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,672
Siri raps

1578
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,376
That's what our new friend

1579
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
Windsor Craig

1580
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,752
Tell the anti-semite

1581
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,032
Let it

1582
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
Call man

1583
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,432
It's a paraphrase

1584
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,736
So I want to see this

1585
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,272
Ultimately

1586
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,040
Kind of weird

1587
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:20,416
For us to have done this episode and exercising

1588
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,184
Hey I would pay

1589
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,464
Struggling

1590
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:29,120
Especially with her comments about the alienation

1591
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:30,912
I don't want

1592
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,960
To feel like I'm beating up on her

1593
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,264
Isidewith

1594
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
Excuse for Emily

1595
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:42,944
I kind of have to allow it for everybody on Saturday everybody

1596
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,736
She's lucid

1597
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,760
She defends her position

1598
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,832
She has all her mental faculties

1599
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:53,184
She's clearly not in some sort of a real struggle

1600
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,000
Like I've seen a number of cases the episode the project

1601
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,352
Why we can maybe read from Context Clues

1602
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:04,448
She stopped Furious alienation from people in her life and that's allowed her to adopt some elements

1603
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,472
The Fantasy Life

1604
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,800
That she feels more and that doesn't make her off-limits to

1605
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,080
Iceman

1606
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,408
Isolating myself

1607
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
I didn't have

1608
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,736
You know I

1609
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,016
I was out of my mind

1610
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:21,088
I didn't suddenly start believing that

1611
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,392
A billion people were

1612
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,928
F***** over by the judge

1613
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:30,560
Disseminating that information

1614
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:33,632
If we made fun of

1615
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:41,056
What cheese you don't get to see you

1616
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,360
Never behaves that way but

1617
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
The fact that she

1618
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Perpetuates

1619
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
Stop

1620
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,248
If you can't not eat

1621
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,808
Just allowed because she's having a human experience

1622
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:57,696
How many people in USA adopted that worldview because they felt they didn't fit in on college campuses

1623
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,464
Is around the country

1624
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:03,328
How many times have you heard the story people falling in with dangerous group because they offered them a sense of

1625
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:04,864
Community which they thought they lack

1626
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,656
This is the story of so many calls

1627
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,680
For sure

1628
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:12,032
I believe it's important to treat people fall into these ideologies with a great deal of empathy

1629
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,824
And I still do have feelings

1630
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,432
However I also believe that the world we see in front of us

1631
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:25,088
We can't allow compassion to entirely blind us to the reality that a lot of the time people who enter ideologies beak

1632
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:26,112
Cousin motivations

1633
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,136
Empathize with

1634
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,672
Often end up becoming too

1635
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,976
Disseminators of the very same ideology

1636
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,280
Which is a behavior that cannot be at the thighs

1637
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,608
What tip the scales for me was when I was looking to see

1638
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
See if I could find Emily

1639
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:38,400
Books

1640
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,192
Today we come to understand your position

1641
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:40,960
A little bit better

1642
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,800
I couldn't find any PDFs or any real reviews of her books

1643
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
But I did find her blog

1644
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,920
What particularly caught my eye was a March 27th

1645
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:52,992
2015 post entitled quote what is a Jew

1646
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:02,464
In the post she argues that the Israelites went to Ireland after the invasion

1647
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:11,936
Conversely she argues almost all people who believe themselves to be Jews are not Jews and quote

1648
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,960
Do not have a gift

1649
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,496
God Yahweh

1650
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,264
Vita Vape

1651
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:20,384
She closes the post I'm sorry but you don't know your history very well

1652
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,688
And that's why the Anunnaki

1653
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:23,456
She had red hair

1654
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,504
Sure that's why there's a red B

1655
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:26,784
Perhaps

1656
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:32,928
So she's espousing British British Israelite

1657
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,464
She's perpetually these things

1658
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,488
Even if she

1659
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,256
He got stuck

1660
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
To this stuff

1661
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
I would never

1662
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,888
Do an episode about her

1663
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,168
If she wasn't

1664
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:48,032
I don't believe that she has a huge reach

1665
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,336
Necessarily on her own

1666
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,152
Exercising punch

1667
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:57,504
Down if we didn't episode like you Channel

1668
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,088
But Project Camelot still has a much larger audience than

1669
01:30:01,344 --> 01:30:05,184
As somebody who has something interesting to say about

1670
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,976
Defeat in human society

1671
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
On that channel

1672
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:12,864
She's being human societies

1673
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,168
This is not the first time she's

1674
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
She's someone who

1675
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
Carrie had her back on

1676
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:25,408
To a wider audience than then we have our

1677
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
Traceable back

1678
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:27,200
Back to

1679
01:30:27,456 --> 01:30:27,968
Do you like

1680
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,248
Islamophobic

1681
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,016
Gazelle it

1682
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,808
Christian identity

1683
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,928
Bulshit that's intentionally misleading about the

1684
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,952
Gospel of Barnabas

1685
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,280
Hopes videos about a grave

1686
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,584
He's still important

1687
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,608
That we talk

1688
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,144
Absolutely

1689
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:49,216
I think it's still very relevant to our worldview

1690
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,800
I don't know baby I'm being a little bit defensive because I do

1691
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,848
Prioritize empathy towards

1692
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:55,616
People

1693
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:58,176
And not wanting to beat up on people who were

1694
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:03,296
Struggling

1695
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,600
Mental illness that was driving

1696
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,624
Her

1697
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,696
Then I probably would feel like we shouldn't do this

1698
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:13,536
Able to tell I think that she's just

1699
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,304
Somebody

1700
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,328
Who believes

1701
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
F***** up things

1702
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,424
And whether or not paying her life letters

1703
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,496
She is now trying to disseminate

1704
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:23,264
These beliefs

1705
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,288
HEB

1706
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
Successful

1707
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:28,640
Apply for larger than ours so it's fair game today

1708
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,456
She's absolutely fit to stand trial

1709
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,248
So to speak

1710
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Like

1711
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
The impulse

1712
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,136
Be empathetic

1713
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,696
Uber

1714
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Overall

1715
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:45,792
Is is very good but

1716
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,096
It has to be tempered by a

1717
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,656
We can't let this s*** go

1718
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:51,424
Like that kind of

1719
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,240
Defensive position

1720
01:31:54,496 --> 01:32:00,640
Absolutely

1721
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Watching empathy

1722
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,688
Is a guidance

1723
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:08,576
When I try and operate through that it requires a lot of

1724
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,112
Questioning

1725
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,160
If it's appropriate

1726
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
Laugh

1727
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
Some of this

1728
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:22,144
Process decided

1729
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:22,912
Industry

1730
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,936
It is okay

1731
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:29,568
She posted on her f****** blog before she was a scary show

1732
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,360
Yeah

1733
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,896
CO2 mite

1734
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,176
About that

1735
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,200
But it is important

1736
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,736
To go through that process office

1737
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,040
Because if it if you don't it's too easy

1738
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
Fall on the wrong side

1739
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:45,696
We still respect

1740
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,488
But I disagree

1741
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:51,328
I can't I can't imagine that the end goal of empathy

1742
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,192
That doesn't make any sense to me the idea that

1743
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,472
We had that

1744
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
Being empathetic means allowing this

1745
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:01,312
S*** to go under

1746
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,176
You know what I'm saying because we understand where you're

1747
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,992
I understand where tons of people are coming Reno

1748
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:10,784
It's you go back to

1749
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:14,624
Cereal

1750
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,184
A lot of people were abused when they were children but they

1751
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,720
They didn't grow up to murderous

1752
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,144
Like this

1753
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,960
And I'm not making fun of about her

1754
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,800
Is her feelings of alienation from other people that to her too

1755
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,336
Decide

1756
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
She is talking to you

1757
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,736
Strange how you always agree but I would not make fun of

1758
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:44,576
If this was just an episode where she was talking about feeling

1759
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,184
You know did she now has

1760
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,208
A bunch of

1761
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
Communication with

1762
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,816
I wouldn't think that was appropriate

1763
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
It's where it extends

1764
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:03,776
To really dangerous ideas

1765
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:07,360
Towards Muslims and immigrant

1766
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,152
Enforcement of that

1767
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,200
Worldview

1768
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736
Very

1769
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,040
I mean there's no other way to put it

1770
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:19,648
Emeline with the world we talked about

1771
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:21,184
It's it's

1772
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:25,536
It what it is is like there is a version of what she

1773
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,072
He's talking about that I would never

1774
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,632
But unfortunately

1775
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,936
Put the

1776
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
Considered fair game

1777
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,800
Yeah no f*** her

1778
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:38,336
