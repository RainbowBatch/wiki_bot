Apologized

Jeff is Love of the Game lover the correct

112
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,695
So here's an out-of-context dropped from Today Show

113
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,231
It's on

114
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999

115
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Donkey Kong

116
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,911
Hell yeah alright well if we're talking Valentine's Day

00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,279
K rool is the leader of them

126
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,167
I just arrived there a problem

127
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:41,567
Is there beginning the show and we get into a particular

128
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
Really distasteful narrative that runs throughout this show

129
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,967
There is a a through-line that Alex

130
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
Who's going to have

131
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,551
About the vaccine causing HIV

132
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Okay

133
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
And we'll deal with this

134
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
As it goes but

135
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
All the major problem

136
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
Play face are run by the

137
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Our weakness

138
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:09,727
But we know exact

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
What's happening in Eastern Europe

140
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
On the borders of Russia

141
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Delete delete

142
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
We know exactly

143
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
What is going on

144
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Web spy

145
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
We know

146
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
Exactly what's going on with the deadly shot

147
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
Now confirm with Mainline stuff

148
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,743
Scientist

149
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
System

150
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,303
And give you

151
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,095
Beige

152
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Vade

153
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:40,703
Autoimmune

154
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Disorder

155
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,263
Oh my

156
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
God

157
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
Unprecedented Hy-Vee

158
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Cases worldwide

159
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,199
Sexuals including from saliva

160
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
Does a good job of allowing Alex

161
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
To become a parody of

162
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Themself

163
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,695
All the news ties together and there's just this one solitary story in the world

164
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:05,279
Everything that's happening is connected in each thing regardless of where

165
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
It's happening and who's involved

166
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,423
Globalist who are willing to destroy the world because they are so afraid

167
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,007
Did Alex and he's with his weirdo friends or Brittany

168
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
Embarrassingly childish level of analysis

169
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:25,247
Described as a dangerous way

170
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
Partially because of how it gives the audience permission to

171
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
To deal with information in their own lives this same way he's modeling that

172
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Behavior is like an appropriate thing to do

173
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,303
Maybe it's not covid in Ukraine all being

174
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
Connected but you

175
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
You can see how Alex's behavior is really just

176
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Kind of grandiose version of like a person

177
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:47,775
You think they got a parking ticket and that's part of a larger conspiracy against the

178
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
Everything is connected

179
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,223
Did get towed the night after I went to a stand-up comedy show when I was thinking maybe I want to do stand-up

180
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
And then obviously that was part of a conspiracy inside the Chicago

181
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:07,743
To keep me from getting back on stage that they do they read your mind

182
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:13,887
Actually now because you texted me about think about getting back into comedy so I could have

183
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
You've told them.

184
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,943
Comments I think he's just referring to an op-ed in the guardian that came out last week about how hiv-infected

185
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Intersexual people

186
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
I'm gay and bisexual men for the first time ever

187
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
These numbers were specific just

188
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,207
England but the reason for this isn't because Hy-Vee is now more dangerous or straight people

189
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,303
It's because there's a large number of gay and bisexual men who take prep

190
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
Which wasn't an option in the past

191
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,119
It's always Ivy rates

192
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,399
Have gone down drastic

193
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
The article itself in points

194
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Without

195
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
This isn't about it

196
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,311
Huge spike in HIV diagnosis among heterosexual

197
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
Instead is primarily the result of a sharps

198
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
Systane drop-in diagnosis among gay and bisexual

199
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
With a 71%

200
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Fall scents 24

201
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,903
Amazing there may be some small increases and HIV numbers this year and possibly last year within the

202
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Isn't because the vaccine is giving it

203
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
The people that's because there's a disruption of normal Medical Services

204
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
The pandemic

205
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Just Cause 2

206
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
Could could see a slight increase

207
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
In a lot of

208
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,495
Conditions as a as a side effect of fat

209
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,799
And I'm guessing that's why everything is just something out with

210
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
I would assume so I don't know where the

211
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
That well from his glands

212
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
Well that's life

213
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,575
You thought about the enchiladas which we know he loves them going

214
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,903
So Alex

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
He called

216
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,975
This whole thing about vax

217
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,535
Steve's giving you HIV

218
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
That I recall

219
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
He called it early

220
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:49,631
Figured out

221
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
We were able to

222
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Put the pieces together two years ago and

223
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Those reports are posted

224
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
Predictions

225
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
Section

226
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Again going back to

227
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
January February March

228
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
2020

229
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,159
Weapons laws and World laws

230
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
It gives you a new type of

231
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Autoimmune deficiency

232
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
Disorder that's much worse

233
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Buccaneers

234
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
Pick 6

235
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
What how would you know

236
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
That there are

237
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,671
I'd like condition

238
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,207
And it's almost

239
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,487
Completely

240
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
Pfizer and Merck

241
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Wait for it

242
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Eminem

243
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,543
NRA

244
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
HIV

245
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Vaccine

246
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,639
Only mitigate the

247
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,199
A little

248
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
As well

249
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
So suffice it to say just about everything in the eclipse

250
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Is made up or both

251
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
Bananas

252
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,415
Set said scientists are working on an mRNA HIV

253
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Fixing but that's not really news

254
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:23,071
Moderna was working on a promising candidate over a year ago and Alex's just mentioning it now because

255
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,399
There was some news that it's entering the phase one human trial

256
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
I mean after work

257
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
You've seen the f

258
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
Fricassee of the MRNA

259
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
Covid vaccine

260
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,823
On such a large I would be surprised

261
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
As if there's literally an mRNA vaccine being developed

262
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
For everything but as we speak cholo application

263
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:42,271
They're pretty high

264
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
Yeah yeah

265
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:49,439
Because time and dormancy is a subject that Alex is talking about Visa V this vaccine

266
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Hy-Vee

267
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:57,119
I can be fairly certain that what happened here is that Alex saw a headline about how researchers identified a new variant of HIV

268
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
In the Netherlands and he's making up a scary story about it from his imagine

269
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:05,567
This Newberry to seem to develop into AIDS quicker than other variants

270
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,383
But also the existing treatments appear to be equally effective

271
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
If against it

272
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:12,991
Honestly it seems like even more of a reason to work on that mRNA vaccine

273
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:13,759
Yeah

274
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,623
It's tough to tell how much of this is Alex just pulling things from his imagination and how much of it is take

275
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
King from sites like natural news

276
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
Which have been pushing the evade

277
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,231
Xydia

278
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,815
It's not based on any science or studies or papers though

279
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,143
It's just rooted in comments made by members of the anti-vax lunatic

280
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,935
The group America's Frontline doctors

281
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
This is in case you forgotten the group it included Stella Immanuel and also they had a website where you can pay a doctor to prescribe u i

282
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Ivermectin are Hydrox

283
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Chloroquine

284
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,551
Also that website that they did that through was run by Jerome corsi

285
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
So I did like that reminder though

286
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,903
Alex has a section on his website

287
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,975
Predictions that he's gotten right eye I can't believe that

288
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,999
Metro

289
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,535
Tonight's good time to

290
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Check in on what's on my page

291
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Call boy

292
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
I can't imagine it like we've gotten a few things that have been like oh weirdly similar

293
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Joking about accidentally

294
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,103
Maybe seeming fairly accurate

295
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
I can't imagine

296
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,407
What kind of

297
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,711
Dork I would have to be to be like

298
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:22,111
Check out the damn freezing I mean you're the one who's going to have to edit it I don't remember what you

299
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,903
You predicted today

300
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,975
Alex's

301
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Call Alec

302
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:33,887
Alex Jones told you everything about Chemtrails in 29 2009

303
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,215
I don't I'm not sure how correct that prediction is on his part

304
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
That's weird

305
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
Here's another one

306
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:43,615
Alex Jones at Alan watt discuss mind control via

307
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,151
EMF waves

308
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
I didn't know that wanted to

309
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
Is that a prediction

310
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
If you just

311
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Even his prediction is just

312
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
We discussed some

313
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:57,183
Control I mean I guess if you predicted that you were going to

314
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,975
To chat with him about that then

315
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
A good prediction

316
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,327
This list of predictions is completely f*****

317
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
One of them is quote

318
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
Fake alien invasion

319
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
False flag exposed in 2008

320
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:14,079
We experienced a fake Alien Invasion full flag is I feel like that would need to happen

321
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
For Alex to clean but he got the

322
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
You would need to

323
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
Experience.

324
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
Yes

325
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,223
But have you considered that it

326
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
It did and you just don't know about

327
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,879
Or he made the prediction that because of the predicted being made it didn't happen

328
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,159
How fun

329
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
A buddy some of these are just too vague

330
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,511
Do you really know what they mean but then there's things like

331
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
He's only gotten right if you

332
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,607
Except Alex as the sole source

333
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,911
About whether or not he's been right

334
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,215
Princeton's quote Alex Jones

335
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,263
Coronavirus engineered bioweapon

336
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,847
Proven correct but Alex's information

337
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Space treats it as if it's been proven

338
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,479
Tickets to pretend

339
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Look at seems like

340
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,551
That is that is cheating

341
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
That's brutal

342
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
There's ones that is our true at all

343
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,023
Infowars predicted door-to-door vaccination

344
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,327
Maybe some vaccines are offered

345
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,959
People in their home so I guess I'm going to like the availability of on-demand vaccination could be seen as an accurate prediction

346
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
But the video image says quote Forrest inoculations are here so this one's bulshit is

347
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,407
With guns going holthaus

348
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,247
You or shooting you a heads-up

349
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,575
One-armed I'm biking back makeup

350
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Yeah

351
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,415
This page is full of s*** but mysteriously absent are

352
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
Thousands of prediction

353
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
Very specific

354
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Entirely wrong

355
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,399
Just this week he predicted A Car Bomb false flag of the Ottawa Convoy on Sunday morning

356
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
Sure that was

357
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,727
Incorrect I can't count the number of times

358
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,543
Predicted an imminent nuking of u.s. City often

359
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
Chicago and here I sit

360
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
On nuked City

361
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,967
Embarrassing attempt to log reputation in history

362
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
Probably get more in

363
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,039
Into exactly what it

364
00:17:59,295 --> 00:17:59,807
Steph

365
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
You said butt

366
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
We've done 650 episodes about it already

367
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
I see now that

368
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,207
The type of page that we would do

369
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:12,607
Which is an obsessive chronicling of literally every single prediction we've ever made along with weather

370
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,887
Whether or not it turned out

371
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,423
The way that we predicted it

372
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Usher our percentage will be

373
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
Incredibly low

374
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,567
But that's how accurate we are we want to make sure you know

375
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,103
TriStar Productions

376
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
There was a part

377
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Has me that wanted

378
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
Until like haha I'm going to go through all of Alex's prediction

379
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,063
I can't

380
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:38,463
No we do not have a team of 300 researchers with the next 2 weeks on their hands

381
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:44,351
Might be fun to create an alternate page like all of these things that he's predicted to have not come true

382
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Dialects with guns

383
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:48,191
Top of the list

384
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,495
So Alex shift over from this

385
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:52,799
This medical narrative into talking about

386
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
Ukraine Chelan

387
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Oh man

388
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
8 years ago

389
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
And brag

390
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
5 billion dollars

391
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,031
Okay so Alex's referring to a 2014 interview

392
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,359
The George Soros day with fries acharya aunt

393
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
You can look it up

394
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,199
And you'll find that he doesn't brag about overthrowing

395
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:35,807
He's worried about Putin's efforts to destabilize Ukraine and here's the

396
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:36,831
Exchange that Alec

397
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:37,855
Mischaracterizing

398
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,391
Zakaria asks

399
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Quotev

400
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
First on Ukraine

401
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,071
Things that many people recognized about you was that you do during the Revolutions of 1989

402
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
Funded a lot of dissident activities

403
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Civil Society groups in

404
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,447
Eastern Europe in Poland to the check

405
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
Republic are you doing similar things in Ukraine

406
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,799
Soros replies quote

407
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,151
Well I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia

408
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
And the foundation has been sunk

409
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Thingiverse

410
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,503
Who played an important part in events now

411
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,135
The term dissident activities here refers to activities that are opposing and authoritarian government

412
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695
Things like Free Press organization

413
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,743
There was just saying that the

414
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
The foundation he set up in

415
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:20,351
Ukraine is that an impact on the transition from being under Soviet rule

416
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
The present-day where it's at

417
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Independent

418
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,471
It's not a matter of interpretation Alex's just

419
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
Lying about this club in soros's

420
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
It's just

421
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
I'm sorry

422
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:35,455
Could you read that one more time

423
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,735
I heard you say

424
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,039
So proud

425
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
Hahaha but I

426
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:46,719
Thinking back

427
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:53,119
Final a billion-dollar real gaslighting

428
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,239
I remember anything about it

429
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,055
Alex

430
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
Planet

431
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Haha

432
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,455
I don't think Alex would be at scatterblast

433
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
Movie Into The Rat box

434
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
Yes

435
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,807
So look

436
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
Alex is gout

437
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,111
Some interesting feeling

438
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,416
About the situation in Ukraine and Russia

439
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,768
His analysis is stupid and I don't really care too much about it

440
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
There's something

441
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
The underlying

442
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,352
Some of these comments

443
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,376
That I found

444
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Really weird

445
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
In coming days and push back

446
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Why are you saying

447
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:46,112
Because it's poking the Russians over and over again while they accelerate the attack

448
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
Russian controlled areas in the east of Ukraine

449
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Is a proxy war

450
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Indoor Regional War

451
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Into a World War

452
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:02,752
Rates I think he responded exactly the part that I felt a little bit strange.

453
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,848
Find the Russian control portions of another sovereign country

454
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,872
Yeah

455
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:10,432
Confused as to what we're doing here

456
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,504
Are our borders that has been in

457
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
Encroach by another country

458
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,648
That's weird

459
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:24,512
Keep send stuff like that multiple times and it's just normal

460
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:25,536
But I don't think

461
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,376
You said if it was a different country that rocks

462
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
Look just because

463
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,192
The UK has

464
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:36,288
I don't know anywhere between 10:00 and 15 colonies

465
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,128
In the United States that any s*** I already wrote the bed

466
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,920
Nevermind

467
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
Mexico was like occupying

468
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,600
Well you know what he going to do

469
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,672
Where we're going to start a World War over this

470
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Is it worth it

471
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,744
Can you take some Michigan

472
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,280
Whatever

473
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,328
Not

474
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
This is the whole issue right this isn't the problem is occupied

475
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:10,848
You get the fundamental problem here I feel like you're just on the Russians

476
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Yeah that's what you're saying

477
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
Blue Lake

478
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,016
Here's another clip of him just casually throwing away that like

479
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
Hey Russia is taken part of Ukraine

480
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:23,904
Russia is

481
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Russia

482
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Ukraine

483
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,008
Russia now says that us and NATO are building up weapons

484
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,800
AR

485
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,640
Swai fish

486
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,664
Why

487
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,688
Arapaima

488
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Just blown away

489
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,736
I don't understand

490
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
Mohican

491
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:55,392
Because I don't think that this is consistent with his earlier positions that I've heard him Express

492
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Just

493
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Just say you want to give Miami to Cuba

494
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
The Cuban

495
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
There's enough Cubans in Miami

496
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,144
They get it now okay is that how it works fine

497
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,544
I don't know or I mean like just come out with it and say that you believe that Russia has the right to invade

498
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
If they believe that very

499
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Just extrapolate that out and

500
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
Say UALR into the Soviet Bloc returning

501
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Soviet Bloc was

502
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,184
Really stoked about trying to be more than

503
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
How big it was

504
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,512
So you might as well say that

505
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
I think

506
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,328
The politburo should rule the world

507
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:40,192
We may be like slippery slope and get here a little bit

508
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
It's not like

509
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,776
It's not totally disc

510
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,544
Connect it

511
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:49,920
It's not really a slippery slope if somebody stated objectives

512
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
AR

513
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
What you think

514
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,272
Slippery

515
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Slippery slope

516
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,576
Alex

517
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,600
Agrees with it that

518
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,488
The kernel of it is kind of

519
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,256
Give the same

520
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,792
There is a wreck

521
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,072
Nation on Alex's bar

522
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,632
In 2014 took part of

523
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Ukraine

524
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
If that's fine

525
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,448
Was

526
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
Well it wasn't but now it

527
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,616
Is that kind of what he's doing is kind of doing just like this wave wave like

528
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,200
Look if you wanted me mad rush about taking over Ukraine

529
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:29,600
You had 2014 and you did nothing about it so they get it all help because I I know that I've heard

530
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Alex in the past David

531
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
Isn't what happened

532
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
And that Russia is like

533
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
Like the Crimea is actually

534
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,560
No it's actually part of Russia

535
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:44,448
Call Great Knoll a crate

536
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
Most of the people there speak Russian

537
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
And like

538
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
The wave

539
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
He's talking about it now he's

540
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,872
Is different than the way he's talked about this

541
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Situation of the past

542
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,176
Recognizing

543
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
Budweiser came in

544
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:57,504
And whenever

545
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,088
Samaria whenever we do this again in a couple of years our lesson

546
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,856
China's take

547
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Can Taiwan back

548
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,672
Whose side is Alex going to be on

549
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,488
You know I think

550
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,584
I know but he hates the Chinese but he also is against

551
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Clearly it's

552
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,936
If it's wearing a similar situation

553
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
It's not Russia he doesn't

554
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
But you can invite

555
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
That's fair

556
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,432
Because Putin so Christian except for

557
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,528
Fraud

558
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,344
So this is this is this is a strange

559
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:38,208
The gullibility and the cheapest of the public

560
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Brought these

561
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
The wolves

562
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,536
Not your fault

563
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,632
Me and I even describe.

564
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
Incredible future

565
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
We've got to get

566
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
These satanic forces

567
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,736
We can do unlimited things together

568
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Is unlimited

569
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Potential Unlimited

570
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,976
You need cuddles

571
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
You will have total victory

572
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
If you want

573
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
You can't see the devil you can't see.

574
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:27,360
The formulation if you can't see the devil you can't see God is a very bizarre theological stance

575
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:31,968
Actually makes total sense in the context of Alex's stupid brain and his oppositional nature

576
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
His

577
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:39,136
Underlying premise that must be true for the statement to be true

578
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,976
And that is the only path to seeing God is to first see the devil

579
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,840
This implies that the only path to Christianity is aleksandr is through the devil

580
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,912
You encounter the devil then you see God in

581
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
In contrast

582
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,544
God in this understanding appreciates on its own

583
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,616
God is really only understood in opposition

584
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,640
To the devil

585
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,200
This actually makes a lot of sense for Alex

586
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,272
Because it's essentially how he operates enforcement matters to

587
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,552
Everything is defined

588
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,832
Solely by opposition

589
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Which is to say

590
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:16,768
Defined as good because it is against the thing Alex has decided he's bad so this we can put into

591
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:23,168
Do we can put this on another in the column of things that would suggest Alex himself as a

592
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
Satan worshiper

593
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:28,032
Because Satan would obviously assume God only exists

594
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
In relation to himself

595
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
So I'm going to go ahead and say yet again

596
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
Alex is a saint

597
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,736
Let me think about it like in politics

598
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,064
It's only really are rooted out of

599
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Fear and pain

600
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,880
12 discovering

601
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,416
Nonsense about the global

602
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:50,048
Write the evil and the good in opposition to the evil

603
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,840
That is in the world

604
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,376
Because it has to

605
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
To stop the

606
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
Right of which we all are

607
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,520
Simultaneous hit it's really strange but like

608
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,056
A b kind of

609
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Take me to make sense

610
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
Narcissistic

611
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,968
Yeah but it's also stupid

612
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,992
Yes

613
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
Which is how most nurse

614
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:11,808
Psychopaths

615
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
You're not wrong

616
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Too much

617
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Further in

618
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,024
To the the vaccine HIV thing because it's nonsense

619
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,376
And there's not really a whole lot to even break down

620
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:30,496
Skip ahead to where Alex does a really long Dracula impression

621
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,288
How about George Soros

622
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Do they found the club

623
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:36,640
Alive right now but

624
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
Ukraine

625
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,136
War with Russia prachi by George Soros

626
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:57,120
Turn on the front of that we posted

627
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,032
Blah blah

628
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:12,992
Crowley rituals what do we do

629
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
What is happening

630
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,536
Prince Charles

631
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
George Soros

632
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,472
Really a good sign

633
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:39,872
Impression or whatever when you have to say I am blank in the middle of it started out as

634
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:42,944
Is Dracula Edmund slowly tilted towards

635
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Like all this that has like

636
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:48,832
Hey Ridgeview we got to get up

637
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,136
Prince Charles where to get a picnic basket

638
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,464
I didn't know that Sarah's work

639
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,232
Looking for

640
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,048
Charles event that seems like news

641
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
She at

642
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,912
I think Alex was thinking of Prince Philip but he's also dead

643
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
Weather

644
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,216
11

645
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
I don't think Soros needs to work

646
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:07,776
Royalty

647
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:11,616
Hold on I have to take a step back I think it's a reference

648
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
2

649
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,944
Expect Prince Charles

650
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Is descended from dragon

651
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:22,880
From Pennsylvania probably what that was

652
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:26,464
British royalty is somehow dragged

653
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
Keep a keeper blind

654
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:31,840
So speaker

655
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
Thanks for the inline

656
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Where am I

657
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
Another appearance

658
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472
Rodger Stone

659
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,104
Since becoming around a lot really really needs money

660
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,272
Is Rodger Stone

661
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
But we came up for air lap

662
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
Never really brought back to Fox like he was

663
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
4 years ago in 2017

664
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,864
He came out and said Trump was being spied on and seconded us

665
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
He was marked for Destruction

666
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
I've been through hell

667
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,784
Warriors thinking you battle-scarred and punished

668
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
The fourth leg of the Russia hoax

669
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
War with Russia

670
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,888
Well Alex, it's great to be back with you

671
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Well said

672
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
Alex and Rodger doing a Victory lap

673
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,848
Because they're just parroting the right-wing media has erroneous claims about this new filing from

674
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
Special counsel John Durham

675
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,920
Regarding accusation

676
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,712
Sunset Michael Sussman a Cypress

677
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
Security lawyer

678
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,576
Had lied to the FBI in an interview about the Trump campaign

679
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Potential Rush

680
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Spintires

681
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
It's very complicated but it's all about you.

682
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,304
The Durham filing wasn't reporting any new information and the coverage evident right with medians

683
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
Been totally inaccurate

684
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
To create this perception

685
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
That it proves that Hillary was spying on Trump

686
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
It doesn't prove any such thing and

687
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
I think that Alex

688
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Rodger

689
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
Like to use it to get

690
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
But I mean

691
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,920
They were right all along

692
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Everything

693
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,576
Absolument up for air lap

694
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
I do I've never I mean I've watched

695
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
Some professional swimming Olympics

696
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
Swimming

697
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
In the last Olympics

698
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,048
And they were swept by Katie Ledecky

699
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Not one lap.

700
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Did she just

701
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
A whole lot

702
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
That's hard

703
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,848
Do do let's just do a quick take a breather lap

704
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
Via the thing

705
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,176
The thing here is that

706
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Alex

707
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Is

708
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:56,992
Heal

709
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
Always refers to this

710
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:02,368
This globe luster holding me underwater and then you get away and get my breath

711
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,416
You got to get a big breath in order to

712
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,976
Sustain yourself next time you get there.

713
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,304
Yes yeah and so like that

714
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
So Rodger is an interest

715
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,936
Thought that actually I was like

716
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
Wow you're right

717
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,752
That is not

718
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,592
I'm the only person you know

719
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,664
Who was actually investigated during Watergate

720
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
And also investigate enduring russiagate

721
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,504
I went

722
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,784
At age 19

723
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
Before the Watergate

724
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,344
Grand jury

725
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
Then as now

726
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,184
I did nothing wrong

727
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,840
Wild you are the only person who's mixed up in Watergate and the Russia investigation

728
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,400
Really are the f****** Forrest Gump of

729
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,680
You know what

730
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:52,288
You can have a couple other things so that last like the Brooks Brothers riot

731
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:56,896
Stop the steel effort to the 2016 elections the latter which

732
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,432
Who's connected to the event January

733
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
I think Rodger selling himself short of his lobbying for evil governments over the years I mean this is a

734
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,440
This is a man who if you have murdered more than 100,000 people

735
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,976
You know Rodger Stone into

736
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:16,608
Connecting thread through a lot more than just Watergate and the Russia investigation

737
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,144
Conover

738
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Man

739
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
That's such a weird

740
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,544
Sometimes you see those like pathway through history and

741
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,104
You just see some a****** like Rodger Stone pop-up

742
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
I need to be more characters in reality I'm sick of it

743
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
How is it possible

744
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:39,136
Somebody stop him how old is nobody it's like oh it's like when you see the Joker get out of Arkham Asylum again

745
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
Do you like Jesus Christ

746
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,208
Put it somewhere darker

747
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,280
In that case it's like

748
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Narrative ksenia

749
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,912
Reality shouldn't require Zach

750
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Joe Rogers

751
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:54,240
Some stuff to say about this Durham filing

752
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,544
It's not really not really

753
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
This is the greatest single

754
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152
Political scandal

755
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,432
In American history

756
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
This is the greatest show

757
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Single no

758
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,784
Abuse of power

759
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
That we have ever seen

760
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Let's just find it

761
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
If we met

762
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Barack Obama

763
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
And Hillary

764
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,024
With the approval of Vice President Joe Biden

765
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,864
Who was in the room when this was all approved

766
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:23,936
Use

767
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:26,752
Authority of the United States government

768
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,616
And the extraordinary capability of our intelligence agencies

769
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,408
To spy on

770
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,224
And there and thus

771
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,016
Launch an investigation

772
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,296
To remove

773
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
A duly elected

774
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,624
President of the United States

775
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Donald Trump

776
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:47,744
Against the people against the Republic

777
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
So none of its proven in the Durham silent

778
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,912
This is a bit complicated so I'm just going to read this

779
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,496
From a New York Times article that explains the information in the filing

780
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,776
Concise manner

781
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,872
The filing was ostensibly about potential conflict

782
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,224
But it also recounted a meeting at which Mr sauceman

783
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,504
Presented other suspicions

784
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
When's to the government

785
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
In February 2017 Mr susman told the

786
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,904
The CIA about internet data suggest

787
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,464
Thing that someone using a russian-made smartphone

788
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,232
May have been

789
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:22,048
Connecting to networks at Trump Tower and the White House

790
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,328
Among other places

791
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,144
Mr. Sussman I had obtained the information

792
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,472
A client a technology executive named Rodney Jones

793
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,336
Another paragraph in the court filing said that Mr Joss company newstar

794
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
Had to help maintain

795
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
Internet-related servers for the White House

796
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,480
And that he and his associates quote

797
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
Exploited this arrangement

798
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:45,344
By mining certain records to gather derogatory information

799
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
About mr. Trump

800
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Gotcha

801
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,952
They're a couple of very important clarifications that are missed

802
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
Spivey

803
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Reporting on this filing

804
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
The first is that there was a

805
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
Spying on Trump in the white

806
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
And that's not even with this is referring to

807
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,472
The DNS logs from the White House that are used in the analysis

808
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:04,032
The Obama

809
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,848
After the Russian hacking happened

810
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
Began an investigation into possible malware in the White House

811
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,992
In particular russian-made phone device

812
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,784
Yotaphone

813
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Connecting

814
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,320
Genetworx

815
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,368
As they were researching this matter they

816
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,416
The data from NuStar to attempt

817
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,720
How to find other potential breaches of security

818
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
In terms of yotaphone

819
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:24,768
Connect

820
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
That works

821
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,328
And in the process they found indication

822
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
Their Communications with you.

823
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
The servers and Russia coming

824
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,984
From networks in the White House Trump Tower

825
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
And Mr Trump's Central Park West

826
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,688
This was where the information came from not from any spying on trump it was from researching

827
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,456
Dental relief

828
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,504
Compromise networks in the wake of the

829
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
What is the Rogers

830
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,576
Is this making s*** up

831
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
Which is

832
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,624
Who's cutting his bread-and-butter

833
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,720
Yeah yeah I mean it's way better than saying

834
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,768
No no I was totally convicted

835
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
Did for a reasonable and logical reasons

836
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
Frankly I got off light

837
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,424
The actual should I did if I told you

838
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
Boy you ready

839
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,776
Sounds like buddy you don't even f******

840
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
You thought I found religion this time

841
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Find if you guys

842
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:20,320
Accused me of my real cry

843
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,088
Strong

844
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,648
So you talked about lying about his case

845
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
Actually comes up

846
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,488
We do know that

847
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,304
Former Director of National toast

848
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
1000 pages of evidence

849
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Which implicate

850
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,984
Not only John Brennan

851
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
But also the former CIA director

852
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,384
But also former FBI director Comey another words

853
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,944
Both of them were informed

854
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,248
Did Trump was being surveilled

855
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,272
Both of them

856
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Chose to use the

857
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
The falls

858
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,880
Narrative of Russian collusion

859
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,696
Open investigations and a smear

860
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
The president

861
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,536
When I tried to say this during my own trial

862
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,816
I was gagged

863
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,888
When I tried

864
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:09,216
Expert testimony forensic evidence

865
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
I was barred

866
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
That defense

867
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:18,944
I don't know what evidence has or hasn't been turned over and neither does Rodger so we'll see what happens on that front

868
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
The beginning of that clip

869
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
Justice

870
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
His trial is b*******

871
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,368
He was gagged because he was posting threatening s*** online about the judge in the

872
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:30,976
In the case of every opportunity to call witnesses or any kind of Defense you wanted to be

873
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,000
Chose

874
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
Not too

875
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,792
That was some

876
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:36,096
He specifically chose not

877
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
To do

878
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,168
There's a Brazen no rewriting this

879
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
It's exactly what you

880
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,496
Yeah it's like

881
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,800
It's like he's f****** I mean

882
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,592
It's weird this

883
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Tortured

884
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,688
Simile but it is a little bit like he's Kirby

885
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
From Kirby's Dream Land

886
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,576
He just sucks it inside of a man transforms in a newbie

887
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,136
About it like your trial head

888
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
What are you talkative they wouldn't let me

889
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,256
They wouldn't let me introduce evidence

890
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:15,008
Saying that you did everything you responded everything I'd really turned over every type of railroad

891
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,872
Guinness down I mean obviously I spent a lot of money on lawyers and then

892
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,712
I think that their argument really Falls

893
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,504
The part

894
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,552
Look at it

895
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
Like

896
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
They don't present themselves

897
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,136
As blameless

898
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
And everybody else's

899
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Screwing them over it becomes

900
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,512
Only too obvious that they are up to no good

901
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:37,792
Yeah

902
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,816
Yeah

903
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,144
What is already too obvious they're up to no good

904
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,168
Not as they are

905
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:47,008
Future is blameless

906
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,104
So more stuff

907
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,175
And I don't know it's just a bunch of dots

908
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,199
I don't really care

909
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,015
Sonic skip ahead to where Alex talks about

910
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,063
The tomorrow about the Durham report

911
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
Existing

912
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,415
For the ones that

913
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
On the payroll

914
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,079
And so important such a big deal

915
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:22,847
Doesn't want

916
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
What's the news

917
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,199
But you're not want the news out right now

918
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:29,759
Filed from

919
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Groups

920
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Candida servers and do all that

921
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
To the news

922
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
National Security

923
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Going so

924
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,655
It's always the top lawyer isn't it

925
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
It's always

926
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,191
Just about

927
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:54,079
Prestigious lawyer in the world about the matter of Clinton

928
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:54,847
Things are the actual

929
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
Point of the Durham filing

930
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
It's not actually an issue at all

931
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
If Michael Sussman had been

932
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Billing decline

933
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,295
One campaign for research he was doing

934
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:07,391
What's the reality is that Sussman work for a Perkins coie

935
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
Who's contracted for a flat

936
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,719
Retainer by the Clinton campaign

937
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,535
There's no evidence that Sussman himself actually was

938
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,071
In contact with the campaign

939
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,095
That's

940
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
The issues

941
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,447
That Durham is a representation

942
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,031
Shouldn't be allowed to be his legal counsel

943
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:27,615
Because he claims they have a conflict of interest having represented other folks

944
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,407
In terms of the Russia investigation

945
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
In the course of

946
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
Also claimed

947
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,063
To the FBI when he said that he didn't have any clients when he met with them

948
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,623
And provided information about the yotaphone matter

949
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,159
But for what it's worth

950
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,255
Sussman's lawyer

951
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
He never claimed to have no class

952
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Right so

953
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
We will see what happens here but there made

954
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,935
Not even be

955
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:53,727
Would be a little bit unwell

956
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:55,775
I would be surprised if a lawyer

957
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
Claims to have no clue

958
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
Don't be a little surprising right

959
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,175
Yeah really

960
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
Not doing anything right now guys I'm not trying to sell you on ship

961
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,039
Because nobody's hiring

962
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Anyways I'll work for you

963
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:13,439
Oz just responding to right-wing headlines about this filing and then

964
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,023
Connecting Woody imagines they say to other narratives he's working on

965
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
Hey it's just completely detached

966
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
From reality

967
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,119
So Rodger takes off

968
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,471
Farewell Rodger Rodger Stone legal defense

969
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
They did do some

970
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,031
Other plugging

971
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:30,079
But we don't need to belabor the point

972
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
Alex goes back from break

973
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:36,735
With the the cell Teresa ultrasound

974
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,551
Car horns

975
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:46,207
Freedom worldwide

976
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:50,303
Martial law Krusty the peaceful truckers who don't want to be forcibly context

977
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,607
MRNA

978
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,983
So so good

979
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,335
Back we heard Alex the interview a guy named Jeremy Mackenzie about the

980
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,407
The Ottowa Convoy and we discussed

981
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:10,527
But I wanted to loop back to this because I've learned some new information about Mackenzie since that episode

982
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
He's a Nazi

983
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:16,415
Defacto leader of a group called The Plaid Army

984
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,023
Who have been described as I felt bad already about about already bad

985
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:27,423
Well I always I hear they like that I'm kind of like well you know the Bosstones

986
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,447
Call bad in plaid

987
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,543
Lizard neo-fascist

988
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,103
We believe in the creation of a cup

989
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
Country called

990
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Diya Gollum

991
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:42,783
This country would include the Canadian provinces of Alberta Saskatchewan the Northern Territories

992
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
And the Yukon

993
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:48,159
But also would extend down and diagonally through the United States

994
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,511
It would also include Alaska Idaho Montana Wyoming

995
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,559
The Dakotas Iowa Missouri

996
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,375
Nebraska Oklahoma Utah Colorado

997
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:02,239
Alabama Louisiana Texas tennessee-kentucky the Carolinas Georgia-Florida

998
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
Mississippi

999
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:03,775
And Kansas

1000
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,311
What don't they get

1001
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:10,175
Would it just be the Northeast the West Coast

1002
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
In case this needs to be stressed Alex was endorsing and piling around or the guy who believes that about half of the US states should leave the

1003
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,903
The union informal weird diagonal country across

1004
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,927
Northern

1005
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
North America

1006
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:27,071
Yeah so this group is also notably accelerationist and that poses a really

1007
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:31,167
Serious concern that they might be the exact sort of folks who would see these protests

1008
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,191
Flashpoint

1009
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,055
The escalate into outright violence they view as necessary to create the world that they want to see

1010
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:40,895
With a weird diagonal country across North America

1011
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,943
Guess you're really not going to be able to negotiate

1012
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,735
I don't think so

1013
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:49,087
This makes it really troubling that even prior to his appearance of Alex

1014
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,391
Mckenzie was arrested for possession of

1015
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,159
5 restrict

1016
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:52,927
Firearms

1017
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,743
Prohibited magazines body armor and ammunition

1018
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:59,839
On top of that on Monday at 13 people were arrested at

1019
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
Coats

1020
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,143
Border crossing

1021
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
Where are there were protests

1022
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,703
What's happening

1023
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,519
And in the process a cache of guns and armor with c

1024
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
You sure

1025
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,103
There was a patch on the body armor that was seized that said

1026
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:11,871
Diego Luna

1027
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:17,503
Which might be construed to imply that MacKenzie's GroupMe of that at least partial ownership of this weapon

1028
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,831
Since cashcrates is really f****** scared

1029
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
Being a pseudo Nazi it looks like MacKenzie

1030
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,071
That socialist countries

1031
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:37,983
It's right next door to the Convoy

1032
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,543
I was hoping you were going to say that you did

1033
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,383
Discovered he was an aspiring country star

1034
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,175
No he's not

1035
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
I don't know it and

1036
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Listen

1037
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
I don't think that

1038
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
The punishment bureaucracy

1039
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,231
And I don't even think you should be put in prison

1040
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,511
Having a bunch of

1041
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
Illegal

1042
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,119
But I don't think you should be allowed to have any weapons after that

1043
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,143
0 weapons

1044
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,167
After you get caught

1045
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
With a lot of illegal weapon

1046
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:15,103
I believe that there are I think part of his like parole or whatever does involved he can't have

1047
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,151
At least

1048
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,967
Yeah but if you're a terrorist

1049
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,759
With a lot of weapons

1050
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,783
And they get it

1051
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
Skip

1052
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
So I look

1053
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,671
That was a bad guest

1054
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,719
Alex's Park

1055
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,279
Add note that the future will make it look

1056
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,047
Like a great book

1057
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Don't know

1058
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,935
But I would say that this next book

1059
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:40,959
Maybe worse

1060
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
This guy

1061
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,775
Holyshit

1062
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:50,175
I expected nothing out of this interview cuz it's just another one of these like hydroxychloroquine Ivermectin doctors

1063
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,455
Marble

1064
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,015
I think I've heard him on the show

1065
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,575
Before because he he made a website called like my

1066
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
A free doctor

1067
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,159
Where he'll prescribe ivermectin for people

1068
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,951
And stop the very hot

1069
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,255
Industry

1070
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,583
Sounds great Blown Away

1071
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
This interview is

1072
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
While

1073
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
Okay this guy is

1074
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,471
Doctor marble

1075
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
He's lost his f***

1076
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,543
That's what I would say

1077
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,359
Man

1078
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
Is the

1079
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:33,183
Travis president

1080
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:37,023
I would drop a bomb on the world economic Forum in Davos the next time they meet

1081
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,583
In the plandemic

1082
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
Yeah they're the enemy

1083
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,079
Gates of Hell George Soros

1084
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,383
All all those leaders

1085
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
Marxist Mark Zuckerberg

1086
00:49:55,967 --> 00:50:00,319
Etc etc

1087
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,647
Put on the world

1088
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,695
This is really letting this dude talk

1089
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,583
Yeah he wants to

1090
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,399
Bomb of the world economic forum

1091
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,447
I mean who Among Us has not thought

1092
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
They're all there

1093
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,079
This is this is a little bit more extreme and some of the language that usually get

1094
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
Gets thrown around

1095
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Politically

1096
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:28,991
He says I were president I would bomb the world economic

1097
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,783
I don't think it would

1098
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
Get the results

1099
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
He thinks it

1100
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,647
I know I think it would be satisfying

1101
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,487
A very short. Of time but then the problems that would arise from it might be

1102
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,535
Might be an issue I would assume so

1103
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Also those dorky ass names

1104
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:48,191
Videos for everybody like that's one of the real sort of

1105
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,263
I mean it's a minor problem but it's really annoying

1106
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,311
The lineage of the assertive

1107
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
The legacy of Troy

1108
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Giving people

1109
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Nicknames

1110
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,175
Derisive

1111
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:01,759
I mean is it you made it really popular like the right

1112
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,551
Legacy of Nick Cannon's Wild n Out

1113
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Look

1114
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:11,487
Obviously roast culture number on this in the right-wing in particular I think Trump

1115
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:13,535
Calling people like Little Marco and stuff

1116
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
That's what they are

1117
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:19,167
Trying to recreate the excitement of

1118
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
Of that

1119
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
They thought it was funny

1120
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:27,615
See the thing that made it funny was that it was Trump doing it and he is an inherently

1121
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,639
Cartoonish

1122
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:34,271
Right. George Soros

1123
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
You're just an idiot

1124
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,879
And you sound stupid you sound like a child

1125
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
Mark

1126
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
Yeah

1127
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,487
He has somehow managed

1128
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,071
Mr. Magoo as a child his way through life

1129
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:51,423
Consider his contacts

1130
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,031
Marco Rubio Little Marco like on stage

1131
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,055
In a debate

1132
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,079
Or something is

1133
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,431
An entirely inappropriate setting for that kind of why

1134
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,967
It's notable

1135
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,015
Is you talking s*** on a podcast

1136
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:10,111
Alex isn't really really all that like

1137
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,159
Edgy

1138
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:12,927
And I think it's

1139
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,695
Mainly Edge

1140
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
Because they

1141
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:15,999
Especially for

1142
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:20,607
Trump's way of doing it it's cuz it's directed at people who are so thin-skinned they can't help

1143
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:27,007
But be like Jerry called me Little Marco and are definitely not used to that

1144
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,311
Everybody agrees to be professional

1145
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
So

1146
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
This dude

1147
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,175
Are marbles

1148
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Ben marble

1149
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,735
Has

1150
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
An interesting theory about what

1151
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,599
Really made this

1152
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
This pandemic

1153
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,183
Not enough bombs on the world economic

1154
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
Certainly that is probably part of it

1155
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,791
But he has a theory that it's

1156
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
Political correct

1157
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
This is a bioterrorism

1158
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:57,471
Program no-doubt-about-it in the

1159
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
Single

1160
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,383
I would also

1161
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
The globalist a Davos

1162
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,951
Is the Great Big Sea depth.

1163
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:22,815
Oh you know what your five-year-old to be talked about transgenderism you're racist

1164
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
Paper tiger

1165
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,935
It's like The Wizard of Oz

1166
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
It's a hoax

1167
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:37,151
Yep did this fear of being called a racist everybody will go to extreme lengths to avoid being called a racist

1168
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:40,479
Political correctness

1169
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,743
Killed around the world

1170
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,167
Say go in for do you know 1946 they made it illegal to be a Nazi

1171
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:04,031
Well when this war is over

1172
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
Wow

1173
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
While this guy is stupid

1174
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,151
What a really really dumb things

1175
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:15,039
One thing I wanted to ask you about I'm sorry I interrupted you.

1176
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
What

1177
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,087
How do you do that

1178
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:19,647
How would you ban political correct

1179
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,927
Well

1180
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:25,791
I mean I think ultimately the undercurrent of what he saying is that

1181
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,863
If you don't allow me to say the n word

1182
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,911
Everybody else is going to die

1183
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:33,471
Yeah there's a little bit

1184
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
I get

1185
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:41,663
A strong feeling that this guy's really sensitive about people calling for AC

1186
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:45,503
Why is it that I can't say the n-word and not be called a race

1187
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,551
What are the other

1188
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:53,183
These are the kind of conversations that I would love to have in a different setting than on Alex's show because like

1189
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,231
If this guy said this anywhere else

1190
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
Sorry like

1191
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
How

1192
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,095
Do you propose we go about banning political correct

1193
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,911
I mean if you said that allowed in a place where there's

1194
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,959
Four more people expect

1195
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:07,263
Everyone to stop what they're doing and turning

1196
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,055
Stare in your eyes and be like

1197
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,079
Stop it

1198
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,895
What policy positions do you advocate

1199
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,199
4tube and political correctness

1200
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,295
If I say something that makes you feel bad

1201
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,087
F*** you

1202
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,647
If you say something to make me feel bad

1203
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
You're going to die

1204
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
Is it

1205
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,719
Here's the other thing

1206
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:33,887
Situation where political correctness is me saying that what you said is racist or is it political

1207
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,423
Preakness anybody

1208
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Stopping them

1209
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,079
So therefore it would be illegal to not be racing

1210
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:45,151
Your point is good but I think you're skipping over Al

1211
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
A lot

1212
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
Which is first

1213
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,247
What is it that you're trying to ban

1214
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,527
When you say you're trying

1215
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,295
YouTube and pull it

1216
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
Pickle correctness

1217
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
People saying with

1218
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Things are racist

1219
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:59,231
8 is that it that's the feeling I get legal for

1220
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,023
For people to say that things are race

1221
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:06,143
Let me mess with the whole ant icrt thing

1222
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
A different word

1223
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:09,215
Because you can't legislate Concepts

1224
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,751
That's a very dumb things

1225
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:15,871
If you can do well I mean out of basic level that is true but I just

1226
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
Yes

1227
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
This guy

1228
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:20,735
So concerned about free speech

1229
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
And

1230
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:24,319
He's advocating for something they would necessarily

1231
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,599
Require a

1232
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,367
Drastic

1233
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
Limitation on

1234
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:31,743
And a massive surveillance industry to enforce

1235
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
You bet

1236
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
So he's dumb

1237
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,375
Anyway I might be is about Soros

1238
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
Or I'm sorry

1239
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
Sore ass

1240
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,311
And he's

1241
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:55,295
And I'm doing great job as president

1242
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:59,647
Bill Gates

1243
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,463
Fauci in a few others

1244
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,839
Minimum they need to be arrested in on

1245
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
Protect

1246
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,847
Oh man this guy seems like he's he's a little bit

1247
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,407
Here's the problem

1248
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,735
Here's I swear to God here's my f****** problem who in

1249
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,855
Presidential election after this win the campaign on the right is just going to be

1250
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,879
Here's who I'm going to kill

1251
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:33,439
Here's my here's my list

1252
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,231
For me for this list

1253
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:39,071
And that guy is going to pick a different list of people to kill and that's it

1254
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:42,399
I love you be like

1255
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,447
I like most of this list

1256
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:49,311
But I mean Skylander mines on there

1257
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:53,151
Every any other let anybody their name would have been great hardship

1258
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
And then

1259
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:59,551
Two years after that they can be like politicians are all liars even kill anybody on these lists

1260
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:03,135
Going to be a whole new handle

1261
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
Seems to be

1262
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,255
Clearly preoccupied with the idea of

1263
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
10 executive

1264
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
Feeling erratic

1265
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,679
Not a great sign for his idea of politics

1266
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
Not a great sign for his ideas

1267
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,287
Democracy or how

1268
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,823
Our system work

1269
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,359
Kill people

1270
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
As a doctor

1271
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,919
The way I want to solve problem

1272
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
Is murder

1273
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,551
But other people doing it cuz I need to preserve life

1274
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:34,879
He is a big fan of those German

1275
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
Fake trial

1276
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,207
Mock trial

1277
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:44,607
Good stuff so if you miss the episode where Joel skousen was on he already explained to Alex how these are stupid and they are

1278
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
We are going anywhere

1279
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:51,519
But Alex is back to believing in because Gavin isn't on and someone who believes in them

1280
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:58,175
You know Rider full Mitch he's a lawyer in Germany

1281
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Mock trial

1282
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,759
July 4th

1283
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,111
Everything that's going on in

1284
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,791
But we really need is some of the

1285
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,607
No the police that the upper level

1286
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,239
Military to start arresting these evil people that need to be arrested and imprisoned

1287
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,031
And then we can hold trials

1288
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,103
I'm actually in favor of

1289
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,479
What time of War

1290
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,807
It's interesting to me how one of Alex's like

1291
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,343
Big thing

1292
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:41,695
And all of his early earlier career was Posse Comitatus

1293
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
He was out yet shirts that he sold with it

1294
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:49,375
Any idea that this guy is on here suggesting that the military should be arresting

1295
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
People

1296
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
Legitimately be

1297
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
Hypothetical to anything Alex

1298
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
Could listen to

1299
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,799
Hi I mean

1300
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
He should be furious about that ID

1301
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
This man

1302
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,127
Is

1303
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,711
What is the most incoherent raving lunatics that I've heard in a long

1304
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,271
And it's not because

1305
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:10,111
And it's not because he's saying like oh aliens are coming

1306
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,391
It's literally he's just saying

1307
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,927
Varian same s***

1308
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,463
That should

1309
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:24,959
Everything I've said is about how much I want to kill today all I want to do is murder I want blood lining the street behind

1310
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,983
Find me I think it's wrong

1311
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,031
I think the death penalty

1312
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:31,871
I want of a Bomb drink

1313
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:39,039
Like if you take away the the military arresting people problem

1314
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
You still have like

1315
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,391
What he wants is the police

1316
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,671
Without warrant

1317
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
Seems

1318
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,607
Yes this is dicey understanding these people have

1319
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:59,007
The government is essentially maybe what if we were all 25 people living in a small town in WoW

1320
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,823
Wild West Exodus

1321
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,711
Can stop the one Thief that came through in the last 20 years we all hang them and then we're like

1322
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,015
Seems to be

1323
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
Pretty consistent with our obsession with

1324
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,391
Understand

1325
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,463
You think dr. marbles doesn't understand govern

1326
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:25,119
You're about to be proven wrong

1327
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,007
So we have a completely corrupt Supreme Court majority of Congress that has taken the poison so we haven't

1328
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
Stop Congress

1329
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,871
Global leaders by Justin Trudeau

1330
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Why is that

1331
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
I mean

1332
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,479
This is ridiculous

1333
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,295
So how would take

1334
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:48,159
Backpack

1335
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,999
Sir Alex has to take a long breath there

1336
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,023
How do IRAs

1337
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,119
Identify even even appear

1338
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:57,887
Consider this

1339
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,727
Wow I walking through mud 11

1340
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,519
What do what do I buy

1341
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:11,455
Asking myself that question the world economic Forum or should I

1342
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,735
Not being

1343
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,295
Should I

1344
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:19,391
Weird that I'm against that or should I just let it

1345
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,695
It seems so hyperbolic

1346
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,719
You can't be serious

1347
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
But also

1348
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:30,143
Hundred percent means it and we should not allow him anywhere near any powerful position a or a microphone

1349
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
The Supreme Court

1350
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,031
Most people in Congress leaders have all been vacs

1351
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:39,359
Weather in on this remote

1352
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,919
Conspiracy therefore we have to

1353
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,711
Overthrow all the government

1354
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,735
Right

1355
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,295
Then I guess it's like get rid of all the Supreme Court Justice

1356
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,855
I mean he does realize that he's

1357
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:52,671
Is it accidentally 100% accidentally poke

1358
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:56,767
A massive hole in Alex's whole story

1359
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,583
All of our Supreme Court is vaccinated

1360
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,887
Most of Congress is vaccinated

1361
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:03,167
Why even f******

1362
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,959
Bother with a revolution

1363
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,239
They're all going to be dead

1364
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,519
That's a good point

1365
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:12,127
There's a designated Survivor though and you know that guy's not vaccinated

1366
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,711
Admittedly it be real bad if your designated Survivor died of covid

1367
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,247
True

1368
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,903
Yeah that is a good point no need for revolution if you believe your pictures away

1369
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,791
Yours anyways just hang back hang loose guys you have a barbecue just chill out

1370
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,095
Yeah just chill out so try to overthrow

1371
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,631
Governments are already done

1372
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
REI

1373
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
I find this

1374
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:36,959
S2b

1375
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,031
Abusing a little bit but also like this guy seems

1376
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,055
Unwell

1377
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
Oh no he needs

1378
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:46,431
Yeah the word territory unless like

1379
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,967
Two-spotted more like somebody

1380
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
Peet's intervene

1381
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,319
There needs to be a professional involved it feels a little bit that way

1382
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:55,135
Alex

1383
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,927
60 people are getting like

1384
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,975
Booster shots

1385
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Compulsively

1386
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,047
Can't Stop

1387
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,423
I think he does think that they're doing that

1388
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,959
Call Laura

1389
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
10 shots

1390
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,847
Okay well doesn't work

1391
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:22,271
Lester the grating

1392
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,855
Miss causes insanity

1393
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
The cause of this Mass formation

1394
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,183
Psychosis

1395
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
Global map

1396
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
Yeah man so people are there like

1397
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,143
This

1398
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
How to take eight

1399
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
I'm just going to keep taking them

1400
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:42,239
And that's

1401
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:43,007
Because of

1402
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
Political career

1403
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:44,799
I mean

1404
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,823
We're at a point

1405
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,359
With this dude where am I

1406
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,383
Legitimately

1407
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,687
How do you go to a grocery store

1408
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:53,247
Because your brain is so whacked out

1409
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
What could you

1410
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:56,575
Would like anything in a grocery store concept

1411
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:02,719
Everything is political correctness

1412
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,279
Political correctness is people wanting to get shots

1413
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:11,679
What's the name of that the driving the crazy isn't named after a racial slur so it's politically

1414
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,959
Break bread

1415
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,263
Little Debbie she's too small

1416
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,311
So Alex

1417
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:19,103
You know he just wishes

1418
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
But all of his dumb friends were wrong

1419
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Don't we

1420
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:34,975
You know.

1421
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:42,399
Discovery of HIV with wrong woman

1422
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,215
I wish that

1423
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:48,287
Father was wrong doctor you. I wish that

1424
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,847
Inventor of mRNA technology

1425
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
What's wrong

1426
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,991
Dr. Malone I wish you were but you're not wrong

1427
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
Major insurance companies

1428
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,255
10-18 256 or 18 to 64

1429
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:11,327
Bigger than WWII death rating

1430
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,519
It's probably political correctness yeah I would assume so

1431
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:25,919
Is Ali Aziz weirdo friends of Alex's are wrong I hope that he can take some comfort now that we've

1432
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:28,223
You know disabused him of the notion

1433
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
They're onto something

1434
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,343
The insurance company saying there's a huge increase

1435
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
Is true

1436
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,439
This is about a guy named David

1437
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,743
Send the video of one America Insurance

1438
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,071
And said that they are seeing a massive increase in deaths in

1439
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,631
Upwards of 40%

1440
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,447
I was absolutely lying about them saying it

1441
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
It's not covid

1442
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,239
This is about Coke

1443
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:56,383
This include the comment Davidson made that reflected that even if something doesn't immediately app

1444
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
Appear to be a death

1445
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
From covid quotes

1446
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,503
The virus could have triggered a separate illness that eventually leads to

1447
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,271
To death

1448
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
This is just

1449
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,391
To the one that are definitively covid where there's a chance

1450
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,951
Play the covid side effect led to a fatal condition

1451
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Alex is lying about this to make

1452
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:15,583
It seemed like the insurance company said that all these debts are covid because he's a liar

1453
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:19,935
The time and that's just

1454
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Standard practice

1455
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Does he run in football

1456
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
Nonsense

1457
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,055
And I mean

1458
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,127
If that stuff

1459
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:28,895
That's Tuff

1460
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,663
You know

1461
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,223
I just imagine being somebody

1462
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:33,503
Who is so

1463
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,551
Integral to

1464
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:36,831
The Non-Stop

1465
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,623
Stream of death

1466
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,695
Reading a study that's like death

1467
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,487
Sir up today and being like

1468
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Well got to go to work

1469
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
Not like

1470
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,143
I am a true f****** cancer upon all of humanity

1471
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,935
All of these debts Rising

1472
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:54,239
Are partially my fault

1473
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:56,031
More so than many other

1474
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,103
And then

1475
01:07:59,359 --> 01:07:59,871
About him

1476
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:03,711
Well you have your pot committed

1477
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:08,063
Santa

1478
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,343
So

1479
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
You know it

1480
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,903
I think there's a lot of people to talk about

1481
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Howard

1482
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,695
It's tough to

1483
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,975
Get people who were in

1484
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:16,511
Conspiracy communities and like

1485
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Maybe qanon

1486
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
Now they believe Alex.

1487
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,375
It's hard to get them

1488
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Out of that

1489
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:24,959
D radicalization is really difficult right

1490
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,007
And guess what

1491
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799
It apparently at this is

1492
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,591
The perspective of doctor marbles to

1493
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,895
Oh yeah but in reverse

1494
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,943
What they believe is fake science

1495
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,479
The PC Kobe

1496
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,647
You can just pretend you're whatever your wallet

1497
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,207
The woman you're just a day or

1498
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:49,279
And all your enemies are Russian just cuz you don't want to go to war

1499
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,887
Yeah and anybody who says it is sitting against that is racist and all this

1500
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
Just nonsense and they're just

1501
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Crazy

1502
01:08:56,703 --> 01:09:00,799
Brainwashed and

1503
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,103
It's hard to bring them

1504
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:10,783
Panda

1505
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:14,623
Breathe

1506
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:15,903
Thousand

1507
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Renovation

1508
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,719
Yeah I would encourage

1509
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:23,583
Patience if you got sick with covid

1510
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,655
See how that the money is

1511
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,191
That narratives coming back I guess

1512
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:36,127
World economic forum

1513
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
HEB

1514
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Clash Royale battle and kill them

1515
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,271
Hey this dude this dude

1516
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
Political correct

1517
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,855
Right right right

1518
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:50,719
I mean his first hundred days in office are going to be real race

1519
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,511
Real race to the bottom on that one

1520
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:59,935
It's going to be a lot of lawyers

1521
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:02,751
Shreveport we'll all be dead shirt

1522
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,287
Yeah there's not much they could do about it

1523
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:08,127
The ACLU lawyers will be

1524
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:11,711
So we have one last clip here and it's Alex rambling

1525
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
A little bit

1526
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,503
About to have

1527
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Hospitals

1528
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,063
Going to kill you

1529
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,135
This is nice to see this narrative going back to

1530
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:22,975
But you got to write this down

1531
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,375
Your friends your family

1532
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,239
Hospital

1533
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Apollo destroys your tissue

1534
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,455
And then what

1535
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
Froggy's is low

1536
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:50,623
Ventilator was kills 94% of people

1537
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,903
The ventilator.

1538
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:56,255
Vitamin C and vitamin D

1539
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Iran

1540
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
And then obviously

1541
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:11,103
$53,000 / minimum value so

1542
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
Dr.com

1543
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:14,943
Like that

1544
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,063
We get so many calls where do I call to get online pharmacy will call me back

Boost your immune system

1549
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,583
Three all three types of iodine

1550
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
I feel like it's

1551
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Really deaf

1552
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,935
Difficult to hear a clip like that

1553
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:37,727
And not think

1554
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:40,287
That he is promoting his product

1555
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
As a preventative

1556
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
4

1557
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,175
I know that he's not making

1558
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,199
King B connection one

1559
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:51,295
Yeah he's doing a little plug for weirdo doctors

1560
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,319
Call in line

1561
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:58,719
Queen of the things you got to do is load up ahead of time

1562
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,023
On stuff for your immune system at that 8

1563
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,863
Boost your immune system by using my products it really feels like

1564
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,935
You would take away from this

1565
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,215
If you were listening

1566
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,055
Right if you are directing people towards the lodge

1567
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,079
Conclusion

1568
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
Of your

1569
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
Regardless of whether or not you put a

1570
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
Couple buffer set

1571
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,711
Fences in between

1572
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
If you do this

1573
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,527
This will happen

1574
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:27,391
Then you're still saying that it seems like

1575
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,439
I mean obviously against the law

1576
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,463
And

1577
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:35,583
Warned about that by the New York attorney general

1578
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,119
Serious problem with this

1579
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,143
This doctor marble

1580
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
Well I mean I have many

1581
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Are growing

1582
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:50,943
Did he prescribe any medications other than Ivermectin and hydrochloric when not that I know of

1583
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,967
Like button

1584
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:57,599
He's been a doctor for what he didn't just start being a doctor today I would assume that he does

1585
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
But I don't think

1586
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,671
I don't

1587
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:05,279
Think you would ever be able to find an article about how he prescribes other thing

1588
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,303
Well I mean yeah

1589
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,327
That's

1590
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,863
All of that comes

1591
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:11,935
Who's from the same medical information that we

1592
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:17,823
The scene was created out of it's not like he's prescribing a completely separate

1593
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,151
Unrelated like all of this comes from the same side

1594
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,503
But you can't get you can't be like all these

1595
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,271
These great

1596
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,063
Pills and vaccines are good

1597
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
But these ones are evil

1598
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,159
The calendar made by the same Folk

1599
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:36,767
Nothing's real that's a good point

1600
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,119
I'm just so mad

1601
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
The doctor Marvel

1602
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:46,239
Piccalilli

1603
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:50,335
I think he has it it's crazy town

1604
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:54,943
I don't I don't I don't know how to respond to anything you're saying because

1605
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
You just do what you have to do is

1606
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
Is give up

1607
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:04,415
And then it all makes sense abolished the death penalty after we've killed everyone that I would give it

1608
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
YouTube

1609
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,511
So we come to the end of this and I think it's

1610
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,839
Surprising that Alex's

1611
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,679
Doing this little charade about the Durham report

1612
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,215
I think it's really gross

1613
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:19,775
The way is trying to get on the

1614
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,079
Vaccine HIV train ride

1615
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
Doctor marbles

1616
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,687
I hope we don't see more him

1617
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:32,831
Wolfie sky was a bit more I really thought doctor group without their Buttman doctor marbles is

1618
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:34,879
And it's bringing

1619
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:36,159
If we

1620
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:42,559
The past is Prelude then Duncan Barboza going to be a piss doctor

1621
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,863
I mean it does really sound like

1622
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,655
I mean it really does sound like

1623
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
He was a day

1624
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,751
Talking Cirque du Soleil show

1625
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
Doing backflips

1626
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
Having a great time and then was like.

1627
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:54,847
Doctor marbles

1628
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127
Just called

1629
01:14:58,687 --> 01:14:59,967
It's the same same basic thing

1630
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
Chernobyl no

1631
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:05,599
I feel like maybe get a dog named doctor marbles on his like

1632
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,767
Yeah I want I wonder

1633
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:16,095
About him

1634
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,375
So you know who

1635
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,935
Let's not legitimate field of study

1636
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
So we'll be back Jordan

1637
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:29,151

01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
Dzx Clark

1640
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
And now here comes

1641
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
What the sex role

1642
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,111
Holding

1643
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:43,231
Alexandra Thurston color
