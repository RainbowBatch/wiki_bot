Quickly

15
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,800
What the right spot but my bright spot is actually going to have to wait

16
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Until the end of the podcast

17
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
But for now I shall

18
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,320
Turn the question around on you what is yours

19
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,136
Spot is lovely.

20
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Very very cute

21
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:09,536
Grudgingly say favorite pastime

22
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
Catching them in some sort of pose

23
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,912
Taking a picture and then marking it up on my phone

24
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
And just drawing a fanciful little

25
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,824
Picture around it sure it is my favorite thing to do

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
I don't know either man werewolf

27
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,088
It's not for its where we would just ruin it if we were there

28
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
I've no idea

29
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,328

30
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,448

31
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,032
See what they have

32
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,056
How to say I think

33
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,384
I think you run into ethical issues there

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,272
I don't think that it's at the coal there labor laws for my dogs and I do think that

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,624
And based on your politics you should not exploit the labor of those Doug

36
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
That's fair that's fair

37
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:12,768
So they only have to work 4 hours at a time

38
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:16,608
If you redirected the money from the cameos towards all like dog related

39
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:23,008
Oh that's early

40
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872

41
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,408

169
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,183

Austin

00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,543
The first president

174
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
Powerful video

175
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
Old man in America

00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,431
Weather

178
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,711
Here is that report

179
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
So this report Alex's citing the Trump

180
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,343
Tweeted out is not what you would call her

181
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Port

182
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
Real loosely

183
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,535
In reality it's a video about how the election was stolen created by a guy named Seth whole house

184
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,815
Who runs a website

185
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
Called Man in the Mirror

186
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
I wanted to learn a little bit more about the

187
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,447
This guy's website

188
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,495

00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,567
Two big thing popped up about his URL which is

190
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,103
Is Mia. News

191
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
The first is an MIA stands for missing in action

192
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:03,039
So that gives exact opposite to put out there

193
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,671
It's time for all good Patriots to show up so please remember you can find me at a my day

194
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,487
I might have chosen a different name

195
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Different acronym

196
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,119
Like for instance I might have gone with American with standing outside Legion

197
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,191
No problem with that one that one's good alright

198
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:26,847
The other thing that popped up was this guy today. News URL and pretty much the only people I've ever seen getting. News page

199
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,127
Bizarre Infowars associate

200
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
I'm sure some other people are doing it

201
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Me too but it's

202
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
Become something I associate so much with Alex and his crew

203
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:34,783
Did I instinct

204
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,415
Truly suspect something is not right address

205
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,231
It might have been slightly on a

206
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,839
Expect at this video went viral as it did after Trump tweeted it out because

207
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
According to an article by will summer in The Daily Beast

208
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,191
Some interesting things started

209
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,215
Did the happen reason

210
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,335
In particular it appears that references online to whole house being a member of the

211
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
The falun gong movement

212
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
Began to be a race

213
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,247
Including the mention of his appearance at a 2007 Minnesota Conference

214
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
On the website clear Harmony

215
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
And all mentions of him on

216
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Minghui.org

217
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Why would they want that scrub

218
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,999
He also apparently this is not necessarily been scrubbed from the internet

219
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
Employed by the epoch times

220
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,863
A right-wing media Outlet associated with Island

221
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
Between 2008 and twenty

222
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:28,543
But he's barely also freelance as a photographer for them as recently as July of this year

223
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,567
Great good stuff

224
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,335
Everybody's got to work

225
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
Freelancers

226
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,967
Yeah this is not an individual who made a news report that super powerful it's the

227
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,063
The product of a longtime employee of a deeply right-wing propaganda

228
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,087
Media outlet that

229
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Essentially deify

230
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Trump

231
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,927
The removal of whole houses name

232
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
From those websites

233
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
This kind of talent

234
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,351
The most likely explanation for why it happened is because the propaganda video featured him as the narrator

235
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:58,751
Doesn't work nearly as well as you know that he's a member of a spiritual movement that reportedly views Trump as a Critic

236
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Highlights

237
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
Becoming judge

238
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:02,591
They were Communists to be sent to Hell there is that

239
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
According to former

240
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
Talk times employee

241
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Speaking to the BBC News

242
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,455
Bear is bad

243
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,271
That does kind of mess with your credibility

244
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
Hey are you like the presentation of the man in America

245
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
American flag

246
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:20,255
Media report in Mora book report on Behold a Pale Horse

247
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,327
This charade works better when you just believe that

248
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
The whole houses

249
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,887
What percent of self to be

250
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,167
From his website

251
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
To his bio

252
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:34,847
Born and raised in the countryside of Ohio I never thought I would see a time with our freedoms are under attack like they are today

253
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,455
I spent the last 15 years fighting against the tyranny of Communism in China

254
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,039
But never did I imagine that that fight would come to American soil

255
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,671
My heart beats with the blood of patriots fighting the needle down in shame

256
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
I created man in America.

257
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
To speak to my fellow Patriots and help

258
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Educate inspire

259
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
And unite us

260
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
All right all I just heard was a lot of

261
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
Ravens like screeching in my ears

262
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,543
It's sort of an angry mix between

263
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
Hacksaw Jim Duggan Charlie Brown's teacher

264
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,783
A good bio for myself but I've always straight about as far away from self mythologize

265
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
I think it's her possibly

266
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,415
It is kind of reminds me of that advertising dude who created the Frank Bates

267
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,023
It's Persona to sell survival food in prepper supplies to conservative

268
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
The Patriots out more

269
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
You coming from a normal

270
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Read a kind of fella like

271
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,143
Frank coonelly didn't

272
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
Exist

273
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,703
Compared to the reality of it being gay

274
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,311
Bulshit being resold them by an affiliate marketing billionaire lives like a New York

275
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
It does not

276
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
It's a it's a it's a

277
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Puppet game

278
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Yeah it's it's

279
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
Tricking flyover state

280
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,807
Anyway I bring this up to remind everyone that Alex Jones

281
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,831
Considers this a

282
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
A news report

283
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,975
What he's doing is just desperately chasing the actual new alternative

284
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,255
Propaganda

285
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:02,655
Poked with associations with vodka epochtimes and Newsmax

286
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,447
2 a gallon they admitted to Biden won the

287
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Also

288
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
It appears that Alex really didn't want to work

289
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
On this episode

290
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
Because other than introduced

291
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
He doesn't get back into the studio until

292
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
20 minutes into the episode

293
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,319
He displays Stone

294
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,647
Happy Wheels definitively proven the following Kong is wrong

295
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:30,559
Are they still is it are they still in the running for the end of days when I don't know nearly enough about

296
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
That as a group I speak with any kind of

297
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Authority or credibility

298
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,751
I can't say

299
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
You know what

300
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
If if

301
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,615
Their point is solely that China is

302
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Repressive

303
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Of groups

304
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,223
I don't disagree with that point

305
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
But

306
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
I don't

307
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
Think that groups like The

308
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Epoch times

309
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
Are on the up-and-up

310
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,183
Go to hell

311
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
I don't think eight even if it does

312
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,327
I don't think Trump is your ally

313
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,911
Probably not

314
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,007
Very shortly become a less effective

315
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,055
We can only hope

316
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,591
So Alex

317
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,015
Quite a ways into the episode before he really says anything substantial

318
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Let me get the number out

319
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
Respond

320
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Trump signing

321
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
Declaration of

322
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,535
Cooperation

323
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Or the pardons or

324
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,655
Any of that you're welcome to call and we can all get our brownie points

325
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Which one

326
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Criticizing

327
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:48,127
World Government Bill Gates the UN the forced inoculations the covid 6

328
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
Joe Biden

329
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
I honestly can't tell if Alex is mad at Trump about the relief bill or not

330
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
Doesn't seem like

331
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:02,719
I can tell that he's going to be mad at callers if they're mad at Trump about it though I thought that for sure

332
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,423
Another thing that I was drunk by listening to this is like we're almost 30 minutes into the show and

333
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,471
But one of the lead stories isn't

334
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,287
Be Christmas morning bombing in Nashville that he interrupted

335
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
It is holiday

336
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
To declare an almost-certain false flag

337
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:26,015
Be a follow-up on that bike Owen hosted the show on Sunday so Alex didn't cover it then so it seems like now be good time

338
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,319
Do this a little bit more responsibly

339
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,855
Oh no

340
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
Couple of days ago you don't need to worry about it

341
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,535
So are you doesn't get to this immediately that's not the lead story believe story

342
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,815
Appears to be Trump

343
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,583
Should not

344
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Not leave office

345
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
I don't like that

346
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
Alteration

347
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Is in 23 days

348
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,007
The coronation

349
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,175
Virtual

350
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,527
Alright

351
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
And refuse to go

352
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:04,159
He folded Azar buddy don't start back into the furniture

353
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
The clothing or stuff

354
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
We're not

355
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Leaving

356
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,047
Well what do you expect

357
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
President

358
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
Trump

359
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,631
President-trump

360
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,911
Shouldn't leave

361
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,191
President-trump

362
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
If it's fraud

363
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
T-shirts

364
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,895
This is kind of sad

365
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
Bush is Alex pretend

366
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,343
When's to be arguing in support of algor squatting in the white house because the 2000 election was still

367
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,159
Yeah earlier this episode Alex said that

368
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Even if Trump was a horrible bad guy the elect

369
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,511
Can we still stolen from Twitter response

370
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
Possibility to fight over turn it

371
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,399
I know that he said that the 2000 election was fraudulent but somehow I just

372
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Can imagine him

373
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Working up

374
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:52,031
Does passion to support Bill Clinton's vice president getting into office

375
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,895
Yeah he couldn't get out

376
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:01,247
So I'm fine if Trump doesn't want to leave we just boarded up the White House

377
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,575
Build a nice little pyramid around it and then

378
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
You know he lives

379
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Comfort

380
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,767
I say we drop snakes in every now and again just keep things exciting you know for the few weeks they have with airless

381
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
Yeah absolutely Runaway

382
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,679
Sport of it

383
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,983
Does the Trump family running around the White House

384
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Stabbing spider

385
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
Looks about like

386
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,431
No I went to this rally this Jericho March

387
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
While backpacking

388
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
ABC chart

389
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
And I will not be present

390
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,575
One way or another lot of people thought

391
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
Maybe Riley that died ice

392
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,415
Figured got a violin

393
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,695
I was not

394
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,719
And in fact

395
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
I'm a snitch

396
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,143
Alright so me on this one out to self as a snitch

397
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,447
We elected President Trump one way or another

398
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:59,103
It'll by overturning the election and it's showing it's a fraud and nnnn getting Congress to act on

399
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:03,199
January 6th to not certified for Biden

400
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,575
Impeaching Joe Biden are getting arrested

401
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,415
One way or another he will be removed

402
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,463
And that's what I said in my

403
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Beach

404
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
Kill Joe Biden

405
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
What I said

406
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,215
Secret Service hasn't called me

407
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:28,799
The last thing I want is for Joe Biden

408
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,639
Turn lemons into lemonade

409
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,223
Kamala Harris

410
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,367
Secret Service knows I'm on record

411
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,927
Not once not twice but three times

412
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,231
Crazy people arrested

413
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:50,559
Weapon

414
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
I'm planning to kill President

415
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,911
These crazies of Santa's letters and called us before

416
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
I'm going to kill George W bush

417
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
Mama

418
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
Secret Service

419
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,639
I don't believe Alex really but if he did if he

420
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:10,271
If that's true good match tell your audio

421
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Your audience that

422
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
If we said hey

423
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:19,488
Some people said that we're going to kill the president we called the FBI and they got taken care of

424
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Free things to do

425
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
It's no problem that's a problem for people who are interested

426
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Freely I will send it

427
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,872
I am a turncoat

428
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
I love

429
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,688
Dicks

430
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
Stuff

431
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,760
I love dancing political

432
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,064
Now

433
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,112
I will call Janet Reno

434
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,208
This glass eye is

435
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:54,048
Have you heard that you get stitches

436
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,328
Alright let's let's

437
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
To keep that straight

438
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,680
Real real full on Alex

439
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
This is part

440
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
Listen

441
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
All of you

442
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
I will turn you in

443
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Alright good work

444
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,408
So disinterested

445
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,944
The Nashville

446
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Situation

447
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Kind of surprising

448
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Cuz

449
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,112
Like I said you put out a video about it

450
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Christmas witch

451
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,952
Seems really maybe this is

452
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,768
Maybe he did smell something really important

453
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,328
In there are maybe yeah

454
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,608
Maybe you did pick up on some

455
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
Pattern that he wanted the flash out

456
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Don't really care

457
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
Still probably

458
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
Wearing phase of fall

459
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,288
All Flags

460
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
A lot of questions about what really happened at the bombing

461
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Nashville

462
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
1 oz

463
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,320
Nothing

464
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Skousen know about

465
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,440
And I do a little

466
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,280
I would say he's going to say it's a false flag

467
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
For sure because he doesn't talk about it when he's on the show

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,008
He has bigger things to talk about

469
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
Joel skousen covered in South Jordan

470
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,664
You know I'm sure Joel would have made time to talk about

471
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
This possibly being false flag but he had

472
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Sure

473
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,528
To do like

474
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Tell you

475
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,320
You've got to live

476
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,392
An hour outside of town if you want to survive

477
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Absolutely

478
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,464
Far because then it becomes

479
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:30,816
It's like almost to be hard to go get supplies

480
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
How to get far away enough from

481
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,168
Places where there's a large populations of people can't walk to

482
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:41,824
He doesn't go awhile down that road

483
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,688
That sounds like when I was like 6 in my friends and I work building a snow fort

484
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
Drew

485
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
There's going to be parapets here news

486
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,808
We're going to make sure that you can

487
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,672
Capri Boucher out of ice

488
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,000
Call Mariana

489
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,888
Also I know exactly where to find Joel skousen now about an hour outside

490
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,472
Setup a radius

491
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
Are you ready we got scales at Perimeter

492
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
Stop mileage

493
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,896
It's about an hour

494
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,200
If you're driving or walking

495
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,224
Or wherever it is

496
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,504
It's just got to be about an

497
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,808
I think I think it's by truck

498
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,088
My truck

499
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:31,488
That's the sense I got not as the crow flies no no crows can't get Lumber

500
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Bierhaus

501
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
Nashville

502
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,936
Conspiracies appear to have deflated

503
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
But

504
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:45,056
There's an escalation going on surrounding covid-19

505
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,336
Related stuff

506
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,896
Getting to the point where I'm getting the sense that Alex

507
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,992
This is just saying it's not even real like you dancing dangerously close

508
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,272
David Icke territory

509
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,064
Open for business

510
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,672
Will never be opened that

511
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,976
Randall K right

512
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,280
Totally hype

513
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,048
PCR test

514
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
So

515
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:13,472
He seems to be implying that the tests themselves are all fake

516
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:17,056
Amplifying and misleading people or what

517
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:21,152
Clear he's so unclear and he'll say like

518
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm not saying the virus is fake

519
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,528
All of the dude ways he's describing the circle

520
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Stances would lead you to that can

521
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Conclusion

522
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
I would I would just

523
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,952
I'm like my guess is he's just reactionary

524
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Contrarian for the sake of it

525
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,792
If you say any that you like

526
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,864
Oh it's it's 100% really be like know it's fake

527
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:45,472
I mean the virus doesn't cause a test right now is

528
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,264
I mean the virus is real but they're test

529
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
They're fake like there's no matter what

530
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,104
Something is fake enough for him

531
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
The entirety of the

532
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,712
I think there's also a feeling of like he's just desperate to be interesting

533
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
And so like if you come in with a piece of information

534
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,064
He'll blow your mind

535
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,344
With

536
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,904
The contradictory

537
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,672
Yeah that's fair

538
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,488
So one thing also that is contrary to

539
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Is Trump

540
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,560
Sure

541
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,352
Kidding

542
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,680
He's not very happy about those pardons

543
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:20,544
Show the ones where he pardoned war criminals and murderers and white supremacist then

544
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,616
Hard to say what Alex doesn't

545
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,896
And approve okay

546
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,944
The number one issue

547
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Is not true

548
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,272
Trump stupid

549
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:37,952
The number one issues World Government New World Order technocracy travel

550
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
Leave your house

551
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:41,792
Digital ID total control it's not coming it's here

552
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
What you think

553
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
What we should do about it

554
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,728
So Alex has plenty of time to cover this story with

555
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
Responsibilities like why

556
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,824
Don't you agree with those pardons

557
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,848
Which one

558
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
Yeah what

559
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,384
What's your problem

560
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
Right

561
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
Why do you think Trump pardon those people anyway

562
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,552
The pardon list

563
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
From the 22nd.

564
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,600
The 23rd

565
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
Just trying to figure out like

566
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:08,416
You know what's the issue

567
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
To hear

568
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,792
Like Rodger Stone and Paul manafort will probably like the headliners

569
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
So those shows

570
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,144
Alex can't be mad about that

571
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
Keys for that

572
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Charles Kushner

573
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
Jared kushner's dad

574
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
Maybe

575
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,336
Alex is kind of wishy-washy

576
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,872
Globalist

577
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
But I've also heard Alex

578
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
Charles Kushner was set up

579
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,880
You know you was just trying to prove that the person was cheating or whatever

580
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:43,488
Bento go go both ways with that

581
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Superman

582
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,072
Of course what you were referring to is

583
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,608
The the four Dudes

584
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,216
Who were Blackwater Mercenaries

585
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,032
Sewer Square massacre

586
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Which is really f***** up

587
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,104
Considering that last year

588
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,384
Trump pardoned

589
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
How was that guy Eddie Gallagher the dude who killed civilians

590
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,040
Yep it's about Isabel pattern

591
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,160
I think I got a feeling that that's what I was talking about

592
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,256
So much of his career in any kind of

593
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,816
You know like well you got to give it to Alex

594
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,376
Is built on his opposition to the Iraq War

595
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,960
So much of it is based on like I am not a war hawk

596
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:29,824
I am I have principles I'm not going to just go along with George W bush

597
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,152
In this war that built on a lie you know that kind of stuff

598
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,456
Is the only reason that his career had any legs

599
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,224
To begin with

600
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
Yeah otherwise he would just be

601
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't know

602
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,904
A hyper talented anti-communist weirdo no one's heard of ya

603
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
That's what prompted

604
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
People of other political alignment

605
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,536
Considerate

606
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
Yeah like as being like a disguise on to something

607
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,936
If you go hard enough on everybody's enemy

608
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
Some people will

609
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
Even from the opposite

610
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,176
Friends in college who almost got sucked into larouche

611
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:09,504
Could you guys all suck so bad

612
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
So I kind of thought about that is like what they'll be such an invalidation of like really

613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Core piece

614
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Ace of Alex's

615
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,416
Like premise yeah

616
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,256
What is martial law

617
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
Putting the Socialist

618
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,328
Antifa

619
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,608
Camps and stuff that

620
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
That's that's invalidation

621
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,192
You can do that if you wanted to

622
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
So here's my theory what's your theory

623
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,032
I don't think it's actually

624
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,568
Without those Park okay

625
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
I was looking

626
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Through the list

627
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,640
Departments

628
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
And I found it

629
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
To pardon

630
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Went to John Tate

631
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
And Jessie Benton

632
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:46,112
Campaign members who tried to bribe an Iowa State Rep

633
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,904
The switches endorsement from Bachman

634
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,184
Tyrone Paul back

635
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,952
In 2012

636
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Yeah you might

637
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,256
I think that Alex would say

638
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Support both of those parts

639
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,072
Because he's excused in the crimes of

640
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,608
People were on the same side is Alex

641
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
But you'd be wrong

642
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,936
Alex hates Jesse Benton

643
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,008
He's indicated in the past that he feels like Benton has worked

644
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Keep him on the out

645
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Side of things

646
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,944
Benton weaseled his way into the Patriot Movement by Mary and Ron Paul's granddaughter

647
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
I do remember

648
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,856
He went on about that.

649
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:23,232
That guy he is a Scourge on the Paul family

650
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,072
Hilarious

651
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:33,472
Yeah you got to go with the psychology the individual and there is nothing that motivates Alex more than paid

652
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,800
Buddyfight number one

653
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
Well you could have murdered his family but if stelter walks by it

654
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
It's stelter who's going to get the hate

655
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
Philosophical

656
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,736
Consistency is what you would hope for

657
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,784
So you would hope it would be something like

658
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:49,088
You know these people are out networker

659
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Criminal

660
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,392
Anime

661
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,000
In fact actually be a violation of the Geneva Convention do I believe it is

662
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
Experts in the field have indicated that it

663
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,072
No I mean

664
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
It is it is f***** up because

665
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,960
More I think than any other decision that a present

666
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
Can make

667
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,520
Pardons are intimate

668
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
You know what I mean like

669
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,384
That you pardon somebody knowing full well that they work

670
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,152
Convicted of there

671
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,456
And chances are

672
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Did that

673
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
Hardening those guys is very much like

674
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
Brown people are not people

675
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,904
That's what that says

676
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,720
Or a warning those people most

677
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,768
Did the most generous interpretation

678
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Is

679
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,376
Civilians in other countries are at the mercy of our military

680
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,192
You know like most

681
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:39,264
Points more towards I'm fine with genocide but yeah

682
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
I mean that's your that's the reality of it so

683
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,872
You if you see

684
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
Trump pardon those guys

685
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
And you're fine with that

686
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
You're fine with every

687
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,760
Did I go today

688
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
The message of it is

689
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
Is heroin

690
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,880
I mean there's a lot of the suit

691
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,416
Asians are made by elected officials

692
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Send

693
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,720
Less-than-ideal message

694
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,280
Play true

695
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,328
But something like that

696
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
Does give

697
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,168
A real middle finger to

698
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,472
The idea that anyone in the rest

699
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
The world would treat us

700
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
Like

701
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
We are operating

702
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
Any kind of place of good

703
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,360
Yeah

704
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
Just any any movie where they're like

705
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
Oh okay

706
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,784
We're going to go in there's we got this super murderer

707
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,576
In the darkest dungeon

708
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,368
And we're going to use him now it like

709
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,648
No those are the bag

710
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,232
Yeah let's set the dog loose

711
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
That's what this pardon is

712
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Please let set the dogs loose on on our end

713
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,960
Accepting that one season of Heroes

714
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
We're at the guys on level 5

715
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,384
Couple of them were actually got there just down there cuz the powers work

716
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,944
Too strong I don't remember exactly

717
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Weapons

718
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
Damascus

719
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
I've kind of

720
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,064
Lost it hurts

721
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Knowing no one's hurting you

722
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Heroes is actually working science fix

723
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
You might be surprised to learn

724
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
Alex took in a little p

725
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
Pizza science fiction over the weekend

726
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,520
When the others

727
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:22,176
Itsfunneh Skyblock out of him calling you I don't like

728
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
Agreed

729
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,624
Arrested Development

730
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
But

731
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
Some friends last night

732
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Wonder Woman movie

733
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
I've seen other two

734
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:47,008
This one was next level for a hallucination

735
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,080
Why do you keep getting dragged the movie

736
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
Like half of his media diet

737
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,736
Say that you like

738
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:03,136
Stop

739
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
New comic book movies f*** off say you like it you wanted to see Wonder Woman

740
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah I got to it opening weekend

741

00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
84

743
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,384

00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
King it is probably the most

750
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,048
It's obvious where he we could imagine

751
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Steve Austin

752
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,656
Lucky I get the f*** out of here

753
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,216
Strangely love the new Ghostbusters

754
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
So anyway

755
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
It's basically like

756
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
If you ghost

757
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
See Wonder Woman

758
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
You're getting mind-controlled

759
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,224
This one was next level

760
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,272
And it was like a hallucination

761
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
Flickr race everything this is the future of Mind Control

762
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
I had

763
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,464
Positive message

764
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:11,488
Deeper

765
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Intuit

766
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,328
But it was

767
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,704
This is Stanley Kubrick level 2.0

768
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
So you liked it

769
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,544
Sophisticated

770
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,848
So when you go see that movie

771
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,896
Rur Bass

772
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Okay

773
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,760
I just say you didn't like them

774
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,344
I'm going to tell you this right now about 80% of that move

775
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,208
Fell asleep on the last control

776
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
I was happy

777
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,792
Ballers just wanted you to fall asleep

778
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,424
Your subconscious brain took in the rest of it and now I don't feel safe around you

779
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,960
Not sophisticated at all

780
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
Not even a little bit kind of a comic book movies Pedro Pascal is the greatest actor in the history of the world

781
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,176
Arizona

782
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
So good

783
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:06,016
He was the best fight at once he wants his

784
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
Part was done

785
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
That's what I fell asleep

786
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:14,208
Feel the same way about Game of Thrones

787
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
Yeah I don't I don't

788
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,424
Maybe it's a sign of getting older maybe I'm maturing

789
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:30,848
I don't find Alex's movie reviews as good anymore it was hilarious

790
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,896
Yeah this is kind of

791
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
This is kind of just a slow

792
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,456
Pitch

793
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,224
We're both

794
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:36,992
Too old

795
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,112
To to really get into a bad movie criticism of Wonder Woman

796
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Maybe

797
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,416
I could I could

798
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Could stand someone like

799
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,232
Telling me what's wrong with the

800
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,584
Plot like if there's a structural issue with Tricia Warriors

801
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
Yeah I think you could probably still enjoy it I mean

802
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Incredibly huge problems

803
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:02,592
But most of the Fast and Furious movies

804
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:08,480
Yeah I'm I'm too old how it to 10 years older than me and I'm too old to listen

805
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,784
Come to his dumbass

806
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
Sophisticated b control

807
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:17,440
I think it was interesting although in our powers

808
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,488
Because the juxtaposition of

809
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,256
Gruff

810
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:22,560
Ostensible newsman just being like

811
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,448
And now we're on movie 300 of him being a child

812
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,240
Alright

813
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,776
Turn into like there was like

814
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,336
Depth to his review

815
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,920
Handicap mispronouncing Ozymandias

816
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,248
This is pretty great something to that like

817
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,320
He was swinging

818
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
And this is just kind of like

819
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
I kind of just get the sense

820
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,512
But he was overwhelmed by like a visuals and stuff and didn't understand the movie

821
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:54,560
He decided to call it brainwash

822
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,120
Beyond suspended disbelief

823
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Beyond

824
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,704
Lower your brain waves to a sleep study

825
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,752
Is beyond daydreaming this was

826
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
Elucidation

827
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,616
Tekonsha 7 Seconds

828
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,920
But still my brain was you need to stop

829
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Watching this is not good

830
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Next level

831
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Absolutely

832
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,672
I think he was just sitting there like I don't know what's going on

833
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,208
Yeah

834
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
I mean

835
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
You know baby

836
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:26,816
Take some brain for a Center focus on the movie

837
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,840
That might help

838
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
At so he he analyzes

839
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
The film a little

840
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,312
For no f****** reason

841
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,360
Call Ralph Harris.

842
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,176
Explain what his problem is with Trump's pardons

843
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:48,576
In this time-wasting on trivial nonsense name Diana

844
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,976
About Wonder Woman 84 any other thing that has Diana in the name

845
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
Princess

846
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,048
Couldn't

847
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
Come up with another

848
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
There's an end of world event coming

849
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:08,288
We're the ones making it happen because we want too much

850
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,104
Miss our desires we got to give our will over

851
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
To something else.

852
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,248
Your will has been given over to this Antichrist character

853
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,088
Then you got to denounce him but give your will to another Collective

854
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,368
That is the goddess.

855
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,144
Mentor bad weather going to be this out of this

856
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
As well

857
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,616
Control the public

858
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
Our God

859
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,408
2 Stars

860
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
So I was listening to that and I was like okay

861
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
I've not

862
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,136
I seen this movie

863
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,416
And I'm not going to

864
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:02,816
To see this movie probably movies that often

865
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
It looks

866
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,264
Good if I get any bike hero movie is

867
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
I was guessing

868
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,080
There's some sort of the villain

869
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,896
Yeah the tricks people into supporting them

870
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
Wonder Woman

871
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Get their support

872
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
And that is how she was able to beat

873
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
Good but it's close enough that's what he's talkin about more life right problem is like

874
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Somebody's like

875
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,096
No spoilers cuz I didn't finish the movie

876
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,216
Boilers because I can

877
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
But it's

878
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:47,104
It does the main bad guy is Pedro Pascal Nicolas Cage during all over the scenery

879
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,896
And he can grant wishes

880
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
But it's a monkey's paw.

881
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,736
Classic

882
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,016
What do you want

883
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,040
And there's a price

884
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,624
Okay so do you need the Twilight Zone episode

885
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,464
The entire movie is Nicolas Cage Twilight zoning everyone

886
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
My review of the movie is

887
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,048
This is Bayberry

888
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
At the beginning

889
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:08,608
It's but

890
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,424
And then in the middle your like this is pretty interesting

891
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,448
And then it's but again

892
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,216
Like that

893
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Bedell whole movie

894
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
I mean

895
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Bad

896
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,640
The wrong with buttocks

897
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
I don't understand all right

898
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
Ass head

899
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
No I don't know

900
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,440
Nlsd bro

901
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,536
Lots of teasing us lots of kids stuff lots of mindlessness

902
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
Lots of 80s Nostalgia for the

903
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,632
That's just for your conscious brain

904
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
Behind it the other

905
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
Manipulations are taking place

906
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,776
Call Bill Morgan.

907
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
Sure but it was definitely

908
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Definitely

909
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:54,687
Mind control

910
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Caliber material

911
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,087
Yeah

912
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
I think that most like bright

913
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
Flashy things

914
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
Might be a little bit tough

915
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,023
How to take out watch while your on LSD weekend

916
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
46

917
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,119
It's yours old probably with a history of

918
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:19,519
Amphetamine abuse and a loose grasp on reality

919
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,799
From the jump NAB

920
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
So I don't think

921
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,455
Smart move on his no no

922
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,015
So Alex does not really I don't think

923
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,551
Gets back into a more in-depth

924
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,087
Wonder Woman review

925
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,183
Equal equal parts disappointed and glad he didn't

926
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
You know

927
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,255
I could have I could have used something a little bit.

928
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
Deeper than this but at the same time

929
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
I don't care

930
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
Yeah

931
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,399
I don't do that eventually

932
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,959
The way you described as Wonder Woman makes me want to watch

933
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Watch they live with him just to see

934
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:51,519
If like

935
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
Does he even

936
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:56,639
See the hidden messages like the consumed messages he just be like a Blake

937
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Eat me like

938
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:03,807
I don't get why these people hate these aliens are great capitalists to running everything all these people wouldn't what are you even looking at

939
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:08,159
That Blake signs for we can talk about this the next time it comes up

940
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,207
Or maybe

941
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,231
Marty

942
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,815
The episode where Rowdy Roddy Piper was on Infowars

943
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
Have you talked about

944
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,191
Little lotto

945
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
Something that is

946
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
Was completely

947
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,103
I just don't understand it

948
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,407
The first part of it

949
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,711
Categorically not true the second

950
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,479
Part in

951
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,247
Impossible

952
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:40,159
I know you're an American brought up that America's bad America terrible

953
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,447
But when you look at the Historical tyranny

954
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,495
2000 years

955
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
The last hundred years

956
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Every form of

957
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
The worst people being charged

958
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,599
Un is in the world government

959
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Is in the Corp

960
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,207
That that makes no sense

961
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,535
The last Thousand Years

962
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
I mean I guess

963
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
Could go with China

964
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:24,191
Sure perhaps but the UN

965
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,471
The way you make that setting

966
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,311
Work is you just pretend that the world government is everything you don't like

967
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,383
Yeah I'm at the UN is actually also the

968
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,663
Show the League of Nations

969
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:37,503
And it's also every government that has ever existed throughout Europe

970
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:44,159
You know whatever your own terms and then you can say all corruption has been part of

971
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,975
I think it's really funny that he absolutely

972
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,047
Cannot bring up a very obvious one in Russia

973
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
We just being like

974
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,655
Well Putin has declared himself president for life at Eddie

975
00:44:54,911 --> 00:45:00,031
Crimes that he commits are retroactively impossible to charge important

976
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,383
To kill the only person running against him for leadership

977
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,455
That sounds a lot like stuff

978
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Alex

979
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:08,991
Once

980
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Trump to dinner

981
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:16,159
Like Wonder Woman but I think the problem is

982
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,463
In America we're never

983
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,023
Taught about other places to eat

984
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,071
Never we never hear about it

985
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
That's something

986
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
We definitely don't hear about bad things happening in other countries very differently than when they happen here to it would be wild

987
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Cover

988
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,127
Different story of Zeno the same story differently there.

989
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:42,015
Crazy never have people on the radio talking about how

990
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,623
That was weird I got very confused by that

991
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
And I got

992
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Kind of mad

993
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:51,743
You're pretty amazing

994
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Information

995
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
John Hopkins

996
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
AOL

997
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,519
New Year's numbers are in

998
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
I looked at last year

999
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:13,247
Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands more already that will be this year so they averaged in the rest of the year

1000
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
About the same.

1001
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,343
Well it's not

1002
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,695
Well nothing is a statistics show

1003
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,535
Spend the fact

1004
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:27,583
Into something that they can adopt

1005
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,119
This is really

1006
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
Simple

1007
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:34,495
CDC there were 2839205 deaths

1008
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
Total in 2019

1009
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
A rate of about 800

1010
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
67

1011
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,383
A 100,000 population

1012
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
We don't have

1013
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,247
The total data for 20/20 yet and reliable figures won't be available for

1014
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
Four month but the AP reported

1015
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,623
The scholars estimate the number will be over 3.2 million

1016
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,415
Typically you would expect

1017
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,439
A consists

1018
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,999
Rate of death to produce between 20,000

1019
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
50000

1020
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Extra tzatziki

1021
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,351
As the population ages and also

1022
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
Increases in

1023
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,655
Total number

1024
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,191
There is

1025
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,727
The reality that people are dying

1026
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,823
Political position depends on him leaving in complete denial of that

1027
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
That fact

1028
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,175
Maybe too pretty to but I hope this haunts him for the rest

1029
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Festivus life gas

1030
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,991
Hopefully this kind of behavior is

1031
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:19,039
People are suffering and losing loved ones

1032
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,343
Answer him just to pull this kind of b*******

1033
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
It's just

1034
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,719
I want more Wonder Woman reviews I don't want this s***

1035
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,047
I was telling you before the episode I was like

1036
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,911
One of those moments where I said like walk away from the computer stand up

1037
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,959
No not yet I just know

1038
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
You don't like

1039
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
Bye-bye

1040
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Family is

1041
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:43,103
What they are but my little sister and her husband both too

1042
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:43,871
Tested positive

1043
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Not too long ago

1044
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
Yalaha and

1045
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
I just

1046
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,015
Like the possibilities for damaged

1047
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,575
Do to them that they that we aren't even

1048
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:53,343
Considering

1049
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
Fine I get it you don't

1050
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,439
Don't think that you're going to die

1051
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
That's great

1052
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,071
You act like I have you not seen long covid symptom have you not seen people Psych

1053
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,375
Psychosis of manifest

1054
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:11,519
How do you not understand how terrifyingly dangerous this s*** is and it's happened to people in mind

1055
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
You don't like it

1056
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
There's No Escape for me

1057
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
It's because of

1058
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,127
F****** monsters like

1059
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
That's because of at least behaviors like

1060
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Totally

1061
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,223
F******

1062
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
Yeah the unknown unknown

1063
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
I think it's partially what you're talkin

1064
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,575
I'm about to

1065
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
Just like

1066
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,159
I don't know I just

1067
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,463
I hope he lives long enough

1068
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
Sukihana

1069
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,071
I'm so Alex does finally gets taken calls

1070
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,119
I'm not sure if he ever gets around to Diana

1071
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,935
I regret to inform you that I think he takes two calls

1072
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,519
But one guy calls in North dock bar

1073
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Diverse

1074
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:47,359
Trump rally schedule

1075
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
News media and the

1076
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
MP3 Americans are you there

1077
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:53,503
Archetype

1078
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
Be there in d.c.

1079
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
But I feel like they'll be greatly shocked

1080
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927
Intellectual diversity

1081
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,719
Boil

1082
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:06,047
That will come crashing through well in DC on January 6th

1083
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,631
Well they are shocking

1084
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,823
And then now

1085
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,943
Under Trump you do 11 / representation

1086
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,527
And the media.

1087
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,111
Because I don't know what to do.

1088
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,231
That scares the living snot

1089
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
Established

1090
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,815
Oh yeah of course it does

1091
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
So this caller brought up

1092
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:45,471
Intellectual diversity immediately starts talking about racial

1093
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
Right

1094
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
Well they don't actually have it

1095
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
Electrolit

1096
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,103
I don't know what he was trying

1097
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,919
To say I think you people have the image of

1098
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
Trump saying

1099
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
From

1100
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Past Trump rally

1101
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
I think that that

1102
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
The ones where we solve

1103
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,623
History is Prelude as they say you expect

1104
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
Sometimes show up

1105
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,999
It's sometimes I really do think that

1106
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:11,327
That the GOP thinks maybe there are 10 black people total

1107
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,143
And then whenever they show them 11 shows up

1108
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
The rally they like we got

1109
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
10%

1110
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,239
How do you not think

1111
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:21,823
We are 10% of all black people hear what I think is

1112
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,103
Interesting is

1113
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,503
The inability for Alex to cure diversity and not immediately jump into defense mode

1114
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
The

1115
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,551
Clearlax

1116
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,343
Diversity

1117
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,135
At these

1118
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
These rallies from that standpoint

1119
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:42,303
Intellectual diversity I guess means that some people want to shoot people and some people want to

1120
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,191
Go to legislative I guess maybe not a lot of diversity that people are

1121
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,471
Nice insta

1122
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
You know you got a lot of people on different site

1123
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,919
Also not for nothing

1124
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:58,943
Trump got like a

1125
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,711
8% of

1126
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,247
In the last election

1127
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,087
It's definitely better to report that as I call record

1128
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,391
Alexa portal

1129
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:13,791
Party that I support has never gotten over 10% so alienated

1130
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,375
Entire group of people elect Trump's pardons let's not

1131
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,959
Consider any of the surrounding content

1132
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
Batman

1133
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
Alex of the great idea

1134
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,055
What's up

1135
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:25,823
If

1136
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
Hugo

1137
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,383
Is to Insight

1138
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Violence

1139
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Insurrection

1140
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,247
Among right-wing people in this country here

1141
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,039
He has an amazing idea

1142
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
Conceited

1143
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,903
We do keep exposing the fraud keep showing the evidence

1144
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,695
And then no matter what happens

1145
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
Trump is still our president

1146
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,375
That the power structure in the system

1147
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
Occupied

1148
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,055
And that

1149
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
Legislators

1150
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:00,383
Houses in others

1151
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,199
He should have a nightly TV program

1152
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
Cast the public

1153
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:11,391
Nightly show where he pretends to be the second president in the rightful president of the United States

1154
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,671
Because there's a knock

1155
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,207
Occupy or in the house

1156
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:19,839
I don't know if I want to live in a 2020 where we're reliving like

1157
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,375
The Pope in the dark pope

1158
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,167
Fighting an Italy in the 70

1159
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,983
Pizza

1160
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:31,359
Beautiful people

1161
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
Bad

1162
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:35,455
But I was listening to us was like okay

1163
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:38,015
It's a stupid idea going to do that

1164
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
TV show Maybe

1165
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,575
If it profit

1166
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,855
Somehow

1167
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,135
He's not going

1168
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
2

1169
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,719
Go on a barnstorming tour of State

1170
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:52,095
Just leave her in order to save the Constitution

1171
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,631
Wow

1172
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,167
But he's also

1173
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
Recruiting

1174
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,567
He's one of the greatest orators

1175
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Generation

1176
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,919
He'll go and give really measured

1177
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
Thoughtful

1178
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Speeches

1179
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
About the responsibilities of State

1180
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Manship

1181
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:16,415
I just found it this kind of said this section of the show just really struck me as like what I would

1182
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Describe is

1183
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,999
Terrorist Edge

1184
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:21,279
Just trying to get

1185
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:27,679
These people right up to the point of this whole like since he lost the election it has been nothing but

1186
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,447
Put edging like

1187
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:32,799
We're going to do this up no no we're not going to blow. This

1188
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,127
Feels pretty really pronounce 28

1189
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
We don't value ourselves

1190
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
God

1191
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Will

1192
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,575
What is that we won

1193
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
We forsake our self

1194
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
All the blessings and throw them out the window

1195
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Because

1196
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,327
We got a game of tennis

1197
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,095
Player golf

1198
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,167
Player we were going to go out to get drunk again

1199
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,983
Voicemail

1200
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
Everything will be taken from you

1201
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
Everything

1202
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,871
U-joint along you'll be taken care of

1203
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:11,199
But you still join

1204
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Keep them flying

1205
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,063
Let's go to

1206
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,415
Mike Arizona micro Mary

1207
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:22,463
Weird weird sound there yet

1208
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
Now they're a little burp

1209
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:26,815
Reflux

1210
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:33,215
The Alamo Drafthouse Play Everybody's got to get something watching Wonder Woman

1211
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
Yeah I just hear that stuff and it's just like

1212
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Hey

1213
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
You could keep

1214
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,175
You know getting along go-along-to-get-along

1215
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,223
But that's how you're going to end up in submission

1216
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
You're going to end up

1217
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,319
In shackles unless you blow something up

1218
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:51,391
Kind of feels that way a little bit but does

1219
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
I think

1220
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,183
That there's something

1221
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,487
To the word Alex is saying like

1222
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
We brought the

1223
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
Ourselves

1224
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
It's your own fault

1225
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:03,935
Canobie the guilt fuel you kind of need

1226
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
To get yourself into a

1227
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
Or maybe you do

1228
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
I'm stupid

1229
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,567
I think is really

1230
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,847
Weird

1231
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,407
We talked about this

1232
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
Believe that masks are evil

1233
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,503
Jordan wearing them is a diaper

1234
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
And what have you

1235
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:20,575
But he sells

1236
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
Do you rationalize that here a little bit

1237
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,951
I'm not talking about

1238
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,231
Particular individual

1239
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:31,327
I'm talking about the way of Pharisee brainworx is

1240
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,887
Very one-dimensional

1241
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,215
You say the master of Fraud and cause bacterial pneumonia

1242
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
You said I don't

1243
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,543
Symbol of slavery

1244
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,871
Then what are you doing selling

1245
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,199
But when we launch them I made the decision

1246
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,295
To print with infowars.com so if you're on a plane

1247
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:52,575
Restaurant

1248
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Replace

1249
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,927
And they're making you do whatever you need to do there for whatever reason

1250
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,487
We're at to fight back

1251
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,559
And then use the abuse like a judo move

1252
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:03,839
They attack you

1253
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
No no we get it

1254
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:09,471
We don't we don't

1255
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:15,103
Doing misunderstands we understand he's selling these masks encourages audience

1256
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,407
Oppositional Defiant two people in public

1257
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,431
And hopefully cause

1258
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,479
16 big enough to go viral and get some

1259
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:24,831
Free Press

1260
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,647
Do the thing that I think is fascinating though is that Alex

1261
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:28,927
Grasp of the

1262
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,255
It's coming from the other side short name Ali

1263
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
I would say that it's

1264
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,327
Strange

1265
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:38,655
That that you do you think that this is a sign of slavery

1266
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:44,799
But that somehow this sign of slavery is okay if they branded second of slavery correct Alex

1267
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
Good profit off of

1268
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,895
Whether by selling it or the Free Press

1269
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:49,919
That comes from it

1270
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,455
Who are the potential new audience

1271
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,527
Let's get that gets exposed to your product by other people wearing it

1272
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
It's it's

1273
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,319
It's weird it's

1274
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
Stream

1275
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,903
The design of slavery would somehow become except

1276
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Triple if you Bennett

1277
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:06,047
It's a sign of slavery but you know if we're going to have slavery might as well make a little cash

1278
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,655
Pretty much what he said

1279
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,191
Also he can straight fuc

1280
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
Himself

1281
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:19,359
Valic spend even a minute looking into the history of how enslaved people were branded and mutilated to signify that they were in

1282
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,687
Maybe a little bit

1283
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,991
Complaining about having to wear a mask to go to Kroger

1284
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:26,527
The f****** dick

1285
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
But

1286
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
He did Brave

1287
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,671
The slavery of

1288
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,975
Public spaces or somewhere

1289
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,511
Cuz you needed to see Wonder Woman

1290
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
And I talked

1291
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Everybody I saw

1292
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
In the movie theater

1293
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
It was amazing

1294
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,911
Alamo Drafthouse

1295
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Horrible socialist levels down

1296
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,287
I love it you go in all the lights are turned off

1297
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
They're sitting

1298
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,663
Little thermometer

1299
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
Laser thermometer

1300
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,599
You know the same people died this year than last year

1301
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,415
It's all Fridays I do but we just doing

1302
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,695
Oh

1303
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,767
I never existed

1304
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
Global takeover

1305
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:19,263
Horrible episode

1306
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:25,151
It was just a disgrace

1307
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,575
Google

1308
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:38,975
Why would you go to the theater that's run by terrible socialist globalist as opposed to

1309
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:44,607
Just renting it at full how can you even how can you go give money to terrible socialist global

1310
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,631
It seems like

1311
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,167
Counter to everything Alex

1312
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
It seems like you

1313
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,007
Probably Rich enough that he has a

1314
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:54,079
Pretty comfortable TV with living room

1315
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:54,847
Based on how many

1316
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,639
Goddamn movies talks about watch

1317
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,199
You think he's got a pretty cushy setup baby

1318
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
Even an in-home theater

1319
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,015
Shut up

1320
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,807
Watches movie around loved one

1321
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:04,831
Oh wait

1322
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:05,599
Can't

1323
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,415
He risked brainwashing his children

1324
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
It's true

1325
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:16,863
Be strong enough to resist the Wiles of the subliminal message Wonder Woman Wonder Woman 84

1326
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,143
Did get an R rating for it

1327
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Subliminal messages

1328
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,263
No kids 18 and older without an adult

1329
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,311
MPAA

1330
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
Subliminal

1331
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Exactly

1332
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Yeah dumb this is dumb I mean I'm not home

1333
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:37,087
Socialist globalist theater I go see who the Cubs game in

1334
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,647
The Ricketts are terrible fascist nightmare

1335
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,415
People so

1336
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,695
What you going to do

1337
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
I think I am

1338
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Think that there is

1339
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
An argument to be made for like

1340
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,351
You have to

1341
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:50,655
You can't watch the Cubs live

1342
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,215
Except by paying for a ticket

1343
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:59,615
To go to regular you know I guess you could travel to another city on TV without giving money to the Cubs

1344
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:06,015
That own their own goddamn Network their evil and you could make a similar argument that renting the movie at home would still be given by

1345
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,575
Money to the studio to where get out he doesn't support

1346
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
Whatever

1347
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
VPN

1348
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
Tourette's

1349
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:12,415
To do this

1350
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,695
Get Off the Grid buddy

1351
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,975
Still

1352
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
I don't

1353
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,047
Think it's a great idea to go to

1354
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,071
Movie theater in

1355
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,911
Austin

1356
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,007
Alex is cranky about the script

1357
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:30,079
Did the globalist Socialist movie theater to see a brainwashing

1358
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Exempt

1359
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
Is it the only way

1360
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,943
To deal with that is to have a couple of

1361
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,015
News reporter babies

1362
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,063
Thief 2 dicks

1363
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,367
Barely

1364
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,159
Patrick Howley and they both

1365
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,719
Work at National file and they are hard

1366
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,327
Can't look at them babies

1367
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
Dress up like adults

1368
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,447
Take me home

1369
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:01,567
I don't know this seats don't fit too well they've got shoulder pads on and they have

1370
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,127
These are the skills and presentation

1371
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:04,895
Of

1372
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
I don't know

1373
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
Lake debate

1374
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:09,759
Junior High kids like

1375
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,087
Just outrageous the end of the performance they both like

1376
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:17,695
Step away from their chairs one of them gets on the other shoulder

1377
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Yeah and then

1378
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:24,863
Play Tom's a little bit beefy seems like a little flu

1379
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,447
Squirrely guys do and their Laurel and Harding is Hellboy

1380
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:32,031
Team about realizing that they work at the same place it's just

1381
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,823
It's comical

1382
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,871
I kind of want to write a sitcom about it

1383
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:40,479
I will not know a nice little nice little workplace comedy about those two evil Fox

1384
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,783
I'll just suffer through listening to these

1385
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,343
2 horribly voiced people

1386
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
Explain to me how Trump

1387
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Can seize power

1388
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,743
A sitting US representative in the new Congress that will

1389
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,583
Coming on January 3rd needs to have in writing

1390
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,607
At this promote Brooks

1391
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,679
Ejection that needs to be mirrored in the Senate

1392
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:06,335
If it is with Tommy tuberville or any number of people ran Paul I'm looking at you Ted Cruz

1393
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,151
Why haven't they agreed to do this at the

1394
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:15,551
F****** a break off and go meet and discuss the allegations

1395
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:19,135
What they should do whether they should strike these electoral votes

1396
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:19,903
What the

1397
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:26,047
And in all likelihood Nancy Pelosi's house will say no Arizona's Sharpie ballot markers worth

1398
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:29,375
Was just how elections Were Meant To Be according to the founding

1399
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:32,703
Fathers meanwhile if the Republicans have a spa

1400
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:35,519
Find which will see if that happens that's the big question

1401
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,591
I will come back and say no Arizona must be thrown out

1402
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,639
Entirely up to

1403
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,175
Is President Mike Pence as

1404
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,735
The presiding officer of the joint session of Congress

1405
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,575
He gets to decide what to do with that information Alex Mike Pence

1406
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:54,719
Can say alright I'm siding with the Senate on this one we're going to toss out Arizona

1407
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,743
He can do that

1408
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Or

1409
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,815
Penske the safe

1410
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,655
Thanks and you can say there's no agreement

1411
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,215
I do not want to cast a tie-breaking vote

1412
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,263
Are for Arizona stands

1413
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
I think the founding fathers were

1414
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,847
Go ahead and throw it out the votes

1415
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:17,247
Turn on white swim yeah yeah I don't think they would worry too much about this election at all

1416
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:23,647
Flight if the founding fathers had anything to say about it not be what yours is

1417
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,743
Fathers definition

1418
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:32,095
Maybe 5 million would have been cast for this year that news Italians and Irish

1419
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,119
You can't vote

1420
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,335
F*** out of here I will tell you this

1421
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:47,711
If if they find some Byzantine way where there like no no technically I mean

1422
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,807
I'm sorry but according to Legal code 206 points e54

1423
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,111
Trump is going to be president for the next four years

1424
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,391
I'm going to start a war by mice

1425
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:59,743
By myself against Byzantine

1426
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:05,887
Yeah it's not going to fly this is here this is just fanservice

1427
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,191
If this happen

1428
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,751
The way that pappert is

1429
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:11,775
Disgusting

1430
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,103
These are objections that have to be brought up in the January 6th

1431
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,383
Joint session of Congress

1432
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
And then it would require

1433
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,223
Senator and representative to sign.

1434
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,551
Each house would meet separately and

1435
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,319
Debate the matter

1436
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
Boethiah

1437
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:26,879
Each

1438
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,927
Would have to have an objection

1439
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,487
With a senator and representative

1440
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:33,279
Memory chap to be debated

1441
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:36,607
We call on the right honorable senator from Kentucky

1442
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,911
Do you believe in reality

1443
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,959
No next person

1444
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,495
So each house

1445
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,079
Congress would then vote and they would require a simple majority for the

1446
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:46,847
Directions to Stan

1447
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,175
The objections would literally never pass the house so you can just

1448
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:50,943
Forget about that

1449
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,831
It seems nearly impossible for me to imagine that it would end up in a 50-50 tie in the Senate

1450
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
Go to be the only time

1451
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:03,999
Mike Pence's vote would matter because the only instance there would be like

1452
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:04,767
Okay

1453
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,119
Possible if both Democrats win in the Georgia runoff election

1454
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Ensure

1455
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:15,263
Been devoting the bike strictly party-line should then we get to a 50/50

1456
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,567
Super unlikely

1457
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:18,591
I find it

1458
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,687
Really difficult to believe even as Craven and ghoulish is some of these GOP Khan

1459
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,247
I can't imagine Mitt Romney

1460
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,783
Loading along that line

1461
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,575
They just heard my threat

1462
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:41,375
If I start my own War

1463
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
Mitt Romney

1464
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
Would I don't

1465
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
There's a number of GOP

1466
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,519
Do senators that I don't think

1467
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,895
I think even McConnell's

1468
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:54,943
Atossa

1469
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,551
Mcraven dickwad if he thought he could win

1470
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,367
If he thought he would lose you find some way to screw somebody else will you

1471
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:07,487
You couldn't even if you do that then you somehow get the objection to stand in the Senate

1472
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
Still doesn't stand in the house

1473
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,303
It doesn't matter

1474
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,191
These statutes are really clear that in order for things like this to fly there needs to be agreement in both houses of Congress

1475
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:20,543
When there's an alternative slate of electors offer from each state in the house

1476
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:23,103
If they disagree on which to accept

1477
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:28,735
The statute states that the votes of the electors whose appointment was certified by the governor of the state

1478
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,503
Shelby

1479
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Counted

1480
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:35,391
The only outcome this is going to result in his like they're just going to draw this s*** out

1481
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,183
The process is just going to get dragged out

1482
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,999
They're going to stall any gun government operation

1483
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:44,351
They're going to further radicalize and to educate the right-wing elements you just can't accept

1484
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
The Trump lost

1485
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,959
Peppers that you're creating this fantasy world

1486
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:51,519
And then when that world does not materialize

1487
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
It's just going to drive the audience

1488
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,591
Deeper into the hole of resentment

1489
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,383
Insisting that the system is broken

1490
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
Going to campus

1491
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:59,967
Like these magical fantasy plans don't work

1492
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
What hope do

1493
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:04,319
Natural process have screwed

1494
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:05,855
That's all that's going on here

1495
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Yeah

1496
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,439
Draw it out drag it out

1497
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
Yeah the the problem

1498
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,743
Is

1499
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,047
Once you've exhausted all of your magic

1500
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:14,815
Copeland's

1501
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:17,119
Then everybody who's believed that the magic

1502
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:19,167
Plans could happen eventually has to go

1503
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Nothing we do work

1504
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,263
We have to do something

1505
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
I'm usually the thing that they think

1506
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
To do different

1507
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,127
Is not like

1508
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,223
Get into actually

1509
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
Community Building

1510
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:35,039
That's because

1511
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,575
They never they don't ask

1512
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,879
Why don't we why are we always lose

1513
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,439
Because they are because of

1514
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Plans or magical

1515
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,487
Can't be that

1516
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:48,607
It has to be because these people are so evil they won't even follow the rules that weird

1517
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:52,191
We're the good guys we're trying to follow the rules and they won't

1518
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
It's not that

1519
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:53,983
We're full of s***

1520
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,519
Nope nope certainly not

1521
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:02,431
Tom pepper coming in with his magical Mike Pence plans and also on the

1522
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,455
Call right

1523
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:05,503
Just like really being a s*** head

1524
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,343
Will Alex not first of all I want to make clear that cuz I just got a text

1525
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,951
You're nobody's considering I replacing Mike Pence it in the short-term as a strategy but

1526
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
Mark my words that was looked into

1527
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,535
That was research

1528
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,327
Absolutely no one

1529
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
As a free pass

1530
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,911
If they're going to go against President Donald Trump

1531
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,959
President Donald Trump is the Republican Party

1532
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
President Donald Trump

1533
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:30,079
Is this movement and the American people are desperate to keep him in here

1534
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:34,175
I looked into this a little bit and I found a mission statement

1535
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,479
Patrick Howley

1536
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
Cheshire

1537
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:40,575
There is no loyalty except loyalty to Donald Trump

1538
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,879
There's no love except low for Donald Trump

1539
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,671
There's no laughter except the last

1540
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,207
Triumph over antifa

1541
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,767
There's no art no literature no science

1542
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,583
When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need for science

1543
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,351
There'll be no.

1544
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,655
Distinction between Beauty and ugliness

1545
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:57,727
There'll be no curiosity no enjoyment of the process of life

1546
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,287
All competing Pleasures will be destroyed but always

1547
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:06,687
I do not forget this Winston there will always be the intoxication of our constantly increasing eat get where I'm going

1548
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
Get a

1549
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,039
Get a job that does

1550
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,599
Do something good with B become a bricklayer

1551
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,135
Do something good with your life

1552
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,415
Instead of writing that

1553
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:19,743
Sweat a little bit

1554
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,911
I mean spiritually

1555
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,751
Patrick Ali's a little bit to like

1556
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,519
Obvious

1557
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,615
Here's what's going to happen on January 6th is great Independent Media

1558
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,919
And an Alex Jones

1559
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:39,199
Are going to show the world

1560
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,503
In real-time all of the evidence

1561
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
If the courts

1562
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Have Nots

1563
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,319
Making public

1564
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:48,415
To the people on the Supreme Court won't even here and I know Matt gaetz is going to

1565
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,463
I know we can drag it out

1566
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
4 hours

1567
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,255
Upon hours

1568
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:56,095
Upon hours and create a maximum pressure scenario

1569
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,375
And that's why

1570
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,399
We're doing

1571
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,471
Is going to really make an impact

1572
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,007
So that was true

1573
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:09,407
A few too many cards they're going to achieve is this big dumb dumb publicity stunt

1574
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,991
The process by however long they can to maximize

1575
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,855
Unfortunately according to us go to each of Jackson that gets made his Limited

1576
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:21,951
The two hours of debate with no congressperson being allowed more than 5 minutes

1577
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
To speak or question the matter

1578
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:27,071
You can do the math if you want but according to the law there's only so much they

1579
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,143
They can drag that out this way good luck

1580
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
Enjoy

1581
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:32,703
Jesus

1582
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,519
Tom and Pat

1583
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,055
Close things out

1584
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:38,847
By explaining

1585
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Hey

1586
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,639
Hoover Dam global

1587
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,199
All right I just have here

1588
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:43,967
These people are

1589
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
F****** nut

1590
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
That's okay

1591
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,807
30 seconds for 1 minute each

1592
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
How would you describe in one minute

1593
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,207
You started to say is accurate at 6

1594
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,743
Collection of psychopaths

1595
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
I figured out that

1596
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,047
They can leverage blackmail

1597
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
Extortion

1598
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,631
Bribery everything you can get to

1599
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,679
Keep a seed in power no matter what kind

1600
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:08,031
Country is the global hegemon if it's the United States that's great if it's China who cares

1601
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:11,103
That is the global if they are power-drunk they are sick

1602
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,431
And they don't they have no loyalties to anything but Power

1603
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,479
Well they might have loyalty the ball

1604
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
2

1605
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,391
They are overseeing a genocide of little babies

1606
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,439
There's sick people they have a religion

1607
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
People leave that there

1608
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:30,559
Descended from the Nephilim Bloodlines at the satanic luciferian called

1609
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:31,583
Wow

1610
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,287
Artemis believe

1611
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:44,639
The Nephilim

1612
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,919
They don't

1613
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,223
Wow don't exist

1614
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,039
Don't know but what they talked about behind closed doors

1615
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
This really

1616
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,951
Say that out loud definitely believe they're descended from the Nephilim

1617
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
Okay

1618
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303

Which is not well

1622
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,031
So I was running

1623
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:14,847
Steal booze from somebody to toddlers wearing

Book service announcer

Really key for the info Warriors

01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
Detective Hart

01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,903
Either I absolutely agree with you and

1632
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:32,767
We we have to physically not support the big levels change sometimes we still will be forced to

1633
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,839
Have to physically support Mom and Pop

1634
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,863
It's a war

1635
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
Didn't you go

1636
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:44,031
Wonder Woman at a socialist globalist movie theater on opening weekend

1637
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:49,919
Huge chain or anything like that I think you're supporting mom-and-pop I mean obviously

1638
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,711
Mom and Pop Evil globalist social

1639
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,247
Now they're still

1640
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,295
Room for that small business global

1641
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
Opening weekend

1642
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,879

Let's call this color actually brings up

1646
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,375
Good point cuz ideas

1647
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,703
I love to see in the future your show Maybe

1648
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,239
Pakistan

1649
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,031
I want to be a new show baby Folk

1650
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,055
Hassan Howie

1651
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
Setting up new

1652
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,127
Deities

1653
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:22,687
Outside of the mainstream society and

1654
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:29,599
What you're saying is 100% that the answer we should all just be focusing on communities

1655
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,159
Neighborhood sounds organization

1656
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,207
Free association groups

1657
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,047
Or we want a future where we want Traditional Values

1658
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,327
Where we honor

1659
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,655
Life we honor children where we honor goodness

1660
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,727
Because they both were taken the churches and control most of those

1661
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,263
And so we need something that

1662
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,103
But something that's just human

1663
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:52,383
We reject

1664
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
We reject

1665
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,967
The wages of the New World Order God bless you

1666
01:13:56,223 --> 01:14:02,367
Paper call bring it up like hey why don't we talk more about setting up some coffee

1667
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Do you want to do

1668
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,399
We're stuck our imaginary enemies have solutions that we don't like

1669
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,423
Because they're also

1670
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,287
We have to make a rural autonomous Zone

1671
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,847
Skousen shows up

1672
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
And

1673
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:26,687
The conversation about this

1674
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:28,479
Dumb elector plan

1675
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,783
The Tom pappert was pitching earlier

1676
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:31,807
Comes up

1677
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
Mosaic

1678
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,367
2000's credit

1679
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,183
You have to go in for that b******* he thinks it's a dumb plan

1680
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:44,351
It's going to be very easy to block it doesn't matter how many people are in favor of the Trump electors all it takes is to

1681
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
Ur3 to block

1682
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
And I think

1683
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
What's going to happen in the sea

1684
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Is there any

1685
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
Disrespectful

1686
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:56,127
Eating a little bit disrespectful a little bit

1687
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Having a little

1688
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,271
In terms of him

1689
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
You know saying that this

1690
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,319
His plan is dumb

1691
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
Yes I will

1692
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,135
Cracked my hat

1693
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
Call this point

1694
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
What he starts talking about

1695
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
There was that

1696
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,791
Story those going around about John Roberts

1697
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:17,887
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court yelling about how we can't take up his case absolutely

1698
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:19,679
Listen to this

1699
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:25,567
Idiot Joel skousen talk about that store

1700
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,127
As you know this

1701
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:31,199
It's supposed to bleed from the Supreme Court

1702
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,247
Which I'm a little bit doubtful of

1703
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:39,391
Stating the John Roberts you know how to yelling and screaming session threaten conservatives into

1704
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,951
Not taking up the Texas case

1705
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,767
For fear of rioting

1706
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
Trump

1707
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:50,399
The Supreme Court came out the next

1708
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:57,823
There was no such yelling match because the Supreme Court Justice in person

1709
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,591
Weeks

1710
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,151
Because of covid-19 everything's done by Zoom meeting

1711
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:03,455
Another person that said well

1712
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,271
It's very possible they did meet in person because

1713
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,623
John Roberts wouldn't want to put this on Zoom which is not a secure former

1714
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,159
Communications that could have been

1715
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:17,023
And lead to the American people what he was saying on that so I think there's good arguments in both

1716
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,839
I dunno Alex

1717
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:24,191
That John Roberts is a controlled individual by the Deep state

1718
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,567
Always vote against Trump to make sure he's not re-elected

1719
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,103
What a f****** idiot

1720
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,383
Alright so

1721
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,455
Doubt this story

1722
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,223
Even happy

1723
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
Great

1724
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,271
Start

1725
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:40,319
Start to launch this ship

1726
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:43,391
They told me that it didn't happen because the only

1727
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,927
Zoom meeting to happen for weed

1728
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,999
My rebuttal to that is

1729
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,023
What if they did

1730
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:57,215
Whoa yeah that's a good one what if instead of the thing that's real they did the thing that I say

1731
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:02,335
I'm going to f****** subscribe to your newsletter man you were killing it

1732
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
Reasoning is being brought to this

1733
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:10,271
Alright now I know the sun rose yesterday but

1734
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,039
What is it

1735
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
Didn't

1736
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,623
What would we say then I would guess that

1737
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
Any communication between

1738
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:16,927
Supreme Court judge

1739
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
This is not something

1740
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:24,351
And therefore this meeting would not be different or special from any other meeting

1741
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,167
If any is being done on Zoom I would assume

1742
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
Probably

1743
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,983
Hyper secure

1744
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,775
Special zoom zoom

1745
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:33,823
I would doubt it

1746
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,871
Very stupid

1747
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,687
Very stupid reasoning skills buried

1748
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
Analysis

1749
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:45,087
I will say as we found out what we did our bonus episode of resume

1750
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,391
It's not even possible for John Roberts

1751
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
It's the scream at somebody through Zoo

1752
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:55,583
It cuts your volume off 100 near as loud as your laptop

1753
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,679
In this episode

1754
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,703
Alright I was in

1755
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,031
Who cares just talked about how you need to live an hour outside of town

1756
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,311
I want to move an hour outside

1757
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:10,175
I do not want to talk about

1758
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:13,759
So we are we jump to the 29th here this is

1759
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,527
Is delightful

1760
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,319
I find this a lot of fun

1761
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Alex decides to

1762
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
Have to kick things off

1763
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
By teasing

1764
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:20,927
A little bit

1765
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,071
Even about a little little too

1766
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,631
Now I know some credible information

1767
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
But I am at Liberty to just

1768
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,287
Give you a hint which I don't think too hard

1769
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,127
January 6th will be wild

1770
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,199
In DC well it will be like

1771
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,783
But I can tell you the Twilight Zone

1772
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,367
Nature of all of this one up to a whole new level.

1773
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:55,487
Alex keep trying to hit the Trump going to come to the rallies

1774
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:02,143
I love you ideas for baby in like some information

1775
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,191
Don't

1776
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,727
Giveaway the information

1777
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:06,751
Make a puzzle

1778
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,543
This is really serious

1779
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
You got to be on the up-and-up about this

1780
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,663
Now I'm not going to tell you what

1781
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
How to hit

1782
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:20,831
Eli

1783
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,647
Hard to say that I just want you to put your own

1784
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
Spin on it

1785
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
Alright

1786
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:31,327
Yesterday's show the 28th was kind of disappointing in a lot of ways there wasn't a lot of content there's a lot of

1787
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,119
Stupid s*** anytime those two

1788
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
Do Dum Dums are on the show

1789
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:37,215
Yeah

1790
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:43,359
Wonder Woman complaining and I found it to be uninspired and by Alex standards

1791
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,687
Didn't even talk about Pedro pass

1792
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,479
Cuz it's amazing

1793
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:49,759
Muselk

1794
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,599
I'm sure he is but there was a problem with the show.

1795
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,183
It was beyond what I could observe

1796
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:01,023
Okay let me just try to calmly explain this

1797
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
I got

1798
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,607
A show for San Jose

1799
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,167
And then I got so upset

1800
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,703
After looking all the news

1801
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,727
Over preparing

1802
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,495
Watching wonder why

1803
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:14,592
That I was in such a show yesterday

1804
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,688
Paradise couldn't couldn't get my job done

1805
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
Cuz I was too

1806
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:22,272
Prepared again

1807
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,088
Instantly over-prepared whining about Wonder Woman

1808
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Happened because

1809
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,136
Cuz he was too

1810
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,256
And someone named Diana called in

1811
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,280
Well then you got it

1812
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,560
You just got up

1813
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,888
Look I don't blame him for that I would have done the same in that situation

1814
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,704
And then today he's like I got to Maaco.

1815
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,752
You know I got it I had all the

1816
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:47,872
This over preparation yesterday now I must pay off that over preparation

1817
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:51,456
To do show off like a baby might need about Wonder Woman

1818
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,736
Covid stocks

1819
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
One is from yesterday

1820
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,552
3 Year from today

1821
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
Four covid stats

1822
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Look at this.

1823
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
Look at this one

1824
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
Look at all these stacks

1825
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:05,280
I have so much paper

1826
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,816
I've seen

1827
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:11,168
Look I I will have been in the pool hustling game for for a while

1828
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:14,496
I'll tell you right now I've see I know when somebody has

1829
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
Some fake ones

1830
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,824
Alright I know what's underneath that all

1831
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,128
I know what's going on this is somebody who's like

1832
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
Pata de SA

1833
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
Hit the word limit

1834
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,880
That's that I would feel a little this

1835
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
Do the size 15

1836
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
It's

1837
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Much a desperate attempt

1838
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,048
To trick people into that

1839
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
Thinking he's prepared at all

1840
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:45,216
Because it visually looks like he might have.

1841
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,544
But it's all good

1842
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
Just a magic trick

1843
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,896
Alice's apparently the story is

1844
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,456
Another level of Deep Cover denialism

1845
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Some that again

1846
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,784
Was like the kind of thing that I just had to walk away from

1847
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,320
Breathe a little bit

1848
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,600
F*** you man

1849
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,928
Turning people away

1850
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,328
What restaurant is full but there's 10 more next door than our

1851
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,912
That's how they statistically but I don't just tell you that

1852
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:22,080
British show you where you can go directly in the cdc's outnumbered and see what every hospital in Yorktown

1853
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,896
Play the Cubs

1854
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,432
Because they're all incentivised

1855
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
Call ecobee to get money

1856
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
I need to be in the hospital

1857
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,808
Travis County

1858
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
You said

1859
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:37,440
As of last night 9% covid capacity

1860
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,256
There are 70

1861
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
7

1862
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:42,816
People

1863
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,400
Hospitals in Austin in Travis County

1864
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,680
That supposedly I'm cover

1865
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:49,728
We're talking millions of people

1866
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,008
70

1867
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,032
7

1868
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
In the hospital

1869
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:59,456
Alex is desperately trying to spin the new stories that have been coming out about how hospitals are going to have to start talking

1870
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,224
Think about rationing

1871
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,784
And care cuz they can't handle the load of patients

1872
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,576
With the surge of covid-19 cases

1873
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,112
Obviously this

1874
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:10,464
2 something people have been warning about for a long time and everything Alex has stood for

1875
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,256
Exact things that people wore

1876
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,792
Would cause the need to ration care

1877
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,584
And turn people away from hospital

1878
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:19,936
The fact that we've reached the point we have should be a sign that people like Alex Jones

1879
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,496
Cancerous influence on the public information space

1880
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,592
And that his recommendations headlight exactly where everyone knew they would

1881
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,384
So it's super important for him to act

1882
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
Like all this is imaginary

1883
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Or something

1884
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:37,344
The way he chooses to do it is by covering the story like a 5th grader doing a book report about a novel he's only pretending to have read

1885
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
There's a couple of days

1886
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:43,232
Details that he got from reading the back cover these hitting really hard in order to fake like he knows what he's talkin

1887
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,560
A December 28th article in the Austin

1888
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
Austin Statesman reported that the ICU

1889
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
Occupancy in Travis County Road

1890
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
Supersite

1891
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
In just the previous week

1892
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:56,544
The county has a maximum ICU availability of 200 patients

1893
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,592
And they were at 132

1894
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,360
Do on Monday night

1895
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:06,272
They're 422 hospitalizations in the county link to covid-19 as of the time of that the writing of that are

1896
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:08,576
I'll try to get a sense of what out

1897
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,600
To possibly be talking

1898
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624
Because the numbers

1899
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:11,648
But he's using are just

1900
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,440
Wheatley out of sync with anything I can find

1901
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
Reported anywhere

1902
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:19,584
I looked at the Austin covid-19 surveillance dashboard and I think I figured out where you got the seven

1903
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:20,864
27 number from

1904
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:23,680
I think that was the number of people listed as on

1905
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Ventilator

1906
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
At the time that he looked at the data okay

1907
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,824
December 31st that number was up to 81

1908
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:33,920
It seems like the number could have possibly be close to what he was saying at the time but he read it

1909
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,480
But I actually found a Statesman article

1910
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,064
From earlier this week that cited that the number of people on ventilators

1911
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,344
What's 77

1912
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,112
In Austin

1913
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:45,696
On Monday episode was recorded

1914
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,720
Pretty sure that's

1915
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:51,840
What's outrageous about this if this is what he's going off of

1916
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:52,608
Like this this

1917
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Misinterpretation

1918
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:57,472
Is it right next to the ventilator number on the covid-19 dashboard is the

1919
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,240
Be hospitalized

1920
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,264
Best figure

1921
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,544
Twice as large a phone

1922
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,080
Which is much higher

1923
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:07,200
If Alex actually it looked real find these numbers they would be literally impossible

1924
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:08,736
For him to miss that one and

1925
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,504
Stevie other one

1926
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,320
It kind of heavily implies that either he's just repeating

1927
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:15,136
Something that someone told him which is an accurate

1928
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:18,464
Or he's willfully passing along inaccurate information in order to

1929
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,256
Minimize the public health risk

1930
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:23,328
Pose by covid-19

1931
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,352
Extra people killed

1932
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:30,240
I mean he just saw Wonder Woman so whenever he read that he was his brain was all messed up he thought the

1933
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:34,080
But the smaller number was the only number that you could say that's what happens with Wonder Woman

1934
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:36,128
You can't see large numbers

1935
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,176
Yeah I know it's a real bummer

1936
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:42,016
Write something bigger than 16.5 and I

1937
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,808
Cannot read it

1938
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:50,208
Also in terms of deaths the City of Austin put out a press release on December 30th announcing the covid-19 was the third

1939
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:51,232
Highest cause of death

1940
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,280
This year behind only cancer and heart to

1941
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:57,120
The number is it at least 548 this year

1942
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
If you do a little bit of math

1943
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
It's north of 1 week

1944
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,728
Also I know it's

1945
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,032
It's not possible I wish you'd

1946
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Just stop doing stuff

1947
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
Like this

1948
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
Like it's so much more fun when it's

1949
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,408
Wonder Woman Illuminati symbolism

1950
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,176
Fake Jeffers

1951
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
Person quotes

1952
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,040
Sucks it blows me away like I understand it

1953
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Because

1954
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,136
I have never been able to

1955
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,464
Light $20,000 on fire whenever I wanted

1956
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,792
But I never fails to surprise me what

1957
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,072
People will be convinced

1958
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,352
Is enough to like

1959
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,888
Corrupt somebody

1960
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,472
Like this whole I called making an extra 20 grand out of

1961
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:38,592
Advertise advertise K and ICU and it's like that's nothing

1962
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:41,664
The people that you are describing as being the evil billionaire

1963
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:43,456
That are destroying everything

1964
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
What

1965
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:45,760
Put put

1966
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:49,088
$20,000 under their shoes just to feel like what it's

1967
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:51,904
To step on money

1968
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,464
Does a secondary conversation even

1969
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:58,048
The past that that money is being discussed isn't like some kind of a bonus

1970
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,096
Yeah yeah yeah

1971
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,656
Like its Medicare payments

1972
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:08,288
What do you think of people who have other things don't also have payments attached them like

1973
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:09,056
A heart attack

1974
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Do you think that maybe

1975
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,664
Might be more No-No if you go in for a cough

1976
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,712
And you have a heart attack they still only pay for

1977
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:22,112
For the cops they're not giving people bonuses just for having a heart attack in the hospital they are 0-4 others

1978
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,464
It's so stupid

1979
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:29,280
The number is also like

1980
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,560
Really big

1981
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:34,400
Do people like us do people like

1982
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:39,008
It's one of those things that it's hilarious to me whenever people are like oh

1983
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,616
House of Representatives make like $140,000 a year

1984
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:46,432
Yes I know that's a lot of money to you and me

1985
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,480
The oligarchs who owns them

1986
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,552
They can ship out $140,000 every 5

1987
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,832
Like it is

1988
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,368
So little

1989
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:58,464
The real scale of corruption that we are existing in

1990
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
Is World level like

1991
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,304
The country

1992
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,656
It's what corruption I will corrupt you

1993
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,728
If you own suydam now like that's the level of

1994
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,008
Billionaire evil corrupt

1995
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:11,776
Then we're dealing with

1996
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,824
I think I get what you're saying

1997
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,592
The scale

1998
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:21,248
So I thought that was bad I thought that Alex is claiming that 77 people are hospitalized with covid-19

1999
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,296
And Travis County which is

2000
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:25,088
Is demonstrable not truant

2001
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
Very bad

2002
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
I know there's bad but then this is

2003
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,672
Is worse

2004
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,440
I think

2005
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,280
Kyle Rittenhouse is Mother

2006
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
No

2007
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:36,864
No Peter first interview

2008
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,144
No

2009
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
No leprosy

2010
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:46,080
I know this is your first interview show

2011
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:48,384
She'll be joining us with her lawyer

2012
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:51,712
About the incredible persecution of The Rittenhouse it's a beta tester

2013
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,272
The rest of us in the

2014
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:59,904
Alex cannot stop saying we are all Kyle

2015
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,464
House she's a very uncomfortable

2016
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,488
Not good

2017
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
It's bad interview

2018
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,536
A little bit

2019
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:10,400
To end this episode we are all murderers however is something that I would

2020
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,448
Save that that Alex is

2021
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,984
Is correct on spirit

2022
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,008
Describing yeah

2023
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:17,056
So we got to get back to this Hospital

2024
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,336
Alex

2025
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,128
He's going to blow the lid off

2026
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
Man

2027
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,944
This guy is an in-depth

2028
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:23,968
Journalist

2029
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:30,624
I'm about to lay out for you the absolute truth

2030
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,208
You have total criminal fraud

2031
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,512
By the hospital

2032
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:38,304
By the media

2033
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
By the CDC

2034
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:45,216
Leave your house for a few months

2035
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
A 2.5

2036
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,032
Million Dead just a few months

2037
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:50,336
Hospitals are already overwhelmed

2038
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:53,664
And the people went to the very Hospital

2039
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,064
Remember when everybody took pictures of parking lots and pretended to know one with the hospital and I remember that

2040
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,344
Industrial

2041
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,416
Nonsense for a bit

2042
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:08,256
Actually talking about article on NPR that

2043
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
You found where

2044
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
Is yours

2045
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,960
And then you went to the federal government CDC website

2046
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Know you know there

2047
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:26,432
You know you're not what you got a billion dollars

2048
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
This week is yours

2049
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:38,720
So what's going on here is that Alex is upset about an article he didn't read in NPR where they had some links that I guess he's certain

2050
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
No one followed

2051
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:46,400
I'm certain that Alex didn't do any original research on this nor do I believe that he went and looked at the raw data cuz I'm certain

2052
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,704
To be unable to read the Excel spreadsheet

2053
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
Dilaudid

2054
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,520
Yeah it's a lot of rows

2055
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:58,176
He's talking about the data visualization that NPR posted which does show the Travis County has 9% of its own

2056
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:59,712
Known inpatient beds used

2057
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,480
For covid patients

2058
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,272
The problem with that

2059
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,576
Is meaningless

2060
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:05,856
Princeton

2061
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:09,696
If Alex looked a little bit deeper into the data he'd see that 9 out of 50

2062
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,256
Boston hospitals are not included in the data

2063
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,584
So it's a little incomplete and times are getting the full picture

2064
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,376
But even beyond that

2065
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,448
The problem isn't that all the beds are being taken up by covid Page

2066
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:27,104
It's that with Rising covid patients the hospitals are reach their capacity and have no beds left for anybody else who might need

2067
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:30,432
That's why I'm more than surface-level analysis

2068
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,456
Is dadaism poor

2069
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:32,736
So let's take

2070
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,064
St. David's Medical Center in Austin as an example

2071
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,624
They showed 7% of their adult

2072
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,160
Inpatient beds being taken up

2073
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:40,928
For covid page

2074
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,464
That seems like nothing

2075
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:43,488
A drop in the bucket

2076
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
7%

2077
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,304
However if you look at the next

2078
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,168
Column you'll see that 93% of their total adult inpatient beds are occupied

2079
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,496
So any increases in covid patients would be a disaster for them

2080
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,056
You see this in many the included Austin

2081
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,896
Ascension Seton Medical Center has 30

2082
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:02,944
10% of its beds taken by covid

2083
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,248
But 90% total occupied

2084
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,064
Dell Seton Medical Center at UT Austin

2085
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
10 is 23% of

2086
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,624
Meds taken by covid patient

2087
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,440
But 94% are occupied total

2088
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,792
North Austin medical center 10% are covid patients

2089
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,608
But 94% total are occupied

2090
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,912
This is the pattern that is

2091
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,680
The important

2092
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:27,008
The concern is definitely partially that there

2093
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
Lot of covid cases

2094
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,056
Symphony to be treated

2095
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:31,616
But the larger picture has to take into account

2096
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,664
Did hospitals have a certain capacity

2097
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:37,760
But even beyond that they only have a certain amount of human attention that can be provided

2098
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
Patience

2099
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:42,112
You can't magically create doctors and nurses in a 3D printer

2100
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,904
Even if you add a ton of beds

2101
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:48,000
Or put patients who should be in the ICU and not ICU bed

2102
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
It's not like that part of the equation

2103
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,560
Can be balanced out

2104
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,864
This is the sort of contact that Alex

2105
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,960
The price of his because he

2106
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,984
Pics of this 9%

2107
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
Statistic

2108
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:02,592
You can go that 9% all he wants but it doesn't change the reality

2109
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,872
Far more complex

2110
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,408
Then surface-level faked

2111
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
Courts yeah

2112
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,224
I feel like I might be saying it's a lot but

2113
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,016
This is disgraceful like it it's just a

2114
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
It's infantile bulshit

2115
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
This elevator has

2116
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:19,488
100 people on it and there's only an increase in 9% of covid patients adding to the Elevate I mean sure

2117
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,536
The maximum capacity is 50

2118
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,816
And the elevators going

2119
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,584
To fall

2120
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,608
And everyone's going to

2121
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,448
Fit an extra 9%

2122
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:35,104
It's interesting when you either willfully or are unable to understand

2123
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,872
The complexities

2124
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:38,176
The things and then you gloat about

2125
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:38,944
Yeah

2126
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
So there you go

2127
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:40,992
What is a gentleman

2128
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:45,344
7%

2129
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,440
Boston Medical Center

2130
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,464
20%.

2131
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:54,048
Ascension

2132
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,632
Oh no this one

2133
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:02,496
They're at 13%

2134
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:09,152
Again those are the hospitals that we just discussed he's not taking into account the larger picture and he's gloating

2135
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:09,920
About missing

2136
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,712
The point which is kind of like

2137
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,504
Exactly what Alex

2138
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:19,136
I'm going to cut up this next clip because it's pointless but I just thought it was pretty

2139
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:21,440
Pretty funny but Alex claims that he fat

2140
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,720
Fact check Johns

2141
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,376
Alright alright alright

2142
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:34,240
EPA

2143
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,776
Taking care of John

2144
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:38,592
Is this number I just thought that was really funny mental image of the

2145
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:42,176
In comparison to how excited I got when I heard this.

2146
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,248
So there's fast now I haven't hit the latest

2147
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:48,576
Actually

2148
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:51,648
A power control

2149
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:58,048
It was first in a Canadian document they tried to say well we're not sure what's real but we were able to search the document find other documents rather country

2150
01:34:58,304 --> 01:34:59,328
Confirm it is real

2151
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:05,984
Straight ahead

2152
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,312
God damn you so excited

2153
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,384
We have you now

2154
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,152
Yes

2155
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,432
You better

Better now

2159
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:27,488
You know me pretty well you know that's something that gets me excited when Alex drop something like that on my lap

2160
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:33,888
We have them now not later we're not going to get them soon now is when we have

2161
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:39,520
Alright cuz Alex

2162
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:42,848
There's more important things going on

2163
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,384
Okay

2164
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
Maryam

2165
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:49,760
I should have known he had a cellmate

2166
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,784
Usher

2167
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,624
And I'd cellmate just died of covis you are now this is a conspiracy

2168
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:00,512
Problems

2169
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,280
My uncle said

2170
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,656
News reports

2171
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:11,520

Hanging Shelf

2173
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:14,848
In August it was there

2174
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,432
Contracted the Coronavirus

2175
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,504
Kelly was found dead in his apartment

2176
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:24,064
Heather telling you it was Coronavirus

2177
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,600
Kitty Wells die

2178

Please pull up a server

2180
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:31,488
Little do you know

Dallas

2183

Call Jack

2184
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,656
I think he thought of

2185
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:43,008
Bit before he realized that the cellmate wasn't there when it happened

2186
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:47,616
Yeah yeah

2187
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:52,224
Really strong like

2188
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
Was she at

2189
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,320
Thought this was the person I was going to pin the murder on the going to be great

2190
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,600
Is there really going to be great

2191
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Yeah

2192
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:04,256
Alex hasn't got the memo from Trump lawyer tweeting about

2193
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:05,536
It's going on here

2194
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
Oh God

2195
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,608
I'm going to cut out this

2196
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,376
Copart

2197
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
To I just

2198
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:13,472
I have no patience for it right now and it's not important

2199
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,264
I can just tell you what happened

2200
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,056
Ivan reichlin

2201

You hung out with Michael Flynn Jr

2202
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,480
Some kind of a search engine

2203
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,016
Start up a they're great

2204
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
Confusing stuff

2205
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,064
He is on

2206
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,856
His argument for Alex

2207
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,416
Is the Trump needs to immediately take over the emerge

2208
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:34,720
Okay that'll do it

2209
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:36,256
Then we'll all

2210
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,560
Eddie needs to start I guess like

2211
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,352
Broadcasting

2212
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,376
Two people and a

2213
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:44,448
Explaining like the election was stolen over their phones

2214
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
Or something

2215
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:52,128
Specifics of what they want Trump to do but it involves taking over technology in a way that's like

2216
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,152
Usually

2217
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,712
Just for tornadoes

2218
01:37:55,968 --> 01:38:00,320
Judging by the number of times it came up in cartoons when I was growing up

2219
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:04,416
I assumed you would be able to solve most Anti reality problems

2220
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:06,208
With a frying pan to the side of the head

2221
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
You know

2222
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:13,376
Like if this happened if somebody says his reality

2223
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
Good thing I don't

2224
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
Oh yeah

2225
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:19,776
I don't know if I can

2226
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
Frying pan

2227
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,152
Only if it brings people back into reality

2228
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:27,712
I got a magical friend

2229
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:31,296
I got the sense that this had something to do with

2230
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Wonder Woman

2231
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,648
The lasso of Truth

2232
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,696
No the plot of the movie

2233
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:45,632
Like the electronic alert system

2234
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:50,240
I don't know I like I said I haven't seen the movie Alex was hinting at

2235
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
Some connection

2236
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:54,848
And Wonder Woman presidential

2237
01:38:55,360 --> 01:39:00,992
We can control and broadcast into every home using this new technology bingo

2238
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
Yep. Okay

2239
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:08,416
Yep that is honestly I forgot about that part because I don't remember too much of

2240
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,720
Anyway

2241
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Alex

2242
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Get Trump

2243
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
To use that

2244
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:20,192
Alright the super-secret magical broadcast into everybody's home

2245
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Got to stop letting me

2246
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,984
How many people watch movies

2247
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,008
Yahoo be good

2248
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:25,824
All they get to read is Heart of Darkness

2249
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:31,968
Come back to the the Alamo Drafthouse

2250
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
Colonel Kurtz

2251
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:34,784
He dead that's what you got to do

2252
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:35,808
So

2253
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,856
Sorry

2254
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:40,928
To Rittenhouse his mom

2255
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:46,816
She's rubbing it sure because we've heard Ivan raichlen before and basically his interview is no more interesting than

2256
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,864
Trump should use the emergency alert system

2257
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,656
Come to f*** with people be great

2258
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:51,424
It wouldn't

2259
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:53,216
It will be

2260
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:53,984
Dark

2261
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,264
Yeah

2262
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,848
What were the worlds was the president and also real

2263
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:07,296
Got to be awful so I feel okay skipping that I find myself uninspired

2264
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,320
At the moment

2265
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:12,672
I'm not inspired by Kyle Rittenhouse is mom as well but

2266
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,464
It seems like something that bears

2267
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
Discussion

2268
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:17,024
Alex is like really trying

2269
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,072
Turn Kyle Rittenhouse into like a folk

2270
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:19,840
Kiro

2271
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:25,984
He watched the last burn down apartment buildings in police station

2272
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:29,312
On the side of the road

2273
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,200
Demonstrations Kyle Rittenhouse

2274
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:35,968
Murder bee

2275
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,248
Symbol

2276
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,296
A murderer

2277
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,576
Murder

2278
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,600
Medic

2279
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,880
Help people

2280
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,928
Murdering people in Kenosha Wisconsin

2281
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
He's a murderer

2282
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,768
Thugs with guns

2283
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,816
Murder I forgot to self

2284
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
Book thrown at him

2285
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,400
Cuz he's a murderer

2286
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:56,960
I couldn't tell if this interview was

2287
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,240
Prompted by

2288
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,544
The state tacking on a

2289
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:03,104
Breaking curfew chart

2290
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:05,920
Even thought was a little like that's a little bit

2291
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,224
Buffalo Patty there's got to be a reason

2292
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:13,600
But I can't figure out what it is they can treat him very nicely and then hit

2293
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,904
Throw the book at him on that break

2294
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:16,672
Curfew charge

2295
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:18,464
I'm not entirely sure but

2296
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:21,024
I was listening to this and I'm like I'm going to get mad

2297
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,048
I don't like this

2298
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
But then I realized

2299
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
I'm not going to get mad

2300
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:26,144
I'm going to feel really sad

2301
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:26,912
For these people

2302
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:27,936
I mean

2303
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
Look

2304
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
No I don't

2305
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,032
But at the same time I feel gross

2306
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,312
Maybe that's what I feel

2307
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:36,896
I'm not sure exactly what I feel.

2308
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:41,504
We need more help Alex we need everyone to go to 3 Calle usa.com

2309
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,088
Outrageous excessive

2310
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,624
2 million-dollar

2311
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:47,904
Bail amount

2312
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,976
We raise those two million dollars we put the cash in a barrel

2313
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:57,120
Beside him pray he's with his family but we need a lot more resources with this is going to

2314
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:57,888
Bard

2315
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:03,264
Every American every Democrat Republican independent

2316
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:05,568
And they're going to come after you next

2317
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,872
Let's be clear about that

2318
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:12,992
People like Rittenhouse like Stone like Jones like Trump

2319
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,784
Not being a victim

2320
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,720
The lawsuits the lights

2321
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,512
I've been like nothing would be

2322
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
Happening

2323
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,304
Alex if you didn't

2324
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,328
Commit bike

2325
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:28,864
Violations

2326
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:31,424
People

2327
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:33,984
Then he wouldn't be getting

2328
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:34,752
Exuded

2329
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,776
For those those things

2330
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:38,848
Shock people

2331
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:43,712
How are even do no benefits protest with a gun that he shouldn't legally of hat

2332
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:47,040
The number of issues that you know like

2333
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,880
It's not like globalist want to just turn people into symbols

2334
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,672
Or whatever

2335
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,464
Actions that precede those

2336
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,512
Lawsuits are arrest

2337
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,072
The General ER what caused them please

2338
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,608
These f****** cheer

2339
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,424
When a black person gets

2340
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,192
10 years for

2341
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,264
I

2342
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,336
I'd like any sympathy that I had where I was like

2343
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,104
You know what

2344
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,920
It was her it was her son who did it

2345
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:20,320
She's not directly involved with that I'm not going to blame the mother you know maybe parenting is an issue I don't know

2346
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,136
I don't know them personally

2347
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:24,160
The all f******

2348
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,184
King Kong

2349
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,488
Yourself you're a murderer too I don't give

2350
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:29,536
Also this like

2351
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,840
This entire appearance is really just about race

2352
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,936
Constantly going back to the wild love like we need more money

2353
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,520
He doesn't want her just like

2354
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,544
Putting out this message

2355
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,872
You get money for Content you understand the job

2356
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,408
Tell me how bad the last

2357
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:48,992
New experience for you to really

2358
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,528
Find out what the left really like

2359
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,856
They don't like to be murdered

2360
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:55,904
Is

2361
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,464
Disgusting

2362
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
Unreal

2363
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,792
And you have to be a criminal

2364
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,608
But you want a postal

2365
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
My son

2366
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,168
Know your son's murderer

2367
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,312
Your lies have

2368
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,104
Then he's a monster

2369
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,640
A killer

2370
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,664
A murderer

2371
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,688
Yeah

2372
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:19,712
It's

2373
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,528
It's just pain

2374
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,320
I'm just sold

2375
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:26,112
You know

2376
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,392
They need to be stopped

2377
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:34,048
The internal logic here doesn't work because if the left has turned her son into a criminal and a murderer

2378
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:37,120
Then they should be putting them on a pedestal based on her saying that

2379
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:39,680
They take criminals and put them on pedestal

2380
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Don't make sense

2381
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,520
And we

2382
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:45,312
The left needs to be stopped

2383
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,592
Otherwise

2384
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:49,152
Kyle Rittenhouse will continue murdering us

2385
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,736
I just

2386
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,064
F*** you

2387
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,904

2390
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,536
What if somebody wants to say that

2391
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:09,888
New website and everything like that we're selling merchandise

2392
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680

Did buy it

2398
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
I don't care

2399
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,784
I got that vibe

2400
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:31,904
I'm interested to read Kyle's book

2401
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,464
If I did it here's how I would have done it

2402
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,048
DDC get to keep the profits from all of those

2403
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:42,400
Sales in a best-case scenario for like

2404
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,424
Like the rest

2405
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:44,448
Cast of his wife

2406
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:45,216
Like

2407
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,544
This is not

2408
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,312
Not part of it

2409
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,616
Your mom selling Kyle Rittenhouse

2410
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,896
Bikinis

2411
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Like just eat

2412
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:59,552
Take that night in Kenosha out of the equation imagine your mom selling a bikini with your face on it

2413
01:46:00,576 --> 01:46:01,856
That would be years of therapy

2414
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,136
Be great.

2415
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:03,904
Great

2416
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,440
Abbey real great

2417
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
It seems gross

2418
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:09,792
Jesus

2419
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,840
That's not because it's a bit

2420
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:13,120
I mean it's just like

2421
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:13,888
Hayward

2422
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:14,656
It's just

2423
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:16,192
Crass you know like it

2424
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,216
Exploitative

2425
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:19,264
Yeah it's like a it's like a

2426
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
Peaky blinders

2427
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:23,872
Whenever the one kid goes to jail and his mom

2428
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:27,456
It went up sleeping with the the corrupt

2429
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:29,248
Evil Northern Irish

2430
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:32,064
Police chief to get him out and he's like

2431
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
Ma

2432
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,880
What did you do

2433
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,440
Infinitely better

2434
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:40,000
Then if you find out your mom sold your face on it

2435
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Bikini

2436
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,584
I refuse to believe the peaky blinders exist

2437
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,376
I think it's just a funny name

2438
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,400
All right Joe

2439
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,680
Murphy's

2440
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:49,728
Are you got this vibe

2441
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:52,032
Office mom that really worried

2442
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,056
You know like

2443
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:56,640
Laughing about selling bikinis and then getting a little defensive about it

2444
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,432
Like alright alright Ma

2445
01:46:58,944 --> 01:46:59,712
Oh and then

2446
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,992
The lawyer comes in

2447
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:09,696
There has been a long march through the institutions over the past few decades

2448
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:12,768
Mass revolution in China and the Chinese

2449
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:17,632
They attempt to destroy everything sacred in a society

2450
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,728
They try to destroy history

2451
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:24,288
Destroy our faith in God

2452
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:26,592
And they try to capture the key

2453
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,408
Institutions such as the media

2454
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,272
Such as financial institutions and

2455
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:40,928
In-N-Out

2456
01:47:46,816 --> 01:47:51,168
All I can say is Amen to that we got one more second with you guys coming up

2457
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
I don't like the idea of this guy thinks there's a

2458
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,152
Lawyer

2459
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,968
Such as

2460
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,248
This is like

2461
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,832
This is like when you're 17 and there's like

2462
01:48:09,088 --> 01:48:12,928
When you go to college you need to get a good Humanities education and then you can

2463
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:14,208
Kind of start getting your special

2464
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:19,328
And you're all like I don't need the what is all this Humanities bulshit my major is

2465
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:21,376
Pre-law or whatever it is like

2466
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:23,424
This is why you need a Humanities education

2467
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:28,032
This is why you need to read anything I haven't logged

2468
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,056
Confession

2469
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,080
I didn't actually watch

2470
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:31,360
Watch this video

2471
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:36,224
Can't confirm if this guy is like not a robot

2472
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:40,064
Hayirli possible theater

2473
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:43,904
Animated on Siri

2474
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,232
It's one of those machines

2475
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,816
Such as media

2476
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:56,960
Today I write the screenplay

2477
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:57,984
Oh boy

2478
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,520
So Alex is like hey I got a

2479
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,288
Great idea

2480
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:02,848
You should work with Barnes

2481
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,432
Really heavy.

2482
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,016
Now he's idea is like I don't like these pardon

2483
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:13,088
The trumpeter on route

2484
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,368
Could be used

2485
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:19,488
Forgot

2486
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,792
Can the president

2487
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,584
Pardon Rittenhouse

2488
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,936
Before he's convicted obviously he didn't do anything wrong the laws on his side

2489
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:28,704
B

2490
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:31,520
But just hypothetically

2491
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,056
Could President Trump

2492
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,128
Preemptively pardon Kyle Rittenhouse

2493
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:43,808
Authorities of the Constitution

2494
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,952
We are going to need to take

2495
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,720
Take this fight

2496
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,280
Frontline's in Wisconsin

2497
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,584
So

01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:56,608
You know

2499
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,680
Also any any political system

2500
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,960
Where you think it's

2501
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:05,056
It's a good idea to be able to write get-out-of-jail-free cards

2502
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,848
Free murder cards

2503
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,384
Preemptively

2504
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,152
Bad sister

2505
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,736
Imagining that sister

2506
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:15,040
Yeah it's not good

2507
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:21,952
Anyway so I call these people I'm not going to listen to any more of their interview it's not really that interesting it's just kind of

Speak publicly like I got to get this guy a job

2511
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:30,912

Yeah

2513
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,776

No more Wonder Woman socks

2515
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:40,640
Although he does get to talk about Bill Gates

2516
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,176
Bill Gates

2517
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712

The Apprentice of Bill Gates

A lot of people who believe

2555
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:35,072
Really heavily that things should be talked about it and almost

2556
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:36,608
Exclusively genetic terms

2557
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,376

01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:22,432
Whole report on this latest development

2575
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:23,200
Great

2576
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:24,992
Where you saw a few months ago they got

2577
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:28,832
Canadian document about the next lockdowns coming and then they'll be the strange

2578
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:32,160
Will never unlock things until the Communist takeover happen

2579
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:33,440
People said is this real

2580
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,464
Yes

2581
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:40,352
Alex didn't have time to cover this I don't have time for it either we'll see what happens in the next episode

2582
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,120
I hate you

2583
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,424
So much

2584
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:54,176
Do we get to a couple of different things listen

2585
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:58,016
Start using tornado alert

2586
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:03,904
You got to get the message to the people the problem with America Dan is not enough people have heard Trump

2587
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,952
That's the real issue

2588
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:07,232
Then I think we've all had

2589
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:13,632
He's just not getting his ferret court because he is worried because the courts keep reading the petitions being like

2590
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:15,424
Oh no this is this is

2591
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:19,008
Comically stupid reading is one of their big hang-up

2592
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,544
Comes to writing

2593
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,848
So I think I think we have

2594
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:23,872
A pretty good start

2595
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,664

2596
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,200

01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,368
Particularly around the lake

2600
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:36,160
77 people like that

2601
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:40,512
Glaring misunderstanding of the data anyway is action of it

2602
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,328
I feel

2603
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,144

2604
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,424

Invest like I want

2606
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,776
There's no continuity

2607
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,056
Right right right

2608
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,080
It's just all over the

2609
01:54:54,336 --> 01:54:56,128
Yeah it's everywhere

2610
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,920
