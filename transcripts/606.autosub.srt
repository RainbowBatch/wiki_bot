3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,144
Yessir Georgetown

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912

00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384

Itrip

10
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
Kind of thing

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
I mean this is Breitbart cuz I like

12
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
I'm excited about that

13
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
Also I bring this up because

14
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Because of this

15
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816
What episodes are going to be out on Wednesday and Friday next week

16
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,096
I cannot even

17
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Enjoy without couching it within an apology

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:51,616
I apologize brain is a mess

19
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Open to anyone

20
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,992
Anything for me I'm still putting up two episodes

21
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:03,392
I have a problem

22
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Remember problems

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
What's your birthday

24
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
I got a rare double bright spot

25
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:17,216
But it's also the same rights but we can't plug your stand-up show it's already happened

26
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
That's the point I did not put it on purpose

27
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,688
On the show

28
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,808
Months ago you posted

29
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,624
Today 12 you're still promoting

30
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,464
I know there's that but also the most important rights

31
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,256
Is on Friday

32
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Play I found out last night

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
That Maria Bamford is in town

34
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
The dead and so my favor

35
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Everett, Co

36
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,568
12 years who I have never been able to see life like I remember

37
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
Her first Comedy Central half hour

38
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,968
Like I can still do the the cult leader B

39
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
The first half-hour

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
Finally I get to see your life

41
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:20,960
Need somebody I know there's nobody else I know I know you got good comics

42
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
In case you're wondering

43
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:26,080
I hope you have a great time

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Today we have an episode to do and because we're not going to be having an episode on Monday

45
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
I was really hoping

46
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
Present-day episode to do

47
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,184
Ketchup see what Alex is doing in the real world in the present

48
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,536
On Wednesday we had a 2003 episode

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,680
But unfortunately Alex's Studio has been hosting

50
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
I can't think of any reason why Alex would need to be out of

51
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,288
Studio other than probably

52
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
Furious 8 hours a day meetings with lawyers I'm not entirely sure what it is either maybe he's selling his house

53
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:09,088
House for a fourth time

54
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,904
Go over for say so we were in a bind

55
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Anirban Monday

56
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
We can't not have an episode on Friday because Alex is a long week out of town

57
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,215
Might do I have to get a ticket head of work

58
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,127
Go to work

59
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
Figure out like Jim Bakker nothing good there

60
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,783
What the Project Camelot land

61
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,807
Didn't find anything

62
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:41,087
Worthwhile.

63
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
So I decided we're going to stick in 2003

64
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,719
Keep going through June 2003

65
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,023
When we talked about the 18th and the 19th

66
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Today alright

67
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,351
Terrible

68
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
Unlistenable may be a long weekend bag

69
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
Bored just

70
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
Trap

71
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
And then it heated up

72
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Okay

73
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,847
To tell you that this is one of the most

74
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Revelatory episodes

75
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
We will ever do

76
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,271
We found

77
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:16,927
In the mire of just unlistenable garbage so we'll take care of that

78
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,719
Everyone stop York

79
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:21,535
Cars in traffic right now

80
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,887
I was really hoping to avoid that kind of language

81
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:37,151
First Emory who's Celine Works been cats made them click this button thank you so much you are now policy walk

Big Louie's Sparky Donaldson thank you so much and I apologize

90

Text of being a feminist makes me a witch and witches are the brides of Satan I might technically the bride or cyber Satan

00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,479
Thank you so much you are now by Lizzie walk

Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine

94
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
I'm a policy wonk

95
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:31,167
Midas voice I'm Mister bright spot

96
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
That's fun

97
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
Okay that is fun

98
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
So Jordan today

99
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,335
Yes we're going to the zoo staying in 2003

100
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,759
Just like soda standard out of context drops

101
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,599
The other is one that I think will be very helpful in the in the future

102
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
Here's the normal line

103
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Okay

104
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:04,191
I read that I've not heard a good argument yeah

105
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:10,591
Terms of Alex's advice

106
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Have to be pretty bad to get there

107
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Spot will come in very handy in the future

108
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,391
Ohio

109
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:28,255
Danny Riley are I was listening to that and I was like

110
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:34,655
Illinois

111
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,615
Alright so here we go we're going to start on

112
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,383
The 18th

113
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,407
If this is a slog

114
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,247
Lulu's like a really bad if you get maybe the first two hours of

115
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,015
Show

116
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927
Real trouble seems kind of like being out of context

117
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Non-stop we're getting

118
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,511
To almost every time we go back there

119
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,279
But also being

120
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,095
Inexplicably boring for long stretches of time

121
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
This sometimes walking

122
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,215
Through like knee-deep mud for sure

123
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,263
Sometimes

124
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,847
What is the things that I was struck by a

125
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,383
So much Adventure

126
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
The so much more of a radio show back then

127
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,991
You know he's like hitting the headlines and going

128
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Two calls in

129
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
Hello guest

130
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:27,135
It's all it's jumping around now that you know who keeps your attention

131
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Mostly

132
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
Yeah

133
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
I was reflecting on how would we go

134
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:38,143
The 2,000 stuffies just like singing along to Country have that right now

135
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,447
No it's it's kind of like

136
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:45,055
He doesn't have as much Freedom rajawat Aviv yesterday

137
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,895
That comes later and he starts singing country and then his life completely falls apart

138
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:55,295
This is still like I'm trying to be a professional comfortable enough to be like I'm letting it all hang out

139
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,855
This is on the upswing in The Highwayman

140
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Totally

141
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,463
Miss that freedom I do like I do like that week

142
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,303
Contrack ups and downs throughout his his time and we can just

143
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
Go to like I'm feeling real bad mood let's go to 2086

144
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Play some Highwaymen

145
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:14,751
So I would say that the beginning of this show and most of it on the 18th

146
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,031
Could be summed up as like

147
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
Alex is a cab

148
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Reaper

149
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,959
It's just constantly talking about how evil the cops are that's bananas

150
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,751
I hate it so much

151
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,895
This is a specific live about like detectives but like he's he's going off on Cops

152
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:53,919
Joseph

153
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
Sometimes I feel like they're the right

154
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
Entire moral philosophy is just like whatever the late left likes

155
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,743
Today I must kill like if we could because the right has the purity of focus

156
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,023
Chris that comes along with

157
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
Having no distractions but hating little f

158
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Right if we could just get

159
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Smart enough to make them happy

160
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
I hate the right

161
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Things

162
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:19,263
By us doing the wrong thing

163
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Then we win

164
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,383
Who's a bad strategy

165
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
You run the risk of them being like Oh I like that there is Joy again

166
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Yeah it is a Hail Mary

167
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,367
Like I'm saying this is pretty boring

168
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159
Mostly a lot of like shiitake

169
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
Can the cops

170
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
Some interesting thing

171
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Things like Alex get to call here

172
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
What's an interesting Theory

173
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
About the SWAT team

174
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
Okay goodnight in the United States

175
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,239
Barney and Maryland

176
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
Are are you doing

177
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
A reason that's a brutal

178
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
So cold

179
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
SWAT team

180
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Where is ski mask

181
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,503
Is it cuz they are criminals

182
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,807
And if they are used over and over again

183
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
And I it's all part of the New Freedom

184
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,679
I don't want you to

185
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,263
Recognizing over and over again all around

186
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Backcountry

187
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,847
Roar

188
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
Man army

189
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
As long as a

190
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
People

191
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,599
Handsome man army

192
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:46,559
Are you understand what's going on here outside of the suicide squad

193
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:52,959
Is amazing there's if there's one SWAT team for the whole country

194
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:59,359
Snooker

195
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,455
Only like 15 guys Criminal

196
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
It's the best of the best

197
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Put should be artist

198
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
Sure

199
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,559
Hey that's what we do it's the suicide squad

200
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
Nonsense I like that though I enjoy these

201
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,471
Out-of-left-field. But sometimes will come up

202
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:33,663
No reason 2003 episode we talked about the case of dr. Charles cell

203
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Who was that dentist

204
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:40,063
It brought up all the issues of the involuntary medicating

205
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Because he was

206
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Not fit to stand trial like

207
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,927
Refuse to take medication

208
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
And as we discussed on that episode

209
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,535
In June

210
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
2003

211
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,095
The Supreme Court rules

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,631
That he couldn't be

213
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:58,751
Involuntary

214
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
Supreme Court ruling

215
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
Did they

216
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
Actually the opposite of the truth

217
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,847
Yeah this Supreme Court ruling in cell versus not establish proper Justice

218
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,663
Station to involuntarily Medicaid doctor cell

219
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
How much is reporting the opposite of the truth

220
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
Or what I call Ally

221
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,415
Alex is also making up at the Supreme Court ruled that people can be drugged as long as it's not too risky in terms of side effects

222
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,535
The consideration of side effect is definitely part of the equation but it's Alex it taken even

223
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,327
Couple minutes to read the Court's decision

224
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,887
He would know that the version of this he's pitching his frogs

225
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:04,543
The court has a very narrow window of cases that could lend themselves to involuntary medication

226
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Involuntarily medicating

227
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
From the top

228
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Quote

229
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,735
First a court must find that important governmental interest rates

230
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:17,599
The government's interest in bringing to trial in individual accused of a serious crime is Emporia

231
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,463
However courts must consider each cases fact in evaluating disinterest because

232
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,023
Special circumstances May lessen its importance

233
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,095
Eg a defendant's refusal to take drugs made me in length

234
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:28,863
Deconfinement

235
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,983
Which would diminish the risks of breathing without punishment one who has committed a serious crime

236
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:38,335
In addition to its substantial interest in timely prosecution

237
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,127
The government has a comp committed

238
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Pinterest

239
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
In ensuring a defendant a fair trial

240
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,527
Second the court must conclude that forced medication would

241
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,855
Significantly further those concomitant State entry

242
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,719
It must find that medication is substantially likely to render the defendant

243
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,559
And substantially unlikely to have side effect that will interfere

244
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Significantly

245
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
With the defendant ability to assist counsel

246
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,399
In conducting at the

247
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Third

248
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,775
The court must conclude that involuntary medication is necessary

249
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
For those interested

250
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,151
And find the alternative less intrusive treatments are unlikely to achieve

251
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,943
Substantially the same result

252
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Fourth

253
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
The court must conclude that administering the drugs

254
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
Is medically appropriate

255
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
So there are a number of considerations that are

256
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,695
I am in the in this ruling

257
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,743
Write the fact

258
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,511
That they have

259
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,095
And in the in the decision they found that the lower courts

260
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
You had ordered

261
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
Him to be medicated did not

262
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,543
Achieve any of these think the standard so they overturned

263
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
The lower Court's decision

264
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
But he was

265
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
Has a lazy f****** liar it's

266
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:54,111
Seems like he was like I don't really care what the

267
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
I'd say

268
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
I think the point is

269
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,695
I'm going to say

270
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,767
I think the argument would be that

271
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
Okay yeah

272
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
Alright

273
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
Hear me out

274
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
So

275
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
The decision says

276
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
But they're overturning the decision

277
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,727
Involuntarily Medicaid

278
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Doctor Cell

279
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Right

280
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
They're also saying that

281
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
That there are narrow Circle

282
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,615
Stances that

283
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,151
You can Medicaid somebody in

284
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,175
So like

285
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
That means they're going to do it anyway

286
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:25,343
Now I respect that however you also said that they are going to do it to Doctor Cell

287
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
Because

288
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Those narrow Circle

289
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
They're going to make it

290
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,999
Digger that's just up saying they're going to do it anyway

291
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:37,119
I know it's frustrating it's very dumb

292
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,191
Alex

293
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
Let's be clear

294
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:48,639
These are not like the higher-ups at the FBI this isn't call me

295
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,431
This is

296
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,991
Gmail

297
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
I all dry brand new Cadillac conversation

298
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,799
Sick of these FBI agents that he knows in Austin

299
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
So

300
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Tired

301
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,383
Of the stereotype

302
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:23,455
Of the obscenely wealthy FBI agent huh

303
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Generously rich

304
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,551
Not stop

305
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Blowing money f

306
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
FBI agent everyone knows from TV

307
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
Yeah

308
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,303
Choose another bit of news that Alex is going on about

309
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,143
Other than just rambling about how bad cops

310
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Enjoin

311
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Wow

312
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,015
So Jane Roe in the Roe v Wade case was a woman named Norma mccourtney

313
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
Norma mccorvey

314
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,879
Her identity is the woman in the case was a

315
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:08,255
The secret by 2003 and already undergone a public conversion to Christianity

316
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
As a person whose name is on the case that legalized abortion she was

317
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,375
Exactly the sort of person

318
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,655
The anti-abortion movement was

319
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
Desperate to court

320
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Call Amanda

321
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,007
For them

322
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,567
It wasn't really all that clear-cut

323
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
From a piece about her Legacy in the Washington Post

324
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,687
In the 1990s when

325
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
Mccorvey was on their team she would tell Evangelical leaders that she supported a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy within the first

326
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Trimester

327
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
The procedure that account

328
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
That's where the majority of all the Porsche

329
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Quotes

330
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,767
We manage that by saying she's a brand new Converse

331
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:45,375
She needs time to mature and her face and her inner understanding of the pro-life

332
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Thanks

333
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
Quote we thought just give her a little time and she'll

334
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Amateur

335
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,335
Eventually they got her to stop saying it publicly but they didn't know whether she'd actually chew

336
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:00,479
Flash Forward to 2020 and a documentary gets released called AKA Jane Roe

337
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
Where director Nick Sweeney interviewed mccorvey

338
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
And since she died before the film was finished

339
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
Her statement could appropriately be called a deathbed confession

340
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,975
And he also said quote this is my deathbed

341
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,743
Confession

342
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
Why would she say

343
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
What to do about Megadeth

344
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,887
That seems like they only reason you would

345
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
In the documentary she admitted that she wasn't actually ever anti-abortion

346
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:27,103
I took their money and they put me out in front of the camera and told me what to say and that's what I'd say

347
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
Did this weenie replied asking quote it was all an act

348
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,967
I had a response

349
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Quote

350
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,319
In that Washington Post peace Rob Schenck

351
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,855
An anti-abortion activist

352
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,879
In the 90s who is

353
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415
The guy who had that quote

354
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,767
From Passenger read earlier

355
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
And his position on abortion

356
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,839
He said that

357
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:48,863
Confession was shocking

358
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:53,983
Quote not because of what it revealed about her but would have revealed about me and the movement

359
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
She forced me to be honest

360
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
With myself

361
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,591
Do you have to be honest about the fact that they used her as a

362
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,639
The prop and that's what I was doing right now

363
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:06,271
And honestly Jane Rose opinion on abortion rights shouldn't really be held up as any more important than anyone else's

364
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,807
No I mean she is proud

365
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
Probably the smartest one involved in all of this she was playing both sides for everything they got man she is smart as hell

366
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,231
I think that that is

367
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:18,815
Some of the sense you get beat up a little bit

368
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,119
I mean like

369
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,447
You granted her name is on the pseudonym is on

370
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,007
The actual K sure it's not like

371
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,847
Cursing aha I've changed my mind

372
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
It's at that doesn't change

373
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Principles

374
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,711
That the decision is based on

375
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,991
That's why

376
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
She was like

377
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,647
F*** yeah I've already got it done. Million billion dollars

378
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:48,255
It's a PR thing

379
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,815
PR victory for the anti-abortion folk

380
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,583
It's not

381
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,119
It doesn't mean anything

382
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
In terms of

383
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Weather

384
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
You your

385
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:02,079
Pro-life or pro-choice involved knows it except for the people there

386
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Yeah

387
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,175
Alex get some news about Zechariah

388
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
What's he up to

389
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
He's in he's in jail

390
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
He wants to talk

391
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
The Congress

392
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,831
About how we did

393
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
Didn't do it

394
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,744
Leaving that aside

395
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:24,096
This is one of the more shocking things I've heard on the show

396
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Appearance

397
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,048
Oh boy

398
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
What

399
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
Alright

400
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,144
So

401
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,960
So we've got both move salary being like

402
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,496
It was the government who did it

403
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
That isn't even how much the government did it

404
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:11,456
You're not even real there's nobody who's on the play

405
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,040
Okay I thought that was an interesting

406
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:19,904
Something to hear like and I was very disappointed expound on this

407
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
There was nobody on the plane

408
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,560
I would talk about this now but it comes back up later and

409
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,400
Do you know how they got into the air

410
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
Giant slingshot

411
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,008
Autopilot has remote control

412
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:35,776
LOL

413
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,104
Slingshot

414
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
It's valid

415
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,968
Brothers episode Alex's teasing

416
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:44,992
About like some

417
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:45,760
Announcement

418
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
He's going to make sure and I actually didn't think

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,392
That it meant anything the first time I heard it but he kept doing it

420
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
So I went back and here's the first time

421
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
I want exposed

422
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,248
Jerk

423
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
Weather control

424
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:27,232
They have control of the ones under their control

425
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
Alex's got this warning

426
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Yeah excited

427
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
Whenever there's a warning

428
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,376
I would like to be warm

429
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,656
You got enough yeah

430
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
It's Big Steaks

431
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,288
We don't know he's teasing that there's a warning

432
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
To a ways into the show

433
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
Here he's teasing it again

434
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:45,920
What

435
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Particularly

436
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:48,992
Warning

437
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:14,592
Morning again but instead of getting to it he has a gold sales

438
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,640
Guess what

439
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
I'm going to Prime you to buy gold

440
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,528
He's going to tell you how great gold is especially it's a

441
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:28,928
It's something negative were to happen to the rest of the world I have a very vague non-specific

442
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:33,024
And also gold is on sale

443
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
Hey

444
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
Then I've got a lot to tell you some

445
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,216
Some things are coming that you're going to want to be like really aware of

446
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
First though I'm going to tell you about how great guns are

447
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:50,176
I don't want to warn you about what I need to warn you about this yeah I mean that would be no

448
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:56,576
Yeah that's true that's owned by a gun sales

449
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
Gold's company

450
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
Being on Vitus resources

451
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
F****** smooth

452
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,000
Love it

453
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:10,400
Sounds good so Alex along with being a cab he's very much

454
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,448
Not getting the grasp

455
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,728
Of supreme

456
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
In Court decisions

457
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Totally wrong about

458
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,944
I'd be interested

459
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,064
Score from the gym

460
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
And there wouldn't be any kind of Reaper

461
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,544
Have your arm cut off

462
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,568
And if the person

463
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Delirious

464
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
Roar

465
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
It sounds like the listener or the caller is saying like I don't believe this I cannot believe that

466
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
We've come to this point

467
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
Yeah

468
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Just cuz this is

469
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
Very much not true

470
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Alex's talked about the Supreme Court ruling that he's referencing here a number of times throughout the show but he's never brought up the

471
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
The name of it is never brought up

472
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,216
Specifics

473
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,544
So the case in question is Chavez vs Martinez

474
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
And it was decided on May 27th 2003

475
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,528
How to present the situation is one where the cop withheld treatment to a person who'd been shot only allowing them to receive medal

476
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,832
Okay once they agreed to answer their quests

477
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:37,696
This is a complete misrepresentation of even with a basic questions were in

478
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:40,000
McKay's and what the Supreme Court rules

479
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,072
Here's the basic details of the underlying

480
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:48,192
A man named oliverio Martinez was stopped on his bicycle by narcotics off

481
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,728
To attempt to put them in cups

482
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,264
They were not a Narcotics invest

483
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
A cab

484
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128
Struggle broke out and in the process Martinez was shot five times

485
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,224
Martinez did admit that in the struggle he tried to steal an officer's gun

486
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,552
But for reasons we'll discuss later this admission might not be all that.

487
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,320
Yeah

488
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:08,160
After Martinez had been shot

489
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
In the case of rice

490
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:14,048
Officer Ben Chavez Road along with the a in the ambulance with marks

491
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:17,888
Trip to the hospital and in the hospital room he questioned Martinez

492
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,192
Which was potentially a violation of his right

493
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:26,336
In the process of this questioning Martinez admitted that he had used heroin and that he tried to steal that officer

494
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:31,456
So the primary question of the case was whether or not that confession could be used in court

495
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,504
Or if it was a violation of Martinez's right

496
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,368
Oh yeah that's a way more interesting question than just vacant

497
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
Stand over you and watch you

498
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Bleed out right

499
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,584
The essential question but that's not even totally accurate because for reasons we'll discuss later

500
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
It doesn't even

501
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,632
Become relevant

502
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,680
Because he never got charged with a crime

503
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,728
So it never was used against him

504
00:27:56,032 --> 00:28:01,920
Still potentially a violation of a really interesting question to have solved

505
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
Portrayal of it

506
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
Because since he was never charged with a crime

507
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Then his confession was never used against him

508
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,160
It now becomes a question of whether or not

509
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,952
The officer Ben Chavez

510
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:19,584
Qualifies for qualified immunity is able to not be sued for his action

511
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Which is your day

512
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,192
Theoretically the Supreme Court was deciding

513
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,240
So Martinez claim to violation

514
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,312
The first was a fifth amendment claimed that he'd been

515
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,592
Compelled to be a witness against

516
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
Himself

517
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:37,248
The second was the 14th Amendment claim with guarantees due process and the right to be free of coercive question

518
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:43,392
What made the case extra complicated like I said is that Martinez never got charged with a crime in the confessions were never used

519
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
In court so

520
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
You know these

521
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,792
Confessions were never used in court were Martinez's rights violated by the office

522
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Questioning everybody was in the ambulance in India

523
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,888
Because if so

524
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,680
Chavez can be sued

525
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
And this is why we need

526
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Need to discuss this right

527
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:02,592
The ninth Circuit Court had ruled that Martinez's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been in fridge

528
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,640
Based on the persistent nature of Chavez

529
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,408
Just questioning

530
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
And that quote

531
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,528
The 5th amendments purpose is to prevent coercive interrogation practices that are

532
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
Destructive to human dignity

533
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,856
This was that appeal to the

534
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:20,000
Supreme Court decided in May 2003 the Chavez actions did not actually constitute a violation of Martinez's

535
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,024
Constitutional rights

536
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:26,912
The rationale is a bit complicated but a lot of it does boil down to the fact that Martinez was never actually charged with

537
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,680
The crime

538
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,216
Since he was never under oath

539
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,288
The court decided that his 5th Amendment rights weren't applicable

540
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
He's questioning

541
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:39,968
As for the 14th Amendment question they found that the questioning Chavez engaged in wasn't quote egregious or quote

542
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
Conscience shocking

543
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,552
As it was claimed to be in Prior cases

544
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
Supreme Court

545
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
If the ruling includes

546
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
It's not conscience

547
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Specifics of the language

548
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
F****** thing I've ever read

549
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:00,704
Pacific conducting engaged in and found that it was not consist

550
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,240
That was a violation of the 14th

551
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,544
On the consideration that the court had

552
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,360
Decided that Chavez has not violated Martinez's right

553
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,128
He was out

554
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,176
Algebra for qualified immunity and subsequent

555
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Can be sued

556
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,784
For the actions that he took as His official capacity as a police off

557
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:19,392
If you listen to Alex's show you would know literally none of these details

558
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:22,464
You would just think that a guy got shot in the stomach and then a cop

559
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,536
Refuse to let medical responders treat him until he agreed to be questioned

560
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,072
About the Supreme Court said hey that's

561
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,168
Cool

562
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:35,264
The first version of its focus is entirely on the wrong question

563
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
Because

564
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,592
Based on a made-up version of detail of

565
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,968
The court wasn't determining whether or not it was appropriate to withhold medical care until someone agrees

566
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,760
Questioning because that didn't happen

567
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Hear from

568
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Supreme Court ruling

569
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Here there's no evidence

570
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:54,464
Since the job has acted with a purpose to harm Martinez by intentionally interfering with his medical tree

571
00:30:55,232 --> 00:31:01,376
Medical personnel were able to treat Martinez throughout the interview at Chavez cease this questioning to allowed test and other procedures to be

572
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Be performed

573
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
Nor is there evidence

574
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,496
The job as a contact exacerbated Martinez entries or prolonged

575
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,264
To stay in the hospital

576
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:13,664
Moreover the need to investigate whether there have been police misconduct constituted a justifiable government interest

577
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,688
Given the risks

578
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
The key evidence would have been lost

579
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,552
Is Martinez had died without the authorities ever hearing his side

580
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
Story

581
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:21,856
That is a very

582
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
That is a good

583
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,464
This case is really interesting and there's something to be learned from discussing

584
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
From here you see

585
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:32,096
You see interesting things you can learn from both angles pro and con

586
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,376
Do what happen

587
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,680
It's not interesting in the way that Alex

588
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,520
No traffic it is interesting because I think the ultimate

589
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
Hinge point

590
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,592
Really comes down to

591
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,152
Do you believe that the physical presence

592
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,432
The officer there

593
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,480
Is it by implication

594
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:55,392
Exactly while you are being treated you are at about the weakest possible you can be

595
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,208
So are you mirror the mirror like act

596
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,000
Give him being there because of course

597
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:02,048
At any point you are aware he could just

598
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
Push somebody aside

599
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
You know that kind of

600
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,680
So the question is do you think that

601
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Real or not

602
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
And I think that that that

603
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
Consideration that lives in the ruling

604
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,128
You know if there is evidence

605
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,944
That the police had acted inappropriately in the shooting

606
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,736
He has that evidence

607
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
And no one else

608
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,552
Would be able to provide it right

609
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
The Nae

610
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
Might die

611
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
It's in everyone's best interest

612
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
To be sure we know that

613
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:35,328
Mangle on this but I hadn't even considered until I right

614
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,912
There's alot going on here

615
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,728
The fake version of these stories in order to get mad about the

616
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,872
And then he accuses enemies of doing something they didn't do so he can get even more mad and make the audience

617
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
More mad

618
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
It's just silly

619
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,712
And most important of all though

620
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
He doesn't have to learn

621
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,808
Anyting

622
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,392
That's the most important lesson we can take from Infowars

623
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,440
Here's the other thing the other added benefit

624
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:03,232
He doesn't have to wrestle with ambiguity

625
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:08,352
Oh no absolute because you know even as I hear the details of this case

626
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
I don't know exact

627
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Actually

628
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,728
What I think is the right thing to do

629
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
I don't know

630
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
How comfortable I am with the idea of police interviewing people in a hostel

631
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,736
Absolutely be very much abuse

632
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,528
At the same time that argument

633
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,344
Needing to

634
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
Possibly get evidence

635
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,648
Couldn't get any other way

636
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,696
Against the police sure

637
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
Theoretically theoretically

638
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,936
Involuntarily medicated somebody I think is not good

639
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:46,240
At the same time

640
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
If somebody is unable to

641
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,312
To stand trial

642
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,456
They're doing a disservice to their own defense right by not being able to stand trial

643
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
Inability to defend themself in court

644
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,320
You shouldn't try and defend yourself in

645
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Court

646
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,368
On a full moon

647
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
If you're aware wolf

648
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,512
Wait until the the day you're feeling normal

649
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,864
It's not it's not black and white there's grazin in

650
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,448
In some of this when you're discussing it outside of let's say of courtroom

651
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,984
Right

652
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,264
I just think Alex isn't

653
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:21,568
Trip to do that and I don't think that he

654
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
Really has a

655
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
Way to make money off

656
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,944
The ambiguity

657
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Definite

658
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,576
Concrete decisions it's far more important for him

659
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,952
Because ambiguity suggests that there there's the possibility you are both wrong and don't

660
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,256
No sure you may just not

661
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
No

662
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
And he cannot do that

663
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,328
No he just can't

664
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,376
It's it's to humbling

665
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
To be in a position where

666
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
You might be like

667
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
It's not the biggest sex

668
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
It does feel lucky

669
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:57,920
He's afraid of that terrible it's almost like yeah you just hear the word do you go for it

670
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,992
We heard earlier that Alex

671
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Believe there was no one on board

672
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
The planes on 9/11

673
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,880
And I thought that maybe he was just

674
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:11,744
Were there any planes at all I thought he was maybe just saying it

675
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,072
I just tried it out yet

676
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
A caller

677
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Closet

678
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,656
You talking about

679
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:23,776
Hey buddy just not call after that

680
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,080
Delaware

681
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,384
The aircraft

682
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,480
Oh he's even got that voice to that's great

683
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
Call cases

684
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:40,928
Chambord

685
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,720
We don't know

686
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,024
Wow

687
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,864
Wow walk back or not

688
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,960
We don't know if anybody was Alda played

689
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,520
Is the exact same thing to take note

690
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,848
Doubling down just a little bit.

691
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:02,688
Evidence of it

692
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:09,088
Really got it

693
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:09,856
Neither is this

694
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
490

695
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,664
So yeah that's already a contradiction of his

696
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,992
Maybe what are you saying is that there's a 20% occupied

697
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
Density of each of them because it was artificial

698
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,184
It would actual people on earth

699
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,744
Still further

700
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:52,096
Yeah and it's not true I was just lying about the people on board the airlines

701
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,192
So United 93 actually did have

702
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,216
20% of its

703
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:01,056
Seat belt with 37 passengers out of a total capacity of 182

704
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:07,200
This is noted to be significantly lower than the average load for this flight on Tuesdays in the previous three months

705
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,480
Which was 52%

706
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,760
Irrelevant

707
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
Drop

708
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:15,136
American Airlines flight 77 had 58 out of a possible 17

709
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,672
96 passengers on board

710
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,328
This was 33% which is right in line with that played three months average on Tuesdays which was 32.8%

711
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
United flight

712
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,448
It's 175 had 56 passengers with a capacity of 1 C

713
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
68

714
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,520
This is a 33% capacity which is

715
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
A bit lower than their average on that flight

716
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
49%

717
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
Find fault

718
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
On the other hand

719
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,968
American Airlines flight 1181 passengers

720
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,760
What's the capacity of 158

721
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
Which represented 51%

722
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:48,672
The three-month average for flight flight 11 on Tuesdays was actually 39%

723
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,720
This is a bit more crowded than usual

724
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:56,608
Just making up statistics to make things seem suspicious but it's all completely disconnected from reality

725
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,264
You the malicious liar because if you followed his logic through to its natural conclusion he must think that everyone who had a loved one

726
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,312
On one of those planes must be lying

727
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:09,920
Or I guess the recipe for more complicated conspiracy where the passengers got taken off boarding

728
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,456
Killed in a

729
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,760
Hanger somewhere whatever I mean

730
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,528
It's not

731
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:18,112
It's impossible not to look at this and see if Sandy Hook

732
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,928
Written all over there not there

733
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:24,256
Yeah it's like a Proto it's like he's trying easy

734
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,400
Beginning the thing that will overthrow his career right now

735
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
This trend of behavior

736
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,264
Even Sanders nine years prior not real

737
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
It's just awful

738
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,104
It's it's really sad

739
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
When you go back to this.

740
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,480
That Alex is going to be trying to sell more grounded 911

741
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Conspiracy theories

742
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
Like you know I don't buy to buy a whole lot of it but I think if you just be talking about building 7 and the speed of sound

743
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Doesn't make sense to go back in

744
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
Can see that like

745
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
He's actually

746
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
Trying to argue that no one was on the play

747
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Playing space lasers

748
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:01,888
Now

749
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
They are space lasers

750
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
Bitchute Plaines

751
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
From space

752
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,008
It's all the government

753
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
Now if you think that Alex arguing

754
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
4

755
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,896
They're being nobody on the plane is a mess

756
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
That's about this gets worse

757
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,808
Break in the middle of this phone call Alex holds him over until the next segment

758
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
And then we get another teas

759
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
New World Order

760
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,656
Program

761
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
Another eight

762
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,544
And cool

763
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Who knows what's going to happen

764
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,896
Maybe you should buy some maybe maybe

765
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,456
I told you where you could literally

766
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,528
So Steve this caller has a great

767
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,856
Okay and that is based on the things that Alex has been saying

768
00:39:54,112 --> 00:40:00,256
There seems to be a suggestion that there is nobody who was on board which is very much the argument that Alex has been making

769
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,816
So Steve was like what about all the people who are the

770
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,352
The funeral let's not talk about

771
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,632
Now

772
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
You'll notice that Alex starts to

773
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,776
Pretend they're having a different conversation than they're actually having

774
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
And all the people that went to

775
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
We're here

776
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,272
That is abuse

777
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,672
That is gas-lighting arguing that there were nobody on board

778
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,952
Sodium boy that play Man

779
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,768
He literally said that I'm going to go back

780
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
Appearance

781
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,072
Alex is trying to

782
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,608
He's done his he's f***** up

783
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,888
Yeah he's talk

784
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,912
What's a bunch of s***

785
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:49,312
And he's realized oh no there's someone confronting me about a fact I can't backup at all 0 backup

786
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,663
Do is hostility pretend that we're having a different argument

787
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,223
And that argument is about all I said

788
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:01,855
Was that they were remote-controlled planes are you saying that they were paid

789
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:08,255
You're the one bringing in Crazy information here that I've never heard my never said there's nobody on the plane flight

790
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:14,655
I think that all I said is there remote control Siri you're not listening to me if you say you're not listening to be with your

791
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:19,263
I want to punch you in the face yeah it really do it's real rough

792
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,543
Violets

793
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,895
This Alex continues to pretend to be having a conversation but no one on board

794
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,431
Their funeral service

795
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:37,183
I'd like to know like I said you know how did they buy off all of

796
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,743
Focus buddy

797
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
So the pilots

798
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
If I knew that

799
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,527
Call the firefighters

800
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Grout

801
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:10,975
So Alex isn't getting

802
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Anywhere really

803
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,607
Because this guy isn't letting go of the fact that they were having a conversation about something else

804
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
Alex gets mad and starts yelling about Authority almost have to kind of agree with you let me

805
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
Tell you some

806
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,591
I talked to firefighter

807
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
I got what I f******

808
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,943
Index Alex just receipts to get more math

809
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
Masshole

810
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Control

811
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:40,159
4

812
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
Tell the passengers using

813
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,967
You have a confession

814
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:10,367
Directions to Northwood

815
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:15,999
What is it that it's Northwoods is that confession

816
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,535
Is very weak

817
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,095
Yeah I mean like

818
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,935
Can't tell you enough how like

819
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,215
Weird it was to listen to

820
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:28,031
Because this guy is very much

821
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,567
Responding to something that Alex

822
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:33,151
No one was on board the planes on

823
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Alex's used weird evidence

824
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:37,503
To try and argue this point

825
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,295
And haven't realized he can't

826
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Pretending they were talking about whether or not the

827
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
The plan was remote can

828
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
Control I never

829
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
You said I said I never see

830
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:53,375
I never said what I said were people on board who died doing the all I said was the planes remote control

831
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,447
You say that I say things when I know what I said

832
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
And there's no way for anybody to follow up on this later

833
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:02,847
So now here's where it gets really

834
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,639
Clear that he's doing this on purpose

835
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,943
As soon as this dude gets off the

836
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
The phone

837
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,735
Alex starts

838
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:12,063
Kind of suggesting that no one was onboard again

839
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Bottom line

840
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:30,239
Get the payoff

841
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,543
Oh and by the way then

842
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,479
Weather

843
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
Here's the thing

844
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,695
If you're suggesting that the families are being paid off

845
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,023
And that they are making sure no one can see the interviews with them right

846
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,559
Whether or not

847
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
The planes were a remote

848
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,983
Control the families wouldn't know that they weren't on the plane write the passengers on the planes wouldn't necessarily know that

849
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,567
I mean I assumed there would be a movie moment where somebody is like

850
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
I don't know what's going on and they knock on the door of the cockpit and they don't have nothing they like

851
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,271
I bet that wouldn't happen that would be a fun moment

852
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:20,671
The only thing he could be suggesting by way of these insinuations is that the families of the people who

853
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:25,791
Airplanes are lying about their family member beating those plans guy they're getting paid off to do it you got it

854
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Correct

855
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,351
There was no one on that play

856
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
This is so intentional

857
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,447
What you did on this call is

858
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
So intentional it's so clear

859
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
He realized he couldn't

860
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
To find this thing

861
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:41,919
Next to a guy who actually wanted to talk about that thing that wasn't offensives

862
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Suggestion

863
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,551
And I realized I got it I got to save face by pretending we're having a separate argument

864
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
It's cowardly

865
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,439
The disgust I have her a person who says something

866
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Beck's off of it

867
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,999
Wines

868
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,279
And then he's like

869
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:03,679
Now that I'm away from that guy go back to saying whatever I want

870
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
Not did not 5 Seconds

871
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,311
What a what an a****** cuz if he had said those things

872
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:15,711
While Steve was still on the line

873
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,039
Paw Patrol

874
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,111
Because he couldn't get away with it while critical voice was

875
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:26,207
This is the type of behavior that cause

876
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:31,583
Capital punishment in schools to be acceptable for a liberal punishment

877
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:36,447
1878

878
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,727
20 kids a day

879
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,615
No I'll be just like that kind of childish like I didn't say that I didn't say that makes you want to slap so

880
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,407
It should you can't not

881
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,455
I understand where you're coming from

882
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
I just get off

883
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Or not get off I like

884
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,319
I'm bored validated by

885
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,159
Demonstrated that I can show you

886
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,695
This Behavior

887
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,767
And it's been consistent for the last 18 years

888
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
Exactly

889
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,559
What a dick

890
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:07,167
So Alex is another color and this person is talking about stories about

891
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,447
What's the Supreme Court decision

892
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,727
About Charles cell

893
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
The medication

894
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
Issue

895
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
And here is why

896
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,383
His audience is just

897
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
Screwed

898
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
In terms of their information

899
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
You can park

900
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,415
Whoever you want

901
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
Turbo

902
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
Medication for

903
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Right now

904
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:51,455
The whole article reads as if

905
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:57,343
They're not going to do it I didn't even catch it until you said if I went back and got the article

906
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,719
It sure is

907
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,047
Thank you do you just trapped

908
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,375
Because the decision also discussed the narrow Circle

909
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,911
Santa's wherein

910
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
Involuntarily Medicaid

911
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
Somebody could be acceptable

912
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,055
They have decided that that invalidates

913
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
The other part of the ruling that over

914
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,407
Overturned the previous Court's decision

915
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
Listen to involuntarily Medicaid doctor cell

916
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,479
It's it's

917
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Give me your trapped

918
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
It's a trap

919
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,575
5 minutes

920
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,855
Stetsom rubber York

921
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:31,903
Forever

922
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,231
I'm never going to admit to anything

923
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Just going to bounce off

924
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,327
Alex gets

925
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Another call

926
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:47,263
And this guy says that like we do we need to do we need to get you and John stadtmiller togethers another

927
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Right-wing talk show host

928
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
And we need to do like a devil

929
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
Ministration in DC we need to protest

930
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,967
And Alex gets off on like

931
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
About how

932
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,831
Anytime the Patriots want to protest

933
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:03,903
The government will infiltrate and make it

934
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
Look bad

935
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:07,743
Arguments for why you

936
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:10,047
You can't have a protester with a pyrite

937
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:10,815
So now I

938
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,423
Everytime we start protesting there's an OKC bombing and everybody thinks that it does

939
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,263
Understand

940
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,287
Be his big warning

941
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,079
But I'm not sure

942
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:26,175
It's also very clearly woven in as a response

943
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:28,991
Let's do this color I wanted to march in DC

944
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,439
Local

945
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Building Supply

946
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Cereal

947
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,591
Maybe his warning is there are feds around

948
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:28,895
They're coming

949
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:35,295
Right there coming for you well I think the warning if the entire episode

950
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:39,391
And now we're the end of the third hour there is no fourth hour at this point

951
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
This Is the End

952
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
You saying that

953
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,303
People who want to do violent

954
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,631
Are feds trying to set you up

955
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,215
Fine that's a fine warning I guess because the ultimate

956
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,263
Conclusion is don't trust people who want to

957
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,103
Commit acts of violence probably a healthy perspective

958
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
I don't

959
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,407
No

960
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,783
Why did you build it up so much this is at Wright-Patt mean it today don't

961
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Start viola

962
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,111
And also this morning this is

963
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,183
Is coming right after a phone call where the guy was

964
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Suggesting violence

965
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,999
No he was suggesting a protest

966
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,095
Stay off drugs

967
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Good

968
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
Kids in schools

969
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,167
Sleep through it all

970
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,215
I don't know

971
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
You know what I've always found Sodus

972
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,335
It's the way that he says

973
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:32,127
You know this happens to everybody

974
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,199
It's it happens to black people that happens to what he always starts with black people

975
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,247
And the reason he does that

976
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:39,807
Is because he uses this false a

977
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,367
He's functionally

978
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
Like

979
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,671
He's he's

980
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:47,743
Vocally using black people as a shield for his wife

981
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,303
Soupremacy it is so f******

982
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,375
Such a small thing but every single time he does it

983
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,655
It's disrespectful into

984
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
Disgusting

985
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,495
Play tape makes my skin crawl I hate it

986
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
That's pretty bad

987
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
So that could have been his warning

988
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,663
This also could have been his Warren

989
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,711
I'm not sure he doesn't clarify enough

990
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,599
Corruption

991
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,143
About how

992
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
You understand

993
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,391
Maybe this is the announcement that he's been teasing I'm not sure

994
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
I want to say also to that

995
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,719
Alex's defense

996
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,023
He does clarify that like

997
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
What I'm saying this about like

998
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,375
Stay away from my show with this b*******

999
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,399
He wasn't talking

1000
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,935
Sing about the caller who was just suggesting

1001
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,239
Daily sketch

1002
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,799
Himself and realized this could be

1003
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,847
Seeing as me saying any protestors

1004
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
Right wrong

1005
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,663
Ryan and Misty.

1006
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,711
I don't I don't understand

1007
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:48,063
The point is of this big warning to declare his independence

1008
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Depend

1009
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,623
I mean

1010
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:55,487
One might say that it's a Reclamation of Independence is opposed to a declaration of

1011
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
Smite

1012
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:58,303
I suppose that also work

1013
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:00,351
I think you could also call it

1014
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,887
What's the word

1015
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,703
I'm going to

1016
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
Listen

1017
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:09,055
And I'm going to call my Senator right now I want them to reaffirm the Declaration

1018
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,591
Independent OB Gray

1019
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,359
Yes

1020
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:12,895
If they don't

1021
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,039
A Satan so unfortunately Alex's run out of time

1022
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
To get to the sad news stories

1023
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Cam

1024
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
That

1025
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,743
Gold coins

1026
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Cool

1027
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
Cool

1028
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,815
Gotham

1029
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,423
About that's even sadder than $10 Olympic

1030
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,823
Infomercial at 2 a.m. the guy who is on for Midas resources

1031
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:15,871
We can't ever find these

1032
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,455
We can get the $5 one so we can never get the $10 ones

1033
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,271
These are just for Alex Jones listen

1034
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:25,599
I got my hands on guaranteed

1035
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
250 lease

1036
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,439
Trying to sell 250

1037
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,463
But hey

1038
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,071
How about we try and sell 5000

1039
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,631
How do I get 100

1040
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,215
The classic

1041
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
You have all of them

1042
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,543
Snake oil use

1043
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,103
Car sales at bullshitters

1044
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,943
So maybe Alex's big announcement at warning is that

1045
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,295
They're going mainstream and you know where I could be hanging out with militias in the woods

1046
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
All the feds

1047
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,391
Disappointing

1048
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,951
To get to the end of this and not really know what is an ounce

1049
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Warning

1050
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,511
The show's over

1051
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
Like I said

1052
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,631
In that Meijer

1053
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:10,911
You find

1054
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,959
Alex getting schooled

1055
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,495
By this guy

1056
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
The claim that Alex made earlier the show

1057
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,103
And I think there's something really valuable

1058
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,895
About understanding what happened

1059
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,919
In that Exchange

1060
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:26,015
Between the two of them because it's essential to understanding

1061
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:28,319
How you deals with the idea of anybody

1062
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:32,159
Having an exchange of ideas or a debate with him

1063
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
These are the sort of tact

1064
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,975
I fixed it will get

1065
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,255
Most people off track

1066
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,583
Pretty easily just pretended you were having a different conversation

1067
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:41,119
Now that we've seen that his

1068
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:44,447
The ultimate weakness is just staying on target

1069
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,799
Like the moment that you don't fall for his we'll have you heard or

1070
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,591
This is the

1071
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,359
You know

1072
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,151
If I ever were to talk to him

1073
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
I would just

1074
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,479
Say laser-focused

1075
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
On

1076
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
Operation lockstep

1077
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:04,159
Just anytime there was something that was slightly off track at they will talk about that later or staying on this

1078
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
And it would just deteriorated

1079
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:10,303
Start begin to vibrate and then I assume go Super Saiyan

1080
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,327
Most likely

1081
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,119
Unsatisfying for me as well

1082
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,655
And be miserable

1083
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,447
So we go to the 19th now

1084
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
Again

1085
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
This is a

1086
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,055
F****** slog at the beginning

1087
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
It is so rough

1088
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
It is mostly

1089
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,687
The first 25 minutes is largely Alec

1090
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,015
Complaining about how some Christian organization has been bootlegging his movie

1091
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:32,063
Those bastard yes

1092
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:37,695
Bootlegging movies to be met you want you want you to make copies of them and spread them out to people

1093
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
Does not want you selling them

1094
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
I guess

1095
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,351
And I think that he would he's really mad about it is they ran it

1096
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,119
Something

1097
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:49,471
You selling his DVD

1098
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
I agree with that

1099
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:55,103
It also is a little bit of a gray area based on the way that he

1100
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,127
Sort of

1101
00:58:56,383 --> 00:59:02,527
Gives up one car garage as many copies of these as you can and do whatever you want with the right and don't

1102
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:08,927
So don't like charge for them but what about the expenses of making copies of tapes

1103
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:12,767
Exactly where is the line now at wholesale cost

1104
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:19,679
I also think there's another thing that he's a little bit mad about that I actually find far more reasonable

1105
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:26,335
And that is that the copies that they're making are like fifth-generation copies EXO's there bad copies that there

1106
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
They're selling

1107
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,479
And people will call him and complain about things that he didn't sell

1108
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:35,551
Pretending to be a distributor of your thing

1109
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,831
And you have no quality

1110
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:39,135
Controllability

1111
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:46,047
Yeah I mean it would make me mad to be in the black market for Alex Jones tapes bugs

1112
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
So this is about the first

1113
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:50,655
Half of the first hour is

1114
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,471
Sure and he finally talked himself into suing

1115
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,159
Dealer public dealer

1116
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
Some people

1117
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:28,287
Angry about

1118
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
New World Order

1119
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,991
What he says I'm not going to talk about these people he means by now

1120
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,039
Can I guess that's like it that's fine

1121
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:39,807
Don't give a

1122
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,599
Whatever

1123
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:45,183
This is just a sister almost

1124
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
Present-day Ash

1125
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,815
Yeah terms of pointlessness

1126
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:57,471
Probably just send him a quick cease-and-desist letters

1127
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,263
How long time on your show about it

1128
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:02,335
It seems like a waste of time for a very important talk show

1129
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
These people lived

1130
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,199
So Alex talk

1131
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,735
Facts about UNESCO

1132
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
Because there's talk that bush

1133
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,551
She's going to re-enter UNESCO

1134
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
And

1135
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,135
This is something that is very bad

1136
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
Because according to

1137
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,183
Alex globalist

1138
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:20,767
Airplane is to destroy the family

1139
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:08,127
He read the paragraph twice and one thing that I would really weird as if you go and actually find this Newsmax article

1140
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,199
At the end it says judeo-christians

1141
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
Civilization

1142
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,527
Props off of judeo

1143
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,111
I don't know if he's reading like a different version of it or if that's intentional

1144
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
Why I've no idea

1145
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
Yeah maybe he just doesn't

1146
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:21,695
Could be

1147
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,279
He's been trampling about this plan that UNESCO has to

1148
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,839
To destroy the family to destroy civilization

1149
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,375
I guess he's deciding to

1150
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,679
Discovery by reading an op-ed in Newsmax

1151
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:32,703
I think that's a good way

1152
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:36,543
But honestly read like a f****** parody

1153
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,103
Take this ridiculous run-on sentence France

1154
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,663
Catch My Breath

1155
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Most of my quote

1156
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,039
Most Americans are blissfully ignorant of the Insidious nature of this

1157
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:53,439
Crowd of oneworld paganistic pseudo communist and real ones who are bound and determined to create a new world order

1158
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,975
Establish new world religion

1159
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,023
Capri worshippers that supplanted score

1160
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
Christianity and Judaism

1161
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:02,399
Promote abortion worldwide's capture control of the schools and school children

1162
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
And is in the process of transforming National and privately owned property in the United States and elsewhere and do his greedy hands

1163
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
I didn't want to hear Ted f****** Nugent on this show anymore break in that sentence

1164
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
VRBO Zazzle

1165
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:19,295
Tree worshipers freeware

1166
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:26,975
And the basis for this according to this op is a publication called toward World understand

1167
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,791
Switch to go put out in 1949

1168
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Actually

1169
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,887
It's not referring to that publication

1170
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,447
He's referring to an op-ed in The New American

1171
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:38,495
Talked about that publication

1172
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,055
These people are so easy

1173
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,383
So here's the quote that Newsmax article attributes

1174
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
The publication

1175
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:52,319
Government schools must Stamp Out the love of country in the family and the family must be viewed as the enemy

1176
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,647
As long as the child breathes The Poisoned arrows nationalism

1177
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
Education in world mindedness

1178
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,487
Can produce only rather precarious result

1179
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:02,559
As we pointed out it is frequently the family that

1180
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Text the child.

1181
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,351
Extreme nationalism

1182
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,239
The school should therefore use the memes described earlier to combat family attitudes that favor jingoism

1183
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,031
The sentence quote

1184
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:16,383
But government schools must Stamp Out love of country and the family would be viewed as an enemy

1185
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,431
Is it from the UNESCO text

1186
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:24,831
That's really surprising yeah that really a surprise that's the interpretation of the guy who wrote the original article

1187
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,903
In the new American which is being quoted in this Newsmax article

1188
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,927
Call Alex

1189
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,975
Constantly says that UNESCO admits that

1190
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,255
The family is their enemy

1191
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,839
When that ambition is really just an accusation from a right-wing rag

1192
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,959
This is not a single publication form ionesco it's actually part of a 10-part series which

1193
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Shark textbook

1194
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
Looks like many blogs

1195
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,287
That incorrectly claimed

1196
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,847
Alex incorrectly claimed their founding

1197
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,127
Cheese and ridiculous

1198
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:50,175
I found it for years prior

1199
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:55,551
But these are reports of meetings where various perspectives were given by various speakers on issues related

1200
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Education

1201
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:00,159
You can find the full text of this volume the other two comes from this is volume

1202
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:03,743
M5 Come Away with a slightly different

1203
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,023
Incentive what it's about

1204
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,095
Just broadly speaking the point of the text is that

1205
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,911
Essential part of healthy development

1206
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,191
For children and adults

1207
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,983
Is feeling like you belong

1208
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:18,335
As you progress through life the size of the group you belong to grows along with you

1209
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:20,639
Initially it's your family than Maybe

1210
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,943
Some friends in the neighborhood then it's your class

1211
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,015
It's cool then maybe your city your state and Nation

1212
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,063
And eventually ideally the world

1213
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:34,975
This document is about public education so it's basically a discussion of how to promote this healthy process of seeing the world as something you

1214
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
You're a part of

1215
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,279
Along with everyone else

1216
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:42,143
The issue is that a lot of this is an emotional process and it relies on experiences

1217
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:43,935
So for students being exposed to

1218
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,263
The sensitivity humanizing representations of people from other cultures

1219
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,287
Is critical

1220
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:51,615
Also they recommend having an exchange with a family who has a kid

1221
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:56,223
If the same age in another country still a bond can be formed with people from another culture which Williams

1222
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:56,991
Still Into You

1223
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
The knowledge

1224
01:05:58,015 --> 01:06:00,063
The stereotypes and Prejudice is someone they have

1225
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,087
About foreigners

1226
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
Aren't real

1227
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,415
The educators are employed to focus on

1228
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,975
Some deep meaningful ways that we are the same as opposed to

1229
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
The more external a trivial ways that weird if

1230
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
That said I will admit that this document is very much a

1231
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
National is

1232
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:20,031
And I can't imagine why someone who did not have a great impression of nationalism in 1949

1233
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:20,799
I mean

1234
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,847
Impossible to imagine

1235
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:25,663
So you have a couple world wars

1236
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Driven almost in

1237
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:29,503
Tireli by jingoistic propagandist nationalist

1238
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,087
And all the sudden you think nationalism is bad

1239
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:36,159
If you not saying the Pledge of Allegiance in class

1240
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:39,487
So weird

1241
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:42,559
Read the thing they spell out what they're talking about

1242
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:47,167
Education for World mindedness of President Carter's obstacles outside the school

1243
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,215
The principal one certainly is National

1244
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,591
A feeling of belonging to the human Community Development normally buy an extension of the feeling of belonging

1245
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
Navigate to the National community

1246
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,919
It cannot possibly develop from

1247
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
Caricature of patriotism

1248
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
Which is extremely National

1249
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:08,159
Nationalism in the sense of caring about your country and seeing yourself as a part of it that's an essential step towards seeing yourself as part

1250
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Art of the world community

1251
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,023
To the writer this report is in no way suggesting that Nation should be destroyed

1252
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,583
Conversely the real point being made is that

1253
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,399
Extreme nationalism is a perversion of patriotism

1254
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,959
Where everything that involves heater is good

1255
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:23,775
And everything involving other countries is suspicious at that

1256
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,895
Also this is just a report of a seminar any introduction literally says quote

1257
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:33,759
The views expressed are of course not the views of the official views of UNESCO

1258
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:37,087
Nor are they necessarily acceptable to all members of the group

1259
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,695
It is hoped however that they will arouse interest and stimulate discussion among teachers

1260
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
In many con

1261
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:43,999
So

1262
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
The little bit on

1263
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,887
Unfair this interpretation that they're admitting that they want to destroy your family

1264
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,167
One of those guys

1265
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:54,495
To like a baseball game in 2021 and watch the planes

1266
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,311
Flyover the evil jet planes in

1267
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
Just be like hey buddy

1268
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
You did it

1269
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:03,967
So here's what happened with this UNESCO doctor

1270
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,831
This report on a seminar was published in 1949 and no one really cared

1271
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,647
Except people deep in the weeds in terms of Education

1272
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:18,303
Then in October 1950 William Henry McFarland wrote about it in a newsletter from his group

1273
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,095
The Nationalist Action League

1274
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,631
I'm at the Outreach.

1275
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Dr. Graves

1276
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
Previous to this

1277
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,495
Actually I kind of miss Pokey

1278
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:29,823
The name was changed from the National Action nationalist Action League

1279
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:30,847
Something else

1280
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,383
Before this public

1281
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,711
Previously the Nationalist Action League now

1282
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,247
It ends up being the America

1283
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Can flag committee

1284
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:43,903
We got real close to Nazi there so now we're American flag not suggest previous

1285
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,439
To this publication

1286
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,743
I had to do with the UNESCO thing

1287
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,583
Self-published series of newsletters called National progress

1288
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,119
Antboy it's bad

1289
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:58,751
I was reading over the first issue from September 1945 and it's about what you'd expect

1290
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
For the first bit of it

1291
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:05,407
It's laying out an aggressively anti-communist position for the newsletter and it's all pretty standard

1292
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,943
Until you get to plank

1293
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,991
Four of their suggestions of how to

1294
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
Fix the country

1295
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,295
Bring Hitler back to life

1296
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,951
A real and Lasting solution of the whole racial problem in America

1297
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,511
Stephon justice4all

1298
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:24,607
Concern it must be understood the two races each possessing a

1299
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:29,727
Print set of morals and ethics or a different culture not going to cannot be forced to exist

1300
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
Together as equals

1301
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:35,359
Sister travel we believe that the Jewish race can never become part of the Christian culture

1302
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:38,687
We know that a Christian America will never accept Judaism

1303
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:45,343
Those who fail to see the choice which must be made are active-active to complicate matters

1304
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
For sure

1305
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:46,879
Peddler

1306
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:52,767
Look hello this is an illusion that they suggest is quoted the immediate deportation of all aliens

1307
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,303
And I'm guessing that is

1308
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,583
Definition of determine

1309
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:58,655
Pretty bra I would probably

1310
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,239
So this National progress was put out by the Nationalist

1311
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,127
Created this new organization the American flag

1312
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:14,527
Committee which was based on an outrage over an incident that in Philadelphia where un flag was raised during a

1313
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:19,903
He began Distributing American flag seals which was most likely just a good PR

1314
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,999
An informant told the FBI that the American flag committee with quote

1315
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,583
It was just quote a sub body of the Nationalist Action League

1316
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,423
And the goal was to gain national attention with the American flag seals

1317
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
In essence McFarland was doing

1318
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:37,311
What a lot of the current a fascist they're doing with the antimatter

1319
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:43,199
Is the exploitation of a wedge issue that you can use to drive people unknowingly closer to extremist

1320
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:47,807
Members of the American flag committee received a monthly newsletter just titled

1321
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,831
The newsletter

1322
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:53,439
In Issue 13 of the newsletter McFarland to did a misleading article about the

1323
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
Does UNESCO document

1324
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:58,559
And from that point it's spread around Tavares extreme nationalist community

1325
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:05,215
It's the circle of the rides 1951 Republican Congress

1326
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
My birth name John T wood

1327
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,823
Who read that not the actual UNESCO document

1328
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
But the coverage of it from the American

1329
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,151
Can flight committee

1330
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,943
Into the Congressional Record

1331
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,711
Right

1332
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:22,111
That's right that's really the spread the word a bit further about this conspiracy and the rest as you say is it just a game of

1333
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,135
Telephone

1334
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:29,279
People don't respond to actual things in the UNESCO report most likely because they've never actually seen the report

1335
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:34,911
We've only heard about it through the sources that have filtered down for this anti-semitic f*** wad William Henry McFarland

1336
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,495
Alex hasn't Reddit he's justina's Newsmax article

1337
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:42,847
The Newsmax article doesn't cite the actual document it cites a different right-wing publication

1338
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
Speak on it

1339
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,919
The very same player between used to drum up

1340
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,199
Beard extreme nationalist

1341
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,991
Since the days of McFarland

1342
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,551
The same person who I should remind you

1343
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,343
Who wants to deport all night

1344
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,367
People from the inside

1345
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,951
I bet MacArthur I cannot so idea who these guys

1346
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:00,255
I bet Joseph McCarthy was like

1347
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:05,375
These guys are so crazy though I never would ever know I will see if there's a pretty positive

1348
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:10,495
References to McCarthy

1349
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,311
I will I think that it's

1350
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:18,175
Fortunate in some ways that the FBI was keeping an eye on this guy's committees

1351
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,711
Because

1352
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:24,831
Now the newsletters are on the FBI's website

1353
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,415
This is this is one of the other reasons that all the

1354
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,719
Who's letters are there

1355
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,767
Not because the FBI sought them out

1356
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,607
Because McFarland sent a copy of all of them to the FBI

1357
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,935
I will serve as a way of being like

1358
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:45,055
Taunting Mike I want you to be aware of what

1359
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,103
I'm going to leave little Clues

1360
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,151
Also he was in his mid-twenties

1361
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
At this point

1362
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,735
So he has a a bit of a

1363
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:55,807
Quintessa Levi

1364
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,855
You know the problem with fascist

1365
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,647
Very on creative

1366
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,207
But enterprising when young

1367
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:05,279
Yeah I mean like if you think about it in the like mid

1368
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,047
40s

1369
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,071
Putting out in

1370
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,631
Like a newsletter did you distribute

1371
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:13,471
Calling it newsletter there is a lot of competition

1372
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:18,335
A lot of undertaking that needs to be done a lot of work

1373
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:19,615
To commit to that is

1374
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,919
You know I mean obviously I think what he did is s***

1375
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:22,943
And I think it's nap

1376
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,991
It's obviously you can see the Ripple even

1377
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:31,135
Breed of this deer baiting about UNESCO

1378
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:31,903
A.m.

1379
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
TripAdvisor

1380
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:36,511
At the same time if you just look at how much you have to do it

1381
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,535
It's kind of impressive

1382
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:38,815
Just from like

1383
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,375
You know ethically neutral standpoint

1384
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:44,191
Do you know he really put his stamp on the destruction

1385
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:44,959
End of democracy

1386
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:51,615
You got to give somebody credit whenever they really leave their name in the history books as destroying democ

1387
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
Is completely forgotten their influences just Insidious

1388
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,319
And the other thing is really fun

1389
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,855
Just because I read a lot of it

1390
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,415
It's a why not share some details

1391
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:06,463
He accepted payment

1392
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
4

1393
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,511
The

1394
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,535
The

1395
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,815
The publication

1396
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
Descriptions of South

1397
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,143
Yeah it only through money orders

1398
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:14,911
But

1399
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,983
If you are going to buy a single-issue you could pay with stamps

1400
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,823
Now he didn't accept the money because I guess we'll get lost

1401
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
In the mail or something

1402
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
Accept personal checks

1403
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Sure because

1404
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,783
And this is spelled out in a very long story and it seems like

1405
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,343
I believe he's not short-winded on this front

1406
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,391
He did not have an account

1407
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
At the bank

1408
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,975
That allowed him to cash these checks

1409
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,279
Because there's a cop size was too small

1410
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,815
Like a backwood

1411
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:43,839
Like in case

1412
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:48,959
The check wasn't a good check they were willing to front him that money until the check cleared

1413
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,751
Ain't so he ended up having to

1414
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,543
To find a friend with a better Bank

1415
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:58,943
Account like cash the check for him

1416
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:04,831
The process has I will agree with him on that front

1417
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:05,855
Okay

1418
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:09,695
Who is the original Bitcoin bro is what you're saying

1419
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:16,095
So I guess God blockchain man I was really interested diving in and seeing where this

1420
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,631
Conspiracy came from

1421
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,423
It's not always as

1422
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:22,751
Kind of the roots are always

1423
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:29,151
As to the traceable

1424
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:32,991
Source material is perverted initially Friday

1425
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
Goes ganoe

1426
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,599
Add b2c to be eventually all the way down the line

1427
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
2

1428
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,415
The new new American

1429
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,743
Has been covered by Newsmax which has been covered by Ali

1430
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:46,559
It's just a name they just know that

1431
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,327
The game

1432
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
You know they're just really good at

1433
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
The game haha they're not good at

1434
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,423
Helping

1435
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:53,471
Or doing anything but

1436
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,263
The game that's f*****

1437
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,591
It's earlier in the episode here's another little

1438
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,151
Clip of Alex talking about this UNESCO

1439
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:02,175
Not saying just because

1440
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,967
He's got everything wrong

1441
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
Organization

1442
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,191
So that's that's his angle on it it's it

1443
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:28,543
Their founding documents

1444
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:32,127
Destroying the part about the family being the enemy and needed to be

1445
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,943
Is from The New American article

1446
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223
Sort of

1447
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,295
Manipulative Lee quoted in the Newsmax article and Alec

1448
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,111
I guess I mean if he's not curious about it

1449
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,671
And just takes that Newsmax article as gospel

1450
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:47,999
Must think that that comes from the UNESCO documents

1451
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:52,351
Actually doesn't use boxes f****** Breaking Bad

1452
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Car wash

1453
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:57,471
Just just like we are we got all these lies I don't know what to do with them

1454
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,751
Launder

1455
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,311
So now we get to Dan in Illinois

1456
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,687
I got an interesting Theory

1457
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,735
What are you doing what you doing

1458
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:10,783
There's only two SWAT

1459
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:13,087
You think that

1460
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,367
North Korea

1461
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,391
Is a decoy

1462
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:21,535
Like there's not going to be a war there any people in Northridge resources to exploit

1463
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
To Alex

1464
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:23,583
Kind of goes off

1465
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,423
Ben price to stay on point but Alex isn't allowing

1466
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,007
North Korea

1467
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
That leader whatever his name is is

1468
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
Alarm

1469
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Or what about

1470
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,703
They don't have any resource

1471
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:01,983
They don't have anything

1472
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
Take a note

1473
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
Concrete over whatever he's not going to

1474
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
In the meantime

1475
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:19,135
North Korea

1476
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
What

1477
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:28,607
The resource

1478
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:35,007
World

1479
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,943
That's not true

1480
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,295
Again is trying to respond to a different point than what the color is bringing up

1481
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,367
And this one I think is a little moron

1482
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,135
Clear to me

1483
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
Because I do think that it

1484
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,719
Possible that Alex misunderstood him

1485
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,511
It is responding to what

1486
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:58,303
He thinks this guy is saying

1487
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,351
As opposed to being caught in a

1488
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,631
Ridiculous situation

1489
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:02,911
Like in the previous

1490
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,703
Dave show

1491
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
Do you know one was on the

1492
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,799
This could just be Alex not paying attention really

1493
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:13,663
Yeah I can see this one just being like North Korea's probably got enough money to kill us all

1494
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,967
I am Alex's turn today

1495
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,271
Story about North Korea being one of the largest

1496
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Opium

1497
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,831
Acro results

1498
01:19:21,343 --> 01:19:23,135
Just something that he can say

1499
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,183
Just toss it out there

1500
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,999
It's not a good rebuttal to this guy

1501
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
It is

1502
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
Anyway I'll tell the gas

1503
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,375
Here's a couple guest on this episode

1504
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:36,703
One of them is this singer-songwriter named Michelle shocked

1505
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,263
Okay I'm not going to any of her interview because

1506
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,567
Pointless

1507
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:44,383
Cienega

1508
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,151
I don't know

1509
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,431
You didn't you didn't

1510
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,479
Volume up on her.

1511
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:54,367
Her singing career no Dan I expect you to do research dude I did look into who she was

1512
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,183
And

1513
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,279
Yeah I don't I don't know it's me a bad vibe

1514
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:05,119
I mean I think a singer-songwriter on Infowars does have a very poor tracker

1515
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,399
Crackers

1516
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:09,471
Some controversies that popped up about her

1517
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
Sing

1518
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Something

1519
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:17,664
Like jokes about all the singer-songwriters who are nominated in a particular category Saturday

1520
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,224
We could have called this the lesbian vocal are it is

1521
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,296
Or something and then later on

1522
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
She like got really mad

1523
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:26,112
Cuz you was asked

1524
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,208
About her take on homosexuality I got like a

1525
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,512
I think was a Christian concert

1526
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:38,912
And she's like I don't know why everyone asked me this. You're looking at the biggest homophobe in the world

1527
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
But I don't know why

1528
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,264
That's fair I don't know if that was just

1529
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
Curbing

1530
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:49,408
Fed up with people asking her that kind of quest

1531
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,176
Hey

1532
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Throwing up

1533
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:53,248
I didn't care

1534
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,040
I I think that you probably just sucks

1535
01:20:55,808 --> 01:21:01,696
You're on Alex's show you not great another Gaston

1536
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,464
Who's not gray

1537
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,744
And that is

1538
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,304
The lawyer who is representing Jane Roe

1539
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:10,656
And now the woman known as Roe

1540
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:14,240
Has

1541
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:16,032
Because he was playing

1542
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,200
And wants to reverse

1543
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,992
Joining us

1544
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,040
Like me

1545
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
And weave

1546
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:39,328
With the organization not here in Texas

1547
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,376
Ring

1548
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:48,032
So it's very clear from this interview if you live

1549
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,824
Listen to it that this person is

1550
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,872
A lawyer

1551
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
The point

1552
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:00,576
Abortion

1553
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:02,112
But they're mainly Nancy porush

1554
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,416
Represent

1555
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
And work with

1556
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,768
Primarily anti-abortion causes

1557
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,120
Promoting

1558
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
Somebody's got to do it

1559
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,960
So this is really funny

1560
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:21,568
The lawyer is trying to give some background on the case okay and Mike down for this

1561
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:24,128
Because you will be tempted to talk about this

1562
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:29,504
Learned of the ruling at the

1563
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,272
Supreme Court

1564
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:32,832
Morning News

1565
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
Alex

1566
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:49,216
Okay

1567
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
Alex

1568
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Just got up and got away from the mic

1569
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:58,176
I am going to let her cook for a little bit I'm going to get out of here

1570
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:05,344
Take a little nap

1571
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
Consistent

1572
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,440
His career respect for his guests

1573
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
They would be in

1574
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
Studio

1575
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,536
Run away from the belt

1576
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,584
Yeah so Alex

1577
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Has a

1578
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:19,424
Real lot of horrible things he says about divorce

1579
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,008
Business interview

1580
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,032
And the section

1581
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,312
I will

1582
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,592
Say that it's suspicious

1583
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
Bad

1584
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
He's

1585
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:32,736
Not talkin about his own experience

1586
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,760
He's paid for it this time

1587
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:40,928
That does not seem something like something that he is willing to discuss publicly at this time

1588
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
Feels like that's an important

1589
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:42,976
Background

1590
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,768
This kind of interview

1591
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,816
He does seem to talk about

1592
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,352
A lot of

1593
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,912
Feelings he has about people who do

1594
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:51,936
Oh yeah

1595
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,008
He feels like they deserve

1596
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,360
Thing about his

1597
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,152
Right now I don't deserve

1598
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,432
Course because

1599
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,456
I'm better now

1600
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:07,040
Right now obviously if we were to reply retroactive

1601
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:13,952
Then yes I would be in trouble in the same way but since we are going to say I'm Scott free

1602
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
Also he seems to have a position that

1603
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,072
Abortions are never okay in the case of

1604
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,608
Protecting a woman's life

1605
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,400
Because

1606
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,896
If you do it

1607
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:36,224
Every but you go in and kill

1608
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
Disgusting

1609
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
Yeah

1610
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
Yeah

1611
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:55,680
That's that's always been such a b******* like okay fine give me an exact list of when doctors are allowed

1612
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,448
And not allowed

1613
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
By God

1614
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,264
Okay just give me

1615
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,824
Give me a Hardline okay if you if you

1616
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,848
You're going to get an abortion

1617
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:04,128
God will do it for you

1618
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,432
Alright God takes care of all of that

1619
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,992
What if say you've got a broken leg

1620
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:15,136
Is God going to heal your broken leg or is it okay for a doctor to heal your broken leg.

1621
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:15,904
List

1622
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:22,048
Of what God can and cannot do all medicine must be suspect I guess I'm recording to this kind of thing

1623
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:22,816
F*** off

1624
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:28,704
Yeah and then also just the idea that it's creating a bunch of broken people

1625
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:29,984
This is just a

1626
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:35,104
Defensive yeah I mean I'm sure that it's not been something that people have done for

1627
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:35,872
The entirety

1628
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,944
Well I mean I can't imagine

1629
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,528
What the emotional toll would be of being forced

1630
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
By the state

1631
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:48,160
To carry a pregnancy to

1632
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,440
Alex happy

1633
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
But it

1634
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:52,000
But I mean the person would probably

1635
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:54,048
Have a lot of emotional impact

1636
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,840
Of the person is not important

1637
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:57,376
God is important

1638
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:00,192
And how Alex Alex's thoughts

1639
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
It's about God

1640
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,288
Not even God for say

1641
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,616
So this is this is one of the only things I found

1642
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:10,432
Really interesting about this interview with the lawyer

1643
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
All because I mean

1644
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:13,504
Case didn't go anywhere and it's

1645
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,576
Stupid

1646
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,648
But she does have a website that you

1647
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416
He's promoting

1648
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:23,232
Alex in a real pickle

1649
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
Makeup app

1650
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:26,560
Supreme Court

1651
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:27,584
Is as

1652
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:31,168
Case that we

1653
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
President Bush

1654
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,640
In his campaign

1655
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,664
Hayward

1656
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:42,432
Promote

1657
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,456
Call Trav life

1658
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
There is a project

1659
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,528
Project

1660
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,808
If you go to

1661
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
Eww

1662
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
F2a

1663
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,184
2A

1664
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,280
Project ROSE.

1665
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
Sending roses

1666
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,584
A present

1667
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,864
For $10

1668
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
President Bush with an F

1669
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,472
Hoarding his decision

1670
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,264
America culture of life

1671
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:10,592
Justices

1672
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,736
LaRosa's

1673
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,320
Allison Morales

1674
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:26,464
So now Alex is in an unenviable position of having to support the guy who did 9/11

1675
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,048
Because he might appoint Supreme Court Justices that end abortion

1676
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,096
Okay so he did 9/11

1677
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:35,936
It might end abortion

1678
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
That's good

1679
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:39,520
I'm in a real

1680
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,080
Call here

1681
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:46,432
And I have to send roses that might be the deciding factor I don't

1682
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:52,320
F*** you discomfort Alex having someone saying positive things about bush

1683
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
And I

1684
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,720
I can hear the discomfort he has with somebody giving money to somebody not him truth

1685
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,024
So they take calls

1686
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,584
Valerian Alex

1687
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Get this

1688
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,376
What

1689
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,936
We can shut the book on the devil question

1690
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:11,008
Oh okay good it's literally spelled out in this town

1691
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,080
I don't think men in and of themselves

1692
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,360
Orchestrate

1693
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:19,200
Made

1694
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:21,248
Himself is the one that's actually

1695
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,320
The genius behind

1696
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,368
Find it all

1697
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Yep so Alec

1698
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:40,960
Does believe that there is a literal devil in the devil is actually even

1699
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
Definitely saying

1700
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:48,640
The devil is behind the global genius behind the global level plans are too evil for people

1701
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:55,040
What's there to evil and so it must be Beelzebub

1702
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:57,856
Obviously the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was

1703
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:01,440
Convincing people he wasn't real now we have moral relativism

1704
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,232
Sympathy how quickly it happened

1705
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,792
Dangerous when did he do that

1706
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:12,448
7018 like when I would like to know the day

1707
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,800
October

1708
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:20,640
Gregorian calendar

1709
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:31,904
For a long time listening to these 2000's believe 18 years ago that he was

1710
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,928
Fighting the literal devil

1711
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,208
He does

1712
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,000
But he doesn't talk about it nearly as much

1713
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:42,656
It's very clear the present-day but E's a little bit more careful about it

1714
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,472
Turn to talk about the devil as much

1715
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,264
Now that you're on the Downey

1716
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,360
I think that's probably also the case with him talking about his

1717
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:57,248
Experienced personally with a abortion

1718
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:03,648
Twice or whatever until after I was already politically expedient for him to do some yeah this point his career

1719
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,976
Take a major blow if he was to say I

1720
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
Paid for 10 of borscht

1721
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:13,120
Do this Alex guys all anti-abortion but he just said that he paid for 10 Fortune

1722
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:15,424
You didn't have the position in

1723
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:16,448
I like his

1724
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
Fearnow community

1725
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:20,288
To be able to

1726
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,592
Have that adjustify

1727
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:24,640
You would have he would have been

1728
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,712
Looked looked at a certain way

1729
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:31,040
And an Evangelical communities there's absolutely

1730
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:31,808
It's not a hard

1731
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,576
Time limit

1732
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:35,136
A year after you pay for an abortion

1733
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,160
You have not

1734
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,440
Repented enough

1735
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,768
Ten Years After you paid for plenty of them it's like hey

1736
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:42,560
Yeah he's a changed man it's

1737
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
Completely different

1738
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,608
It's totally fine

1739
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,144
What also the repentance

1740
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,728
At this point in his career would probably require some humility

1741
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:52,288
It would probably require him to

1742
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
Like except

1743
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,104
That

1744
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,664
That you know he's not the Arbiter of all these

1745
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Ferrara

1746
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,712
But now he's a star

1747
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,760
And so is his

1748
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,040
Does not really required

1749
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:07,904
Frame to be humble literally star they let you do whatever you

1750
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,488
Aw this case to go real

1751
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:20,448
It's going to take awhile to get pretty mad about that or at least frustrated

1752
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,032
And then this weaves nicely into a little bit of transphobia

1753
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:31,712
Millions more

1754
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,016
We have to wait

1755
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:36,576
Federal District Court

1756
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,880
Megan

1757
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:44,512
Sometimes these things just move very very swiftly and other times they get bogged down

1758
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,632
Well

1759
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:05,504
Good to see that Alex's pretty early on that train

1760
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,528
Great job

1761
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,368
Do we have one last

1762
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,160
Like I said

1763
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:13,696
Bizarre

1764
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,976
Alex

1765
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:15,744
Is not

1766
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,536
Talking about his own

1767
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,304
Involvement

1768
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,328
In abortion

1769
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,912
Because it's hyper relevant to the conversation that's being hat

1770
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:24,960
You think

1771
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
That

1772
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,056
Someone

1773
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,080
Having abortions

1774
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,360
Paying for an abortion

1775
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,152
There's not anything to be ashamed of

1776
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,456
I don't think there's anything wrong with it

1777
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:37,504
But Alex does

1778
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,552
In that community

1779
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,832
Alex does

1780
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,928
Something wrong with the ultimate Evil of murdering children

1781
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
Right

1782
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,232
But you can also be

1783
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,000
You forgiven

1784
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,792
Corsican this clip

1785
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,584
Really feels like Alec

1786
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,120
Talking to himself

1787
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,984
Because we know what we know from things that he talks about later but is not talking about

1788
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:58,752
At this point

1789
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,384
You try to rationalize

1790
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,440
Women keep it legal

1791
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,424
The murder of other children

1792
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,520
So he's saying this like you can be

1793
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:36,128
He's talking about himself himself

1794
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,176
That he can be forgiven

1795
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,224
And I think that this

1796
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
Is

1797
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:44,320
An unfair way for him to discuss this

1798
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,368
When he's holding back that

1799
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:50,720
Information everyone else who does this now is evil

1800
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Forever

1801
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,048
And they're working for the devil

1802
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,072
And should be punished

1803
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,376
Obviously

1804
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,704
From prior to this moment when I did it

1805
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,800
If you were still able to be forgiven for it is grandfathered in

1806
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,592
To the whole

1807
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,152
Let's punish everybody for the crime of murdering babies

1808
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,968
I think if there's such a such a weird

1809
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,272
Circle line with this

1810
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:18,368
A lot of it comes down to I don't think the people

1811
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,416
Should be required

1812
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,696
To disclose

1813
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,976
Things that are person

1814
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,512
You know like if

1815
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,816
Someone did have an abortion or something

1816
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,912
I don't think that it's anybody's business that that they don't want it to be there busy

1817
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:33,984
It's it's personal

1818
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:38,592
That said Alex is engaging in a conversation

1819
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:39,360
That

1820
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,896
Applies to himself

1821
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,664
Deeply

1822
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,992
About a political issue that he's trying to do

1823
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:45,760
Prive

1824
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:49,088
People of being able to access abortion

1825
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,624
Oh it does

1826
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,416
In this case it does

1827
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
Feel like

1828
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:54,720
He has an obligation

1829
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
To denote

1830
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,304
In the same way when he talks

1831
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,840
It's about like

1832
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:02,144
Is Big Berkey water filters

1833
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,960
And stuff he has a responsibilities at their response

1834
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:05,984
You know like

1835
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:11,104
I was thinking the same thing I was just going like this

1836
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,384
It reminds me so much of

1837
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,152
Despondent

1838
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:20,064
You know like there's such a huge conflict of interest are emotional conflict of interest for him

1839
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,856
I mean such that it is

1840
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
It's just

1841
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,648
F***** up

1842
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
Women chest really f*****

1843
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,488
You listen that last clip

1844
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,536
And it does really feel like you talk

1845
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,304
Talking to himself

1846
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,840
M2d

1847
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:32,864
Like this

1848
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,888
This conversation

1849
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,984
Is actually a psychodrama of his own

1850
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:43,360
Trying to deal with his own past Route that's being projected as political

1851
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,688
Principal or advice to the audience

1852
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,712
That is unfair

1853
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,248
That is a conflict of

1854
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:51,296
And I think

1855
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,320
I think that it's

1856
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:53,088
Unethical

1857
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:57,952
But then again it does come up against the principles

1858
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,720
Should be forced to

1859
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,488
Disclose

1860
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,352
Biggest I don't know if you know it's a mess but I do know that as a radio show this is

1861
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:09,728
To it to the extent that you are influencing

1862
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:14,592
You got it you got to disclose that s***

1863
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,872
You got it

1864
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
Because

1865
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,968
If your if this is who you are then that's the context

1866
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,528
With which I'm going to understand what you're saying

1867
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:28,672
And maybe if this personal experience that you have is really a major portion of what

1868
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:29,440
What's driving

1869
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,976
Your position

1870
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:34,048
And this emotional plea that you're making to the audience

1871
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:36,352
Service of trying to change law

1872
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:38,400
Yeah it does feel like it

1873
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,424
It's super relevant

1874
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:41,216
I understand

1875
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,264
The reasoning behind.

1876
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
Talking about it

1877
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,568
Couldn't get away with it back.

1878
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:50,688
I mean it's just the thing that follows obviously is

1879
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
You know

1880
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,760
He's leaving out that if you're getting one

1881
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,552
Now you can be forgiven

1882
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:02,464
It's very conveniently in the past if you got it abortion you can be forgiven right no point in time is he saying that

1883
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
In in the contactor

1884
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:08,864
In the context of discussing abortion in the presence of evil

1885
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
Violet

1886
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:13,472
Right

1887
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,240
Government

1888
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,288
In the U position of the past

1889
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,360
You can be forgiven there's no worries there's nothing

1890
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,896
In the present you should be

1891
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:22,432
Be killed for getting an abortion

1892
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:27,296
So I end this on a pretty good

1893
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:29,856
Obviously disgusted but also

1894
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,648
Conflicted position

1895
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,696
About this whole

1896
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,280
I do think it's very interesting the way that Alex

1897
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:41,376
Refuses to talk about his own experience when he does later

1898
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:42,144
I think that's

1899
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,704
Bedrooms of this episode

1900
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,776
I really think that the most important takeaway

1901
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Is that

1902
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,592
Nobody was on the 9/11 plane

1903
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:53,408
Right I think that what happened in that occur

1904
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,176
Exchange

1905
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,968
Is so relevant

1906
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,992
The understanding

1907
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
The way Alex

1908
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,552
Deals with

1909
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:01,344
People who disagree with him

1910
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,368
Or our threat

1911
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:03,392
Coming to his ideas

1912
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:06,976
And also it's such a good

1913
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:10,816
Demonstration of why talking to him is a waste of time

1914
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:11,584
For pretty much any

1915
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:15,424
Yeah I mean and it's it's another Power Dynamic to that occur

1916
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
Exact same

1917
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,752
Scituate you know when you talk about the way that

1918
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,544
Bill Ayers talk to him up just like

1919
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,104
The same kind of functional

1920
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,152
Just stay on topic just stay on top

1921
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:27,456
Buddy just stay on topic but

1922
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,248
Because billares is a name

1923
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:33,856
Then Alex has to engage with that to some extent he can't just

1924
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:35,648
Scream over you

1925
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:38,464
Gaslight you directly while while

1926
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,256
Scolding you

1927
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:41,280
Daring to ask

1928
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,048
Ask him those questions

1929
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,096
In this power imbalance

1930
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:50,496
He just gets to yell at you and say you're stupid you're talking about something else soon as you're gone he can go back to

1931
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:56,896
Listening to me you're not listening to me you or not leaking no I didn't say that there were no but there's nobody on board

1932
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,432
Until we hang up and then I'm

1933
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,712
Suggest it again

1934
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:03,552
I think that's no just awful and

1935
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,600
But he does all the time

1936
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:12,256
Anyway Jordan we will be back on Wednesday indeed but until then we have website

1937

1939
