The Evangelical form of Christianity around those Corners a little too long

10
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,736

00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,280

25
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Yeah I know I think I believed in

26
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,800
Not that so much I don't look back on believing in the religion

27
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,592

75
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
The other

76
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
Tremendously important

77
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183

89
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,103
Professor Griff comes in and talk about the 13 Bloodlines of the Illuminati

90
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Alright it's a lot of esoteric

91
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,967
So that's not important

92
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:12,735
No I doubt

93
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Now what is it for

94
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295

98
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,447
It's taken months

99
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,775
Love listening to these episodes

100
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,639

I am crisis actors narrative in Sandy Hook

106
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,631
He's been something that I have

107
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Thought about probably

108
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Right

109
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,871
Steve pieczenik is somebody who is Lord Alex down terrible roads repeatedly throughout his career

110
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
Makes sense

111
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,407
Likes

112
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
Since we do know that he is a crisis actors guy

113
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,623
Hurricane

114
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,975

00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,399
Steve pieczenik showing up on Alex's show in 2013

116
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,983

117
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,311
March 27th

118
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,871
Steve pieczenik makes his first appearance on the Brock

119
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,455

Stingrays

124
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:02,047
So episode Alex's on some narratives

125
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,327
His big one

126
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,119
Is that he's found a story

127
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:09,983
Wired about press releases

128
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,335
And how this is going to spiral out of control

129
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,103
Complete

130
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,151
He's Aggies game

131
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,367
IRobot

132
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Square

133
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Original

134
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
House Press Corps

135
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,295
You will never be

136
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,495
It's just a video simulations

137
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
No it's interesting

138
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
You know Trump is

139
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,151
Kick a lot of people out of the press the room

140
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:25,759
I just wrote down for the list

141
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:32,159
I love my authoritarian leader he's got to kick him out there making snide comments

142
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:34,975
Also this hasn't happened

143
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,511
Easily imagine

144
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Scenario where Alex is like

145
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
Of course Trump sends a hologram to his rallies ass

146
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:48,543
Realistically

147
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:57,503
Say it's very close to Alex being completely

148
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,551
I don't know how much

149
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Answer is to the ID

150
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,135
To make a holographic Obama

151
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
Time is

152
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,559
Does not appear to have happened

153
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:15,423
Sure

154
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Play takeover and

155
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Control the Earth

156
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
Otamatones will become the actual president

157
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,527
When they have those when they're running everything they're going to need their own

158
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,063
For people to walk well

159
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
A cyborg suit

160
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
Switch the Holograms

161
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,231
Obama's going to be in there

162
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,023
Call it nailed it

163
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Alex male that's what I'm going to give it to him 100

164
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Ze starts rambling and spiraling out

165
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
And you know like the

166
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,799
Holographic president

167
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Pre-recorded

168
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Speeches and all this stuff is

169
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,247
Fight back now

170
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
For these

171
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
Deserve whatever

172
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Because if

173
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
You don't

174
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Your dad

175
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,695
That's

176
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
Argument

177
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
And then relies on

178
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
What I would call Shawty

179
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:36,575
Emerge

180
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,935
Communication satellites

181
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,055

182
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135

All the way up to number 3 which I believe is 2003 space

185
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Absolutely so good

186
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,031

187
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Good good Eva

188
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
So far

189
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
80s movie villain

190
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,431
Volleyball

191
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
That's why I

192
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,343
Classic volleyball movie

193
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
Exactly

194
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
Freedom

195
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,463
Yeah

196
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
But how all of this goes

197
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Intervallic saying something

198
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,679
We know this because of the revealed plan in X science fiction movie

199
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,471
It would get sad

200
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,031
Quite frankly

201
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
It never takes into account like

202
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,615
What about all the other things

203
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Person wrote

204
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,687
Like what about

205
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,599
To be so clunky

206
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
That's wild

207
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,487
I'm really surprised that

208
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,535
Is it have we never

209
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,303
Harris

210
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,631
How to be a guest

211
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,679
Maybe a gas problem

212
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,495
OneStop hair

213
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,591
Yeah I know that I have

214
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:41,759
And it makes me think that a guest probably brought it up I don't remember Alex talking about it a lot

215
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
But

216
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,111
So this isn't the Project Camelot

217
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
Kerry Cassidy

218
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,023
Over Project Camelot

219
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,095
Alien

220
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
Are working for the reptilians

221
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:04,543
A little worker bees that run around people and terrifying

222
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
And all that good stuff

223
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,103
And the reptilians are the bad guy

224
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
Author Richard bad guys

225
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
The Big Bang

226
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
Different

227
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,231
Computer-assisted telepathy

228
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,311
And the graves are humans from the future

229
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,639
As far as I understand from highest-level Luminati information

230
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,503
What salon near today

231
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,807
What the f***

232
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:55,743
Aliens in movies are in Illuminati conditioning device in order to make you think that that's what we will be

233
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,095
In the future of boy right now

234
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
That is not real

235
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Bright based on everything I've read

236
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
High-end the Illuminati releases

237
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,759
I would love for him to provide this high-level Illuminati document

238
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,087
Or whatever that

239
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,159
To be available

240
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:29,279
Actually is childhood's end

241
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:30,559
Great

242
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
Alex you know he's talking about all this

243
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,751
This kind of you know this 2001 Space Odyssey

244
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,287
Gray aliens are

245
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,591
You know the Illuminati believes

246
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
XYZ

247
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,895
He doesn't believe us

248
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:50,015
You need to give himself the video of rationality

249
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:50,783
Behind the

250
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
I don't believe in stuff

251
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,463
I don't necessarily believe the community

252
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:04,863
He's giving the plants that I will yell about that all the time because you believe

253
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
So he gets into a little bit of that

254
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,751
Is it going to achieve this

255
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
Geologist

256
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:29,439
Takashi

257
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,423
Force

258
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,007
Beautiful people

259
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Shq Wells I just quoted

260
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
His book The New World Order

261
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,391
Arthur Schlessinger

262
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
Okay

263
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
Set me up

264
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
Quote that Alex misuses

265
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
From HG Wells book The New World Order it all the time

266
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Constantly

267
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
It's almost as if you only read this one

268
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,687
Paragraph that book

269
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,759
Not understood it and decided the ideas

270
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,831
About the world and the misunderstanding

271
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,391
In discussing how he observed

272
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
The world was generally towards greater social

273
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
H.g. Wells

274
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,399
Nor doesn't alter the fact that even when the struggle seems to be drifting definitely towards a world social

275
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
There may still be very great valeza disappointment

276
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
Before it becomes an efficient and beneficent worlds

277
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
Countless people from Maharaja to millionaires

278
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
Is a pukka sahib

279
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,431
The pretty ladies

280
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,271
Will hate the New World Order be rendered unhappy by frustration of their passion

281
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,039
Vision

282
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,087
Through its Advent and will die protest

283
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:05,183
When we attempt to estimate its promise we have to bear in mind that the

284
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Distress of a generation or so of malka

285
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
Many of them quite gallon

286
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
And graceful looking

287
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,631
The list of people who sang will be against social democracy

288
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,191
They are the very top of the prevailing social hierarchy

289
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
The millionaires King

290
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Colonialist

291
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
Aristocrats

292
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
When Wells make reference

293
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
What's 2 gallon

294
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
Can people he's

295
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,919
Expressing the feeling that monsters are not always grotesque

296
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
And often actually beautiful

297
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
Alex seems to think

298
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,527
The passages about him

299
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
Self

300
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
Express in the sense that eventually Patriots would show up

301
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,415
The counter these nefarious playing

302
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
He's putting out

303
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,975
And these Patriots would be Gallant

304
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
And really hot

305
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,863
Legends perfect was Alex's self-design pathology but it doesn't match

306
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Wells is making

307
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
At all

308
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,703
Much like Alex is interpretation.

309
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Scripture this is an active eisegesis

310
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:54,847
And it only makes sense if you understand the Alex read the paragraph

311
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,871
Support for the things that

312
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,895
We already believe

313
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,711
This pattern along with tons of other behaviors

314
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Galaxy terrible socio

315
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,039
Terrible anthropologist

316
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,319
Terrible psychologist

317
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,855
And terrible historian

318
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
They're all labels he has no business giving

319
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,487
The biggest one that was missing

320
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,047
Is literary

321
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:17,887
He doesn't really it's

322
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,167
Himself for everything

323
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Could be applied to

324
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,775
I'm a sociologist

325
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:30,175
Psychologist Astorian apologist I am also illiterate

326
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,271
So I just fine I tried that too

327
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
Be so fascinating

328
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
Level

329
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Hear that

330
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
Opposing forces

331
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
How to kill all of us but we have to be done

332
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,191
Completely out of line

333
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
With the with what wild

334
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
Also

335
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,335
It however him

336
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
Sing with an exactly what

337
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
He is bad

338
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:06,271
Millionaire going to die

339
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:12,671
Miserably Amy Wells wrote The Millionaire meant a lot different

340
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
They Alex's ascribing to him

341
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:15,999
Himself

342
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Hi social

343
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
But he probably doesn't Merit like

344
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:26,239
Compared to Maharaja millionaires

345
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,543
He's nowhere near that level no

346
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,335
Beep beep beep

347
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:35,455
Himself in that conversation

348
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
Also has a

349
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:43,647
Specific connotation like high-end socialite

350
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Aristocrat

351
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,511
Malcontent

352
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Yes baby

353
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
The very thing that would improve his

354
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,399
That is true

355
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
To be in Avid

356
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Some calls here on this show

357
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
To talk about how the Catholic Church

358
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Wants his gun

359
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
If you listen carefully

360
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,503
He gives a citation

361
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
For some of his belief

362
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:11,807
It's deeply drop

363
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,623
Nobody I know of so far has

364
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,696
Responded to an article that

365
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,000
February 25th at an article

366
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Any dirt America or Catholic America magazine

367
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
An article on the 25th of February issue

368
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,448
Actually have a nautical new that I read

369
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,520
If they are going to repeal the 2nd Amendment

370
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,800
I'm a nobody

371
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,336
Respond to

372
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
Vatican of Rome doing this or any other

373
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
Stop talking about

374
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,560
Vatican release

375
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:05,568
Over the over the years

376
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,128
Roommates the American Constitution

377
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:12,736
Proven also by failing get ahold of through baby Chick Publications called

378
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:18,880
50 years

379
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,512
I don't know if Alex did actually scan around on XM and find a Catholic Channel but this isn't

380
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,072
Like a fake thing this actually is real

381
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,120
Yeah it was an op-ed published in the castle

382
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,144
Look magazine America

383
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
Who's going to ever have sensible gun laws

384
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
If we repealed

385
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
This wasn't necessarily call to outright ban

386
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,016
Gunn it's more of a realization that the Second Amendment absolutely gets in the way of any conversation about

387
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:52,416
So possibly debate where people were still able to preserve

388
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:55,232
Ownership that we would also be able to fix some of the problems

389
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,000
Is it a come along with

390
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,024
The ubiquity of God

391
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Yeah it's kind of a sensible position

392
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,912
Controversial

393
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,448
Come from a religious magazine

394
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
Definitely not something I would call

395
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:06,752
Scandalous

396
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:11,104
The writer the editorializing grappled with the reluctance of people to alter laws

397
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Particularly ones

398
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,224
But ultimately those are just laws written by and passed by human

399
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,528
If they were passed in one Circle

400
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Answer those circumstances

401
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,208
Consider changing the laws

402
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:26,976
Good Roboto

403
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,024
Probably more troubling to

404
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,632
And that call is the fact that the caller is also citing a book that is put out by chick

405
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Publication

406
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
The business run by Jack

407
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,032
He's got to put those little cartoon pamphlets full of gross

408
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,824
Grotesque depictions of Chris

409
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,432
Christian fundamentalist ideas it's pretty clear

410
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,480
It is now it makes

411
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Fancy I got you

412
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
It's all there

413
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,552
Those exist

414
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Primarily a cc

415
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,112
Exclusively

416
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
To scare the s*** out of

417
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,952
If they strafe

418
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,720
From the fundamental

419
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
Chick tracts run the gamut of Christian issues

420
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,096
You're going to hell if you get an abortion

421
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:07,168
You're going to go to hell if you have sex drugs

422
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,192
All the stuff YouTube

423
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,264
But Jack Chick was also a

424
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
C tablet

425
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,824
A constantly rails on Vatican

426
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:20,736
So this article is being brought up real article making a point that will be easy for Alex

427
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,272
Manipulate

428
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,320
Church

429
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
Zippo price every articles are those

430
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,256
It's worth pointing out that the sewer people in

431
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,792
Discussing the article is

432
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
This way

433
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:37,376
From my perspective here it seems

434
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
To be someone who's also into Jack

435
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,264
Check which is pretty bad that is a bad sign

436
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Now

437
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,128
Have you heard have you read the one about calling

438
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
Propaganda

439
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:55,808
Well it really only positive

440
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
Scares children

441
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,416
Wanting to call in to REI

442
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,024
Tower with Professor Griff

443
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,304
8

444
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,096
Fundamentally not worth

445
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Going over

446
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,704
Mostly about a book that was written by a guy

447
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,472
Professor

448
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
To be former

449
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Netflix

450
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,152
Confirmation of it

451
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,200
He has a bunch of s*** about the Illuminati

452
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,576
The other stuff I've heard Professor Griff's

453
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,112
In past appearances

454
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,392
I don't even want

455
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
I just let them talk

456
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,536
Have fun guys because

457
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
And that my bigger fish

458
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,864
Is the man the myth

459
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:41,888
Steve pieczenik

460
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,216
Most of the interview was actually pretty boring

461
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:49,312
Alex wanted to have him on to talk about how the bin Laden

462
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Killing was fake

463
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:55,712
Right and how do thing

464
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
Rite Aid

465
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,880
Osama Bin Laden dead forever

466
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
You have him on

467
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
To talk about

468
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,488
Steve Howey

469
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:11,328
Namely that Zero Dark Thirty sucks

470
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:16,960
He's very mad about Zero Dark Thirty

471
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,288
And I don't think we really need to get into that either that's sort of

472
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,616
The film review

473
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Fair enough

474
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,456
So

475
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Purview

476
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
What do you know

477
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Sandy Hook

478
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,576
Surprise

479
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Gary speed

480
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Put

481
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,904
Talking about Sandy

482
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:41,536
I told you and I didn't tell you but how you said very clearly

483
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:47,936
That is very important right there until you

484
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,216
I told you I didn't tell

485
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
I told you and I didn't tell you but I very clearly there's no question

486
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,464
My mind after I damn in Sandy Hook

487
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,632
Individual

488
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:23,776
Play what's a Woman by 100 million dollar contract

489
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:26,592
Call Hunger Games with post apoplectic

490
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:32,480
She didn't say a damn word

491
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:40,160
Irish Catholic

492
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
Increasing union pension

493
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
Stanchion of executive power

494
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,208
So that

495
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Pretty up blonde

496
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
He is very much

497
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,352
The crisis actor narrative

498
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:25,984
Express tan Alex's show

499
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
It's because Susan Colin

500
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,056
Wrote The Hunger Games

501
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Yang Chow

502
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,872
Yeah that one

503
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
Heard him say Susan

504
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
There's no reason to throw that in there and then

505
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,272
In the back of my mind

506
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
OSHA

507
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
That's right

508
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,976
Brought the Hunger Games

509
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
I know first this is what year

510
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Yeah that's not good

511
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,752
So on February 12th 2013

512
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
Steve pieczenik posted a Blog

513
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,640
Entryway

514
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
I can say with certainty that at least by that point

515
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
February 12th

516
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,528
Steve is absolutely Advantix

517
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,416
It's rooted in the fact that he credits himself as an author of Tom Clancy's books

518
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,208
So he knows a bit about fiction writing

519
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,024
The story of Sandy Hook struck him as a poorly-written

520
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
Piece of fiction

521
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
So when he found out that Susan Collins

522
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
The author of The Hunger

523
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:28,960
This explains everything

524
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:32,032
Suffice it to say this is not convincing stuff

525
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
Tracing back to January 22nd

526
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Steve posted on his blog

527
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,224
I'll be posting later tonight but here's some homework if you're interested

528
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,552
Something does not smell right about the Sandy Hook thing

529
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Inconsistent

530
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
You keep nagging

531
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:48,416
Especially when I start comparing them to other events in Rio

532
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
History...

533
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Who does that sound like

534
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
The way Alex

535
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:59,168
Constantly Compares Sandy Hook at all of his feelings about it to Aurora

536
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,728
Event from recent history

537
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
I don't know

538
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,800
Seems weird yeah

539
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:08,128
I have every reason to suspect that Alex knows with Steve

540
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,040
At this point has been publicly accusing V survivors and victims of Sandy Hook of being actors

541
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,344
I need someone Alex knows and respects

542
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,184
It just doesn't track the idea that Alex would think that Steve is a

543
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
Intelligence operation

544
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
Weather blog

545
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:30,912
Current affairs Alex doesn't that block

546
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,568
It's possible but if that's the case then it's a really good at piece of evidence that Alex doesn't do nearly the amount of preparation that he want

547
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,152
If you read the discovery request

548
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,968
In the lawsuit that Alex is facing for his recovery

549
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
A couple of things stick out

550
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,832
They're obvious pieces of things they're looking for like

551
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:55,232
Request for all the materials involved in Sandy Hook crisis actors anything involving Wolfgang halbig

552
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,304
But then when you get to item number 3

553
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
The plaintiffs request

554
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,400
Quote all documents and or Communications

555
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,288
Between you and any of the following individuals or anyone acting on their behalf concerning any of the topic

556
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Text listed

557
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
They're only two names

558
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,408
James Tracey isn't on there

559
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,944
Wolfgang halbig isn't on that

560
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
It's only Steve pieczenik

561
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,272
And Jonathan Wright

562
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,904
Reich was a twenty-six-year-old dude got arrested for harassing Sandy Hook families as well as the County Medical

563
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,744
He hasn't shown up on Alex's show or had any mention

564
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,560
Browse I think that's because he doesn't get arrested until May

565
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
If I recall correctly

566
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,120
Every March

567
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,912
There may not be any reason for Alex

568
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,680
Text to Noble

569
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,336
There's a longer list in item number for request for communications regarding appearances on Infowars

570
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,152
Which includes both of those two dudes and some of the other likely

571
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
We suspect a gang

572
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
The Reich

573
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
Steve pieczenik

574
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Are the only

575
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
Only two people

576
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,600
Requested all Communications

577
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Concerning

578
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Be covered top

579
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
Based on what I've been able to suss out for listening back to these episodes

580
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,816
It appears that the plaintiffs may have the same working theory that I'm coming

581
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
Namely that Steve is communicating with Alex

582
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
Behind the scenes

583
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,424
Leading to a shift in

584
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
His coverage

585
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,544
From my position but this is not nothing

586
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,104
When Paul Joseph Watson interview James

587
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
Tracy about the crisis actor

588
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
Ethereal little while back

589
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
They were at least

590
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,504
Trying to be explicit about not endorsing his ideas

591
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:26,880
Paul Joseph Watson had to list off a ton of disclaimers and caveat about how he doesn't agree with this guy

592
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,952
No not too much longer after this point

593
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,976
We have our first dance

594
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,328
Survivors were all actors with no pushback

595
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,376
And actually excitement from Alec

596
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
And that's someone

597
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Steve

598
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,264
Other than like a spray collar that Alex might have gotten

599
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,544
No one is Express

600
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
This Theory

601
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
On the show

602
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
And anyone who has has gotten at least

603
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
Stomp performative pushback

604
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Alex's Grill

605
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,272
With Steve bring this up

606
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,576
It almost gives him the ability

607
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
To cover this now

608
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,392
Steve is giving him that

609
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
And I'll say this

610
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
If you go back and you look at a bunch of

611
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
To like these

612
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,048
These blogs that are sort of a line

613
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
Patriot ideas and stuff

614
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
The day after this

615
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
There are tons of articles

616
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,496
About Steve pieczenik appearing on Alex's show and sayings

617
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,056
Saudi idea Alex

618
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,384
Had a hand in really amplifying and legitimizing

619
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,152
These ideas

620
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
If this

621
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:22,944
Is

622
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,224
The beginning of it

623
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,504
And the kernel of it

624
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
He presents Steve pieczenik

625
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
Like as an absolute expert in everything

626
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,416
He's overthrowing governments

627
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Psyop expert

628
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,744
He's been olivitos everything is part of the

629
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
Lcfr but he left because he was

630
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,304
Disgusted

631
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,120
Having him on allowing this to

632
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Be sad

633
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Uncritically

634
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:46,240
And with no pushback and infect celebration

635
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,520
Steve's Kombat

636
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
Does a

637
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,568
Mastiff

638
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Piece of work

639
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,128
In terms of legitimizing

640
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,920
The a crisis actors Theory

641
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,736
Did the role that Alex plays

642
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Even if it is a little bit

643
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,040
Delayed

644
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:02,112
Inasmuch as these theories are floating around on the internet

645
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,136
Conspiracy forums

646
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
I mean almost

647
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
Immediately

648
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,256
This piece of work

649
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Is terrible

650
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,328
This doesn't severe amount of

651
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,144
Well now

652
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
I'm kind of lost

653
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
Cuz I didn't know that

654
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,008
Steve pieczenik

655
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:19,776
Fiery hen

656
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:21,824
Written

657
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
4 time

658
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:29,504
Is there Ghost Rider Ghost Rider

659
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,040
Has ghost written one book

660
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
If that part

661
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,368
Is true

662
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,672
Then I can only assume that

663
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Susan Collins

664
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,048
Cuz if if a

665
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
Then be must

666
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Be true as well

667
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,192
It's Shawty stuff and one of those things that I've learned from

668
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:48,960
This

669
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,800
Like looking at Steve's blog is that he does not write how he

670
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
Detox

671
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,896
Controlled measured

672
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,920
There's a

673
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,200
Almost

674
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
I don't know

675
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:01,760
There's a

676
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
Elevation

677
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,320
Into the waves

678
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
Speaking

679
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:09,184
On his blog it's just full of like bold letters and all caps and like

680
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,744
Pictures of the Photoshop pictures of

681
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,096
Robin Obama in homosexual

682
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:18,912
It's ludicrous blog

683
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,472
The only know Steve

684
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,800
From his appearances on Alex's show

685
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
Rambling

686
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,616
Nonsensical blog post

687
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,176
Poorly formatted just b*******

688
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
It's very weird

689
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,248
It's all called

690
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Isn't the question

691
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
How much

692
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:38,368
Of his presentation on Alex's show is a put on

693
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:43,232
To make him seem more rational or reliable as a source

694
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
As opposed to where he has full

695
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
Control over what he's putting out

696
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
He stops having a

697
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
An audience

698
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:54,496
Tinfoil hat

699
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
And we start

700
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,408
That was troubling

701
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,944
That was the trouble

702
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:05,248
And here's Alex

703
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
So you want

704
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Come back on

705
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,576
About this

706
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,120
Thank you very much.

707
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Is it

708
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,384
I would definitely say that that's

709
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
The show is going to be

710
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,040
Be far more hardcore

711
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:44,416
As time goes on

712
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
Consider this

713
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Yeah I'm thinking

714
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
About this

715
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Experiences

716
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
Surreal to me

717
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,496
Because with the awareness that I know that the Boston bombing

718
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,264
Is happening

719
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
So many of Alex's narrative

720
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,872
We've so perfectly into that

721
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Confluence

722
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
Of of that

723
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Like I just

724
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Frames

725
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,760
About to run into

726
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,528
To each other

727
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
And I can see it

728
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
There's nothing you could do it

729
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
The past

730
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:18,208
I'm getting really

731
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Anxious

732
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
A little bit yeah

733
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,728
It's troubling

734
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
No no no

735
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,288
Disaster

736
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Yeah probably

737
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
Alex has Devon

738
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,224
For rent that you know this

739
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,296
Clearly articulated

740
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:44,576
Sandy Hook

741
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,344
Was actor

742
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
There was totally fake

743
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
And it's

744
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,208
You know I was really wondering is like March

745
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
28 is going to be

746
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Floodgates open

747
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
The first hour of the show is just Alex saying he's going to

748
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,168
Take calls all day

749
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
The whole show

750
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,984
How old is Cher

751
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,032
Betty Rambles about

752
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:04,800
Nothing

753
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:10,688
He's just going on and on about how he's not a fear monger and all that kind of standard s*** that he yells about

754
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,992
I honestly kind of think he's vamping

755
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,552
Is it really feels like you wanted to go to calls

756
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Because he had a

757
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,880
Prepared for the show but no one is calling it

758
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:23,232
Standard and uninspired

759
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
Yoox

760
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
Where he does like Bob pontificate about whatever it's honestly one of the worst episodes of the show that I've ever had to listen

761
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
Intuit just so Bland

762
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
It's so Bland

763
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
It's so petty

764
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,800
It's still manipulative

765
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,336
Just it is a very

766
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,360
Lame

767
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Certainly

768
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,040
So the first the first flower is just

769
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
Doesn't get to Costco

770
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
I think it's if he is

771
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,976
Pieczenik was riding out

772
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,072
I imagine every line of dialogue

773
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
And ironic

774
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
Adverb

775
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
He said the fear-mongering Lee

776
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,776
Like that's the only way you could write that

777
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,968
You're going to die

778
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,552
Twosome race memory

779
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
In his ramble hour

780
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,928
Isabelle

781
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,744
And I think in this next clip out

782
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,768
Kind of admits that

783
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:29,536
He's just making

784
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,192
Route to Bleed It Out

785
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,776
Doesn't spoil you butcher it yourself

786
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
You cook it yourself

787
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
You're thinking about that

788
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,040
Synapses

789
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:53,344
Experience

790
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
Race memories

791
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:06,400
And just doing

792
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,448
Willow

793
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,336
After someone's written

794
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
Well

795
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,432
Literally communicate

796
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,552
I've never read any of this

797
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:27,648
It's just an idea I've got milk

798
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Refuse

799
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:35,840
Simultaneously Alex will say that science has proven all of this stuff

800
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:40,704
Like literal connections

801
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,008
I don't I don't believe that

802
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:47,360
I do believe that he's just making this stuff up and it's maybe an experience

803
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,408
That he's had with his weird brain

804
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,688
Of eating

805
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Alright I kill

806
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,040
Ore-Ida

807
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,832
Find it pretty fascinating how plans

808
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,160
Watching them

809
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,696
Seedlings

810
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:03,744
Do the almost full grown

811
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,072
It's pretty it's pretty wild

812
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,888
The tiny little ceu denial hot plant

813
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,912
I don't

814
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,752
I could see how if I had a very very weird brain

815
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
I could

816
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Really

817
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,312
Turn that into

818
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
Transcendent experience

819
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
I don't think

820
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,624
We'll use a Dungeons & Dragons

821
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,392
Who's playing

822
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,672
Cosplay

823
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:41,376
I mean I thought about 1 but I thought about it and that means

824
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
He's written it down

825
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,984
Experiments self-evident

826
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,520
Okay

827
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:52,384
You got to you got to grow plants

828
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
What's the number to connect to your ancestors

829
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
Is true just because it

830
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
It's true

831
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,343
But the globalist don't want you to do that

832
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,647
That's why they put rules in place

833
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,439
Agriculture I guess

834
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
GMOs

835
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,279
It's not only that

836
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
And in this next clip Alex fake

837
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,423
Fix crying

838
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,983
While discussing how is

839
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,031
Crying is always very real

840
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Which

841
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
Is another this is not the first time

842
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,111
Which makes me think he's absolutely

843
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,415
B b

844
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
Fastest

845
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:58,943
Social engineering

846
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Is to break

847
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
The genetic encoding recordings

848
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,543
Connection

849
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
The stars in our true destiny

850
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
Hard to kill deers

851
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Plant seeds in

852
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,191
Space

853
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
Spaceship

854
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:00,639
Alright Alex shut the fuk up

855
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Gwyneth Paltrow

856
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
In literally any

857
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:07,807
Why does he not care about like tribal cultures

858
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
If you so into this like

859
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,903
Connection with ancestors

860
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,231
Shouldn't he respected in non-white populations

861
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:19,839
Also they have a vanes Lee if he was going to

862
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
Just do a bunch of

863
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:26,239
I would almost guarantee

864
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,311
Somewhere inside there you resent made of

865
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
Tribal popular

866
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
For having

867
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
More of a Kinect

868
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:40,319
Maybe in there somewhere

869
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
Ayahuasca

870
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:49,023
Yeah that's Ludacris

871
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
Such fake crying and then additional

872
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,631
You know why

873
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
People don't want

874
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,167
People fighting

875
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,959
Assault

876
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,591
Yeah I think you're you're infringing on people's right to not be beaten up

877
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
Outlaw

878
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,711
What street

879
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,551
Right

880
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,599
Ludacris

881
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
Sweetly untethered

882
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
From any kind of

883
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,047
Semblance of his show being a show

884
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,095
Like really does

885
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
I can't stress this enough

886
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
It feels like he doesn't have another

887
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,727
Like there aren't anybody calling in

888
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:32,031
He has no news to cover

889
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
I feel that way

890
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
Part of it was

891
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,759
This is me writing a story

892
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:47,903
But the day before and he is dropped

893
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,231
Alex

894
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
About that maybe you

895
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,559
Really freaked out for the rest of the day

896
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:56,095
No can't sleep

897
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911
Just too excited about the possibilities

898
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,983
I have an expert who's apart of my shows

899
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
Wack Pack

900
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,823
Ready to go this MI

901
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,223
We could tap into this market now and I have some plausible deniability that it seems

902
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:16,319
I can point to

903
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Credible experts

904
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,159
I'm just

905
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
They're saying

906
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
Just dressing

907
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Nothing

908
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
Said this.

909
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
But this made me laugh pretty hard

910
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Alex makes

911
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:32,959
Proclaim

912
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
That

913
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
Man just think about this

914
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
In the context of like

915
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
He's still doing

916
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
His show

917
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,199
6 years after that

918
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
I'd screaming

919
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
All the time

920
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:47,039
About his enemies

921
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,135
Those of you to see by this I I don't even hate you anymore

922
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
Friend

923
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,687
I'm disgusted by these people

924
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,759
He's trained globalist

925
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Intermediate

926
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
Yeah I remember

927
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:27,999
Poultry songs

928
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
I'm pretty sure that

929
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:31,071
So you can get that it is a warm

930
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
I don't believe that

931
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:38,239
I don't think there's any

932
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
I think that's crazy but it's also like

933
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,847
I think that's funny

934
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,127
Just as an idea that

935
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,967
But that's also really funny

936
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
This is what he's doing instead of take

937
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
Call

938
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,111
Calls to go to what

939
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:56,159
This is 40 minutes

940
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,463
But he has every reason

941
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
2 knots

942
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,583
Pretending he's reached his Zen state is battle

943
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
It's

944
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,375
It's pretty crazy

945
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,215
This one guy

946
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
McCall's in

947
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,287
Interesting because Alex

948
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,079
What are last recent

949
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Mi presente episode

950
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,431
Alex said that he was going to come in

951
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:21,759
Studio and talk about what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole

952
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:28,159
Yes

953
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:34,303
Good like what the f*** did you say you were gave us our the rabbit hole this is 6 years in the past

954
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:41,471
Losing my ability

955
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,871
Alex dropped the ball and fumbled on his plans to tell you about the bottom of the rabbit hole

956
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,271
Alex what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole us no like you talk all the time about these Horrors

957
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
These terrible things

958
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,111
What it what are you talkin about

959
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,391
Alex has no answer for

960
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
He Rambles a bit

961
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,999
I think he feels like well I got to do something

962
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
I got to give some answer

963
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
Eva Maddox

964
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
It's wild

965
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,399
This is what the bottom of the rabbit hole Georgia

966
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
Home

967
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,311
The rabbit hole

968
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
You see what you see in Japan

969
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,719
Outside of baby diapers

970
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,351
In the world

971
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
And and and inventing machines everywhere

972
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,991
Open right now

973
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,807
Underwear

974
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,927
And with the picture of the woman

975
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:12,095
End

976
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,247
Earthquake

977
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,215
Wow

978
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,455
Questions and then we go back to the past and get the answer

979
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:07,135
Man I wish we didn't get that at there's an interesting dialogue that's happening across the temper

980
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Coral space

981
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
This is pretty f****** stupid

982
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,511
I would say

983
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,655
Oh you know what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole

984
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,471
Yep that's about

985
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Japanese

986
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,311
Diapers that are

987
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,103
Fully loaded Reloaded

988
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,175
Herbie this is obviously exaggeration

989
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
His world

990
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:42,975
I read an interesting article on the website Tech in Asia where they look at the bottom

991
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:45,279
Well kind of besan racist ideas

992
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,327
Urban Mystic

993
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,167
The machines advertised quote used underwear

994
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,703
But the actual Japanese Tech

995
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,519
Kiryu

996
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:56,799
Similar to pre distressed

997
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,455
Arises that non-native speakers see the word used on the machine they come to their own conclusion

998
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:05,759
Where is if you actually speak Japanese you wouldn't

999
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Make the same mistake

1000
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,367
Which tracks neatly with Alex saying that he got this information from Mancow

1001
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
Who is visiting

1002
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
Speak Japanese

1003
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:16,511
He probably just saw used on the machines like all my God people shiting those

1004
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,279
Virulent

1005
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,839
Racist man

1006
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,935
The article determines that most of the stuff you hear about this sort of thing is based on Urban

1007
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:30,591
I can also find no evidence that there are poop bars all over the United States

1008
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,967
Is that a civil rights issue we would have to close our poop

1009
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,855
I mean

1010
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Got it

1011
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
Can have her clothes up

1012
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,535
The issue about this sort of thing is like yes there are people who have

1013
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,327
You know it dolgin

1014
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
Some sort of a kink

1015
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,911
That other people would find disgusting

1016
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
I'm not super interested in myself but

1017
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,615
Japan that's not

1018
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,687
It's not reach the pandemic level

1019
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,735
No not yet

1020
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,015
Be an escalation towards

1021
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,039
Blood-drinking

1022
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,319
Zombification and

1023
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
Cities Burn

1024
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,415
Even though

1025
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
The good son

1026
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
Could make

1027
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:19,743
It's at 5

1028
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,767
Pressing all these

1029
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
We wind up

1030
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
Bleeding closer to

1031
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,351
To the blood-drinking

1032
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
And

1033
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,263
Baby I'm not entirely sure on the literature on that but it does the

1034
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,287
It does seem like

1035
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,615
You know some feelings you have about it might lead you to that

1036
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
Conclusion

1037
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
I don't know this is crazy

1038
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
First of all just because

1039
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,271
Like the information that Alex's

1040
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,807
Is going on is obvious

1041
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Racist

1042
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
This

1043
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
The 2nd

1044
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,927
Impress

1045
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:51,487
About what's at the bottom of the rabbit hole

1046
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
That's what he's got

1047
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
That's crazy

1048
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:58,399
Japanese the top seller doesn't specify without even

1049
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
Japan

1050
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:04,543
Is diapers for people to s*** in because they all love

1051
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,615
Defiling themselves and

1052
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,175
Desecrating

1053
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,711
Right

1054
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
You here though is

1055
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
Is that that was

1056
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,623
Just a

1057
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,975
You don't like his explanation

1058
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,511
Alright

1059
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,815
If you want to know

1060
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,431
You know that

1061
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,199
Is

1062
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,223
Ludacris

1063
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:48,831
Why are you pressing me for specifics of making me look like I don't give a specific right

1064
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,135
View

1065
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,439
Failing this contract

1066
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:00,095
Right and then you calling you amplify the things I say

1067
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,119
Make money

1068
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,703
So I don't know

1069
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Absurd

1070
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,311
Some more specifics Alex

1071
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,103
The more you realize

1072
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Nothing is

1073
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,151
Is based on any

1074
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Memphis's

1075
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
Absurd b******* about

1076
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
People

1077
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,015
Eating poop

1078
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,295
Meaning of civil rights

1079
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:21,855
So Alex

1080
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
Rambles a bit more

1081
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:26,719
And he ends up telling the story of why his family moved to Austin

1082
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:30,047
From Rockwall alright

1083
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,143
Loaded baked potatoes

1084
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,447
That's not the story

1085
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,727
I don't believe this

1086
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Okay

1087
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
Mythology really well

1088
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,103
So he would never

1089
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:56,415
Who were corrupt

1090
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,743
I even had some of them come around

1091
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,047
I started messing with my parents

1092
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
Story

1093
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:10,751
He come by

1094
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:14,591
Smart young kid like you

1095
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,991
Trophy wife

1096
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,807
Egypt better watch what happens to you what you've been talkin

1097
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,743
Just watch your butt boy

1098
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,607
Our lawyer called

1099
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:43,775
Are these

1100
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:50,175
Absurd his lawyer got a call that the FBI agent

1101
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:55,551
So are the police department put out the word we're going to go kill little Alex

1102
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
City Hall

1103
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,623
2

1104
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,999
David

1105
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,047
We just want to give you heads up

1106
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:10,399
Let you know that kill yourself

1107
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
Supposed to do this

1108
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
I've been signed by the governor

1109
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:25,247
Oh right absolutely

1110
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Get out of here

1111
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,063
I don't believe this

1112
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,623
I also now there's Federal involvement

1113
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,255
But I don't think I'm going

1114
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,047
Don't think moving to Austin would help

1115
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
If they have

1116
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,655
The lawyer said they're going to kill Alex

1117
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:49,311
Moving a couple hours away doesn't seem like it's going to be are there the Federal

1118
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:54,431
Bureau of Investigation for them

1119
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,991
The germs of them murder of a child

1120
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,271
This is Ludacris

1121
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,551
Austin has no X

1122
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
Tradition laws

1123
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:05,183
Even if his story was believable on its own

1124
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:10,303
As the solute it makes less.

1125
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
Howard kid

1126
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,423
Which interprets things

1127
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,775
Like it could be the sort of story that you tell yourself

1128
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:21,055
You've your parents

1129
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,871
Like you're getting in trouble at school so they want to move

1130
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,967
Change environments cuz you're a piece of s***

1131
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,759
Beadery will change

1132
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,039
All sorts outcomes

1133
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:33,599
Maybe there's bad influences if that's cool

1134
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,647
Maybe he's running with a bad crowd

1135
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
You can

1136
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
Maybe finesse things

1137
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,303
In your own mind to tell yourself a different story of what Acts

1138
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
Happened

1139
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
Set Alex's

1140
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,375
Decided

1141
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,423
That this. Version of the story that

1142
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,191
VeggieTales

1143
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
Is the reality

1144
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,031
Because it never did not happen

1145
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
Probably

1146
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,895
SAS terminal pool once

1147
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,455
I could see that I don't know

1148
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,551
Right

1149
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,879
I have to believe Alex was annoying as a youth

1150
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
Call Tricia

1151
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
I can't imagine someone not telling him to shut up every now and again

1152
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:16,095
How does Merit spiraling

1153
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Into

1154
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
They were going to kill me

1155
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,703
Probably not now

1156
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,263
That's my feeling

1157
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
This is a load of s***

1158
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,079
Yeah it's a story like that that really May

1159
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
F***** him

1160
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,967
So but like I don't know if they did

1161
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,015
It sounds to me like

1162
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,319
Based on every story we've heard about him

1163
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,111
Moving or or any

1164
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Before he would

1165
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,951
Any control over it

1166
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
His parents probably

1167
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
Just lie.

1168
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,351
Maybe maybe but so much of it is only coming

1169
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,119
From his perspective

1170
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:55,775
No is actual input from his parents as perceived

1171
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:59,871
So I don't know I would be I'd be hesitant to say that they're lying

1172
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,663
Stop when it's coming from

1173
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,711
I don't know

1174
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,503
It could just be a self-defense mechanism

1175
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:09,087
Get some selfies the hero in all these stories

1176
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
That's entirely likely

1177
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,023
Now that he

1178
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:19,071
He believes all of Alex's narrative

1179
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,863
And all of the Worlds

1180
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
Puts out

1181
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,423
His friends don't agree with them

1182
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,727
GoNoodle

1183
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
To some extent

1184
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
I don't think it Alex

1185
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,103
Response

1186
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Appropriately

1187
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:35,199
You know it's a twin like all my friends hotels like

1188
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:39,039
I try to tell him about like what's going on about all the Tyranny about

1189
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,647
It's like they don't have their own.

1190
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,351
Everyone everyone has the iPhone now it's like it's like we're living inside of a clone tiida

1191
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:59,007
Well it's

1192
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:07,199
I just really feel bad for like my generation my future we don't even get to live our lives now

1193
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:11,039
And I mean like

1194
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:19,231
The future is

1195
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:21,023
Every corner

1196
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,607
People pooping on each other

1197
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:36,127
Very obviously stupid kid I really look up to you and I hear aware

1198
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:40,479
Doubt about my increasing isolation

1199
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,551
Please tell me what the future is for my generation

1200
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:48,159
Alright this is the Great

1201
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:53,535
That's that that's a situation where what Alex is doing is

1202
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Mocking

1203
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
The out

1204
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:59,935
The friends he has that don't agree without his worldview

1205
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:03,775
Thursday

1206
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:06,079
Serves to insulate the Imgur

1207
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
That is a part of

1208
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
With Alex

1209
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,967
And I don't

1210
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,247
But that's healthy

1211
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:17,087
Not good

1212
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,415
I think there's some Merit to

1213
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,183
Lake

1214
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,487
Not necessarily a lot of bully

1215
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,327
Generational isolation

1216
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,631
You feel the technology over

1217
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,423
To an extent

1218
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,727
Feels like there's a lot of in personalization

1219
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:38,335
You can talk about in a realistic way at 4

1220
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,639
Offer solutions to

1221
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:44,991
And it's not hey all of your friends are stupid they're just cheap

1222
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
They're thinking like that they all have

1223
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,391
The same thoughts not like you know they're just going to end up at

1224
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,415
Like that

1225
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,743
That's not good that's not that's not a healthy weight

1226
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,535
To treat someone calling it

1227
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,839
If you don't help them or

1228
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
You're going to end up at the

1229
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Kapooclub

1230
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
There's also an imp

1231
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,239
Play Syd threat to every part of

1232
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,775
He's out groveshire

1233
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:08,799
Sure

1234
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
I don't know I think

1235
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
That's not cool

1236
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
That's the

1237
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
With what

1238
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
Simply

1239
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Call them

1240
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
Never

1241
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,679
One last clip and it's from the end of this 28th episode

1242
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:42,335
It's kind of a no man's land

1243
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:46,175
Third in there somewhere

1244
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:51,551
It's pretty it's mostly just vamping to not take calls and then taking a few calls

1245
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,135
There's no Sandy Hook

1246
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
Really

1247
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,975
Except I guess

1248
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,511
I think once or twice you generally

1249
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
It says

1250
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
It's a false flag

1251
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,839
But that's not really any

1252
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Develop

1253
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,655
That's just him

1254
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,679
Throw that in there

1255
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:12,543
Just a reminder it's not a development

1256
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,359
Inasmuch as

1257
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,383
Introduce

1258
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,479
Acceptability of dealing with this as a crisis actor situation

1259
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,807
False flag

1260
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,367
It's the same thing we talked about on our last 23rd

1261
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
It's the kind of thing where

1262
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,719
If you want to hear it this way you can

1263
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,511
If you want to hear at this other way

1264
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,559
And it's not

1265
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327
It's not relevant

1266
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,143
But we got One Last Cry.

1267
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Another caller

1268
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,703
Alex is running out of time

1269
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,751
To tell you he's in overdrive

1270
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
So he does not have to answer to

1271
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,639
Then he's both running out of time and

1272
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
He's already

1273
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:55,807
Show is over but he can just keep going as long as he wants

1274
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:03,487
Yeah so he's talking to this guy

1275
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,511
He could

1276
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:09,119
Come back from this commercial break that they're their barreling into

1277
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:15,519
He could cancel the commercial break he wants to

1278
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
I probably wouldn't

1279
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:22,175
This whole thing is sort of

1280
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,271
There's a whole story on top of the story ends medium

1281
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
Shine some light on you

1282
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,159
I covered something the other day and I know this may sound fantastic

1283
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:37,535
Hartford Connecticut

1284
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,863
Okay Define JPMorgan and his

1285
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,239
Why is M3 songs their graves were ransacked and bodies were sold

1286
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:00,575
Is the a division

1287
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:08,511
YouTube

1288
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
Princess

1289
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:19,775
Their bodies were stolen

1290
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,199
Such a good boy

1291
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:31,551
Morgan is buried at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford Connecticut

1292
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,135
An extra layer to the story

1293
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,207
Feels like he's talking about Sandy Hook because it's Connecticut

1294
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,999
But it's not explicit but that's

1295
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,023
Disconnected

1296
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
You think

1297
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:48,447
I don't really know cuz I would doesn't give him enough time

1298
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Conspiracy

1299
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,007
Connecticut

1300
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,591
Any added layer it feels like it might be

1301
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:59,199
I don't know like just from the the

1302
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,247
Large background information

1303
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,551
Throwing

1304
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Sandy Hook

1305
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Was a

1306
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
False flag

1307
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,927
Nobody died in

1308
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,231
To distract

1309
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
Stealing of the Apple

1310
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:18,911
From Rushmore

1311
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,519
Pictures of jpmorgan's gravesite

1312
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,079
Easley online if you look it up there's not really any

1313
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,895
It's just kind of granite slabs

1314
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:31,455
JPMorgan was married twice

1315
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Is buried with him

1316
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Cedar Hill

1317
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,087
Problem

1318
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,927
Mostly because JPMorgan only had one son JPMorgan to

1319
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,559
He had three daughters Louisa Juliet

1320
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,631
But others for children only

1321
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
And are buried at the family plot

1322
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,751
This guy is just simple facts wrong

1323
01:07:55,007 --> 01:08:01,151
The little difficult to trust any of them

1324
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:07,551
JPMorgan and his three sons gravesites where they stole their bodies have three sons

1325
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:11,903
Got an additional element

1326
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:16,511
And now I want to find out that JPMorgan had a pretty good cook

1327
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:22,911
I tried to look into this I can find literally no indication the JPMorgan in his family's tubes were ransacked and their bodies were stolen

1328
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,007
I can't even find conspiracy sites are doing that sort of thing

1329
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,127
Maybe

1330
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,199
Yeah it is just kind of the problem with how Alex relates to his collar

1331
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:40,319
He has no time left on the show even though he's an over driving to keep going as long as he wants

1332
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,367
Realize this guy to throw up something

1333
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,415
Unfounded and insane

1334
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
While leaving himself

1335
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
No time to respond

1336
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:50,559
Except for with a weird grown

1337
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:52,863
You can't operate like this

1338
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,887
Especially when Alex

1339
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,703
Fancies himself and he talks about a lot about like

1340
01:08:56,959 --> 01:09:00,543
I get so much information from you callers of the Brain Trust

1341
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,895
Stories of gun bills that I don't even know where happening

1342
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,687
You've got a call or calling in

1343
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:12,831
This JPMorgan grave robbery happened

1344
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
The specifics of it

1345
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,647
It's just left hanging there

1346
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:21,023
It with no like if I were Alex I one second left and that guy said that

1347
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,607
Nope

1348
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,911
I cannot hang up

1349
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
We've been doing this

1350
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:33,567
So many years I've heard so many callers and I have never wanted to know what

1351
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
Any of them had to say

1352
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,015
And if you consider that like he's Vamps

1353
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Almost there

1354
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,855
Entire episode if this caller it just been allowed

1355
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,671
Some of that time

1356
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:53,535
We could have maybe figured out what is the conspiracy

1357
01:09:55,071 --> 01:10:00,959
Obviously the conspiracy is so much better when I'm writing what he might think right

1358
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:05,311
That of course is going to be better because the real conspiracy was probably going to be a method

1359
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,383
Probably it is more fun

1360
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,783
If it is like we need a diversion in order to pull off the Italian job on his tools or something

1361
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:17,343
It is more fun

1362
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,623
It's probably not what he was

1363
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:24,767
But I want to know

1364
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:31,935
Come back to the 2013 on March 29th will we find it

1365
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,983
Probably not almost certainly not

1366
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:40,127
No problem. You're all going to die wondering what happened

1367
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,991
I think I think that is something that a mystery that will go unsolved

1368
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,623
So I am.

1369
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
Departure

1370
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
Like I think

1371
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,695
I think we have

1372
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,487
Icy chains

1373
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,327
First of all Steve pieczenik

1374
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Simplay

1375
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,655
He wants to come back he'll be back very soon

1376
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,239
Disseminate

1377
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,775
And that is the Susan Collins

1378
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:11,103
Existence proves that there crisis actors

1379
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
Also I want to know how much you got for ghostwriting

1380
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,455
I would like to know that

1381
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,551
On is big

1382
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
And then I also think that

1383
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
Do you think

1384
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,695
These things and Alex.

1385
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
Push back on them is big

1386
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,559
Because it's Alex had a moral and intellectual

1387
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
Consistency

1388
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,167
What we've seen so far is it least of version

1389
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
To the actors

1390
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:42,335
He scolded that caller who brought up the idea that Robbie Parker was an actor

1391
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,919
Like you can't stay

1392
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,223
There was a repulsion about it

1393
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:51,807
Winnie had Paul Joseph Watson interview James Tracey

1394
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,831
There wasn't

1395
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
Do distance

1396
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:57,951
Interview the guy about what he believed but not be

1397
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
Now here on Archer

1398
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,279
27

1399
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,303
You see

1400
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,351
Almost complete except

1401
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:08,191
Partially because Alex knows Steve

1402
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:13,567
He doesn't take it as just some crazy idea that

1403
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,103
There's the gravitas of Steve

1404
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
Britannic behind

1405
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,919
Which is a mess

1406
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
Hypnotize

1407
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
Probably he probably has like a

1408
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
The real Arrow credibility of very

1409
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,487
Like I don't think Alex has any reason to

1410
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
Pieczenik was on

1411
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
Every goddamn

1412
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,591
Fueling a lot of Alex's

1413
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
Shift to Trump

1414
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
With his

1415
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,479
Narratives about the counter-coup

1416
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
What have you

1417
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,319
Loki

1418
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,159
What happened

1419
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
In the future and how quickly Alex

1420
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,791
But I do I do think that

1421
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,095
We could what we can see

1422
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
He publicly here

1423
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
It definitely feels

1424
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Like

1425
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
I need those

1426
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:14,495
Yeah

1427
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:16,543
I very much hope

1428
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:22,687
The lawsuit involved release

1429
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,991
I don't think we have standing

1430
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:26,783
Prefer something along those

1431
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:28,831
Certainly.

1432
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,599
Snow

1433
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,927
Feels feels like this is

1434
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:35,487
It feels like this is a drop-off

1435
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:38,047
We'll see I'm more

1436
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,863
Excited whenever face on like

1437
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
We only have like two weeks left

1438
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,191
Before the Boston bombing

1439
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,751
Narrative is taken

1440
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:48,031
A drastic step

1441
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,567
Before this

1442
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,103
How much

1443
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,663
Is that going to come in

1444
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,199
Play how far is he

1445
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:55,967
You going to go down to

1446
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:57,503
Sandy Hook crisis actors

1447
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,575
Before the Boston bombing

1448
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,367
And then how is that going to inform his

1449
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,903
News coverage of the bombing

1450
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,999
Such a disaster unfolding in front of me

1451
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,303
Like that is unnecessary

1452
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,839
It is based on

1453
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
Haribol sourcing

1454
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,655
It's based on

1455
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
Just

1456
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,495
I mean everything is as bad as Jeff

1457
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Poop bars

1458
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,543
In terms of

1459
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,591
America poop

1460
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Because they're not that

1461
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:30,783
I mean grounding in reality none of this is real all of it just going to drink

1462
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:39,999
Yeah

1463
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,535
Yep

1464
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,071
I don't know either

1465
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,887
I'm more excited than ever to see where this goes

1466
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,167
But then I also.

1467
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,471
I mean isn't in this

1468
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,751
Situation I have weights

1469
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,591
You know what I got to do information

1470
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:08,159
Sabong happens if I got Steve on you

1471
01:15:09,695 --> 01:15:11,999
I never said that

1472
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,839
Expect the unexpected

1473
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
Nothing ever

1474
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,143
Turns out how it appears

1475
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,191
The appearance of

1476
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
Steve pieczenik

1477
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,727
Being

1478
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Various

1479
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,287
Actually related to this

1480
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
I think is born

1481
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
That's crucial

1482
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
So Pat myself on the back

1483
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
Ever-so-slightly

1484
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,735
For that prediction correct

1485
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:34,015
Today right

1486
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,295
Yeah I will

1487
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:38,879
The pattern on the back

1488
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,695
More information comes to the

1489
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,255
On Wednesday

1490
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,303
Live website

1491
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:48,607
Yeah it is

1492
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:53,471
Ross on Twitter

1493
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,543
Yachtworld

1494
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,311
If you would like to

1495
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,871
Forced tell someone else

1496
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,151
You can go to I2

1497
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,455
Are you could leave a review

1498
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
But that is

1499
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
Low

1500
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:06,783
Level

1501
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
Oh boy

1502
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,087
You're going to want to do

1503
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:11,647
To your nearest park bench

1504
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,207
Underneath that park bench will be a bed

1505
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,279
That will give you the key to our dirty Dropbox

1506
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
Okay

1507
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,375
You're going to want to download those two

1508
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:23,935
Three files all of them. EXE

1509
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,959
So if you have a Mac

1510
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:30,847
You're not going to be able to listen to their label JPMorgan said 12 + 30

1511
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,663
I didn't know that's where you were going
