He made it very big f****** and I am going to lay out exactly what he did wrong

That's an excellent out of context from the top

26
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:11,072
Jesus Christ

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Just for me

28
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Alex today we're going over this episode over the October 19th episode

29
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,808
With a couple of pieces of evidence from other days

30
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Comparison

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,136
Today is

32
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,696
Show I want to say one thing

33
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
He

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
He's really pushing really hard about his show for tomorrow for Friday

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,728
Guests who are exposing pedophiles in Hollywood

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Documentary that has nothing to do with Samantha lawyer

37
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,616
But

38
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,920
The way Alex is ramp it up

39
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Pretty sure he's about to get sued

40
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,600
He is working himself into a PR stunt lost

41
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
Like he's going to say something he shouldn't interview

42
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,328
Something like that is going to happen

43
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:21,728
Smell it the entire religion of Scientology

44
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
That be a wild turn of events

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,432
I hope you destroy each other

46
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
I hope the courtroom accidentally lights on fire tomorrow show

47
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,160
We don't really have any of that

48
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
In here

49
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:47,840
But we do have a repeat return appearance from rainbows naturacel Millie Weaver

00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,336
Enough feedback on that where they like neither of us

52
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,432
Improv training papers were skaven

53
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
Hollywood Reporter did not give the opposite of Hamilton

54
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Dispatch

55
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
No.

56
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
I'm so let's start off the show how Alex starts off

57
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Nonsense

58
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
If the broadcast that I know are particularly historical and important

59
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,871
He's got enough

60
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,143
Victories

61
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
By the day

62
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Against the globalist

63
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,007
Unless it's really happy

64
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,871
I got a really good feeling

65
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,943
Residential

66
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,319
Bob Lazar going to strike back and they're going to strike back hard

67
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
Crowded

68
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:22,815
Icebreaker

69
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Yahoo doing through their lies

70
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
Donald John Trump

71
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,407
And I just love the fact that the global took over one of the most American cities

72
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,247
Pure Americana

73
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,879
Corrupt

74
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,231
Hollywood babble-on

75
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Set Sodom Gomorrah

76
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Who is the catalyst

77
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
Leveling the playing field

78
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
He's taking care of American workers are veterans

79
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,175
It's incredible

80
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,783
Do you mean

81
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,439
That's why he tries to get charity to give 25 to $50,000 to every veteran

82
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
Killed in combat

83
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
Every active-duty Soldier

84
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
You mean anywhere

85
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
Air Force

86
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,823
That's why he tries to personally visit them or give them mobile phone call him because that's one of his big strengths

87
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:44,479
First one to get money they make it as weakness

88
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:48,831
Chandeliers

89
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Party mothers

90
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
See that's the problem

91
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Soldier

92
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
How old is he goat

93
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:09,823

Caldwell

96
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,623
Promise the day

97
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
Promise 25,000 to them

98
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951
Never paid

99
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
No those are his strike

100
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
What the f*** are you

101
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,583
Talkin about

102
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Probably makes great deals and that's why people make fun of all the bad deal he's

103
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,495
Because he's made zero great deals

104
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
Denise tried to destroy every

105
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,175
What you don't understand is you got to you got to get into the headspace of an Alex Jones right about now

106
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
And that is

107
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
You ain't not be aware of this

108
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:53,343
Sean Hannity has been pimping real hard

109
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,135
Documents

110
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
And you've got a big scoop about Hillary

111
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
And it's mostly this uranium

112
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,815
It's mostly that there's a new twist in it

113
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
I bet it turns out that the FBI was doing

114
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
Investigation

115
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,215
Concurrently but not about Hillary

116
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,263
It was about a trucking firm

117
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
That have nope

118
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Was getting no-bid contracts

119
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
And had been basic

120
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Play compromise by Rush

121
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
Yeah

122
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
They were investigating that Alex is turning it into a thing where they're

123
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
Call Hillary

124
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Yeah but

125
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:30,463
Bitter and Petty about the fact

126
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,023
That Sean Hannity's getting a lot of attention about it

127
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
Is like

128
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:35,839
He's in this place

129
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,607
He's like

130
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,631
No one

131
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Tumi

132
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Struggling

133
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
At the same time

134
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
Because of all this like

135
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
All of this stuff amounts to a hill

136
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
But you got it

137
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
Use it as a

138
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,687
Why

139
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,015
There are questions about Trump and Russia

140
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Do you have to go

141
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Use this as a way to

142
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,855
Deflect from the Russia investigation

143
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
About how much more

144
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Real thing

145
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,791
Involved are present

146
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
The thing is what

147
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
Using this week s*** in order to deflect from the other ship its

148
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,215
Coming

149
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
He flips

150
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
The alai

151
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
To deflect from the truth

152
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,823
Of these attacks

153
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
You were screaming about drunk

154
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,967
Motor hard right now

155
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
He is

156
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,575
Straight up lying about this

157
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,391
To the point

158
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,159
You have to be like

159
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
You're lying

160
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,023
So you don't look over at all the s*** that he's not talking

161
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
I mean

162
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
I'm stupid

163
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,935
Yeah but it is it is

164
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
Tactically a smart idea

165
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,335
I will accept that is what we come down to over and over again

166
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
Is Ronnie's the

167
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Red flag

168
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
Yeah

00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
Distraction everything

170
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
He's f****** banana

171
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:03,647
Is he gets into the

172
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,415
The

Handy related Rochester

174
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,607
Pretty early so let's jump clip is about Mueller

175
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,983
The entienda basically accusing

176
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:23,103
That Robert Mueller had delivered uranium

177
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,151
In two thousand and

178
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
15 to the Russians

179
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,111
I knew that they have gotten hundreds of millions of dollars

180
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,951
Candy companies

181
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:42,559
Real quick just about that because some people may not know what the details of that

182
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,583
Situation were

183
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
Robert Mueller deliver to sample of Highly enriched uranium

Confiscated from

Smuggler's Inn

Country of Georgia

187
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Russian

Authorities for forensic

Examination back in

The request of the Russian government and with the blessing of the American law enforcement

192
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
Alex

193
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,903
See what confused me with Alex said I knew about it

194
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,671
In 20

195
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Bright

196
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
He did it

197
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,583
Yeah wasn't the directory

198
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,119
Mel

199
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,471
2009 it's nothing nothing

200
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
Spooky nothing nefarious

201
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:26,079
It's like you said WeChat week-tv

202
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,103
Nonsense

203
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,407
And that

204
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:31,711
Killer has work for

205
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,551
Call me was his menu

206
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:40,927
Basically still the head of the FBI degrading stand

207
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,423
And we had

208
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,215
The cfcm

209
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,775
All of that information

210
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,175
Flyers Larry Nichols

211
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,319
Hillary criminal investigation

212
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
Bi

213
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Opera

214
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,887
New York with photos

215
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,615
I'm sitting around all the famous

216
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
Huge material

217
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,831
Infowars.com

218
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:46,719
I can't find it I don't know what he's talking about I tried to look for it

219
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,023
It's nowhere probably because

220
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,839
Just untrue for their state

221
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,887
But also legally action

222
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
Written

223
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:59,775
That is almost certainly something that you

224
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,311
You can sue for libel

225
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,431
I would I would assume so special if you somehow doctor briefcase

226
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,807
I don't know I have to reserve judgment until I can find this mysterious article

227
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,903
I did go to Infowars though I don't want to give you a little bit of a glimpse

228
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,463
Into what's a hot news over there today

229
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,815
Bar over on the side number one top stories

230
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,839
Saber-toothed cat

231
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,375
Mingled with modern humans

232
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Big news

233
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,103
Do you think because it's okay

234
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,223
You think that means that their Jeeps respond that's exactly what I think is going on

235
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
So what they're saying is about

236
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,343
30000 years ago

237
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:46,623
Sabertooth

238
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,975
Tigers were just hanging out with National Geographic

239
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:56,351
And then in the top stories bar we have a total of 7 stories

240
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
Two of them are about things that

241
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Newstead

242
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Public statements

243
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,543
Does reinforcing up

244
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,823
Narratives about the world

245
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,151
If us develop new nuclear weapons Russia will too

246
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
And the other one is Putin

247
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
Hillary is behind Russia

248
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Conclusion Hysteria

249
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
An elite

250
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,551
Disrespect

251
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Trump voters

252
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,183
Maybe it's not that

253
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,743
Trump voters have zero respect

254
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
And we should not respect

255
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,583
They are deserving of no respect

256
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,727
Voters who don't like Alex

257
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
I'd be interested in meeting

258
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
I told you before the show that I think I

259
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,735
Stumbled

260
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
Something big

261
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:54,207
I was just I was just thinking about his his angle on this and apparently the new angle that the Jeep

262
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:54,975
He is going to go

263
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
Instead of ignoring the Russia

264
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,839
There's no story so we're not

265
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
Comment

266
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,679
They realize now that's not going to stop

267
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,495
So what they're going to do then

268
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Is deflect

269
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,151
The Russian operative

270
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
What is

271
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
What's going on right now

272
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,855
Clearly everybody knows Trump

273
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
Committed

274
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
Nobody wants to deal with it because

275
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
That would

276
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
Be f******

277
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,535
What would a big Mastiff

278
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,863
We would have to first of all hang Trump

279
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
By the neck until dead

280
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
On the national Square from the Washington Monument

281
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
Somewhere

282
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:47,711
Right

283
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,087
For sure most likely

284
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
Taking those guys.

285
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
You're like that

286
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,191
One out it as being come on now don't you don't like that

287
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:13,055
That's a good thing as monsters person

288
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,127
Secretly gay just because you probably

289
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,991
A lot of the most

290
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,551
Maryland antique

291
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
Yeah well cuz I'm

292
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,415
Thrown around is like a negative

293
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Sometimes

294
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
I know you weren't doing that but I was just

295
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Be that as it may

296
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,375
Homophobe

297
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
Sex with men

298
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
While the same time taking away

299
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Your own right

300
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:48,895
To do so hypothetically you lose a lot of like negative

301
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
So

302
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,223
Now we can get back

303
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
This

304
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Is important

305
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,415
Their honor episode that we put out today on Thursday

306
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
We discussed

307
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:02,975
How

308
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,791
By looking back at December of 2015

309
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
We were able to

310
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,607
Fairly accurately

311
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,399
Depict

312
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Determined

313
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
That

314
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:16,031
And Rodger Stone we're working together to manipulate Alex

315
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
The Joint team Trump

316
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
Concerted effort going on

317
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
At that point

318
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,175
They

319
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,503
Now I want to build on that

320
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,271
A little bit

321
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,063
In these next

322
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
Because I think Alex accidentally said something

323
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Over the last three days

324
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,511
That he might regret

325
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
You might regret

326
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:38,815
Because I think he

327
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:39,839
F***** up the time

328
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:41,887
Cuz

329
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Getting really jealous

330
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
About John Hannah

331
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Right

332
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,567
And he's speaking a little bit to extemporaneously

333
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
He's being a little bit too loose as is as is his wont

334
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Yes

335
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
So here's the first clip

336
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
This is from the Wednesday show

337
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
From the 17th

338
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:02,367
This week in 27

339
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,159
This is

340
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Expressing a bit of

341
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,255
Pettiness

342
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,279
About the fact

343
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,375
They know he's not getting enough credit for the Russia stories

344
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
And what have you but keep in mind

345
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,239
Closely to some of the details

346
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,519
About timeline

347
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,311
Can hear because they are very

348
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
To the rest of the story

349
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
On russiagate

350
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
Clear

351
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Understanding the media cover-up

352
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,463
And why

353
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Hillary and others

354
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
Went after Trump for what

355
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
Themselves had done

356
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,543
Here's the article up on infowars.com

357
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,639
You story on Hillary Racha chat to drop

358
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Tonight

359
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,967
Bombshell expose

360
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,295
Journalism

361
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,111
The president Nelson

362
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:09,183
Does a great job has a lot of Courage

363
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,999
I don't want to sit here and say this is not new news

364
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,215
Record show on cable

365
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,823
Protest with Rodger Stone

366
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
2016

367
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
Hundreds of shows

368
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
Hundreds of articles

369
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
So

370
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
In clip

371
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,279
There's a

372
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,047
Nonsense

373
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,143
Trying to Cock out the audience size of an average

374
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
Alex

375
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
F***** up

376
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
He's saying

377
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
Then Hillary Clinton

378
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,311
And all of these people

379
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
Start accusing Trump

380
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
Of colluding with Russia

381
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
Because secretly they knew they were guilty of it

382
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
So they were trying to get ahead of it

383
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
He f***** up

384
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
Cuz you said

385
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
January or react in the next cookie says

386
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
At the beginning

387
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
26

388
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:17,023
Me and Rodger Stone started pushing this

389
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Really hard

390
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
The idea of Hillary colluding

391
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
With Russia

392
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
What was happening in the world

393
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,959
At the beginning of 20

394
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:27,775
Dude

395
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
At this point I

396
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,359
I can't f****** handle the barrage of

397
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,455
I don't remember much in October 2015

398
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:40,063
In October 28th of 2015

399
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,599
Build

400
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,623
The Moscow

401
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,647
Trump Tower

402
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:45,951
Of 2050

403
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,255
At that point also

404
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
Phlegm

405
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:51,327
I'm just temper of 2015

406
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,351
Gave that speech

407
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,655
In Moscow at the RT convention

408
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
With Putin and Jill Stein

409
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:02,079
Also at that point he was working forward one

410
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
So

411
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
We get to January of 2000

412
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Steam

413
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
When is and even

414
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,527
An advisor formerly

415
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
For trumpet this

416
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Right manafort isn't

417
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
Even

418
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
His campaign manager

419
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,672

420
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
No one has it ain't

421
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Until what

422
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,400
Like August

423
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
At least

424
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:28,704
Yeah

425
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,776
Paul manafort became the campaign manager in March

426
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,824

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360

April 27th

430
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:41,504
Was when he gave that meeting at the Mayflower Hotel that speech

431
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,344
Met with all the people

432
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Come out until much later

433
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:53,024
June 3rd is When Donald Trump jr. had that meeting with the Russian lawyer

434
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,304
They got setup

435
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm sorry that was a little bit later in

436
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Is window washing

437
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,800
Post reported that hackers gained access to

438
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,360
The DNC server

439
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Even happened at that point

440
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,088
And Alex

441
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,648
Ian complaining about what he's

442
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,184
Accusing Hillary of

443
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
His giving away his own

444
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,512
Threat

445
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,352
Of course the other person

446
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
Doing the thing you were doing in order to

447
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,240
Heavily

448
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Gino's

449
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,800
And Rodger Stone

450
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Nose

451
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
That that's what they were doing

452
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,176
Because

453
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
Debriefed by Russian intelligence

454
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,832
November

455
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
Well whatever November December

456
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
It could have been years

457
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Before

458
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
22nd 2016 is when Wikileaks released the DM

459
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,424
Right

460
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,448
When people started to get low

461
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,264
June 25th

462
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Later that week

463
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,336
Is when the FBI confirmed that they were

464
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,616
Having an investigation

465
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,712
Trump tweeted

466
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Vintage Oak in town is that Russia did it

467
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
That's when people started to be like

468
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Herbalife

469
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
You give the press conference

470
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,464
Claims he's never spoken to Putin even though in

471
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,536
2013 even though we have a great relationship

472
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
Yeah so it goes on from there

473
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
August 8th

474
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,984
2016 is on Rodger Stone publicly admitted that he had communicated

475
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,056
Whether it's the Rebecca Channel or whatever with Julian Assange

476
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
A little bit later

477
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
August 21st is when Stone said trust me podesta

478
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
The time will soon be in the barrel

479
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
It will come soon

480
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
In October

481
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
Stone is pleadings at

482
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,720
On Wednesday Hillary is done

483
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
#Wiki Lee

484
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,304
Yeah like all this stuff that made people

485
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,840
Concern

486
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,376
And Wendy

487
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,656
Was really bubbling up

488
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,448
Was not the beginning of 26

489
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
16

490
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,056
Now it was near it was right near the actual

491
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:13,824
Talking

492
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,640
Vote at least towards the middle

493
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
Weights

494
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,528
Is win a lot of those those

495
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Concern started to come to the Forefront

496
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
And the fact that I was just saying

497
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,184
We were writing copious articles about them

498
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
In January at the beach

499
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Beginning of 26

500
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:38,656
16 to the point where he like Rodger why are we talkin about this

501
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,216
What it is

502
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
But now he knows

503
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Subconsciously Let its

504
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,128
I don't necessarily think that he

505
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Didn't know

506
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:54,272
I don't think at all said to Rodger

507
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:57,344
Why are we writing about this

508
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
You know being like

509
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,184
Look at how many articles we wrote

510
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,816
That I have to protect you like that

511
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,472
No a guiro

512
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,288
Here's the next clip isn't a little bit long

513
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
But it's worth it for what happens if

514
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,224
Straight up January

515
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Beginning of the year

516
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:28,064
Say the beginning of March

517
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
Put you in in March there wasn't

518
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:30,624
Yeah I know

519
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,392
So

520
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,440
Now you know why

521
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:36,512
Doing

522
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
No exaggeration

523
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
But

524
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
What's incredible is

525
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
He even makes it

526
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,392
Queer eye me already he already clarified that 16

527
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,208
You could be saying January of 27th

528
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,488
Candidate

529
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,560
He wasn't candidates 2017 January

530
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,120
So he's obviously talking about January of

531
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,680
16 timeline doesn't make sense

532
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Very

533
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
King to Trump all the time

534
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,080
In January

535
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,152
While on this narrative

536
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
Yep

537
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,528
And he's obviously working

538
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
Working

539
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:46,656
Russian tried to contact him about secrets

540
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:52,544
Indicted and convicted

541
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,896
Rodger Stone came up under Nixon the famous

542
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
And Senator McCarthy

543
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:03,808
Rodger Stone was around way back then

544
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:10,976
So from the beginning one of the other important things to pull out of that

545
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,512
Is that

546
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,280
Is not

547
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:17,376
Vladimir Putin is a difference

548
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,776
Entirely a communist country

549
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:25,568
State exam

550
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,712
260 it's absolutely not

551
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,320
Russians turn into a giant billionaire kleptocracy

552
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
Stone being on the outs of American politics

553
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:42,464
Text Mom I'm being so close to power

554
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,512
Has finally decided like well f*** it

555
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
If you guys aren't going to give me money

556
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
Empower I'm going to get it from this dude over here

557
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,912
You make a compelling argument

558
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:55,008
I was just going to say is that maybe he was against the people who came before Putin

559
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,824
And now he kind of likes

560
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,688
I think it's absolutely he felt neglected and they gave him the chance to feel powerful again

561
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,992
And he's really addicted

562
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,784
Power influence in a tent

563
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Bulshit

564
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,744
18 years old

565
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
The opposite of a communist

566
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,912
Is on your Democratic Party

567
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,240
What do you do when a red Hunter

568
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,200
Public auction

569
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,480
What are you going to do

570
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,576
President

571
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,672
He was a vice president

572
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:47,744
Present

573
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
What are you going to do

574
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,608
Friend

575
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,424
Hunter is on your butt

576
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,752
Rodger Stone

577
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,336
On television

578
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,872
Fake story about Russian

579
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,224
You better watch it you're working for the

580
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,760
Course

581
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,112
East Coast family

582
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,488
You don't think he was in the CIA

583
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:24,352
Carlson said you better watch it

584
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:38,176
On the floor

585
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:45,600
A little bit

586
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,000
But if anyone is forgotten the reason that John McCain

587
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
Because Grandpa voted was

588
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:55,840
The only person

589
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Who voted against

590
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
Montenegro being

591
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Except

592
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:02,496
Really

593
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,872
The the vote

594
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,896
Montenegro tube

595
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
Allowed in

596
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
How is something that

597
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
Putin was very strong

598
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,040
The rest of the world

599
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
They wanted them

600
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
He didn't say that he's working for

601
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,976
You said he's effectively an agent

602
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
And Alex has misrepresented

603
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,376
He's doing all the literally major

604
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:30,656
6 point which is what

605
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,424
Alex Jones

606
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,216
It appears

607
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,712
It's because

608
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,552
John McCain

609
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Hillary

610
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:55,488
And both podesta brothers are covid-19 a crown.com

611
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:01,888
Brokerage firms military

612
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,824
For most of those years

613
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,104
Waivers

614
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:21,856
Like what Trump is doing Friday or in total and complete mode in DC right now and that's why

615
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,720
And the Republicans

616
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:34,656
The rest of the resistance as Russian agent because he's just like an old spy movie

617
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
Sounds familiar

618
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,664
He got shot in the back with a

619
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,480
Polonium

620
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,856
Yep

621
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:56,928
2 days later they tested

622
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
OpenTable

623
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:05,888
If you have been poisoned

624
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:13,056
Was all Rodger Stone so that the dead man couldn't resist them

625
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,272
I mean that's true Warriors 4

626
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:27,392
Congress and they are in

627
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:33,536
Pool panic mode

628
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
Love it

629
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
I mean it's a good story doesn't

630
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Match up with

631
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,032
Keep him silent it would be the Russian

632
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:49,664
Well there's that

633
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:56,064
Spoon has used in a bag although I would say that

634
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,856
Calling card

635
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:01,184
Yeah it's dumb

636
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,488
He didn't get poisoned by Polonia

637
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,048
It would be public

638
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,888
Just Like Larry Nichols did not

639
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,680
Run guns in Nicaragua

640
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
You can make up that story but

641
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,056
Not the only person who's going to believe you with Alex

642
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
And then when Alex starts screaming about it

643
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
His listeners are going to believe it

644
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,688
And then you get into like

645
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
You've crafted just a false

646
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Reality for them to live in it

647
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
Fun it's f****** fun

648
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,880
Really fun I imagine like

649
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,952
I would love it if I could believe this s***

650
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,744
Do it

651
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,024
It's really just

652
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:40,352
I have to believe that it is

653
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
All of them

654
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Having a subconscious or unconscious

655
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Realization

656
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
That

657
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:49,312
They voted for the dumbest worst president in the

658
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
History of the United

659
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,152
It's possible were they to accept

660
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,200
Then they would have to realize

661
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
Because the dumbest worst president hits

662
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:01,344
Embodies a lot of Republican values

663
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,488
So if you admit that you voted for the guy who embodies all of your values

664
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
And he's the dumbest and worst president

665
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,864
Maybe you're the dumbest worst part

666
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,192
And you're not even president exactly and you are

667
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
F****** yourself over and they just

668
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,800
Can't do that like that destroys your entire world

669
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
View

670
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
B final

671
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,944
The type of Republican that I wanted

672
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,712
Is in the White House

673
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,552
That is very very very bad

674
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
So then you have to

675
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,160
Reevaluate yourself and most people

676
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
If not all people

677
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
Have such a hard time doing that that

678
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,240
Especially if you've lived your whole life by that

679
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Ditto

680
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,288
Finally you get

681
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,824
Chance to figure out what

682
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
And the answer is

683
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,456
Everyone's going to die

684
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Not a great outcome

685
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,088
I don't think that would be something that warms your heart in the middle of the night

686
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,648
So instead you make

687
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
You do everything that I

688
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,840
Like what they're doing is they're just projecting all of their hatred for Trump

689
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
On to Hillary or who

690
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,192
Yeah all of the things

691
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
That Trump is doing

692
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
Just like what Alex's

693
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
With what Alex is doing right now

694
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Everything

695
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
It's about Trump

696
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
He is just

697
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,480
You know just like a like a game of

698
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,832
Move it on over

699
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,136
Doughboy right

700
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,928
Yeah but I mean you kind of have to

701
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,000
Good guy

702
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,024
When you're not

703
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,120
Cuz I'm not in that last one

704
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,472
Clear lies that Rodger Stone told him

705
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
About

706
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,264
Rodger inside

707
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Red light

708
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,568
Believe

709
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
Cuz it's like my hero

710
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,480
Animals next clip we we learn a little bit about a guy named

711
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Plumlee

712
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
Who's another whistleblower that Alex has on

713
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,112
The Alex

714
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:10,880
2.1

715
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,160
2.12 late

716
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,976
Diaz Soma

717
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,816
Some details aren't true okay

718
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Let's just see what your

719
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,144
Hillary

720
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
Secretary of State

721
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:29,568
Had the power to several logs

722
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
The letters

723
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:42,368
So you would give money

724
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,744
Then they will say that but we have

725
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
Million dollars or more

726
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:02,592
Can you give a million

727
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,416
Delivered

728
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:47,136
Blackhat

729
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,976
Leaving groups of C-130

730
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:53,280
Disguise

731
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:59,936
15 c-130s lined up behind the fly to wherever

732
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
Whatever it is

733
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:13,760
Then he shouldn't really Krokus.

734
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:40,384
Broke it all we stuck our necks out

735
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:51,648
The Patriots

736
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Printing specials

737
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:09,312
Boy

738
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:17,504
We're going to be ended specials here for dinner

739
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
Jesus

740
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,576
Steered

741
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,208
A guy who's running guns and takes a little bit of time he's running heavy munitions

742
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,024
High kinetic weapons

743
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
Call Alex Jones

744
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
Ring-a-ling oh hey I'm selling terrorist weapons

745
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Running

746
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
About to fly

747
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,640
Lookbook

748
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,200
You should not be allowed to call Alex Jones

749
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,784
I think that's just it just it makes me think of all the like

750
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
If you ever listen

751
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,648
The coasttocoastam they have a lot of callers who are like

752
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,976
There's like that it was a famous call with Art Bell

753
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,560
Where this guy was like I'm going to fly into Area 51

754
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,168
Any fake like the the call going out

755
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Stuff that happened like that

756
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,520
When was clearly doing some of that ship to Alex

757
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,824
Embellish

758
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
Alex

759
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Description of him saying is like

760
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,808
We run guns to the jihadis

761
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
I'm not going to say I'm doing it

762
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Right now.

763
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:36,864
Gorilla

764
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Specialized specialized White

765
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
CIA antenna

766
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,824
What about

00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,664
Breast

769
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,712
Leg

770
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
Give me a hat

771
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,576
Alex

772
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
Reveals that

773
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,648
Believe

774
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:01,696
Trump

775
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
That

776
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,048
Russia our military

777
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,096
Yes

778
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:10,144
Courtney believe the Trump believe

779
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:11,936
Frankly

780
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,800
I buy that that's possible really possible that Trump believes all kinds of fans

781
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
Simple things

782
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:23,712
If that is true actually had a

783
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,992
Good at calling

784
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:28,320
Widows are the

785
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
Parents approval

786
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,648
Fallen Soldiers

787
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:34,976
Believe

788
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:38,560
He's a lunatic malignant narcissist psychopath

789
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,840
And you will not

790
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,888
He believes every

791
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,448
Fair but listen to this

792
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:46,240
Elizabeth

793
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
Military

794
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
Years ago General Dempsey

795
00:41:55,455 --> 00:42:01,599
Went and met with Obama and said we are not going to have a military strike from the air on Syria we're going to work

796
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,743
In the future when the war's over

797
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,631
Russian

798
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,711
And all this really

799
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,719
You're going to follow that agreement no more

800
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,487
So

801
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,935
He likes to believe

802
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,727
Do you know why

803
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,263
Do you know why he believes all this

804
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
Why isn't Steve pieczenik told him anymore because

805
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
Las Vegas attack was fake

806
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
April

807
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,367
Bar with his bulge

808
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:10,719
I would straight up on his show in response to a caller said it's

809
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:17,887
The very good likelihood that Steve pieczenik is still working for the CIA is pulling a psyop on info

810
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
He doesn't sit down to Quest

811
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
What else

812
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
Steve pieczenik

813
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
Well

814
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,015
If you're if you're telling me about Mars

815
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,087
What else have you lied to me about

816
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Step

817
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,927
It's crazy why would because it's very important

818
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,975
But with Las Vegas he can

819
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,863
Which Syria it's a magic life is a magical thing

820
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
Like hey are Jeeps

821
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Extrajudicial

822
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:57,311
Deal with Russia

823
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:03,711
The generals came to Obama in

824
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:07,295
Very clearly likes

825
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:10,623
Say whatever you want about our foreign policy

826
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
But I do not

827
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
Support General

828
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
Getting out of the chicken of commands

829
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,535
And making deals with hostile Act

830
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
The military

831
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:29,055
It's not a Great America

832
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
So bad

833
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,431
The weirdest part is that currently Brazil is about to have

834
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,015
Like their military generals actually

835
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:41,087
Are talking about a military coup

836
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:43,135
Because Tamara is

837
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,183
Most corrupt

838
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:49,023
Leader in the world right now

839
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
True

840
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
There's a lot of people with warning track

841
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,591
Cubs it down

842
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Buy a lot

843
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Sorry about that

844
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:09,759
Maybe it's one of those things though we're

845
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
You could see that being

846
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
A

847
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
Like a flash toy

848
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
If there is a military coup

849
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,463
In Brazil

850
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Because

851
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:24,095
The president is the single most corrupt president on the plan

852
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,887
And we have

853
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
Number three

854
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:31,263
Cuz I would go I would go with Tamara

855
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:32,799
And then Trump

856
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
Doterra

857
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:41,247
Oh yeah that's it no corrupt

858
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:47,135
But I think it's wise blood

859
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,927
Corruption

860
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,975
But the military is on his

861
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,791
So I would go let's see what

862
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Rank your favorite no

863
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,423
Worldly don't have time

864
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,983
Sign off on whatever your rank

865
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,311
I just I just miss them I just want

866
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
What's a good old bunga-bunga party

867
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
He's back by alright fine

868
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
I don't know what you're

869
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
Oh you don't remember Berlusconi

870
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:17,855
I remember all the corruption that I can get by

871
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
Corruption

872
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,207
Pictures of ultra rich

873
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,999
Plutocrat

874
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,023
Right right

875
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
I mean it sold its quaint

876
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,375
Yeah yeah

877
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Quip here

878
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
We can listen to or we can

879
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
I'm going to give you the option

880
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,359
Well we got to do it okay it's about Alex getting mad

881
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,687
Compression

882
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,991
So

883
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,671
Real quick Alex's setup is clip by saying

884
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
That Joe Biden

885
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,975
8

886
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
Has indicated that he has a

887
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,303
The stay behind Network

888
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:06,751
You know treasonous actors within the government and in this quote in this clip you playing

889
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,543
It's Joe Biden telling them

890
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,383
Guys Trump

891
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
That sort of thing

892
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,967
That's going to be fun at our next State of the Union

893
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,783
Hopefully we'll make it

894
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
Maybe but

895
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,391
Obama did not lie

896
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:27,487
And yet was called a liar by a f****** idiot

897
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:30,047
President

898
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:30,815
Lies

899
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Quite a bit

900
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:35,679
I don't think you told the truth on anything ever

901
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,287
He said this accurate other than

902
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:43,103
My name is President Trump

903
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,127
Even then

904
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663
His name isn't President

905
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
Now that's true

906
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,735
The title to the club

907
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,903
These are basic

908
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,767
We have certain basic social

909
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:07,167
People shooting other congressmen

910
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:13,567
The real quick right is that what he's implying that like Jobe

911
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:18,431
Democrat

912
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
With that

913
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
No

914
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:25,087
His belief is that the gunman was trying to kill everyone on that field

915
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:30,719
Because if you killed all of them it would he was becoming also

916
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
The special election

917
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:32,767
And Democrats

918
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:33,791
Could take over the house

919
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,583
But mathematically it

920
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
Doesn't work

921
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:40,703
Cuz even if all of them were killed and replaced with Democrats Republicans

922
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,983
Still have a majority

923
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:44,031
Real dumb

924
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
You say someone saying Obamacare didn't cover illegal alien

925
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:10,143
Can you shut that off

926
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,727
Old

927
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
And teach him how to be sexually screwed up and hook it up

928
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:32,927
Funding off and have the Thomas computer at IBM decide who gets Healthcare who doesn't

929
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
To say Watson

930
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:43,167
He's done this before but he's called

931
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,031
Computer now

932
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:54,687
Right even back then

933
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,527
No residential

934
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,831
Decided that that's the only thing that matter

935
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
Do some old episodes

936
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,231
Unhealthy distrust

937
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:17,727
Computer actual cell service in England

938
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,495
CareNow

939
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,031
Years ago

940
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,223
Literally

941
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,207
You are

942
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,327
Kellogg's folks about

943
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
Lock

944
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:52,031
He's how long it take for him to interrupt again

945
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,359
Well he sure is f***** up and make it all the way to social Norm

946
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,783
I think it could be that quick let's see

947
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:09,951
Garbage

948
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:13,023
And lay down

949
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
Oh my gosh

950
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:39,135
George Soros women's March organized

951
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:45,791
Palestinian activist

952
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:47,583
Activist

953
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,375
With after family in prison

954
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,191
Usually there on the right side

955
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:58,335
Wheelbarrow

956
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:08,063
For their activity

957
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,487
Inaugurated

958
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,791
You were there

959
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:31,871
About what's going on

960
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,455
It's generating chaos internally

961
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
I don't want to see the chief of staff quit I don't want to see

962
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:45,183
Trieste squid

963
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:48,511
People were in our Administration we're still there

964
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:55,167
Please stay

965
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,471
Confidence

966
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,031
Issues

967
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,895
You don't say so

968
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,015
He saw nothing so friendly

969
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:21,535
Bali push all this stuff when we push

970
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
The resistance

971
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:30,239
After our last episode when it was like

972
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,823
Resident

973
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,359
Pushing for war

974
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:38,943
We're going to go to Sinai

975
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,223
Yeah

976
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:44,319
Again

977
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:48,415
Ted Bundy

978
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,191
How many torture you to death 4 weeks or

979
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:01,983
Your body

980
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,799
Such a dumb idiot

981
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:07,615
Settle down

982
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,687
Chipotle

983
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,671
NeverMind clothes

984
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:28,095
Normal

985
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:31,423
Hurt you politically

986
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,335
And I'mma tell you

987
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:42,687
These are the monsters picked

988
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:51,647
Remember folks when you spread the Articles the videos the Langston Hughes wards.com

989
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,303
The world

990
00:54:58,815 --> 00:55:02,911
The basement

991
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:06,751
What is growling

992
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,799
Put on the handcuffs

993
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:16,223
Very interesting dream

994
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,951
There's more

995
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:34,143
I mean I don't need to really unpack that machine-gun of misrepresentation

996
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,191
And I think what the Bible saying

997
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:37,983
So

998
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,007
It's weird zaheer

999
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,567
Like of course he has to interrupt him so much

1000
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,359
You just let Biden's words

1001
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,663
Play Stephen Alex

1002
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Is it going to be like

1003
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,735
Hockey sounds reasonable

1004
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:54,879
You know it seems like a lot of them

1005
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Donut

1006
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
Jobs

1007
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,463
Maybe Biden's onto something

1008
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,631
A fake Russia ties

1009
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Biden news

1010
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Like

1011
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:12,287
They want Obama administration

1012
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
Stay there

1013
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,103
I am saying that if

1014
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,127
You listen to what

1015
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:16,895
He saying

1016
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,711
There is a certain amount of one his tone of voice

1017
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
Perfect

1018
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
Politician

1019
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,575
Exactly exactly

1020
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
You got it

1021
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:34,303
To just not be a dick like Olive Garden was saying was don't be a dick

1022
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,095
And be good at your job

1023
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Basically

1024
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
Alex

1025
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,007
Launched into a f****** perv fantasy

1026
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
This is where Alex

1027
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,807
Taking orders

1028
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
Take from Putin in the crab

1029
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,903
Rodger Stone

1030
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Little Babs

1031
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
One of our friends

1032
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Has assigned us

1033
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
One of our walks

1034
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
The signed up

1035
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
Tour through history

1036
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,703
Give me a date in the past and I started listening

1037
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
I found the date

1038
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,287
I listened to the wrong year

1039
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
It's a good thing I did so

1040
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
Because on May 3rd

1041
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
2011

1042
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
I found this

1043
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:25,247
You might be asking yourself what happened on May 3rd

1044
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
2011

1045
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,855
5 days before my birthday

1046
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,927
I don't worry about it after Obama announced

1047
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
They killed Osama Bin

1048
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,231
Okay

1049
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,815
So in this clip Alex 11

1050
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,911
Obama kill 9/11

1051
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,727
In this clip Alex talks

1052
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
About the

1053
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,263
Spots but

1054
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,079
Neoconservative thinker

1055
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
Previously

1056
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,943
Against Obama

1057
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,991
Right here is yours this clip

1058
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Alex Jones

1059
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
Anion

1060
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,647
6 years ago

1061
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,231
Howard neocon radio going on

1062
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,335
Because it's that

1063
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
So

1064
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,071
Alex Jones

1065
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:44,607
Just explain

1066
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,399
Tendency in human

1067
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
Exploit

1068
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
On a daily basis

1069
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,823
In 2011 he's very clear that he knows that when you

1070
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,871
You paint someone out to be the enemy

1071
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,919
Going to kill the man

1072
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,967
And take the women and slaves

1073
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
And attack the children

1074
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:04,831
That is your response like

1075
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,623
Take the children and

1076
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,159
Be all pedophiles

1077
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:14,303
Who was Marmaduke

1078
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,607
October 19th

1079
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
Exactly

1080
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,495
Like what he's accusing people of feeling about it

1081
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,063
Absolute complete domination

1082
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:40,415
Competitive

1083
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,303
The overall prosperity

1084
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,583
Collective

1085
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:50,143
Describe Prosperity one

1086
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
Terrible

1087
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,703
Affront to them

1088
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,175
Here we are one hundred years into the great experiment

1089
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:05,759
Audiology

1090
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,295
Oh okay

1091
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:11,135
120 + million Dad we know of

1092
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:20,095
All other government extermination

1093
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:30,079
30-second like it like that

1094
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:34,943
Fascism is way less bad than communism

1095
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,271
Socialism in there with him

1096
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
Know what words

1097
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:43,647
Doesn't explain what Prosperity is cuz he doesn't know what it f****** actually mean

1098
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
Doesn't

1099
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,375
He's right only left on your leg

1100
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,935
Just talk about the Holocaust

1101
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
Lights Bash

1102
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
Right

1103
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,007
At least

1104
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,543
It's not Holocaust

1105
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
Denial at this point it's just

1106
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,103
Every other

1107
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,895
Denial will get sick

1108
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,479
That's all fascism is overdone

1109
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,527
Holocaust

1110
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,319
Lesser of two evils

1111
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,599
He actually does that

1112
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,183
Violin show

1113
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,303
Have a higher body count

1114
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,655
The idea of calling that a combo

1115
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Government

1116
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Stupid

1117
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,799
Communism is an economics

1118
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,359
The government that they had

1119
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
Why

1120
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,551
Add stop

1121
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:45,087
Alex is dumb

1122
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Stupid

1123
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,463
There's one pair

1124
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,231
The men fashion

1125
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Those are

1126
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,535
Those are not

1127
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,071
Inconsistent with each

1128
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,887
And they are not the same f******

1129
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:00,447
Now

1130
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
They did in

1131
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,263
Indeed

1132
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
Cold war is the

1133
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Portrayed

1134
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Communism

1135
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Not

1136
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
They're horrifying facts

1137
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,735
Like even Orwell.

1138
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,807
You know he's describing how

1139
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,343
Communism has

1140
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
The the flaw of eventual

1141
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
Some are more equal than others

1142
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,487
What else

1143
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,279
Does that turn into as a

1144
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Government

1145
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
Though it's

1146
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Fascism

1147
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:29,375
All of Animal Farm

1148
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,911
What's a fascist

1149
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,191
Dictatorship

1150
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,007
Growing out of people

1151
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Berry Fresh

1152
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,151
Out of capitalism just as easily

1153
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:46,015
Clearly

1154
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,039
Equality

1155
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,879
This

1156
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,791
Deposit

1157
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,863
Now whenever we have f****** billionaires they were

1158
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,911
Unafraid

1159
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,215
Clearwater

1160
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,031
Because real armored readout

1161
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,079
Redoubt

1162
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,151
The context of this again

1163
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,455
In case you forgot was that Alex

1164
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:23,391
Free remind me what's going on I thought after I go up to a weird

1165
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:27,231
It's just him exploding 9/11

1166
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,047
Communism

1167
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:33,119
Accounts for over 80%

1168
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,751
100 years

1169
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,335
Cancel.

1170
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,871
You get some numbers

1171
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,879
That is the Great Red Terror

1172
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,927
Suckling

1173
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,791
That's who they are

1174
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,167
There we go

1175
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,703
Butler

1176
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:12,031
Describe the tricks

1177
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,567
6 years ago on a

1178
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,103
Been doing it

1179
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:15,871
With great

1180
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,991
Absolute exploiting natural fear and natural

1181
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,295
Desire to

1182
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,319
To fight back in band

1183
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:28,927
Together he's created a community out of it.

1184
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,975
Yeah 1011 he does

1185
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,023
Wind up making a very

1186
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
Whether or not he means

1187
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,911
But a very great point about our government

1188
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:43,519
Which is that militaristic nothing nothing brings everybody together like

1189
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
Dropping a bomb or murdering

1190
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,151
Huge hard-on when they murdered

1191
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,943
This goes back to like

1192
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:54,271
The thing that I talked about a bit about how he's a

1193
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,295
Person that he was

1194
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,903
Much much closer to rational

1195
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,487
Absolutely

1196
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,535
F******

1197
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:09,375
Come down on me anytime I say someone's reasonable

1198
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
Past Alex Jones is

1199
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,447
Closer to

1200
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,567
You're describing is making a fair point I mean

1201
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:20,895
Mother of all bombs

1202
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,175
Everybody was like

1203
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,247
Now he's pretty presidential and you're like f****** kill us

1204
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,855
So you guys are going to suck his dick after he drops every bomb

1205
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:34,975
F*** you

1206
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:39,071
Hollywood

1207
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,887
Sklepy

1208
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Describing

1209
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,191
Sort of tiered layers

1210
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,215
Depravity

1211
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:46,751
Veteran Hollywood

1212
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:47,519
And then I get

1213
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:51,615
So it goes from heterosexual to the homosexual

1214
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:54,943
2D pedophilia and then

1215
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:56,735
Torture death murder

1216
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
People

1217
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:02,623
Things like Fifty Shades of Grey

1218
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:08,767
Says the downswing the grappler wait man.

1219
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,423
Run around the bunch of folks and they think they got what they want

1220
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:18,751
Going to let you out of those ropes you're going to be down there for

1221
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:23,103
Couple weeks ago

1222
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:28,991
Feel like you have somebody commented.

1223
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,087
Making in there and wailing person

1224
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Devil worshippers

1225
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:57,919
They are your enemies

1226
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,455
Wild breakdown

1227
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
Who do you start to see

1228
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
Be you like

1229
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015
Hitler

1230
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:04,063
The problems that he has

1231
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
Is that all of the

1232
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:08,159
But you said over the years are on record

1233
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:10,975
Rats from 2011

1234
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:11,999
Where where the

1235
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:14,303
Knows that this is a trick people can employ

1236
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
It's not like you

1237
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
Forgotten

1238
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,423
No istick skiers this awareness

1239
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,495
Really get to people

1240
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:27,359
If they think that their loved ones are threatened

1241
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,383
So

1242
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:32,991
Yeah it really makes all this very disingenuous

1243
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
Tom was like

1244
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
In 2011

1245
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,111
Like

1246
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,647
A light bulb went off

1247
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,231
Oh no wonder people aren't list

1248
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,559
Right

1249
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,863
Chocolate

1250
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
Because down Buckley scare

1251
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,519
No one's ever written completely original idea

1252
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,287
I'm the greatest

1253
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,615
Spin the wheel.

1254
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:03,967
Periodic

1255
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:09,343
Periodic

1256
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:20,351
First

1257
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:26,495
Logical logical chords archaeologists have discovered

1258
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:33,151
Let's famously an issue with archaeologists all the time

1259
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:40,575
Throughout their enemies Alex Jones enemies are demon beings and there's a horde of Satan worshipers

1260
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:44,671
Dehumanizing of your opposition

1261
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,719
Speak to them definitely don't learn from them

1262
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,767
Make sure that they are dead

1263
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,303
Kill Them All

1264
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,607
Call Marsha Brooks

1265
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:56,191
To prosperity

1266
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:02,591
Disagree with Alex exactly and they are not heterosexual

1267
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,943
Know which is the top desk

1268
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,991
Yeah I guess

1269
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:16,415
So an appraisal episodi revealed that in a meeting with a Hollywood executive

1270
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,951
Mikey was sexually assaulted

1271
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,255
Which

1272
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
We're not making fun of

1273
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,559
But I will

1274
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
He has another discussion

1275
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
About a meeting with Hollywood Executives that is

1276
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:31,007
Less believable and dumb

1277
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:34,335
Actually assault them no get involved

1278
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:43,039
Jump in the lake as they say

1279
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:48,159
I've been in Hollywood and I've had people ask me

1280
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
We got to do is

1281
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,359
Until March

1282
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,383
Dislike

1283
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:11,199
A couple times on air go to a party

1284
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
In Hollywood

1285
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,551
And he'll be like

1286
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:21,439
Someone come up to me and be like hey we're about to worship Satan you should get out of here if you don't want to be involved

1287
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:26,303
I love you dear that in a meeting with a Hollywood executive

1288
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:29,887
Listen I love your picture green light

1289
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,679
Feliway diabetic

1290
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,639
So you later good golfer loves you

1291
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,199
So long as you don't tell him to go jump in a lake

1292
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,271
God doesn't like water

1293
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,623
The idea the very idea that you'd be at a party

1294
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:55,999
My first instinct will be like today

1295
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:09,311
Is they want me out of here without me

1296
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
Yeah just f****** with me to get me to leave

1297
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:14,943
Hi I am now anytime I want I have not been to a party

1298
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,735
Such a long time Wild

1299
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,295
The next party I go to Interlake

1300
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,319
Hey dude we're about to wear

1301
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:25,439
Make your decision

1302
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
He also has

1303
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,255
Stories about

1304
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:29,023
Like

1305
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
You're just making this up

1306
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
About to bring

1307
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:39,007
You just making s*** up about weird Hollywood Park have you been to misrepresenting

1308
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,823
I think the latter is probably

1309
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,359
Anyway

1310
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
But you were having tomorrow

1311
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:48,223
Biggest reality TV show

1312
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,503
Companies in the world

1313
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:54,111
Numbers of Motley Crue

1314
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,903
Probably Tommy Lee

1315
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:56,927
I guess

1316
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,047
Nikki Sixx

1317
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
I like the devil

1318
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
Worship devil

1319
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,239
Lucifer God

1320
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
And

1321
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
If you'll just

1322
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,103
You are supposed to give you the shot

1323
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,879
Worship the devil

1324
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Good for you

1325
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:39,423
Really talk about

1326
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,287
I got bad news

1327
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:45,823
You do not break thing

1328
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
Inform

1329
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:55,551
30 seconds

1330
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,927
Distract

1331
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
You're making money

1332
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,327
Anyway I just kept this next clip it because you were

1333
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,375
It's true

1334
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
I know

1335
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:14,751
But let's let's just Workshop all right

1336
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:17,823
I don't know if we do that I just need to figure out

1337
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,359
What is your leading

1338
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,663
We're going to worship the devil

1339
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,943
So

1340
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,039
In this show Tommy Lee is going to pretend to go back to college

1341
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,831
Okay

1342
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,903
I am Mark Dice

1343
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:35,231
That's actually, I am actually in

1344
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:39,839
Into Satan that's to Dynamic avoid

1345
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,375
This is

1346
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Nitpicking

1347
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,959
But the owner of the company

1348
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:46,751
The biggest reality show company

1349
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
Talking to Mark Dice

1350
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,871
Also is the producer of the show it's

1351
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
Seems unlikely that that would be the thing

1352
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,711
You got to get your hands dirty

1353
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:59,039
Reality production

1354
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,879
Shane Company in the world to not get involved

1355
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,439
Just took years later f*** with Mark Dice

1356
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:10,047
Baby funny let's start a reality show company

1357
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:15,679
Has got to go we got to have a reality show called

1358
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,543
I'm up for worship

1359
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,591
Devil baby greatest like

1360
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,871
Alex had a story like

1361
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,919
For all of his employees

1362
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,247
Owen Shroyer was 10

1363
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,295
Jerome corsi

1364
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:36,159
He's working in DC who wrote this long article about how Joe Biden

1365
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
Came up to him one night

1366
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Listen

1367
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:39,743
I think it's important

1368
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,047
On ourselves

1369
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,375
Competition

1370
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,703
Is only

1371
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,239
Oh my God

1372
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,543
Also fun fact about Jerome corsi

1373
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,847
If they're already

1374
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:58,943
Article

1375
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
Keep referencing

1376
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,551
I searched infowars.com

1377
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,319
Jerome corsi

1378
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,879
You came up was an article from

1379
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
2011

1380
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
And

1381
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,743
In it

1382
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,279
Jerome corsi was making the argument

1383
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,815
That Donald Trump

1384
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,863
I was working with Obama

1385
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,423
The entire birther thing was a setup

1386
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,727
And Donald Trump was making a big

1387
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,519
You out of it just Obamacare

1388
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,591
Come out with and destroy the entire narrative

1389
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,871
When the truth is

1390
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
Calculator

1391
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,687
There's a fake birth

1392
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,015
So Donald Trump with eonon it as a setup

1393
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:38,623
Okay if I understand

1394
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
This correct

1395
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
Right

1396
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
Trump

1397
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,511
New Obama

1398
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,047
Has a fake birth certificate

1399
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,607
Yeah

1400
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
Get to talk

1401
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:53,215
And Obama's like here's the only way that I'm going to get away with

1402
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,519
Cover

1403
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,335
Noted lunatic Donald Trump

1404
01:15:58,591 --> 01:15:59,359
2

1405
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
Pretend

1406
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,663
That you were racist

1407
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
We both know camp

1408
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,527
And

1409
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
Claimed it my birthday

1410
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,575
Certificate is in Rio

1411
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
That way

1412
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,135
Can go on TV

1413
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
Say that it is

1414
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,743
Yep and no one will believe you Donald

1415
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,815
That's basically what is arguing

1416
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,887
History

1417
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,447
Be friends with Trump for like the last 40 years

1418
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:26,495
Which seems to fly in the face

1419
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,847
Superman

1420
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
Just remote

1421
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,175
Purely objective

1422
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Writing

1423
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,783
I-85

1424
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:43,391
Spell no bells and whistles

1425
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,743
Except

1426
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,071
I kept this clipping just because he does my favorite voice

1427
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,607
Short clip

1428
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,143
Voice

1429
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,751
Joya Tricia's come on back on your sleep

1430
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,543
You're going to like it

1431
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,847
You're gonna float too

1432
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:10,015
Evergreen

1433
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:31,007
The voice is J&R bad the voice that I like it your arm in his drainage clowns.

1434
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:40,479
I was walking by super great the other day

1435
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:46,879
Who is the executive of the largest production company that I like

1436
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,903
Good I was reference

1437
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,671
Sing is the

1438
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:52,511
I just like that

1439
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:56,095
Little bit

1440
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
Maybe

1441
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
Slightly uncomfortable

1442
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,239
Maybe not I don't know Billy Weaver comes on

1443
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,263
One of the reasons

1444
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,031
She comes on

1445
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,823
Is that

1446
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,127
AC phrases it is

1447
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Exploit

1448
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:13,759
Sexually assaulted when Cheyenne

1449
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,575
Before she came to Infowars

1450
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,343
Well then I believe

1451
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:20,159
Sure they talked about it a little bit

1452
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:23,231
And you know I don't want to get into

1453
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:25,535
Because I generally don't like her work

1454
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:27,583
And I don't want to

1455
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,375
Negative

1456
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,143
About that

1457
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,959
Site support

1458
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,311
She has an interesting

1459
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,335
Take on

1460
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,431
In Hollywood

1461
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,735
Came out and

1462
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,015
She was sexually

1463
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:47,807
Which she worked at

1464
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
She wouldn't work there

1465
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
Contributor

1466
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,927
She went to the office

1467
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,719
Imagine the moment

1468
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,767
If she comes out

1469
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
SSO

1470
01:18:58,047 --> 01:18:58,815
I

1471
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,095
Believe her and

1472
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:00,863
I think that

1473
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,423
But

1474
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
Terrific person

1475
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
Here I have 3 clips

1476
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,799
Aware

1477
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,823
She lays out

1478
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
A very clumpy

1479
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,359
Solution

1480
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,407
The abuse

1481
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
In Hollywood

1482
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,711
And I don't like

1483
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
I don't like it at all

1484
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,415
Abusive

1485
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:30,815
Masculinity

1486
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,631
Predatory

1487
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:44,127
Do you know okay and try to try to

1488
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,623
We're going to take these women

1489
01:19:54,879 --> 01:20:01,023
We're going to fight predatory discuss

1490
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,143
Problem is

1491
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Bet

1492
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
Men aren't

1493
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:12,287
For women and forcing them to against a silent in the back

1494
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,848
Elements of that

1495
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,688
I really want to pull out of

1496
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,968
Specifically is that Alex

1497
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
One of his

1498
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
Immediate

1499
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:25,600
You know what you're getting into in Hollywood

1500
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,160
So whenever she's talking about the real name

1501
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
Blame the wind

1502
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,488
She's not talking about Alex Jones

1503
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:37,120
I wasn't sitting right there he is all that stuff

1504
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:38,144
Yes

1505
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,520
Let me play the next clip

1506
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,568
She sort of

1507
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:49,920
She's not doing a good job

1508
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,456
Speaking English

1509
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,016
There's a point

1510
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
Embarrassed

1511
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
Reasonable

1512
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,856
There are not

1513
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
Falls by the wayside

1514
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,416
You know what she did

1515
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Combined

1516
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:03,232
Not all men

1517
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,512
With

1518
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,328
A good point which is that

1519
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
It Is by

1520
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
A lot of Silence

1521
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,192
Complicity yep that

1522
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,240
Powerful men get away with this

1523
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,520
It's a system

1524
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,312
Yeah but she then

1525
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,080
Is falling back on it

1526
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,360
Just a couple of bad eggs

1527
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,640
Uriah

1528
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,408
But

1529
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,432
Hashtag.

1530
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Like I said

1531
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,320
Hi Siri iterate

1532
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:36,256

So

1537
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,440

1538
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328

01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,472
Difficult to rely on

1542
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,520
Seeing as how men in their lives

1543
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,848
Have so often proved themselves to be unreliable

1544
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,920
Interesting take

1545
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
Perspective

1552
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,424

1553
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,752
Chemicals in the water to try and lower sperm count but

1554
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:56,896
Talk about his grandpa Apparently one of their neighbors kept beating his wife

1555
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
Okay

1556
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,712
Demand

1557
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:06,112

Our friends

1559
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,912
Put your hand on this woman

1560
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,192
We will

1561
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:30,176
The women stop complaining

1562
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:39,392
The guys beating with the women

1563
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,256
So

1564
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,584
Okay Auto World

1565
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,656
Did you understand that

1566
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,704
Both men are acting

1567
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,776
Are violent and that is

1568
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:56,800
An issue

1569
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,360
What do negatives make a positive

1570
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,920
I think if you multiply them but

1571
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,456
That's not how

1572
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,552
Situations like this generally and in the

1573
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
Battered wife

1574
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,648
Yeah

1575
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,696
It doesn't usually work that like

1576
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:17,280
Physically abusive

1577
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:19,072
Beat up by other men

1578
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:25,472
That doesn't work it doesn't happen like that

1579
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:30,080
There is violence work the first time and then I got violence.

1580
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:30,848
Wait

1581
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,664
Quite frankly like what Cheese's

1582
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:34,688
Could get someone

1583
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,576

1584
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,112
Almost all of them

1585
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
Yeah

1586
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,928
That is so

1587
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,768
Is it reveals

1588
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:50,816
Exactly the issue again

1589
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:51,584
Which is

1590
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,888
Even said it

1591
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,168
The women

1592
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:01,312
The guy complaining

1593
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,896
Complain a lot

1594
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,712
Which means that the man once again did not believe them

1595
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,736
And she got beat

1596
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:12,832

Big Top

01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:18,208
Maybe they got retaliated

1600
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,512
