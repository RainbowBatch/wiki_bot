1
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,736
Dot-com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
Pray

3
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,824
Quick question for you

4
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,224
My bright spot is that sweet Cantina theme remix of our theme song that just played by

5
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:26,016
Celebrate

6
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,552
Crushing the game

7
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,576
With ease

8
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,624
Remixes

9
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,280
There's definitely the theme song of our trip to Austin and being able to I have that incorporated into

10
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,560
The podcast for us

11
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,400
Special

12
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
We're two lucky

13
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,288
Talented photo

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,336
Or willing to create

15
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
Thanks I appreciate it

16
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
I would say my brights

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,088
Spots well might as well we were on the televisual box

18
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,976
Television debut

19
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,024
The demon stelter

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
Was here we weren't in the same studio so we can smell them through the camera but so far already there

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,240
You know we can't confirm sulfur or not

22
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
Yeah I agree we also

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,360
Yeah we were in a studio we were staring at like

24
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
A black wall

25
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
We didn't see him

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Even at school

27
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
Which was a little unnerving

28
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Is this

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Concerta

30
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,904
It's faces that he made

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
Producer Michael

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
Just making mocking faces

33
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,656
Jordan I mean we were on with stelter

34
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
It's all right there's a couple of things I want to point out

35
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,080
Question was whether or not we got to ask him about his hatred

36
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,872
Or Alex hatred of him

37
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
And

38
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:00,736
We didn't on-air although he did say we could ask him that

39
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,648
Alexace

40
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
So that part week

41
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Can confirm

42
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,072
I meant the second thing I wanted to bring up Visa V that interview is

43
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
Are star parents have different response

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,944
I got a text from my dad that was about how proud he was and how I was the first family member to

45
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
To make it on the national news

46
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
I would imagine there had to have been some kind of coverage of my brothers ice cream shop

47
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
In the day you know

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
But I know that there was a ton of

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,864
Serve local and Regional stuff

50
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,680
Like a national Spotlight but there was

51
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
But certainly no Seltzer baby

52
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:01,408
Ya-ya-ya people's my my cousin

53
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
Who consumes a lot of right-wing news

54
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Was the first person to text

55
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
And then you go on the Clinton News Network know he was like you did a great job

56
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
Some preaching today so they couldn't get to see it

57
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,423
You know and then

58
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
I sent him a picture and they were like congratulations

59
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,591
So the conversation went

60
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
And I won't fall asleep

61
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
Avalanche of appreciation

62
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,367
It's

63
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,391
No

64
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
With smooth as they say

65
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:52,607
It's it's been it's been a really interesting couple of weeks with the trial and stuff and

66
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,423
Just adding the surreality of

67
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,215
That is

68
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
It's almost hard to process

69
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
I don't know how I feel about having makeup

70
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Put on me

71
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
Thanks

72
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:12,063
I ate yeah it's it was all is all a lot but I appreciate them having this

73
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
I appreciate that they allowed us

74
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:15,903
2

75
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,719
Not play into like some of the

76
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,255
You know like

77
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:24,095
Hey why don't you do a talk talk about Alex's

78
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,679
Able to

79
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
Speak on the issue as we

80
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
I wanted to and I appreciate that that's something that's

81
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
You know

82
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
Maybe some people wouldn't

83
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
Media outlet with the offer

84
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,527
Yeah yeah yeah I think we're both actually very lucky that we're not in like

85
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Like this is the Behind the Music moment where it all starts to fall apart

86
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,695
100% in agreement like

87
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
We're going to say exactly what needs saying ghetto

88
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:59,935
I think I saw a little bit of feedback that it was a little bit of a shallow interview

89
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,639
You know like she is really dive too deep

90
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
You got to

91
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,711
Question

92
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,759
Move along and end so

93
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,039
Unfortunately it does

94
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
May not satisfy people

95
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
Sarah deconstruction of some of the

96
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
The podcast is for

97
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,511
Yeah it was it's a treat

98
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,559
And speaking of treats Jordan

99
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,655
We had Ferrari episode today we are thrilled

100
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,727
To be joined once again by Mark Bank

101
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,263
Paxton Bill Ogden

102
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
I think I think marks in our little

103
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,807
Everybody on on this but

104
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
We always really

105
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,231
I feel like it's kind of condescending to say an otter but it was

106
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,047
Meaningful

107
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,607
I'll be always be very

108
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,703
Thrilled to have been able to be whatever small part of

109
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,543
They said it wasn't I I appreciate them so much for allowing us

110
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
Do you have

111
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:12,127
Inside track on some stuff

112
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Send their generosity with

113
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,431
The Listener is

114
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,783
And it's just so wonderful

115
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
I'm glad that we are able to

116
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Have this sort of button

117
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
A little bit

118
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,927
Although maybe it's a button the last

119
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
All of sneaky

120
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,071
Wrapping up some of this this sort of

121
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Chapter

122
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Is very nice and being able to

123
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
I have have a conversation with them to do that

124
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
I think everyone will enjoy

125
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
I think it's great

126
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
So we can belabor this longer it just

127
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,407
Chat about nothing but

128
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
I'll be honest

129
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,455
It's late

130
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,735
I got to get this episode

131
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:52,575
Don't

132
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,159
No

133
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,535
Never

134
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,375
Don't care

135
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,007
Who knows we might be sneaky as hell this week

136
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
It's Nico

137
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Anyway enjoy the interview

138
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,807
Hey ladies and gentlemen we are back and here in

00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,343
In in Chicago

140
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,623
As is

141
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
Is this the norm

142
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,719
A bit of a chat

143
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Decompression session

144
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,583
But you can press that if you like

145
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,375
Was it good

146
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,031
Listeners will know we were in Austin recently

147
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,895
Trial and a couple of people out there

148
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
Just two dudes

149
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,223
We would they were wandering the streets

150
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,343
They were wearing nice suits and we were like I can't believe that these these two people are not being take

151
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,647
Taken care of

152
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,975
I can't believe

153
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
Share wisdom

154
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
Security detail 10-strong

155
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
0.

156
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
Disguise security

157
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Lewisberry we're actually running

158
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
No I did

159
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,927
We figured this week

160
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
Is snake week

161
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
We have honorary call

162
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,303
Squeak

163
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,167
And what better way to begin

164
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Sneak week

165
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:49,567
I went to have a little bit of a trial

166
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,663
I guess you better join us then

167
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
Mark Bankston

168
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,551
Plaintiffs attorneys for Scarlett Lewis

169
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Thank you for doing

170
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,623
What's up

171
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,975
How are you going for the walks

172
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
Certainly become favorites

173
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
Of the community absolutely

174
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
So

175
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Doors at the

176
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
This is the office of the only interview I'm doing

177
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,479
No other press

178
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,271
I said I'll do this one and that's it

179
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
No joke though this is

180
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
Since I walked off

181
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
The courthouse grounds

182
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,999
Playing first time I've spoken to any sort of public media

183
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,679
Why don't you drop the butler public media now

184
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
Glitches

185
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
I mentioned this morning

186
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,223
This morning as recording is I we were on

187
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,527
Reliable sources with Brian stelter

188
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,551
And I was just

189
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,855
Cuss swear

190
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,439
It was so hard for me to like

191
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
I didn't scream one time

192
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,791
What time does

193
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
The reason I'm here actually is because I knew if I went on CNN the mood I'm in

194
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
What's my email

195
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,383
What's bringing that swearing to mind what to wear where y'all heads at

196
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
We just got

197
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
I don't know

198
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,015
I was

199
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
I don't know why but this

200
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,087
Trial

201
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:38,623
Took more out of me

202
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,767
Like emotionally and just exhausted I guess why because everyday was something

203
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Holyshit

204
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Oh good now

205
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
I think that

206
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,727
We wanted a little bit of

207
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,751
Difference when it comes

208
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
The numbers breakdown but

209
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
We're extremely happy with where it's at and

210
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
And I think the message

211
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
That

212
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,175
The client wanted to send

213
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:02,943
Weston

214
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,735
Pretty damn clear and loud so

215
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,783
I'm super happy now

216
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,063
But definitely

217
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,087
Exhaling

218
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
And taking a deep breath and just kind of relaxing a little bit

219
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:16,511
This point I'm not wasn't jumping on a private jet to go to Waco to New York City to do interviews

220
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Good point that you bring up

221
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,423
The numbers and

222
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
I think a lot of times the

223
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
The reporting on this misses you know there's a lot of

224
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,335
Flashy numbers and millions and stuff

225
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:33,151
And the context of it as the message

226
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
CMP

227
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,199
The actual intent

228
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Of the plaintiff

229
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
It's kind of lost in the shuffle a little

230
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,903
I mean two in the in the complications of

231
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
How does a

232
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Actually plays out

233
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,255
It's it's

234
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Not exactly sure

235
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,775
Caps are they

236
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,079
Then what people have to remember

237
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
Yeah

238
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
You know

239
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
50 Burke Lane

240
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
And then you got to to finish per claim

241
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,023
So-so is the capital

242
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:27,935
Pink Floyd Pulse the 1.5

243
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
A million in interest on the 4th

244
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:40,991
Right right

245
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,783
Birthing appointment

246
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Bitcoin

247
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,135
But here's the thing about that is that

248
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,463
Because they put themselves in bankruptcy

249
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,535
And that means that the potential appeal

250
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,583
What you going to be doing

251
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,167
How Beckett

252
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
Potential to have that

253
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
Not applicable

254
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,759
Is Gibbs enough value

255
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
That's really interesting

256
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,703
Judgment

257
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,239
If you know jokes

258
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
Constitutionality Thompson

259
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,335
The Sacketts the day

260
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,127
The sad part is that's not going to happen

261
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:45,503
Value

262
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,831
You got Maddie coming in with his

263
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:54,207
What is a 9 plan if you got two more dead with Osmond Delarosa

264
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,423
Griffith

265
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,471
Serfontein

266
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,495
Misidentification

267
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
Right2know

268
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
I mean that's what it like

269
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,903
You for somebody who claims to not want to court

270
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,023
Attention and media is dropping these bombs that just

271
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
I'm going to throw pipe bombs from

272
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,543
Top of this roof

273
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
Kill

274
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,063
Yourself

00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,367
Story

276
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
Probably

277
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
5 years ago

278
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
Maybe six years ago Mark try to case

279
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
Call

280
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Harold Adams

281
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,791
And he tried it

282
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
And with his dad

283
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,399
And they got screwed

284
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
And

285
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,959
He got done with that case in Hebrew

286
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
She's like I don't

287
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
I've never tried another

288
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,055
This isn't for me

289
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
This is my

290
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,175
And I think this is the first time he was in a courtroom since then Llamar

291
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,015
Oh no I got a couple cents

292
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,343
Yeah that you want to meet

293
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,903
But yeah there's been a couple of been like okay.

294
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,231
And then you start participating in some of these

295
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:36,095
Before you guys get out

296
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:41,727
If you got a little good feedback and then you're ready

297
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,103
You spend your life second sharing trials by giving your young plants while you're in

298
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
This this

299
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,999
Yeah

300
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
That's interesting.

301
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,167
Wiethop

302
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Is it Direction like

303
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,519
I thought I was good at this was going to be good

304
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Cuz now I

305
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
The most famous lawyer moment of the last

306
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,735
Decade

307
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,527
Absolutely

308
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
On television

309
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,879
Saw that it was just

310
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,647
Rock everywhere

311
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
The new if

312
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
The glub glub.

313
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:37,023
It really is

314
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
And I for you like

315
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,399
Such a question

316
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Because because Mark

317
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
Slapped

318
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,431
Retinol and the Jet bus marking the judges type right now so many times

319
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,223
I really feel like at the end he was like

320
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
I just don't even want to stand up

321
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
I'm not going to feel good about what

322
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Concierge

323
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
What's 1

324
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:10,815
We shouldn't have absolutely understand the Plainfield he thought he was going to come in here and figure

325
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Address is good press

326
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,215
Guys named right now

327
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,311
Lawyer and

328
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Was Not only was it

329
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,663
Pitch Perfect like

330
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
In America

331
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,039
Sputtering cost

332
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
But the fact the moment itself

333
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
Focus so intently on opposing counsel

334
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
But even though

335
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,279
A person

336
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,631
Play does the dramatic painter pants down the rain all are sitting there just soaking

337
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,471
Right now

338
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
I tell you I saw I saw

339
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:56,383
Open Cloud on The Daily Show tonight after I did it and I was I was obviously on the list I was like

340
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:01,247
For a second I almost done cuz I know all of his friends

341
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:05,343
I mean

342
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
He inherited

343
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,767
Indicates that was s*** already

344
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,303
There's nothing to do about it and I

345
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
She probably took

346
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:15,839
That case without

347
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Appreciating where the case was

348
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,191
And in chess

349
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,727
After Bob

350
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,519
Dropped on him in

351
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
I do I kind of feel bad

352
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
Because I think in 5 years

353
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:31,711
And I'd like a

354
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:38,367
With the

355
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
Is that what you're

356
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
I I just I

357
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,207
It's rare that

358
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,999
Something like that happens especially on such

359
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:46,047
Such a big stage

360
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,471
Rare Plus

361
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:06,527
I came home and I have a kind of rough around the edges cousin who I would not expect

362
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,599
And he came right up to me and he was like what

363
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,695
Man

364
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,279
Is it me in the Pepsi challenge

365
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:26,495
And I did I'll tell you I felt bad for a moment but I need

366
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,311
A story that that

367
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,103
School

368
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
But

369
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:36,223
The first time I met renewal back in March when he was coming into December

370
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,903
Outside on the steps out from Courthouse

371
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:48,255
And he even tried to do some sort of psycho psyop stuff you know mess

372
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,351
Tell me something along the lines of

373
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,447
But you never get mad I'm off this case of your clients are Never Getting It.

374
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,151
And then that s*** just collapses on itself

375
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:11,551
Everything goes south hands up Owens have any kind of a million-dollar zensation Petit pays in the middle of truck

376
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,367
They actually had me. Checking and get that'll never

377
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:16,416
And now he is up

378
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
It's just dessert

379
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,048
If you were coming to send it like with

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,608
That's one thing

381
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,192
But if you come in and just meet bagman for Alex Jones proto-fascist

382
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
Whatever

383
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Right now

384
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:36,896
Oh my God

385
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
Do the show cause hearing for discipline all of that

386
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:42,272
Complaints against them

387
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
Rodger stone is begging him to sue him

388
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
Staying

389
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:53,280
Is Eric Holder

390
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:56,608
And somehow weasels live in the jungle

391
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:09,152
Defamation claim against Rodger Stone

392
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,504
But it's all this is going until you

393
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,576
Kman

394
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:21,440
We had this verdict and then I know what's about to happen

395
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
Is he is going down the tubes

396
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
What is

397
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Is this

398
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,168
Doubt

399
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Exit of Jones

400
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,544
Is going to take a considerable amount of time and

401
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,616
You're going to have fun today

402
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
For the next year that is

403
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Finally.

404
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,112
Yeah yeah

405
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,928
Think I think one of the things that's really important

406
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
About that is that

407
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
It happens

408
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
Probably because it'll be a little bit

409
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Protracted there will be

410
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
So many opportunities for the

411
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,400
Inside of the saucer

412
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
To be understood

413
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
Ray middle bit more by the public

414
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
Like what could be

415
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
Incredibly helpful in

416
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
Teaching people about

417
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
These sorts of actors

418
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:12,896
And how they operate

419
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
So you can

420
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Understand other

421
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
People like

422
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
And avoid

423
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,528
Falling for the same trick

424
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,552
Another

425
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,136
Western cottonmouth

426
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:29,536
Want to come talk to you when they can do some educating and if you think I'm on your podcast

427
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,984
Lake-Link

428
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:45,152
I was like absolutely not

429
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
Was something about his Tennessee draw

430
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Something about

431
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,040
Foster the tenor of the whole damn case

432
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
About Jonah

433
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
What does a sup on the witness stand

434
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,232
Yeah she say that

435
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
And that is when West did that

436
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
She

437
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Just landed

438
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,168
That was everything that he had the most

439
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
He had practice

440
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,496
Tom's with this night before

441
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,520
And it was it was

442
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,568
That was

443
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Weird because

444
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Grass was like

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,432
Kyle cross

446
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
What I came here for

447
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,320
Mark

448
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
Introduces the term Perry Mason

449
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Listen to the world

450
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,744
Dairy Queen

451
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Scarlet

452
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,328
Christian Dennis

453
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,608
In my opinion demos

454
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,400
Powerful moment

455
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Machine

456
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,704
Doug Henning

457
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,984
What's right Alex

458
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Chew him

459
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
It wasn't

460
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Ejection

461
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,872
But there was

462
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,944
So no questions being asked she was just talkin

463
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
What's Raynaud's

464
00:24:55,808 --> 00:25:01,440
Monologue

465
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,768
Because your attorney didn't look Jatt

466
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Choice

467
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,632
So we get that and then

468
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Here Comes

469
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
He was the only one of us that

470
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Without crying

471
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,080
Dad

472
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Me and Kyle

473
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,920
I can't do it Mark was going to do it and that's a

474
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Like mid-trial marks

475
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:29,088
So Westside that's we didn't get

476
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Huestis

477
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
You know

478
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Everybody's got their own style

479
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Definitely the most

480
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,744
Kind of cavalier

481
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,024
Style and

482
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,328
It's just a different type

483
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Uptown

484
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Until

485
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,680
He didn't get to show that and then all the sudden he

486
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,240
The closing and chest

487
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
I mean

488
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Laid it all out there and it was it was

489
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:49,824
Dallas

490
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,104
Buy For Less close

491
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
A little bit unfortunate that it's

492
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,248
Denotes overshadowed by the Perry Mason

493
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
You know that like

494
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,880
Almost

495
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,440
Shadow using say because

496
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,280
We're not talking about the fact that for the first time ever we played

497
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Clip

498
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
Of the defendant calling the judge a pedophile

499
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:17,216
I forgot about that

500
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:21,312
Play we played a video of the defendant

501
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,104
Calling the jury bunch

502
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
Blue-collar simpletons

503
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,432
In the middle of trial

504
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Astros

505
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Things are insane and they're not

506
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Yes

507
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,744
Call Linda Neel on the Spectrum

508
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,768
Show me show me

509
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Huge moments

510
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,608
Happening in this trial

511
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
But most

512
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,936
I mean obviously the Perry Mason one because

513
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,496
Nice try on the Perry Mason

514
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Oh you have

515
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
No idea what I'm saying

516
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:58,176
I was going to ask you guys how do you feel cuz I feel like

517
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:01,760
Ultimately the jury did an amazing job

518
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Because of the amount of

519
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
Bulshit that is barrage that that

520
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,624
In such a short.

521
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,392
Give time

522
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,440
That their ability to kind of like

523
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:10,720
At least

524
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
Processes

525
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Into where when

526
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:18,656
I feel like it's kind of almost amazing anyway did you guys feel that similarly what are there really UFOs

527
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:23,008
Right in that jury was a broad mix of different backgrounds

528
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,896
None of this b******* stuck a second they were on it from Square

529
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,480
And there was basically a conjurer who was who was a little

530
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
Dino hesitant about certain of the ideas of

531
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,952
I don't know free Express you're not necessarily

532
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,280
Compensate

533
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
Stop so adorable

534
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,848
Once we're able to talk to him they gave us

535
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,616
Feedback

536
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
And if we didn't really didn't know like you say

537
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,832
You know my brother actually told me about the see what you sent

538
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
This trial it's like

539
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:15,232
It's like trying to get your mom to start watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe

540
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,304
Why is Harry Style showing up

541
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,656
Steve pieczenik

542
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,336
Hell don't want to miss the post-credits

543
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,664
Time everyday when she left

544
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,600
Yeah he was

545
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:42,624
Stepped in

546
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,416
The song I believe I was

547
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,464
One publication

548
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,488
Describe me as

549
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:48,512
Like one of those large

550
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:55,168
Or you know Kimmy something that larger

551
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:55,936
You sound like a

552
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:03,104
I don't think you saved his life but I do think you might have saved his license

553
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,712
Because there's no really did go after I have no doubt markers and going to be like

554
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Can I get the cops

555
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:13,088
Nearby like I don't think that.

556
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
Around is because as the

557
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:16,672
They both started

558
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
Mark's wheel will you talk

559
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,744
Talk to me in

560
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
The cameras

561
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
So funny

562
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
You were in jury selection you didn't know where that

563
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,424
Bratz

564
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
Seminal moment

565
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
Is that

566
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
Immediately preceding that I'd basic

567
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
We managed to have a large walk 2016

568
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
Doesn't know his way around to the wall

569
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Poster board

570
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:49,440
Videos

571
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,352
Like seriously up in my face

572
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
School.

573
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
And am I grabbing like

574
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:04,032
Kind of diffusion

575
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:07,360
So what I say is

576
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,200
It looks on the camera like I'm being super super reasonable

577
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,248
Hey Federico will you talk to me

578
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,368
We know is that this dude started

579
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
General admission

580
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
Miss Miss Rodriguez whoever was right

581
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
We talk to me

582
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,584
Thing's weird

583
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Journal 3

584
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:41,152
Jurors in the goddamn awkward

585
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Third row

586
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
Who's out there by said that ostensibly like I'm being a peacemaker

587
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
It will

588
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,328
North Carolina little

589
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:08,544
I have stopped paying attention

590
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,272
No and I

591
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
I'm watching it

592
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
And then I see just

593
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,368
Camera starting to Folk

594
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,976
We got to get this

595
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
See you like 10

596
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:32,864
Different journalist

597
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Yeah exactly

598
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,424
I'll just boring myself

599
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
The camera

600
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
Dubai

601
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
Yeah whatever

602
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,664
Who's going to end in so I was like

603
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,992
Yeah there's a great picture that I saw of like

604
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,552
The two of you I buy mark

605
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
Did reynal and Billiard looking on like

606
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,464
Buff out here we go

607
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,864
Please know the cameras are on please don't say anything bad.

608
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,656
Not least of which because that

609
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,680
Wasn't like

610
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,984
The middle of the trial

611
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,264
That was Dave

612
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,848
A f****** 101

613
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Right on

614
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
GetGo

615
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:25,344
Everyday and you have to understand

616
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
And I see you also

617
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:36,352
You also had to wait a couple more days before we leave

618
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
As it were

619
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,472
The clock to run out

620
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
I said this on

621
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,032
On Twitter but it mean it is

622
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:47,104
It is something that kind of it is hard to wrap my mind around

623
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
If the defense had made

624
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
No defense

625
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,224
Those text messages wouldn't have been allowed.

626
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,296
In a week

627
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:00,416
Doing this and not

628
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
That would be even after

629
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,256
If after the trial you wouldn't have been able to use them

630
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,096
Overwrite but you would have had that loaded

631
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:10,912
Exactly and I could have never trap Jones into

632
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,704
CC

633
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
Is lie on what

634
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
Text messages

635
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
Made that choice

636
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,968
That day I was I was free and clear I have

637
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,016
And I had Jones under subpoena

638
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
And I could have put them on the stand

639
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,112
Didn't I read

640
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:36,768
I knew they were going to call Joseph.

641
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
Devastated

642
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
Basically

643
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Yeah

644
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
Boy

645
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
You were sitting there in.

646
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,056
You are a lawyer with all that rain down on

647
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
I noticed

648
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Even during

649
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,944
The closing arguments

650
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,504
When Kyle was presenting his closing argument

651
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,296
Rain always on his laptop

652
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
And I can see just enough

653
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136
Screen to see the Giant

654
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:38,208
Logo on the bottom of an email

655
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,840
Communicate with

656
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,680
Call Scott lawyer Medical

657
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:55,104
I think it was circumstance like that it's time to tear lyrics

658
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,456
You know Snickers isn't going to cut it

659
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,064
You need something you could just all

660
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:07,136
Stop.

661
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,160
Call Fred

662
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,744
This is what everybody seeing on Mike Scioscia right now I guess

663
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
But the

664
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Rumbling

665
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
Eggs that were half

666
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Throughout the development of the questioning like

667
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
No remember you had

668
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
The depo and I asked

669
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
You said you pulled it down into

670
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,472
The search bar

671
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,384
His mouth is still talking

672
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,968
Amanda

673
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Off drops

674
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:36,320
He has multiple cell phones with that number I

675
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,856
Oh my God

676
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,416
Pasta on the spot

677
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,488
Is it there's a picture of a doting on Marcus

678
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Is exact

679
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:49,120
What I thought it was this is so much better than what I thought

680
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Nobody even with this outcome the clients like

681
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:58,080
Nothing could have happened in the trial of fighting the outcome happened

682
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,456
Broccoli

683
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:11,648
A right to talk a little bit more about that we're supposed to get

684
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:20,096
Yeah it was an absolute

685
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,448
Everything I've ever wanted

686
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
It does come down to such a dramatic

687
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:30,592
Jumps in the courtroom

688
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
Where things are going they know the other case

689
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,880
Just makes them feel like they just put a battering ram to

690
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
Fortress and it's all crumbling down MI

691
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Now

692
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,744
When I say in some ways

693
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
It was like they were

694
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,304
In the sunshine

695
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,168
Constantly thinking about

696
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
He likes

697
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
About

698
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
What's Scarlet

699
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
Is that

700
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
Check your child

701
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,480
And she was like

702
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,504
I couldn't be there

703
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,368
When he died it became my job.

704
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:16,672
That was my job now

705
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
And that's what I've made my whole life

706
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,792
And that's what I'm trying to do with the movement to counteract this stuff

707
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:28,448
Can't you feel like every time you see this jumped-up everytime you have these people contact you every time

708
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,776
You feel like you're failing your child again and again and again

709
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,056
And she's like it's over now

710
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,640
Did the only the absolute most crazy people

711
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,992
Everything has become toxic and not induced gun

712
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
And then see them

713
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
So happy

714
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
Oh my God

715
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
There is a small part of me that

716
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:51,744
But maybe I'm just such a pessimist that I worry a little bit about people

717
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Being readable

718
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:53,536
Spy

719
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,304
The consequence

720
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
They come to Alex you know like

721
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,912
It'd be a being a galvanizing thing

722
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Folks

723
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Harassing more

724
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,240
I hope that's not the case

725
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,800
I don't think that will be based on

726
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
You reacted

727
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,896
Intuit all which was I you know I do believe the parents and Aiden

728
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
You know he he

729
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
Is is

730
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Half-assed

731
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,504
Apologies is he's made

732
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,040
He did

733
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
To some extent at least on the stand

734
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,904
Hundred percent counter repudiate

735
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
Dumb stuff

736
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
She's been saying

737
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,840
He was saying that he wanted to have Scarlet on and that he supports

738
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,864
Beautiful woman

739
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:35,264
Windows before the trinity

740
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
I wish more people that talk

741
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Talked about it's like

742
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,360
That idea of Alex

743
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,152
Inviting them on their show on

744
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,944
His show is so disgust

745
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:45,760
The idea of having them on

746
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Staying

747
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
I guess borderline

748
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,624
Things and then I'm almost going to

749
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Assumed that he would be like

750
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
And also you know I'm

751
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,720
I'm right to

752
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Question this whole thing

753
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Things sooner or later

754
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Like that

755
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:01,376
Disgust me on a level I can't even

756
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,912
Comprehend what I say

757
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,680
Think about

758
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
I will say this though

759
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,752
Scarlett's reaction to that

760
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:07,520
Was

761
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
It will get to just one

762
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,616
Person to support

763
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
The movement

764
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
Further

765
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
I meant

766
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736

And they do it in different ways but

769
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,136
But

770
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
You know involved

771
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
In the

772
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
The Choose Love movement is

773
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Impressive when you look at what her story

774
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:40,032
Job everything about her is impressive might be in a better position to make this

775
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,080
Council but I would advise her not

776
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:45,920
To go

777
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,856
Jonesville Jones is a Madman so whenever

778
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Expect

779
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
What I did not expect this

780
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:05,632
I work at your trauma

781
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,960
We are supposed to do that Miss Louis

782
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,480
Oh no he didn't

783
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,576
Maybe I like you just did the whole thing and it's free

784
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,392
You say that we looked at each other like

785
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:31,744
Easter

786
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,584
Is that like its first they came for the Socialists

787
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
Alex hate communist

788
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
He would come get with it

789
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
Alameda

790
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336

Appleminte

792
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Cast

793
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,736
Neon scarlet and their lawyers

794
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,672
The first extermination of the jurors

795
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,304
Probably it's probably more

796
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
Poorly thought-through then

797
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
Like intentionally

798
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,424
Getting that across

799
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,984
That was the

800
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
That cuz you could

801
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,288
That poem

802
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,080
Miss much more applicable to a

803
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
A criminal trial

804
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
Sure sure

805
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
Computers are

806
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
He's coming forward people for this that and the other

807
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
HughesNet

808
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
A few other times

809
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:33,184
And interest

810
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,792
But yeah that was interesting

811
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
Quote specially with Joneses

812
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,168
Especially for me to play more Jacobs

813
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
6 Depo

814
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:48,032
Albany

815
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:49,824
The one that

816
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,104
Greeley by Mae

817
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,151
Caught my breath cuz I was in the court that day

818
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,431
But when he decided

819
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,455
To cross-examine

820
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:58,271
Both meal and Scarlett

821
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
I was like there's no way

822
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
You can possibly think

823
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,623
This is a good legal

824
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:03,391
Strategy

825
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,279
Think about you defaming like that

826
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,351
Interesting strategy

827
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
We can't say everything you did was

828
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Who's bad

829
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:15,679
Because

830
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,215
He did hold

831
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
The compensatory

832
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
We do we work at

833
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
Try you you want to set

834
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
Yohai bar in

835
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,735
And work down

836
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
4.1

837
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,343
Significant less than what we would want

838
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
There

839
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
Made up for it on the

840
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:38,463
But walking out of of that I had to say like

841
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
As much as I hate the 808

842
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
How many mistakes

843
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,583
Prevented

844
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,167
He told me he

845
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,447
Anything he did

846
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,007
Metro Pizza

847
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,055
Conscious what the situation is or what

848
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:57,151
To send a message

849
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,295
To give these people to billion dollars

850
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
Sprite number

851
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,135
Another

852
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,207
That is another kind of point about that is that

853
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,791
What are the hard things that you guys one of the hard jobs I'm assuming you guys

854
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
His head was trying to impress

855
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
These people

856
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,143
That 150 million dollars

857
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:19,167
Is not

858
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
A huge amount of money

859
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,983
Do you know what I mean like

860
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,359
Twice that in a few makes calls to a million dollars everyday

861
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
He made twice that in a year

862
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
You don't

863
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
You put on a certain case

864
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,135
The trial based on the evidence that's really out there in front of you based on what

865
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,279
Businessman

866
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,423
Anything above that is just mess

867
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,263
Who's once you were starting to talk 10 million

868
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
You start that average those out

869
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:03,199
There's no

870
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Superbook

871
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,807
Hidden somewhere that it's not that that's not

872
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
A Rippling

873
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Effects of those wrecked

874
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,183
Judgment

875
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Impact

876
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,743
His business in ways that are

877
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
You do not judge

878
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,583
Just directly you have to pay this there other things

879
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,631
That will have those bows like

880
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
The ball rolling down the hill

881
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:26,495
Listen to music library.

882
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Billions

883
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,799
Going on an island in Barbados

884
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
Yes we got to go pick it up

885
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:32,127
If you have two little sisters

886
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,687
If you haven't left out there

887
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:39,551
The evidence is out there that can be used

888
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
Moron

889
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Economist

890
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,887
Evidences is real

891
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,703
Is that real

892
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,519
Ajayll

894
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,967
Brighten our opinion

895
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:12,319
Just for

896
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Does bankruptcy

897
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
Yes

898
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
If you

899
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
It should be on

900
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,215
That

901
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,383
We Believe based on our Accord

902
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:48,159
I don't understand under ocean said $2000000 will wipe us out

903
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,695
Astro

904
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:56,095
What's the other thing

905
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:59,167
Why I'm saying that that thing is also untrue

906
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,727
And there's a metal ware in there

907
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,591
Orbi

908
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,639
Eleni

909
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,919
These - 4

910
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,503
I can understand the Temptation by somebody like

911
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,319
The first part of the trial

912
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:22,207
941

913
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,535
What I can't believe is that they allowed it to happen. Jones

914
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
Testimony under oath about his financial condition

915
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
For a baker

916
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,983
Yeah that's reason why

917
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,567
Yeah it is definitely

918
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,151
That is if any of this if he was lying then he's in a lot of

919
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
Bestie

920
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695

00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,815
The amount of help

00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,631

Connecticut lawyers were helping us out as much as they could they were watching

935
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,111

00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
Suppose that

958
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
With Alex

959
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
And

960
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:08,959
Hit some of lawyer friend apparently who came to the courthouse

961
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,263
And I didn't know who Adam Lanza

962
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
So

963
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,567
He Had a Brain Trust

964
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,359
You know he had a lot of help

965
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,383
Right

966
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:19,455
Realtor

967
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,855
Was the old dude to the psychological Adventure

968
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,439
Say this

969
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
He

970
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,487
He didn't talk

971
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,583
Did the

972
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,863
Times that he spoke with

973
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Where to

974
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
1

975
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,191
When you got off the

976
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,239
Just and I waited in the hallway with him

977
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Jurors had their questions with submitting the question

978
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:48,383
And he was coming from the bathroom right before we got started

979
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,407
And he looked at me

980
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,223
Can I shake your client and I said yes

981
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,503
I'm so sorry for all of this

982
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,807
Mirai

983
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:02,975
Hey Liam, hat

984
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:09,119
Don't forget

985
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Open Waze

986
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
Mark

987
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Imrane all had

988
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Just got

989
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,175
Done with some sort of battle in front of the judge

990
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,711
And it didn't go their way

991
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
And I went to the back

992
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,015
Would you expect to me

993
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,551
And I just looked over

994
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
Alex back

995
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,367
Made it safe

996
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,439
Gladiators go out just like

997
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,327
You're not gladiators

998
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
There was nearby

999
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
Neal's ant

1000
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,799
Couple of Gladiators going at it

1001
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
There is not a gladiator

1002
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:58,015
Directions to Prost

1003
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,807
Yeah that's what this was

1004
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,879
Nissan directions

1005
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,231
Original compression out of the room

1006
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
About that

1007
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:16,447
You know Joe is still in the courtroom for a minute after.

1008
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
They're just running

1009
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
Text Tiffany

1010
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,175
But Joseph

1011
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:30,271
Any kind of standing there the day is looking at me so I take the opportunities turned over to him

1012
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,367
Hey by the way I should also let you know that was in those Direct

1013
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,927
Which contain the entire confidential psyche

1014
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
Medical record

1015
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
Call Central.

1016
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
Either you or me

1017
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
Mr an hour allowed to have sex

1018
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Immediately

1019
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,151
Is cholera

1020
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,223
Absolutely

1021
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:03,807
Just Don Knotts I guess I mean he is just

1022
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:10,207
Nice nice

1023
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,047
Tired of it in

1024
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,399
Actually have an interaction

1025
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,495
I maintain eye contact

1026
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
And just step

1027
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:27,615
Backwards out of the courthouse.

1028
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
A little.

1029
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:40,927
Bobby Barnes

1030
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,279
He had some Choice words but

1031
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,327
Marquis

1032
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,399
Demon demon leprechaun

1033
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,447
Yes but also

1034
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Appositive

1035
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,543
He was so confused

1036
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,335
By the moment where you

1037
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,871
You

1038
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,455
Bobby Barnes

1039
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:09,087
Lyrics

1040
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:15,231
We're just had a really good bet and I come back in there and there he was

1041
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:19,839
And it was because I had just been back just as like maybe

1042
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
30-45 minutes

1043
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,191
Before watching a video with our judge

1044
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:29,311
Simulator

1045
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,687
I wanted to ask Drano

1046
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,991
Ian book nobody wants a gag order

1047
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:40,831
A judge to hold of your client

1048
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,903
Is slapstick version of a lawyer

1049
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,927
Something about

1050
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
End-of-course exams

1051
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,215
Listen to No Man

1052
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:13,599
Please with a couple days later I'm literally playing to the jury

1053
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,647
Like video of Barnes talkingshit

1054
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,023
Videos of

1055
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
Siri is Bobby

1056
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
Sitting in the gallery

1057
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
Lawyer

1058
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:41,247
I think I heard that on Infowars but that doesn't mean it's true

1059
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:49,951
He was insisting that you're obsessed with him

1060
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
And B

1061
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
No one has called him Bobby

1062
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,559
In in

1063
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:57,375
Since he was a child

1064
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:05,311
I think I've pretty routinely called him Bobby pretty I think we're right on top of the bottle

1065
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
Call service

1066
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,735
Trolls get back in the day

1067
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Yeah

1068
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:18,367
Do loves playing around people's names and so when we know his name was Robert Barnes

1069
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:21,183
Hey

1070
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:25,535
And like and then it turns out

1071
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,839
23 months after Barnes got out of the case

1072
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,375
Another lawyer there

1073
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
Bill referred to

1074
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,727
Bob Barnes

1075
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:37,055
Barnes & Noble

1076
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:43,455
Or something like that

1077
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,135
Personality

1078
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:54,207
I would say that I am obsessed with him

1079
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,767
In exactly the same way I am obsessed with

1080
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,399
Laughing

1081
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:05,471
Basically the same

1082
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:08,543
Lawyers right exactly

1083
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,151
He's literally falling out of this coffin

1084
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Every time

1085
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,735
So apparently the John Oliver

1086
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Skip

1087
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
Just aired and Kyle said it was hilarious so we'll have to go back to the club

1088
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,655
I don't think things are done between me and

1089
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Stokke talking on the show

1090
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,983
Shadow s*** he is

1091
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
I love it

1092
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,335
I think he is going to be obsessed and come up with a fun

1093
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,639
Nickname for me

1094
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:45,919
Marquis Bank

1095
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Is that

1096
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,479
Is that she is the

1097
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,247
Guy

1098
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,319
The Alexander write an affidavit about

1099
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
He is messed up everything and please don't punish me because we are getting rid of them and you will never have to hear from him again

1100
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:01,023
Representative

1101
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
Practice

1102
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,607
Now

1103
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,983
Write like there's no

1104
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,543
There's a sinking ship

1105
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:19,199
Call me smart

1106
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967

How do you put a little bit of a Kind word towards Brad Brown

1111
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
I don't know

1112
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,279
You are fairly nice tan

1113
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,863
That was my twin.

1114
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,823
Might be what I was picking up on Les

1115
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,199
I'm a lawyer I'm every participant on season 1 of Survivor almost like I'm not here to make friends

1116
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,551
Like that's like I'm getaway

1117
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,087
Point of order

1118
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:00,415
I am a survivor historian and they were not doing that on to zandalar

You're taking me back

00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,175
What are we doing

1123
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,015
We don't want to make friends with anybody else

1124
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,671
That was BP like

00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,951
Rock of Love

1126
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,303
Yeah

1127
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:40,863
How do I make friends

Discovered some of the other

1147
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,983
Earlier to listen to me

1148
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:55,359
He couldn't get out it's about to get bad. One more paycheck

1149
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,943
150-gal want to be a part of this and if he didn't

1150
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
But not but I was a brat

1151
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Was the only one

1152
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
Teach

1153
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:04,319
The s*** that

1154
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,599
Everybody inherited

1155
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
That was already made

1156
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,927
And he tried

1157
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
But there was just

1158
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
With us

1159
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,023
Pressing the way that we work was asking

1160
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,815
With Mark pressing the way that he was

1161
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,607
You know there was

1162
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,399
He couldn't keep up with that

1163
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,679
Let's go back and try to

1164
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,959
Figure out the messages made

1165
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
Which what

1166
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
Appeared to me

1167
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Tubino

1168
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,895
Client in her 80s helping him

1169
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,919
Control

1170
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
He was just like

1171
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
Sorry

1172
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,319
Biscuits to another thing about the assertive

1173
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,927
Elena same way that Reeves inherited a lot of this

1174
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,719
Renault it is well

1175
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,559
Probably with the least lucky of all of them

1176
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,631
Because he

1177
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,423
Lawyers

1178
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:53,471
But the lawyers progressed

1179
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,543
Behavior kept happening

1180
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
You guys

1181
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,103
We're out of the Mind

1182
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,687
The lawyer is maybe something

1183
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:06,783
It also should be as opposed to just sanctioning Alex Wright

1184
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,343
Is my understanding was

1185
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,903
Isn't really the case with some of the earlier lawyers

1186
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
Who behave poorly

1187
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,999
Kind of got a little bit of the shaft

1188
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
There is

1189
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
And that's because

1190
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,327
We truly an hour

1191
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,399
Our firm weed that we do

1192
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,191
Press sanctions against lawyers

1193
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,471
We just

1194
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,311
Unless we can

1195
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
The decline

1196
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
I had nothing to do

1197
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:34,943
It was purely the lawyer

1198
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,735
There has been very few inches

1199
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,503
Just that

1200
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,527
But

1201
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
But yeah

1202
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
At that point

1203
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,391
Yes that is

1204
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,951
That isn't there weren't that many instances of

1205
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
Purely lawyer like

1206
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,303
Without cuz I mean even some of it

1207
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
Even some of Reno's

1208
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,119
Cross-examination

1209
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,143
I really could

1210
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Here

1211
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,983
The voice of Alex and Infowars behind it like

1212
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,263
Hey we need to ask

1213
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Please question

1214
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:05,151
Absolutely

1215
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,967
Whispering and right now the ear in the middle of his

1216
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,135
In an emergency hearing

1217
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Records

1218
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:30,751
Claire

1219
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,567
Lingering question

1220
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,847
But I feel like we can

1221
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,431
Address a little bit more now that case is over

1222
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,759
And one of them surrounded the

1223
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,551
My involvement

1224
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,343
In the deposition

1225
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
When I came down

1226
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:50,975
One of the questions that we have not really been able to answer was

1227
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
The question of whether or not they wrecked

1228
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,863
I'm part of the reason for this

1229
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:57,631
Because they

1230
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Didn't

1231
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Until they read the Tramp

1232
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Exactly

1233
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:07,615
This was something that I knew that we couldn't talk about but do you want to say or do you want to explain that a little bit

1234
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,991
This was a little bit of drama

1235
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,855
I saw it and look we were sneaky because we always are

1236
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
We we had

1237
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,719
Mini Mart

1238
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,279
We have the ability to bring

1239
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,815
Experts weather test finder

1240
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
Depositions

1241
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,143
They have to sign a protective order

1242
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,191
I'm sorry

1243
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,287
With other documents

1244
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,127
Start of deposition

1245
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,407
Understand

1246
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:48,831
So he's got the documents

1247
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,415
Okay now I'ma start Google

1248
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,767
Are you not plugged into this

1249
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
Is that a walk

1250
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,375
Mulatto

1251
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,959
Good advice

1252
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Dial

1253
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Alex's yes

1254
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,759
Yes or no

1255
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,575
So

1256
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,695
I'll be at you know a little bit

1257
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:29,023
Heavily bearded I cleaned up

01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
Music rap

Brewery of experts

1260
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,151
As a law firm

1261
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:48,735
Yes so I think he just kind of fit in a weird way

1262
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,695
On the first page of the transcript of the list of everybody's president

1263
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,351
Google junior what the hell

1264
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,167
They actually tried to insinuate

1265
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,215
Protective order in Subway

1266
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,007
Because

1267
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:15,615
I don't know I guess

1268
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,407
WhatsApp

1269
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
Very like whatever

1270
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:29,183
Find article

1271
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:33,791
The entire thing that they were arguing along with Mother stuff just

1272
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,583
Sooner face during that

1273
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,871
And I think that directive I mean

1274
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,943
But you don't know if that was a larger strategy moved to try to do that at that

1275
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,623
Yeah

1276
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
What is a piece of information

1277
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:06,815
We are

1278
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,351
It's something that went

1279
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:16,287
And so you know according to the law

1280
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:21,663
Fix it something you want to watch YouTube

1281
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:29,343
Describe beer

1282
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:34,463
Business cards and letterhead

1283
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,487
Consulting expert

1284
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,535
I'm a consultant

1285
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,815
Playing

1286
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:42,399
Firstenburg

1287
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,191
Things I wanted to

1288
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,495
Get to use the

1289
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
Like the

1290
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,543
Protracted

1291
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,311
It's of the case

1292
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
Dislike

1293
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,615
Is all frustration

1294
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,151
Constant roadblock

1295
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
And everything

1296
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,199
And then

1297
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
Get to the caves

1298
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:01,599
I don't know your experience was like

1299
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:02,879
Even in the

1300
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
Process

1301
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,439
The trial

1302
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
There was

1303
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,511
A sense of pretending that it was

1304
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
The damages cure

1305
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
I meant it was

1306
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Actually

1307
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,375
Innocence or guilt

1308
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:14,655
I kind of

1309
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,423
Trial

1310
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
Was that

1311
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,519
Extension of olives

1312
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,287
The b*******

1313
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,847
Coming into the trial at

1314
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,895
Siamese cat

1315
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,431
Here's the thing is is

1316
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,199
Is

1317
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:30,015
I don't know if you're saying that that

1318
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:33,343
That sort of issue on liability

1319
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,647
That was

1320
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,439
That was she lying

1321
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,743
Passing away because

1322
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:45,887
Lot of heavy focus on just

1323
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,679
Zircon.

1324
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
The amount

1325
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,471
Appeared

1326
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:53,311
Right

1327
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,871
Shown to show that they were liable

1328
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
With the exceptions of Something's reading

1329
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:01,503
True

1330
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
In the same

1331
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,927
54

1332
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,535
And so because we obviously

1333
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,815
You want to

1334
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
Got to be the thing you want to drink

1335
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,959
Thinking about so that whenever you can

1336
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,519

01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,655
You're sitting by the side so you're having a process it emotionally

1527
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,935
Me in the moment

1528
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
Tempered and put to the backseat

1529
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,151
By the fact that I

1530
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,943
Compass MPG

1531
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,991
Yeah yeah yeah

1532
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
In front of her face

1533
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,439
Who is the disgusting all that but also just

1534
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:51,231
The surprise of like

1535
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,279
That's where your mind was

1536
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,327
Like

1537
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
Teams

1538
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:01,471
Like that's something you might say if you're trying to come up with Anna

1539
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,687
That's nuts

1540
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,783
And I just think about all the people worldwide who saw that Super Bowl picks

1541
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:16,063
For the first time in Toronto

1542
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Yeah

1543
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,903
That was the goal with Daria to get you

1544
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:26,559
This was something much more.

1545
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,863
That's okay

1546
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
Is that like

1547
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:32,703
The notion that it's like he got something wrong and he said if

1548
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,495
A few things is so full

1549
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Yeah

1550
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,591
Based on the information that's presented

1551
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
Care to take

1552
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,639
Take the time to look at it

1553
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
Is a

1554
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,223
Conscious negligence

1555
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:48,319
There is a willingness to platform and

1556
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:49,855
Fundraise

1557
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,135
4 people who were

1558
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,927
Acting maliciously and

1559
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
These people

1560
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,511
There's so much more than just

1561
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
We went on this story

1562
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,863
You know like that something

1563
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,143
More people need to recognize

1564
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,959
We were at we were ask kind of an inch

1565
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:09,311
Interesting question today

1566
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
Ultimately a boil down to like

1567
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,431
710 episodes

1568
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:17,503
Can we like learn anything about this

1569
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
And it's like

1570
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:20,063
We're on here for 6 minutes

1571
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:22,879
If we were able to explain

1572
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Anything

1573
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,671
To you then

1574
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:29,535
Why would we do 710 f****** episodes

1575
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,887
He has that that will have anything to say of any value to you in this

1576
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,703
That's almost a repudiation of everything we've ever done

1577
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,055
Also did a little dirty for seltzer

1578
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,079
Business

1579
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
700 UPS

1580
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:54,367
Somebody's Daughter come on

1581
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,743
Y'all have before we

1582
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:03,071
Before we wrap this up your perspective

1583
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
Unjustly

1584
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:09,215
Babe do you want to make sure people know

1585
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,480
You going

1586
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,784
We

1587
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
The

1588
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:27,648
The one thing I will say is that when you when you go through trying to get

1589
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
You don't have a choice

1590
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,720
You're with him everyday

1591
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:31,488
And

1592
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,024
You talked with him and that's where you get

1593
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,328
Really appreciate them as people

1594
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,376
And the more and more that I met

1595
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,656
Niall and Scarlett

1596
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:40,192
You know at times I would

1597
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,752
What year at times you get frustrated for certain things

1598
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
But I'm not going to

1599
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
Nothing bad

1600
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:48,640
Show me that some of the surrounding circumstances

1601
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,408
Never going on

1602
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,688
Outside of Austin

1603
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,224
That we're going on during the trial

1604
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
But I will say that

1605
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
It was

1606
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
There's a

1607
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,648
Is surrealness

1608
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,184
Feeling whenever they both took

1609
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
The stand and they told their stories

1610
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,256
Completely separate ways

1611
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,048
And I think when that

1612
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:07,328
You know

1613
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,120
And

1614
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
Everybody had heard

1615
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
Ridiculousness

1616
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,496
Craziness and there was all these moments

1617
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
Witnesses

1618
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Is getting bloodied over and over again

1619
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
The stand

1620
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,920
And the mood shifted a little bit

1621
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,712
Even for me

1622
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,760
And I know 4B I think all of us

1623
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:27,552
We we talked about it more

1624
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
When that moment

1625
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,088
Hit

1626
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
A kind of

1627
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,416
Got me back on track of like

1628
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
This is

1629
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,976
But let's go

1630
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,768
Like this thing up for real cuz

1631
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:37,792
This

1632
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,584
As fun as those moments can be proved

1633
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Professionally

1634
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,680
When when you hear from the person that you represent

1635
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:47,520
How it how it actually affects them Empower sheet of really

1636
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
You know

1637
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
Put your foot down on

1638
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:50,592
Throttle and I mean

1639
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,896
You can see that that's kind of what

1640
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
Because after

1641
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
After that it was

1642
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
A bunch of surgeons in

1643
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
Operating room

1644
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:01,344
Cutting things down

1645
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,136
And then I'll come

1646
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,160
I got put back together

1647
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,464
There's something that's so

1648
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:10,560
Kind of bizarre to me I have a perception of

1649
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,328
Lawyers

1650
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,352
In general

1651
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
Baby

1652
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,192
It's not entirely favor

1653
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,776
There is something about

1654
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,056
I hate lawyers

1655
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:26,432
You guys I've met you I spent time with you and it seems like you have such a

1656
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,480
Ability or willingness

1657
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:29,760
With your client

1658
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,856
Scarlett Marcel

1659
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,416
Hear that you have

1660
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
About your clients

1661
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
The context of

1662
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,048
Being your client

1663
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,328
McKay's

1664
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,352
You know that

1665
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,632
Disorder cut-and-dry nature

1666
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
McKay's

1667
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,424
It's one of

1668
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:50,240
Offends me I guess

1669
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
Maybe it's me taking so

1670
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
Something personally that I don't need to

1671
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,408
What about when Alex describes you guys as like

1672
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,456
Ambulance chaser

1673
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
And this that you know

1674
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,552
How much you all do actually care

1675
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:07,136
It it it adds an extra layer to to that bed

1676
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,672
I think is is

1677
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
That's so undeserved in

1678
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,256
Obviously

1679
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,560
Yeah not all about you guys but

1680
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,352
There is an angle of that the

1681
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,656
It sucks yeah you went to confession does

1682
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:22,240
You were talking about how nice our fans have been to you and all that stuff

1683
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
And I will tell you this

1684
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:24,800
They are not nice

1685
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:25,568
Because

1686
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,360
You're good

1687
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,640
If you weren't

1688
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,944
Boris be nice to our fans are

1689
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,224
Very very good at

1690
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Discerning whether or not

1691
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,040
Who gives a s*** about

1692
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,672
But yeah Mark and I don't like other attorneys

1693
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
We hate we we hate others

1694
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,072
Personality

1695
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
Your you're

1696
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
Your view on us isn't a

1697
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,704
I would say that

1698
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,776
But it's not as

1699
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,056
Big of a minor

1700
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,384
There are a lot

1701
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,920
Plaintiffs attorneys

1702
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:03,712
That do personal injury work out there that

1703
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,784
Truly do do it for the right reasons and then the right ways

1704
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:11,136
But I can set a time to get overshadowed by

1705
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,184
It's overshadowed by

1706
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,208
That you know some

1707
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:17,024
Push certain limits that they shouldn't have

1708
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:17,792
That they shouldn't have

1709
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,608
And that's always going to happen any profession but yeah

1710
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
I mean

1711
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:22,656
When you guys

1712
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:24,960
Don't tell you I mean they have

1713
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
A decade's worth

1714
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,264

Text them and they still let you know they they check

01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,808
It's hard not to when

1720
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,832
We don't do

1721
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,160
So it's rare that you're going to go do a case where somebody got rear-ended in the

1722
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
School zone

1723
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:45,952

Chiropractic

1726
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,584
So if we're trying a case

1727
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,352
Significant

1728
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,632
And because of that it's

1729
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,168
We try hard not to get

1730
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
Get too emotionally invested

1731
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,496
Because it'll mess with our performance

1732
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,056
But at the end of the day

1733
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:01,824
Possum

1734
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,592
Care about

1735
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
These people because

1736
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,896
There's been very

1737
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,176
Few people as any

1738
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456

1742
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,600

1758
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456

1759
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,760
I got home

1760
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,808
And I walked in the door

1761
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,856

1803
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,056
Immediately

1804
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
From that conference room

1805
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:17,920

That story

1813
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,264
Because we know that

1814
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Power that has to counteract

1815
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,616

A narrative

1821

Stuffing any dishonest way and I honestly think that

1822
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
It's one of

1823
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,744

Manipulative

1828
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:18,080
In a theatrical narrative-based and it's so powerful against

1829
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,872
Text him to use things that are real

1830
