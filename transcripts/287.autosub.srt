Lead me into a plug about how we have shirts

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,584

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
Quest

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:41,728

Replay the song on it up

21
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,432
Made me realize

22
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:25,248
Oh that's right I had a big italo-disco face

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,168
Crass capitalism

I don't think this is the best

34
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Possible we had to do

I already built it

45
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:45,888
Might have that backwards backwards

46
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
Rebuilt

47
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,088
Which was Monday of life

71
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
Notre Dame caught on fire

72
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
And we will get to that a bit in the

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Of this episode

74
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
Most of Alex's show on the 50

75
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,351
Is him

76
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
Complaining about

77
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,423
Are you

78
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
You're nothing else is going on in the news

79
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
He's giving off a scent

80
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,799
To me that he's very afraid

81
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
There's if there's a Feeling

82
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,127
But he's very worried about him

83
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,991
Starting to get afraid of that

84
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
He sent Billy Weaver and Kaitlin Bennett

85
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
Penn State gun girl

86
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,391
Outdoor rally and

87
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,671
Kaitlin Bennett

88
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,439
Kicked out answer

89
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
She's making a real

90
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
The two of them on to talk about

91
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
Bernie rally

92
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
We're covering their

93
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
But it is important to note that

94
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,751
Most of the show

95
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287
I'm not kidding around

96
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,567
I would say good

97
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Percent of the show Alex does

98
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Anna Bernie in French

99
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,711
I believe is

100
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,503
Indicative of how he's kind of lost

101
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,783
Himself in the character

102
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Yeah

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Is Impressionism

104
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,327
Is just getting

105
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,447
Getting Wild

106
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:35,103
Stretches of time but he's really trying

107
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,639
Has Bernie character in realizing

108
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Like I don't have the

109
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:44,319
Yeah I can't stay inside the impression

110
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,367
Real disappointed

111
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
At its most

112
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
I was listening to it

113
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,279
I know that Notre Dame is on fire and

114
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,423
What's going on here

115
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Does he have a

116
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,055
Picture in picture of Notre Dame burning as he's doing this

117
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:05,823
Found out yet

118
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,615
The news hasn't broken

119
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,175
Or whatever

120
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Next

121
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,735
Talk about how he's always right

122
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:13,759
What you said

123
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Nike pin

124
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
So you can keep in mind

125
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
And as we go

126
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,519
The pleasure scares

127
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
Charlemagne

128
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Broadcast

129
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Architecture

130
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,879
Zerohedge

131
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
We're open

132
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
What were

133
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,727
Killshot

134
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,079
Part of the conversation

135
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
Somebody's talking about you

136
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
The context of it

137
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Is that

138
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,687
He needs Trump

139
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,967
To really Act

140
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
Internet

141
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
He doesn't

142
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Is going to

143
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
Diminished

144
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,559
People in operation if I don't have access to those people

145
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
And I will go out of business

146
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
I need Trump

147
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Now

148
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
This is a

149
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Soviet takeover

150
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Whatever

151
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:43,871
And we're the only ones who've been right about it all along

152
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
Social media

153
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Nefarious thing

154
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,599
It's not

155
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623
I want a crush

156
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
Like Alex's

157
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
They also have

158
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,231
Real girls play

159
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
For you

160
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
And your family

161
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
We can now take it away from you

162
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
Two genders and family

163
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,063
Your mind uploaded to the web

164
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
That is the agreement

165
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Give up your physical body in this week

166
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,255
And of course the top scientist

167
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
You must

168
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,823
Facebook

169
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
Service First

170
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,943
In terms of getting you to kill yourself to be uploaded as a false

171
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Coco question

172
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,551
Your

173
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
Entire brain is uploaded

174
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
Is program

175
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
2 minute perfect

176
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Exactly that is there a difference

177
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
You know

178
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
Discuss by greater minds than ours

179
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,495
I don't know I don't have a position on it

180
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
Because that what I was talking about is s***

181
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,687
Misrepresenting comments made by like futuristic chocolate

182
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Well there's a possibility of uploading

183
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,087
If you imagine that is a possibility but you probably have to die

184
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
In order to do it

185
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,719
It's not like I want to kill you so I can upload

186
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Prospect

187
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
People like

188
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:16,959
No I mean is there is something whether or not it is part of like

189
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:21,567
An intentional advertising model or just go to the side effect of we didn't know was coming

190
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Social media

191
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,127
I think there is something

192
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,407
Dangerous about the ideas

193
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
Living on these social media platforms

194
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Now your life is so different

195
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
Without them

196
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,671
We all need to take a look at

197
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
Gets the same

198
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,767
Conversations a little bit

199
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
So Alex is mad

200
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,679
Censorship parsley because it will you be enforced

201
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
To kill yourself to be

202
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
Really wants

203
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:58,431
Get back on social media so we can become a clone at next

204
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:03,039
Arguing to get back onto the flowers

205
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,135
He's not making any sense most important I just kept it in

206
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
Kinda to give you a

207
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,743
A sense of how the beginning of the show is going

208
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
As opposed to wear it

209
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,887
I'm so here is Alex talking about

210
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:20,447
If you doesn't stop this

211
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,519
Alex

212
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,591
If the president doesn't

213
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,639
Of course the election

214
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
Lucifer

215
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:41,439
So hard to trick massage

216
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
Alex character is

217
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,631
Early on before Alex

218
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
Was fully on

219
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
As we saw in that 20

220
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215
Stop

221
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
There was this

222
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,519
Galaxy

223
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,591
Who's the most evil person in the world

224
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
Gordy's The Greatest

225
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,855
To work with us tonight

226
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,391
Look sometimes

227
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
It's true sometimes

228
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
You never know which way it's going

229
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Messed up

230
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
So it is easy to pull out

231
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,423
Even be

232
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,471
The most resolute

233
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
Reminded person in the world Alex

234
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,127
Presented as though

235
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,431
Like he doesn't even have that big sarcastic

236
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
Voice to it

237
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
It's literally him like rest

238
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
With the thought

239
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
It's not like I'm going like

240
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:42,879
Just being like

241
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Yeah

242
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:50,559
He could be the worst

243
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Notre Dame Notre Dame

244
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
The news

245
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Alex

246
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:15,391
Church got the music

247
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,999
Are there scorpions in

248
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:23,839
I noticed they must have someone new behind

249
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
Alex's intro

250
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
And it does not Fade Out start fading out earlier than it does

251
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Turnover in employees

252
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
Houses amateur hours yet

253
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,023
Disassemble

254
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
France

255
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
What we're dealing with

256
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:04,799
So expect

257
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Alakazam

258
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,919
Response that this is a symbolic sort of things

259
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
This symbolizes the West

260
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
Because at least he's not putting any blame on anything like already said like outside

261
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,279
His play starting a firearm while they're staring at

262
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
You coming in

263
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,215
Part of it is

264
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Because

265
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,031
He is really into

266
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,055
To doing that Bernie

267
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,359
And he doesn't want to suck

268
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
He wants to keep doing this

269
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:43,711
I don't know

270
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,735
Sometimes you just

271
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,063
Suspect something is going to go a certain way

272
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
You haven't even set

273
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
To do and someone in the audience

274
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
Heckling

275
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
I think that's how he's because Bisset

276
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,471
He wants to do right

277
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
His bucketful of Bernie impression

278
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,759
I hungry

279
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,319
Will you could actually get them

280
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
Questions

281
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,135
Spotify

282
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
I am Superior

283
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
Serious

284
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
Islamic toilets early

285
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,895
Hunchback

286
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:51,551
I love the idea that you like Notre Dame and I wanted to go to Paris

287
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,999
Well where is it going to live there is a sense that he's like

288
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Very strange

289
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Speedway

290
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,775
Here already

291
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,567
Close after

292
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:20,479
Break is already started to mention Islam

293
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
Surely yes

294
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
He's connecting

295
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:30,975
Those two ideas is on fire in his audience

296
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:34,559
Over about that

297
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
He said something

298
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
Kind of sucked up

299
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Sort of like

300
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
More restraint than you'd expect Alex

301
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,567
That sucker is inflamed

302
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
Anyway so maybe it's better if just totally Burns

303
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,271
Yeah

304
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,087
Better than mamas

305
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,111
Casper

306
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:05,023
Were the Crusades

307
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:12,191
Literally what alligator say

308
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,311
Better for this to burn than for the islamists to take it over and turn it into a moth

309
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
Bucked up

310
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,895
That is really f***** up

311
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
But it does give you a sense of the world

312
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,759
You know what the state of things are

313
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Is it is

314
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,159
In the past when we've seen Alex cover stuff

315
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,511
On the day of the Boston bombings he's screaming it's a false flag

316
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,351
Speculating pretty wild

317
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
Here we have on April 5th

318
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
He's not doing

319
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
That much

320
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,751
He's a f****** saying this long sucks

321
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,967
It's just it's very strange

322
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
Also his reaction

323
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
Very much

324
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
Smaller tragedies

325
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
He's never expressing any kind of

326
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
Regret or sympathy

327
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,751
Like this is such a strange thing for him to just

328
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,823
Eenadu

329
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:28,223
You know what is beautiful

330
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
I don't know why but

331
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
Maybe I don't know

332
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:38,975
To do the Bernie impression

333
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,255
Drive to score points from that

334
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Right

335
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
He's got Joe Bannister

336
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,943
Partial

337
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,479
Why would I give away

338
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:03,039
The show before I'm ready to do it

339
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:06,367
Yeah I'm not sure what it is but there is something going on that is

340
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
Is what you're describing the

341
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,671
That sort of response

342
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,207
Very unlikely

343
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,743
Maybe

344
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
He's getting his

345
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,583
Rubbing off on him and now he's gay

346
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,863
Sing some sort of human emotion

347
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,983
I doubt it when are they are they talk about

348
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,007
Logan Paul's

349
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,103
It's because Caitlin was also on Logan Paul's

350
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
Not too far back

351
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
It's not really important

352
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
Anything they say ft Alex

353
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
I just I just I just I just

354
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
The script

355
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
What

356
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
Almost

357
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,495
Bad children

358
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
How old do you think Logan Paul

359
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
He's 24

360
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
What's 9

361
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,295
Irresponsible parenting at Beth also

362
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
1004

363
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:13,183
What kind of like syndication did Alex have in 2000

364
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
4

365
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
Northern California

366
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
The NorCal market for a long time

367
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
Fire from there

368
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Undoubted

369
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
I find this incredibly difficult to believe

370
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
And also I should say I looked it up Logan Paul

371
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:41,599
Just turned 24

372
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:45,439
If so I have even Logan Paul's parents

373
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
Irresponsibly they raise this child

374
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,815
I don't know Logan Logan

375
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Just answer

376
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Please just an

377
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
What is

378
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Is 4 +

379
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Globalism

380
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,519
So here's the last clip from April 15th it again

381
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
This is a demonstration of Alex

382
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
Characteristically cautious

383
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,919
It is coverage of Notre Dame

384
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Never know

385
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,512
Some parents are going to be mad at you for asking questions

386
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
Or something like that

387
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,032
Presenting that is a hypothetical

388
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
That's not

389
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,456
Really restrained

390
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,248
Alex Jones rhetoric

391
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,624
The ideas like I kind of glibly and dismissive

392
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,904
It was an accident

393
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
Maybe won't

394
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,352
I quit

395
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
I expected it

396
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
Forces towards the future in order.

Teleport ourselves all over the universe

400
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,808
Given all of his rhetoric

401
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
His world

402
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,696
Should be like

403
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,744
On the 15th

404
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Although

405
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:33,216
Alright the 16th he got the Bernie impression out of the system

406
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
April 6th

407
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:40,896

410
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:44,736
I'm your host Alex Jones

411
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:50,624
Obviously the tragic fire of a very important historic question site

412
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Interrupt

413
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,464
Left of Islamic occupied

414
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Burned

415
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,096
That's the ground but into an empty

416
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,632
The Ready Set

417
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:05,216
Incredible response

418
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,800
U.s. news Fox News

Under French law US law under UK law under common law

421
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
Big fire

422
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
Is investigator

423
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
No s***

424
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,864
And that's why you don't really have to argue on

425
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
The only people who were saying

426
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,520
And that sort of thing are people who have invested in

427
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:41,568
Behind what they're arguing

428
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,104
They're arguing that

429
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
It was Muslim

430
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
Not that it should be invested

431
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
That sort of thing

432
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
Investigation

433
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,784
What they're looking for

434
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
In favor of

435
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
Even as they're saying those words

436
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
Instead calling for Noah.

437
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
Just like you know what

438
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,168
Let's chalk this one up to bad behavior

439
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,496
Let's not even worry about

440
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:16,896
Or or whatever the globalist

441
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
Biggest fire that could possibly happen

442
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,344
Eiffel Tower might be bigger

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,744
Imaginary visual

444
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
From the top

445
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,816
Patently

446
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,376
For this argument to be coming

447
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
People who are

448
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Let's be honest

449
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:44,032
Noted islamophobia

450
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
If there is any

451
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Voice

452
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
Publicly saying

453
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:55,040
Stop investigating

454
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,344
I don't think we need to look into this one at all

455
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,232
Probably an electrical

456
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,168
Go to tell you

457
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:18,848
Take me to never was not on fire don't look into the

458
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,128
Don't look into it

459
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
Who won the Falcon playing right now

460
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,992
Smoke bombs

461
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,552
It's completely absurd

462
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,112
Alex Alex wants the perception

463
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,160
There are people were saying

464
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,328
So if he's still not really saying

465
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:41,120
It was

466
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
Whatever

467
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,448
Around that line

468
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
Nicely

469
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
MMS next clip

470
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,616
He's trying to imply pretty heavily

471
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
For behind the fire

472
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
Thousands of cars burned mod

473
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,320
Screaming Allah Akbar

474
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
And they're on a Jihad

475
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
The UN reports that there have been

476
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
In Europe

477
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
11

478
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
1063

479
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,096
Churches attack

480
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Burn down

481
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,960
Most of those

482
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,800
And I got the report here with a view in before it's

483
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,872
That Christianity is the most persecuted

484
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:25,408
Religion in

485
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,688
The world

486
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Alex's

487
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,256
Archbishop

488
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,560
Bernadette

489
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
Before the UN that was were

490
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,888
Repeated as a talking to

491
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,912
Point is if it was something

492
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,008
The problem

493
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Christians

494
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:57,408
It's just the point that I'm trying to make it slippery out

495
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:59,968
Didn't say that does Catholic Archbishop

496
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,808
Has been repeated all over blog

497
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
Interesting Lee

498
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:07,392
In June 2018

499
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:12,512
Research Center released a report

500
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
The Christians were the most

501
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,352
Harassed by a very small margin

502
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Airport

503
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,168
Look at the Grouse number

504
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,472
Only the number of countries in which

505
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:22,496
Happen

506
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
They found the Christians report

507
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
44

508
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Countries in the world

509
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Coming in at number 1

510
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Islam came in at number

511
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
With 142

512
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Opportunity

513
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,088
I'm a write-up about the report in the express

514
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,184
Analyze That

515
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
A Christian person

516
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,072
The world which found that most of it is found in

517
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
The asia-pacific

518
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:51,168
And that quote

519
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,704
India Nepal

520
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
Sri Lanka Target

521
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,264
Christian's the most

522
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
The picture of Christian persecution

523
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:03,456
Is a little bit different than people like Alex would like

524
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:09,856
Romans making lions eat

525
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
But

526
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,672
It's not it's not a totality of

527
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Interested

528
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
The EU Parliament

529
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,864
He hates so much actually put this out in a report released on December 4th

530
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,496
They are currently the religious group most harassed and intimidated

531
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
Throughout the world

532
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:33,408
He can't say that I came from the EU though because you would have to explain then why I Godless globalist

533
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,688
Demon organization

534
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,992
Would put something like that in one of the reports

535
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,064
Talk about everything

536
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,832
Christians

537
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
The most persecuted

538
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
I wasn't all that curious about that be

539
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
We talked about that

540
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,304
Really curious about that number that Alex's

541
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,840
Decided about the

542
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,632
Churches being attacked in Europe in

543
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
The past year

544
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,704
The feeling I had was that it definitely

545
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
Could be a real number

546
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
Obviously even in the best of times some houses of worship

547
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,080
Two-faced

548
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,920
The grocery ality of modern life regardless of what faith

549
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Albeit people worship

550
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Dick movie

551
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
But something felt off about

552
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,552
Alex

553
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
Reporting it

554
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Europe is a

555
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,648
Cute with a large population

556
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Citrate

557
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:20,000
I know he's misleading people about the UN report saying Christian

558
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Most persecuted religion in the world

559
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,376
I didn't know that he's exaggerating the number of car bird

560
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,400
What happened in France

561
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:30,752
And he's intentionally not telling his audience that most of them were burned as part of an insurance frauds

562
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,544
Good reason to suspect

563
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,336
This Thursday might not be accurate

564
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:35,616
Yeah wasn't

565
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Sure

566
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:39,968
Claiming that this number is reporting is coming from the UN

567
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
Which I can tell you right off the bat

568
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Is not true

569
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,624
One thing

570
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
Is it if you try and find out where he's getting this

571
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,976
Information from

572
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Tana possibilities

573
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Does a write-up in the gate Stone it

574
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,584
Institute of sites that

575
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Number does a blog entry

576
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,144
Christian Broadcasting Network

577
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,448
Works website there's a report on one news now

578
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,008
There's a post on the Middle East Forum about it

579
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
The number is all over the

580
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,920
You and of course the most of us means United

581
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,992
Nations but where he got that number was from

582
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
His Uncle Nick

583
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:18,368
Oh that could be

584
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,952
Nope it's not Santa Claus

585
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,536
Should I just mention Christian Broadcasting Network

586
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Gatestone in

587
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,328
Do one News Network

588
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Release form plenty of others

589
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,400
What do they have in common

590
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,216
Probably owned

591
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,240
The Bursar

592
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,712
They're all relying on a single source for reporting their number and it's not the duet

593
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,088
It's a block run out of Germany called Politically Incorrect

594
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:49,856
News

595
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:52,160
Or as these websites

596
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
T.i. new

597
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,608
So it's a 3 million illegals voted tweet

598
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
Level of

599
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
Show me original post on

600
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
1000

601
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
3 attacks

602
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
Christian churches in

603
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
Symbols were registered in France in 2018

604
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:18,272
Symbol very different than when Alex has a pimples

605
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,832
Property damage

606
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,160
Is 185 more violet

607
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
27

608
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,768
By comparison around 100 synagogues and mosques

609
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
What are purely factual level

610
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,400
But there's a reality

611
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
Here that's worth discussing

612
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,008
Because it's a reality that right-wing media Outlet

613
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,080
I mentioned earlier they're using a reality

614
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,640
I put the story

615
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Outrageous

616
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
My hatred Manga Rock

617
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,504
In this Pi news blog in

618
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,528
There's no

619
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
Information about this 1,000

620
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,088
Tax number

621
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,880
Navigation

622
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Where the number comes from

623
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,744
Or even specific information of what sort of attacks were included in this

624
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Statistic

625
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,560
It just has this number of attacks

626
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,096
What were register

627
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,144
It doesn't even say who was doing the register

628
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:11,008
As it turns out the number comes from a report put out by the French Ministry of the interior

629
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,312
Which does say that there were 1006

630
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Christian

631
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,128
In France

632
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,152
828

633
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,224
This is used to argue that there are by all these

634
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,504
Media operations

635
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,808
Waves of antichrist

636
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,576
Attacks and fix

637
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
What is on the rise

638
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:27,648
Yeah

639
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
The problem with that

640
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
Is that the same released

641
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,792
Interior Ministry points out

642
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
38

643
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Anti-christian

644
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,632
Recorded

645
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,912
This last year was only a

646
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
2% in

647
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,984
That's an increase of 25 in

648
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
It's not the 185

649
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,568
Increase the pi news was a ledger

650
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,872
Also perhaps more importantly

651
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:49,920
This report points out the 2018

652
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Teen size 7

653
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,968
54% increase

654
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,248
An anti-semitic in

655
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,344
Which probably seems like more important as a headline

656
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,136
Entirely unmentioned

657
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
MPI news

658
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:03,488
That's really odd you think that they would want to provide some context

659
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,304
So they would know

660
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
The situation is going on

661
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
As opposed to

662
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Sprint

663
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:16,288
Small fact that would support some sort of attack

664
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:20,640
Nothing in the interior ministry's reported think about the people who

665
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:21,408
Committed these acts

666
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,712
But it does

667
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,808
Quote the obvious truth about the Antichrist

668
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,600
Fury and it's origin is permanently

669
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Clouded

670
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,672
It's not for Traders who are in danger of being author

671
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,720
Ostracized

672
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
The desecration

673
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Christian symbols with immigrant Imports

674
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
They are accused of hate hate speech and racism

675
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
Do people who baked the connection but

676
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
Christian

677
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,496
Anti-christian the text

678
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Immigrants

679
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,544
Import immigrants

680
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Immigrants

681
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,152
No problem isn't a news Outlet

682
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Like its name might suggest

683
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,504
Overtly anti-islam

684
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,552
The depot which go so far

685
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
Bugs and buttons that's a quote islamophobic and proud of it

686
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,440
The guy who started the blog stuff on her

687
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:10,048
I was quoted in ideology of

688
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,632
He's very clear and interviews it doesn't believe that there's any

689
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
And literally

690
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
You're all Muslim

In 2005

694
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:26,944
The Danish newspaper

Protest

Muhammad car jumped on the bandwagon

700
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Much more

701
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,744
Attention of a large crowd of monster

702
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,280
I put his blog on them

703

He goes on to say quote

709
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,288
T.i. is a forum for

710
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,056
Defamatory

711
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Slanderous abuse

00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Threatening and sighting in

713
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,944

714
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,736
Going to be honest

715
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,784

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,112
Exit they make

717
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:11,232
So good about all that stuff on higher claims

718
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
Because he's pearl is real

719
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,072
Are you racist because Islam

Roku

722
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Perhaps this

723
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:22,240
Explains the greatest

724
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,032
Attraction of Politically Incorrect

725
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,568

4 old

731
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
PR news is a bigotry

732
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Depot.

733
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:40,672
They've been constantly criticized for posting absurd and not true stories

734
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:45,280
To demonize Muslims English Banker no longer allowed to distribute

735
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,328
Piggybacks because it might offend Islam

736
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
It's very much like Infowars

737
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:55,264
The pattern of just posting whatever they find to reinforce their predetermined position regardless of whether it's true or

738
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,592
The thing is none of this is to say that they 1000

C3 anti-christian Acts

740
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Statistic is incorrect

741
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,688
You know

742
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,480
What's important is how a publication like

743
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,504
User the stat

744
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,112
Octopus Outlet is a long-standing

Dementia

746
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Because

747
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,464
No way you just be official reporting so

748
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Suggested these anti-christian

749
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,280
Carried out by Muslim

750
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,560
Or even by immigrants

751
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,096
That's an interpretation

752
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:23,168
Is being added to a real number by a bigoted publication

753
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
Which is better Outlets

754
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,264
API news as a source

755
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
Without the primary source

756
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,104
T.i. news claims

757
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:35,456
Churches were violated every day the past year because they were simple.

758
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
The hated infidels

759
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Ultraman Islamic

760
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
This is editorialize

761
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,112
In the past week has been pushing its

762
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:45,184
Insinuation that the Notre Dame fire was Islamic arson

763
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
Attacking the story from every conceivable angle

764
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,328
Headlines like where are the Muslim donations for Notre Dame

765
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,912
Missing from that article is the fact that Kamal cup Tani

766
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
Be president

767
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:00,032
The Council of mosques of the Roan had already come out and said quote we call on Muslims

768
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
France

769
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,592
To show their solidarity by actively for

00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,432
Participating in the National solidarity campaign will be launched

771
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,968

Of our country if it's

773
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,784
The prayer so dear to our Christian

774
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,320
Brothers

775
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Single Muslim

776
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Speakingout

777
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,280
This kind of activity there's no

778
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
We shouldn't

779
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
A hundred percent

780
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
I don't hear them

781
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
The same thing you're not listening

782
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,960
I don't believe that any sort of attack

783
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,520
Takbir property crime or assault or even just make

784
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,824
Anthrax is acceptable at all no matter whose

785
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
This isn't an attempt to minimize the

786
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
The real anti-christian

787
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,760
Accident happened

788
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
He's on the Thursday larger number of Acts

789
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Against Christians than there are against Jews

790
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
They're Muslims it's really simple

791
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:54,816
Exactly what there are more Christians

792
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,840
Intentionally apps

793
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
2000

794
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
Something mosques in France

795
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,520
40000 churches

796
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,592
I can say with certainty information

797
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:08,128
But I can

798
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:11,456
Exactly the same way Pi news is trying to

799
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:15,040
They're putting the same spin on real numbers

800
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
False conclusion

801
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
What a camp

802
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
For sure is that Alex has no idea

803
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
About these just make

804
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Can the UN part of this

805
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,512
The numbers game from the French interior

806
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
Even though that

807
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
So

808
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
You know

809
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,960
The thing about this

810
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
Strikes me is

811
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
The propaganda laundry

812
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Technique

813
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,360
You know what I'm saying

814
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,688
Like so often with the 3 million illegals

815
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Voted in this election

816
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
It starts out as a

817
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:48,064
All you have to have a some idiot with

818
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,344
0

819
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,136
Like bees Pi news

820
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:54,976
Who were going to make up some b*******

821
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,304
Slightly more

822
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
Trustworthy Outlets who just

823
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:08,032
Cited as a source knowing that you're not going to go look at it later

824
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Report

825
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
If you go back through the second

826
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,504
I'm in there is laundering going on

827
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
A couple of

828
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,600
Specific examples about it they will talk about

829
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,624
As we go along

830
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
Alex talks about how

831
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
Islam is

832
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,024
About

833
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
I don't know

834
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
Wow

835
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,032
Write an article saying Jones is making up

836
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,360
That Islam attacks churches it's like Shane

837
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,408
Joan just making it up

838
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
The foxes will try to get in a henhouse

839
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,416
You understand what he's trying to make

840
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:57,952
In his audiences

841
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,720
Mine

842
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
Connection

843
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:02,304
Natural predator

844
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,864
Animals

845
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,632
Do

846
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,168
Of their very nature

847
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Are you trying to

848
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,984
To compare that to Muslims

849
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
Attacking churches

850
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,848
As being just a friend

851
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
Character trait exactly

852
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,968
Read into them forever

853
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,296
Without having to overtly say that that is

854
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,344
He's trying to get across.

855
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
Which is deeply

856
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,208
So that's what's going on

857
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
On Palm Sunday to Easter as I said

858
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
What a few months ago

859
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,472
I said Islam is attacking churches all over the world

860
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,848
And I said his mom has said on Palm Sunday through Easter

861
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,152
They're going to burn up and bomb Church

862
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:53,504
I guess what they said just last week we're going to blow up in French

863
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,088
I just had a public plot

864
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,880
Notre Dame

865
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,280
You don't want to talk about it

866
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:08,608
Only saw the Christchurch mosque

867
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Attack

868
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
I said

869
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,496
The media won't cover it

870
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,032
When we see

871
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,592
Churches and blown up

872
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:19,616
And shot up

873
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,920
Or islamists run over people's cars

874
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,688
Or trucks

875
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
Screaming Allah Akbar

876
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
There's a lot of

877
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,576
Four-wheeler

878
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,344
Response

879
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
Just get to this next

880
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
More

881
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072
Back in the coffee run

882
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
And the kitchen

883
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,192
There was Fox News Chang

884
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Well

885
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,616
Arson expert Fire Department

886
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,663
But we know

887
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,943
It's not arson

888
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:00,319
So he says there's no investigation

889
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,159
The government

890
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
Not Muslims. Arsenal

891
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
That is done

892
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
This is an attack on logic

893
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
They looked at the

894
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,807
The fire was only going for an hour and they said

895
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
No

896
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:35,391
Islamic Terror because Islamic Terror doesn't exist

897
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
I don't think they said that

898
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
So Alex knows what

899
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,231
He's doing here

900
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:42,559
Go together

901
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
Terms of building up with

902
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
The Narrative video

903
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:45,887
He's trying to push his

904
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,679
He's playing his role in

905
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Each production that

906
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
Has been run

907
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
Times and the right-wing

908
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
See how it works

909
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
The first thing that's important to point out is

910
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,175
Is it the statement being made by French authorities

911
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
They works

912
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
It's fire wasn't arson

913
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,039
Everett Islamic terrorism

914
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Creating a straw man

915
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
And fight with instead of doing any real work

916
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:13,023
Prosecutor Remy Heats with nothing shows that it wasn't intentional

917
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,631
But that was just based on initial information

918
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Available

919
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:20,447
That wasn't making any kind of definitive state

920
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,007
And Heights the acknowledge that there was a

921
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Investigation

922
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
Like when my apartment burned down like

923
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,639
6 years ago it was an accident

924
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,735
At the fire department didn't still do a week-long investigation just

925
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
Investigators do

926
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,391
By Wednesday the prosecutor's office it interviewed many of the workers

927
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:43,999
Well the prosecutor's office does not rule out any hypothesis

928
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:46,303
Nothing

929
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,071
Investigation

930
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Highlights of criminal origin

931
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,423
Accidental causes remain are privileged

932
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,775
Investigators were allowed into the building they were initially

933
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
They were allowed

934
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Safe

935
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,175
Able to begin their work by late evening on Monday France time

936
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Which is daytime

937
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:03,711
Em4us

938
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,759
As they began their preliminary best

939
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
Navigation

940
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
Conceived to be pointing towards the next

941
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,927
Battlestar to the fire like what Alex

942
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:13,951
Play Mandisa

943
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
People on

944
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Twitter

945
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,863
Probably some pundits on talking head shows did

946
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,191
Because they felt officials

947
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
It said that there was no into

948
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,751
Keisha that this was arson

949
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,775
Nor was there any reason

950
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,567
To put blame on Muslims are immigrants

951
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
And you know why they felt the need

952
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,687
Do that immediately blame it on Muslims

953
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Immigrants and they were probably going

954
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,039
To start some sort of f****** mob immediately

955
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
Constantly and aggressively

956
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Please wait

957
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
Not just

958
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
People

959
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,207
People like Alex

960
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:52,607
The day of the fire Paul Joseph Watson posted an article on Infowars that the headline quotes

961
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:57,215
Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on fire worker claims it was a deliberately started

962
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,079
Certain of that

963
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,895
It was just about getting the headline out there quick

964
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,199
It was still early and get a chance

965
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,551
If you sold enough doubt before anyone really knew what was up

966
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,647
The article was entirely based on what a guy named Christopher Hale

967
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Paris who works

968
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
Notre Dame

969
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
Cathedral staff

970
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,071
The fire was intentionally

971
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,631
If you breaks out what's going on here

972
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,935
It's Paul Joseph Watson reporting on a tree

973
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,959
Posted by someone

974
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,775
He doesn't know who is your friend

975
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,615
Who told him that some other unnamed people told him that the fire was

976
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Renton accident

977
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,687
Is not a good basis for reporting this is

978
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,247
To the possibility this is straight-up gossiping

979
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
It also doesn't help it hail followed up his tweet with another saying quote I should know he has zero evidence beyond what the staff

980
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,351
Substantiated rumor character

981
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
I don't know

982
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,079
Qualify

983
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:12,479
Unfortunately something demonizes Muslim

984
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,247
It's what they

985
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,015
They do

986
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Because make no mistake about this

987
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Cuz I'm not just saying this loosely

988
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:22,207
Paul Joseph Watson was trying to imply that Muslims at Notre Dame on fire

989
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,023
He ended his article by saying quote also take note of

990
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
The names of those who were celebrating

991
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:33,215
The fire by Rihanna on Facebook video of Muslim names

992
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,287
Smiley faces on a stream

993
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Of the fire which I guess is a Smoking Gun

994
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,407
I don't care

995
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,759
He'll deleted his

996
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,063
Because he realized how it could be misused

997
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
He didn't believe the fire was arson

998
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,719
Piece of Gossip you'd heard

999
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
But in the wrong

1000
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
That could be very dangerous

1001
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Unfortunately the wrong hand

1002
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,607
Found it

1003
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:03,935
Before he could delete it hit Paul Joseph Watson used it is covered

1004
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:04,959
Point the finger at most

1005
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:06,751
Can you imagine how

1006
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,775
Frantically

1007
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Once the fire started

1008
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
He had to have been

1009
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,383
Research Refresher

1010
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,687
I just need one

1011
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:21,087
I just need one, I know it just was

1012
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:21,855
Enough air

1013
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,975
He'll got to learn an important lesson

1014
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,583
I regret that I became an unintended tool for the worst parts of the internet

1015
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,655
I think what's remarkable about this is how quickly

1016
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
Desire to blame

1017
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,263
Clear accident in Paris on the Muslim Community

1018
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,055
From a tweet that was up for 10

1019
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
Infowars

1020
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,175
Multiple fake Twitter accounts created

1021
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:47,967
To look like Fox

1022
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Sweet bulshit

1023
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,599
Likes Alano Mars responses

1024
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:56,415
The fire was too fake

1025
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
We're posting videos of Notre Dame on fire with audio

1026
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
The push to play Muslim

1027
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,631
This fire was very

1028
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,935
Strong and involved

1029
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,471
The campaign

1030
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,287
We talked a lot about this because it's super important

1031
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,103
People like this pack of assholes know what they doing

1032
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
They're doing

1033
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,663
Amino that it only works

1034
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
If they works

1035
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:22,015
They know fully well that if they do nothing initially

1036
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,343
The investigation comes back with proof that the fire was an accident

1037
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,927
But that's not nearly as a pet

1038
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
Effective they will squandered an opportunity

1039
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Rile up Their audience

1040
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,863
With this speculation

1041
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,887
Nearly isn't packed

1042
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:40,191
I misunderstood I thought you meant

1043
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:45,567
And afterwards doesn't matter

1044
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
How to do the cover-up Ark

1045
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,615
Not as

1046
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Emotion

1047
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
Initially in the investigation

1048
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,087
X Factor with proof it let's say Isis that Notre Dame on fire

1049
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,623
The visceral emotional

1050
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,903
Responsible have worn off

1051
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
On the radio

1052
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
It'll be hard to whip them up into

1053
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
The same level of

1054
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,815
The stereo they were able to hit the moment after an emotionally resume

1055
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:11,935
And listen problem with the cover-up

1056
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,775
Vindication and being always right forever

1057
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:22,175
Guess who's a nautical now Notre Dame

1058
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:27,039
F*** you you know so this is part of the game that's being done and this is what Alex

1059
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063
Is

1060
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Engaged

1061
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
His own webs

1062
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,647
Posted

1063
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,415
It is based on

1064
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,463
To try and claim that space

1065
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
Early on

1066
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
F*****'-a

1067
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,399
You're the worst right respond on Twitter or

1068
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,727
Respond on these talking-head shows this rank speculation

1069
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,055
Specifically

1070
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
To point the finger at Muslim

1071
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,383
When they respond by saying

1072
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,431
Hey look you know Dalton

1073
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:58,015
We don't want to get into that sort of thing

1074
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
Yeah

1075
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,183
I was afraid of an investigation it was an accident

1076
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
When in reality

1077
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:07,999
Just a f****** stupid

1078
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
The dance

1079
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:12,607
Who played what I actually

1080
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
I actually cried

1081
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
Yesterday

1082
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,727
Because my girlfriend I just started

1083
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
The Twilight Zone

1084
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,359
And they hadn't liked her first four seasons were dropped onto the net

1085
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,199
So I was like all of The Twilight Zone

1086
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:29,503
And when we got to the monster on Maple

1087
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Do you remember that one

1088
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,855
That's the one where it's this idyllic

1089
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
Little night

1090
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,927
Eisenhower suburb

1091
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:39,231
And all the sudden just all the power goes out

1092
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,071
Moment everybody starts picking

1093
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,351
Can get each other and I

1094
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,375
Just watching this going like

1095
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
This was nice

1096
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
1860

1097
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
T2 whatever

1098
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:50,751
That this was recorded I'm crying because this

1099
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,287
The same f****** s***

1100
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,591
It's like Twitter turned into that

1101
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:58,431
Entire place all day everyday

1102
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
Respond to things better and not let

1103
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,599
Autopilot

1104
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,183
Watching Twilight Zone episode

1105
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:17,375
Jordan if I didn't point out that we're recording this on Sunday and late last night

1106
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,655
Multiple bombs went off in

1107
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,679
Churches and hotels in

1108
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,447
Sri Lanka

1109
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:25,055
Time does recording many of the details are still

1110
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,335
Materially reporting any

1111
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,431
Nope throughout all this last week Alex has been yelling about Isis

1112
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
We heard it

1113
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,319
Before

1114
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Easter egg

1115
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,903
Well maybe what ended up happening

1116
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,695
Right we don't know but that might be

1117
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:45,023
Write on a technical level about that prediction

1118
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,679
Mainstream Outlets are reporting a no group has taken responsibility and it's unclear who's behind it

1119
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,751
Complete assholes like Robert Spencer of jihad watch

1120
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:00,127
Cowboy one of Anders Breivik most-cited resources in his Manifesto

1121
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:06,271
Are posting things like reports suggest that suicide bombers might have been

1122
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:10,367
And then he says people's names who I'm not going to repeat cuz I have no idea where

1123
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,391
Trump

1124
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,279
And it could possibly be playing the cigarette people who I have nothing to do with anything

1125
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,375
Fifty-fifty at best

1126
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
Here's the thing

1127
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:27,007
This is awful and complete tragedy

1128
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Exactly

1129
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,591
But if you smoke

1130
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
That doesn't

1131
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,687
The perpetrators of the

1132
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,991
Days ago I thought

1133
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Horrible brutal terrorist

1134
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,575
But has no place in our society

1135
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,903
Leave a long history of killing civilians and terrorizing population

1136
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,695
I work against that is a valuable

1137
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Google

1138
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,999
I still think that today

1139
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,911
Minimize this or not care about

1140
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,311
You all knew that Isis was capable of that

1141
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:05,407
A month ago remember when they put out YouTube videos

1142
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,735
Cutting people's like literally decapitating people

1143
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,551
I never would have expected this Behavior out of those

1144
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:13,087
Right

1145
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,671
Yeah exactly

1146
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,791
It's not to minimize the damage that they've done know how can you possibly use this

1147
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,071
As some sort of

1148
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
Extra amplify

1149
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
Application of your hatred of Isis information comes out

1150
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
If it does turn out that it is

1151
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:33,567
Attack that was

1152
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,615
I will

1153
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
Field

1154
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,919
You know this thing

1155
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:44,575
One more one more

1156
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,647
Now at this point Edward recording this on Sunday

1157
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,463
An article with the sub-headline

1158
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,511
Quote Islamic suicide bombers launched

1159
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:53,279
Attacks on

1160
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,047
Shepherd Church

1161
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:55,839
About the attack

1162
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:59,167
Which is actually just a copy and paste of an article

1163
00:53:59,423 --> 00:53:59,935
Zerohedge

1164
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
God dammit

1165
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,471
Your problem

1166
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,055
Islamic suicide bombers

1167
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:08,383
Alison Infowars just added that to this article

1168
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,663
The closest

1169
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,967
Zerohedge articles

1170
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
Cost of this is quote

1171
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:17,343
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the deadly Easter morning attack

1172
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,879
Those Sri Lanka

1173
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:23,999
Christians as a sizable minority of about 8% have reported an uptick in person

1174
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,023
Threats coming

1175
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:25,791
A Muslim

1176
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:28,351
And majority Buddhists population

1177
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,119
In the country

1178
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:29,887
So

1179
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,703
That is the closest that the Zero Hedge article comes to

1180
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
Alex Jones

1181
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
The sub-headline

1182
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:38,079
Quote Islamic suicide bombers launched

1183
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
Tax on 3

1184
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,151
That is not in the source

1185
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,687
Material that is Alex adding

1186
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,711
A hundred percent

1187
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,783
The only coverage

1188
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,831
An attack so far on Infowars

1189
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,647
Another copy and pasted article this one for Breitbart

1190
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
About how the pope denounced the

1191
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:54,463
Cool violence

1192
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,255
That's better

1193
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:01,375
Kind of silly that Alex run Astoria

1194
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,447
But I'm yelling about how the pope is involved in the global child sex

1195
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,471
Extravagant

1196
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
But he's free to run his business Howie's

1197
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:12,127
The problem here is that the Infowars article has this headline

1198
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:16,479
Quotes over 200 dead by Islamic suicide bombers hundreds more injured

1199
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
I think you can already guess this

1200
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:22,367
The attack was carried out by Islamic

1201
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,135
Suicide bomb

1202
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
It's not even a Breitbart

1203
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,975
Story gets published

1204
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,535
Just a copy and paste a report from the associated

1205
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,375
Depressed it's mostly just about how the pope is praying for the children

1206
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
German

1207
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
He's around the world

1208
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
Replace vial

1209
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,239
Are very basic level

1210
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,007
Superbad

1211
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,591
It could turn out that this attack remembers of Isis

1212
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,431
Alex has no reason

1213
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
Other than to push the narrative

1214
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,087
He could editorialize something like quote I bet this was suicide bomber

1215
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,135
But he's not doing that

1216
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
He's copying pasting other people's articles

1217
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,487
Conclusions to them

1218
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,559
Even if it's hunched ends up being accurate his journalistic track

1219
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Actresses are unacceptable

1220
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,631
I need to be ashamed of himself for doing

1221
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
Is Bartos

1222
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,751
Respect and flip

1223
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,799
Is he literally copying and paste

1224
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:19,455
Like he's not he's not rewriting posting on Infowars

1225
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
The text of the article

1226
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:25,599
Byline

1227
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,647
But yeah it's just

1228
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,719
I don't know if they have

1229
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:34,047
Agreement where he's allowed to do that or if he's doing it

1230
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:39,423
Without permission I don't know that Alex

1231
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,959
Used all those artsy articles.

1232
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,263
Marty wasn't super happy about

1233
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,567
But I don't know if you could have an arrangement

1234
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Zerohedge

1235
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,711
I don't know it's really really f***** up that Alex is taking

1236
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
Stories

1237
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,527
And adding his own self headlines

1238
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,343
Have nothing to do with the content

1239
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,111
Of the story

1240
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,159
Is his source

1241
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,719
It's

1242
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
It's framing

1243
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
Of the story

1244
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
That's inappropriate

1245
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,423
Is that something

1246
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:17,311
Opening practice

1247
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,615
Two-story too much

1248
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,407
Time spent

1249
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,223
Focusing on drugs are researching his practices

1250
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,271
I know that he does write his own

1251
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,575
Pretty stories and sometimes their B

1252
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,599
Sensationalizing

1253
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,135
Sucks but I don't know if

1254
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,975
I don't know

1255
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
Like

1256
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,791
Something of a progenitor of this type

1257
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:45,471
It could be it could be that Alex has taken his game and gone much further

1258
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,775
You see what's going on

1259
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
The initial thrust

1260
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,943
To control the story

1261
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
Control the story

1262
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
Box it into our narrative

1263
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,319
A story from the Associated Press

1264
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,367
The Breitbart is copied and then Alex

1265
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,927
To copy from Breitbart from the copy from the Associated Press

1266
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
About the pope praying for the world

1267
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:09,023
4 piece is now turned into

1268
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,583
Sub-headline of Islamic suicide bombers

1269
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Committed this

1270
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
With no other

1271
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Gross

1272
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,471
Listen

1273
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:18,751
Picked up

1274
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,127
Get picked up by an amplifies it with three different

1275
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,223
Watson was doing

1276
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:30,271
Immediately after Notre Dame

1277
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Was caught on fire

1278
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,647
It is their business practice this is how this works

1279
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:38,719
But of course

1280
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,935
Islamic groups and we're going to Target

1281
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,359
That's

1282
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,151
That is absolutely

1283
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
No one

1284
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,087
Cuz there are investigators the best

1285
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Specifically

1286
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,879
Please don't invest

1287
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,463
What we would prefer regular people

1288
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:17,119
Like he's not going to be able to go into the cathedral and like look at he doesn't he's not a f******

1289
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
Fire Marshal

1290
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:25,311
Press pass in his little cap

1291
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,127
I would like to investigate this

1292
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
You can investigate

1293
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
Tweets

1294
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,831
No one's going to stop you from that but like

1295
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,183
Just the very idea that he's presenting it as anyone is saying

1296
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Stop invest

1297
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,791
Towards the people

1298
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:49,375
French officials or something

1299
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:50,911
I'm soaked

1300
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,191
Because Alec

1301
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:54,239
Just like we talked about earlier

1302
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
He does see this as

1303
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
Something of

1304
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
A crusade

1305
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,871
Because a modern-day Christian

1306
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,223
We got videos

1307
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,271
Lookout app high rise window in

1308
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,063
405

1309
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:13,695
Running around

1310
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:16,767
Molotov cocktail

1311
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:26,239
You'll have 500 is running around and they'll just go down street

1312
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
Is that Bernie

1313
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,999
You just presenting islamism

1314
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,863
It's not a it's not a good way to look at

1315
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:57,215
Alex

1316
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:57,983
Call

1317
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,543
To worry is the idea that all of these folks are

1318
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,567
You're coming in

1319
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,335
Right

1320
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,127
They're all

1321
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,967
Are coming into country

1322
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,831
It'll be bad enough if they just had it will but the reality is

1323
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,367
Is to Alex they're part of a bigger

1324
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
Plan

1325
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,415
And of course that plan

1326
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:17,951
Is being run by Soros

1327
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,535
This group is funded by George Soros

1328
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,071
Natural Nazi collaborator

1329
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:29,215
Well what they're trying to do is to get enough of dumb people to go out the tack white folks

1330
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,007
Start shooting back

1331
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,287
Second cause of Civil War

1332
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:38,943
So I understand the Pawns in this minorities are in the good news

1333
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,159
Bunch of professors that's the good January last year

1334
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,487
Secret

1335
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,047
Internal documents

1336
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,327
How to have

1337
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,935
In Maryland and other cities attack

1338
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
Reprieve

1339
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:07,615
Starbucks

1340
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,407
McDonald's

1341
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
They are actors

1342
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,111
Yul Brynner

1343
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:22,719
It's this is all just b******* that he's making up editorializing on those fake

1344
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,255
Contractility found on Fortune

1345
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:27,327
This is

1346
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,935
Completely ludicrous fake documents that he found as evidence

1347
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:33,215
Global

1348
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:38,079
In order to cause minorities to attack white people to cause a civil war

1349
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:44,223
This is f****** stupid so bad I'm trying to understand this plan

1350
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,551
You get professors

1351
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Right

1352
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,623
Wearing all black that's important

1353
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
And they

1354
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:58,047
Knock over trash cans outside of Starbucks because there's an arrangement

1355
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
Starbucks

1356
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:03,679
Maybe they haven't baby there are always

1357
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:11,103
Maybe there's a f****** billion of them

1358
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
Maybe they like you know

1359
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,199
Locally-grown

1360
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Boutique coffee shops

1361
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:22,367
I don't know it's stupid it's all just a stupid fake Soros antifa document

1362
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,927
That's a Harrison Smith found on 4chan

1363
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
It Alex is just

1364
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,999
Gracefully pretended is real

1365
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:34,399
Cuz I get looking like the very f****** idea that you would make

1366
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,495
Make someone sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to be like part of a

1367
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Criminal

1368
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Conspiracy

1369
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:46,687
In order to overthrow the country and start a civil war is laughable this f****** idea is not

1370
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
Nonsensical

1371
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:51,039
Anybody involved in that kind of a criminal conspiracy would know that

1372
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:56,927
In no way protected by an entity

1373
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:03,327
That was it was weird with Steven Soderbergh left on Ocean's 11

1374
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,631
Sign an NDA and they had to do the whole thing

1375
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
I was really surprised

1376
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:11,263
Underpinnings of the police

1377
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
Reinforces

1378
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,591
His ability

1379
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,895
Horrible

1380
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,271
And you just laugh them off if they

1381
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Reinforce

1382
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,647
Assertive the things that hold up the big

1383
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Which is

1384
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
The bomber

1385
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,767
Alex

1386
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,559
Get sidetracked by

1387
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
Cuz he's got it

1388
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,655
Most of his peace

1389
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:44,031
About the Notre Dame fire

1390
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,103
He doesn't talk about it that much

1391
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,687
Of the big news of last week

1392
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,063
He gets into some other stuff

1393
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:57,087
Here's one of them

1394
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
Potable

1395
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:05,023
What's wrong with this picture right here

1396
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,583
Torrid.com

1397
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:13,215
Putting American flags on police cars Sparks backlash

1398
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,031
People don't like

1399
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,823
American flag

1400
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,807
It's a racist evil symbol

1401
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,855
Sounds like that rid of that flag

1402
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,879
Sounds like

1403
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:34,463
So a lot of the reporting on this story outside of even Alex's

1404
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
Stupid show isn't pretty

1405
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
What's the mark

1406
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:41,887
Circle around that idea that the flag is seen as an intimidating symbol to immigrants

1407
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,911
Or some s*** like that

1408
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Septimus reporting

1409
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,751
From the original story in LA Times

1410
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,847
I just wanted to repaint Laguna Beach police cars with an image of the Americas

1411
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,175
Can fly grinding through lettering on the doors will return to the city council

1412
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
Tuesday

1413
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
After some residents

1414
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,503
Deemed it unfit for the artist

1415
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,271
Community

1416
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:03,903
Though most of the comments made by residents in recent months were about the squad cars newest Tech

1417
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:07,487
Online reaction in recent days characterize the debate

1418
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
Supporters again

1419
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Mater

1420
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,167
Thoreau said Monday the council is

1421
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:20,031
Quote decision about the brightest colors

1422
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:26,687
But but the issue has evolved into a broader National conversation about tape

1423
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,527
So this is like

1424
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:36,927
This is like they have two graphic designers and one of them is like an American flag with a big

1425
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:42,815
What does a smaller American flag

1426
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
That's it

1427
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:49,215
American Woodburn

1428
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,287
The design scheme looks quote aggressive

1429
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:01,503
Candy with designs

1430
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,343
After idiots started attacking heard leaving more than 150 message

1431
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
Just quote via phone call text

1432
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
Voicemails and emails

1433
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,463
Explain what you was talkin about

1434
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,767
I don't really care too much about the

1435
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,559
Design other than what I said

1436
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:18,911
It's bad art I'm being attacked for that because the narrative

1437
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,727
Feed the fire of division which is what our culture has become

1438
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,311
Sojourn

1439
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,847
Laguna Beach Commission

1440
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Who designed for the

1441
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:36,063
Mayor pro tempore literally looks on the car

1442
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:42,463
Better on paper than it did on the cars

1443
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,791
So they put together a council meeting to sort out the artistic issue

1444
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,631
The fact that they were having a council meeting to re-evaluate the car's design

1445
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,959
Was intentionally misrepresented by people like Franklin Graham

1446
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:59,359
The Christian Broadcasting Network FOX News

1447
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
Protect

1448
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
Because the flag was never under attack

1449
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,015
When the flag is It ultimately removed from the cars all these Outlets

1450
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:09,087
Culture battle

1451
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:13,183
When in reality it only existed in their head climate change

1452
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:16,255
We need to go this can't be this is

1453
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
We're done

1454
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
So I'm out

1455
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Congratulations dumbass Patriots

1456
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,423
The flag from yet another imaginary threat

1457
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,703
From what I understand

1458
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,495
Customary celebration in their culture

1459
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
A times like these

1460
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Cheeses to make up

1461
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,615
So I look forward to

1462
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
Alright so

1463
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,967
We we have the new design for the cars

1464
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,015
American flags going to be on

1465
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,295
I think we need to

1466
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,831
To take it back though

1467
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
I took account

1468
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,391
The car is a ridge

1469
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Orange

1470
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:50,815
So I don't think you want to put that

1471
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,375
The only complaint that I saw from

1472
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,655
Mike primary reporting

1473
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,935
About the

1474
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:56,959
The flag

1475
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,007
Itself was from some

1476
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
My buddy who was

1477
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,567
The point that

1478
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,359
The way that the red white

1479
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,687
Blue of the flag is presented in the letters

1480
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,223
Ice in police

1481
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,271
Display three letters are mostly read

1482
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,575
There was like a feeling of

1483
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
This aesthetically doesn't it

1484
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,159
Feel good

1485
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,439
Different

1486
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,975
It's between the pool and the ice

1487
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:21,791
In the color scheme

1488
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
Which

1489
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,607
I certainly

1490
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,631
See what they were saying

1491
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,167
If you look at the cars it is

1492
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
Ice is

1493
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
Predominantly

1494
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:36,895
It sticks out more in the eyes of the police

1495
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
Word based on the design

1496
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:42,783
So even that could be an aesthetic argument less an argument at the flagship

1497
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
So whatever

1498
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,367
Who cares this is all bulshit

1499
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,647
Ridiculous

1500
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,415
Hate that

1501
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:49,439
So much

1502
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,767
F****** b*******

1503
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
Imaginary battles

1504
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
Imaginary victories

1505
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,631
Because Alex is never wrong and

1506
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:58,399
He's very hard to pull

1507
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,703
Guys calm it down

1508
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,239
So here's the next one

1509
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
He gets to

1510
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,335
Clip of Tucker Carlson

1511
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:09,151
Talking about Alana Omar

1512
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
But Mike down

1513
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,991
Because what Alex

1514
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:19,391
Tucker Carlson

1515
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Gunship

1516
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Assault

1517
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
Everyday

1518
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:42,687
Many ways things were injured growing up in a refugee camp

1519
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
Quotes

1520
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:49,855
When you're a kid

1521
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:56,255
There is freedom in knowing that you were accepted

1522
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:08,799
Representative Omar is incredibly disgusting

1523
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,383
She's here to conquer the country and thesaurus

1524
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,687
Anger to do so is pretty dangerous talk

1525
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:18,783
Aggressively anti-islam character of his

1526
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Entire show

1527
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,391
Play this clip of Tucker Carlson being a

1528
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Dick and then

1529
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,463
Which I find a Presa vintage

1530
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,023
But I want to address the propaganda

1531
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,559
Autocracy

1532
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,607
Performance

1533
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
She never said that America is

1534
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,959
People that she feels threatened

1535
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,751
Demonized

1536
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,799
Are the articles

1537
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
It's challenging

1538
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,847
She says of living at present

1539
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:45,151
Where is Heritage

1540
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
Just constantly criticize

1541
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,783
Everyday a part of your identity is threatened

1542
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
Demonized

1543
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,319
And vilify

1544
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,367
Trump is tapping into an ugly part of our

1545
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:56,159
And freeing is ugly

1546
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,695
It's been a challenge

1547
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
To try and figure out how to

1548
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
Continue the inclusion

1549
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:04,351
How to show up every day and make sure the people who identify with all the marginalized

1550
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,143
Kerry Hill represented

1551
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
It's transitioning from the idea of

1552
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:11,007
Resisting to insisting in upholding the value

1553
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,799
We share that this is us

1554
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:13,567
Society that

1555
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,591
Was built on the idea that

1556
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
Start anew

1557
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,151
Celebrate

1558
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,175
Immigrant heritage

1559
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,479
So you can already see the twist

1560
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,271
He's done by a cherry picking

1561
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
Deliberately

1562
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
No matter what you

1563
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
You do no matter what

1564
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,303
You say

1565
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:35,327
6 words

1566
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,631
Rip it out and say that you hate America

1567
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,167
Even if you're into even if

1568
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:43,263
You wrote an entire novel book about how

1569
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,823
America 100%

1570
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,895
If you even mention of fault it's going to be like

1571
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:56,831
If you don't love every single part of America especially the part where everyday on Twitter

1572
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:03,743
And then whatever you f****** turn your TV on at night Carlson says that you're a terrorist

1573
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:06,303
In-N-Out

1574
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,887
Bright

1575
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:17,567
Assault on her part of it

1576
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
Is doing here because

1577
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
What you talkin about is

1578
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,151
Pieces of your identity

1579
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:22,687
Assault

1580
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,735
Threatened

1581
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,271
These pieces of yourself

1582
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:29,599
You were proud of and are proud of an are apart of

1583
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,647
It's a different thing

1584
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
It's very slightly different but it's important

1585
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
The cheat sometimes

1586
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,863
I can't go to work or it's hard to go to work

1587
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,167
Message there is what he was

1588
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,191
Misrepresenting

1589
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,727
She saying that it's a challenge

1590
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:48,031
Chance to try and figure out how to show up everyday

1591
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,847
And make sure the people who identify with all the marginalized

1592
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:52,895
Representative

1593
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,431
To go to work

1594
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
Figure out how

1595
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
To carry

1596
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
This

1597
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:01,599
Temptation and make sure that the people who have these identities

1598
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,647
Tucker do you know what the challenges

1599
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,695
Dealing with your boss

1600
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,279
She never got discouraged

1601
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
By your b*******

1602
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,351
Stop showing up to work everyday

1603
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
I will fight

1604
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,471
She never says that things are easier for her growing up in a refugee

1605
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:23,615
America is a black Muslim

1606
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,383
Registered

1607
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,919
He just

1608
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Conflict

1609
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
Society

1610
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Wichita

1611
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,159
Girl child

1612
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:39,231
Who just survived a f****** Civil War

1613
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,767
What you said

1614
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:41,535
Introspective

1615
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:42,559
It's not judgemental

1616
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
Not bitter

1617
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,607
It's completely reason

1618
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:46,911
Tucker Carlson is absolutely one

1619
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
100-percent twisting

1620
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Taking everything

1621
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,495
You said in this article out of

1622
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:54,079
Image that helado bar hates America

1623
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,151
This place is long for the days of the refugee

1624
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:59,455
Where everyone around her were black and buzzing

1625
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,015
The passage

1626
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:04,063
Discomfort you felt better identity

1627
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
12 year old

1628
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:08,415
Is part of a paragraph that also contains Omar quote

1629
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
Optimism

1630
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,767
Their father grand-father imparted to her after her

1631
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:13,535
Her mother died

1632
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,815
When she was 2 years old

1633
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Quotes

1634
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,607
Today does not

1635
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Determine your tomorrow

1636
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,191
Her discussion of her experience with a hope

1637
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,983
It was an expression of

1638
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,519
Natureware society and

1639
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
With each other

1640
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,639
We twist this into an over

1641
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,431
Xenophobic

1642
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,223
Absolute

1643
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Disgrace

1644
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:36,063
Only surpassed by his commentary on it

1645
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,511
That's a 12 combo that I that I

1646
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,559
A real bummer

1647
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,423
I'm interested to know

1648
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,471
Nae can't be true but

1649
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
The writers for Tucker

1650
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,543
Richarlison

1651
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:57,567
Knows who they are

1652
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,407
Right I mean they're probably

1653
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:06,783
Tucker Carlson isn't extemporize into extemporaneously

1654
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:10,367
Writers over

1655
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,159
If you did a lot of the right

1656
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:20,607
Where's my real ones

1657
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,167
Putting this s*** out there and bake just get away

1658
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,871
One of that like some sort of writer or some form of writer found this article in Vogue

1659
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
Brought it to the table

1660
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,687
Yeah that's interesting

1661
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,759
Focus more on Tucker we would know those writers

1662
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,695
Yeah I wonder it just seems like this

1663
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,719
Exorcism

1664
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
Kind of gift

1665
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:56,447
The face man

1666
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,055
For the 17th

1667
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
See what happened but I

1668
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
Or the entry

1669
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Because

1670
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
The 18th

1671
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Thursday

1672
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:07,455
The Mueller report

1673
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,783
Episode

1674
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,551
For Monday

1675
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,111
If we're covering the present-day while you were on a f******

1676
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:17,439
Beach in Mexico

1677
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:18,975
That wasn't getting

1678
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,791
You f****** s*** stolen from

1679
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:28,191
That definitely wasn't taken

1680
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:34,591
Yeah I know my girlfriend the Mustang

1681
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:38,943
Lucifer

1682
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,551
You're going to love the story and I gave her the whole long list of like internet articles

1683
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,319
Read about it

1684
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,135
For 5 minutes

1685
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:53,791
Did you give me a list of the articles about what the actual symbolism about the artist father run

1686
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,351
Edwards

1687
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:02,751
Just making sure you didn't just go

1688
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:04,031
Murals

1689
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,311
You up

1690
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:10,175
Denver Airport

1691
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,455
Security twice though in that

1692
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,271
Vine

1693
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Fair enough

1694
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
Two ways

1695
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:25,023
Notre Dame was on fire

1696
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:29,119
Have to be part of this

1697
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
17

1698
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
Get back

1699
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
We're moving on to the A-Team

1700
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,543
Makes pretty clear

1701
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
He hasn't read it but

1702
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:43,455
But he knows what's up

1703
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,855
Latimer here on my desk we've already been scanning through it

1704
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,207
It's really just confirming everything we already knew

1705
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,375
Giant

1706
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:04,959
We elect a president

1707
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
An overthrow

1708
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,311
The election of the people

1709
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,335
So

1710
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Cool

1711
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
First of all

1712
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
Kind already

1713
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
Like months ago

1714
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
We knew what his angle

1715
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,999
For this really I think this is probably a little bit

1716
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
Is

1717
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,143
It just came out

1718
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,959
Everett

1719
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
If I were him

1720
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,543
I probably would have had someone fill in

1721
01:19:40,799 --> 01:19:42,591
And taking an hour or two or whatever

1722
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
And no more about it

1723
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:50,271
Instead what he does is just

1724
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,415
He basically did a bar

1725
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:00,511
Whatever I wanted to say

1726
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,071
Let's not worry about it I'm going to give you shorts

1727
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
2

1728
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,959
Reinforced whatever you want

1729
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:10,239
Namely that is

1730
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:14,848
It's basically a cover-up and the Democrats are the ones who were guilty all along

1731
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
Hillary uranium

1732
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:20,736
Yeah the Mueller report was always going to say what we said it was going to

1733
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
It's not all that interesting

1734
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,600
But there's a couple things to do come up and its coverage

1735
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,392
Char

1736
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,184
Interesting eating of themselves

1737
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,488
Less about his

1738
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,536
His feelings on the the report

1739
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,584
And yours one of them

1740
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Different ways to say

1741
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,424
Say balls

1742
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:47,104
The Democrats Rod Rosenstein

1743
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,712
The Bruce

1744
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,088
The cojones

1745
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,440
Meaning of the testicles

1746
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
The short hairs

1747
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,328
The balls

1748
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
That's pretty fun

1749
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,336
The Tulips

1750
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:22,176
Do you know what I'm saying

1751
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,736
Alex

1752
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:30,368
Do in lieu of actually knowing anything

1753
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,672
About the report

1754
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,232
William Barr press conference

1755
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,448
About the announcement

1756
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
That's fine

1757
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
His justification

1758
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,312
For doing it

1759
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,408
The best comeback on the other side

1760
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,736
Adjust play the press conference end-to-end

1761
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,528
With a few stops

1762
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,320
Open contacts to it

1763
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:02,880
The best

1764
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:09,280
That's what I regular old smart new show would do so weird

1765
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,816
Press conference

1766
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:17,216
Because that's what a normal smartpress

1767
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:24,640
Brian stelter

1768
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:28,992
Absolutely

1769
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,856
So Alex doesn't

1770
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,440
Kipling press conference

1771
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
That's

1772
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
York Times

1773
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:48,192
Two-piece about me the next hour cuz it's show Illustrated

1774
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
Panache

1775
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,872
In WeChat

1776
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:58,176
The consolation

1777
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,992
Prizes destroying Alex Jones

1778
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:06,624
Of losers that are hurting America

1779
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,416
And prosperity

1780
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,696
I hate America

1781
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
Sounds right

1782
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,792
Listen York Times article analysis talk about ism

1783
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:14,816
About his death is

1784
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:19,936
The headline is Alex Jones under oath is an anecdote to the Post

1785
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Truth age

1786
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:25,312
Hey Gardino my feelings about this article already named leave at the premises a failure

1787
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,360
So wherever it goes from there doesn't really matter

1788
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:36,064
Quote the hundreds of thousands of views on these videos

1789
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,880
To their appeal as a hashtag resistance

1790
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:39,648
Consolation

1791
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,416
Emprise

1792
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:45,280
Maybe it's not habitually lying president but at least someone is getting called to account under

1793
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,840
Application of America

1794
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,912
This isn't talking about destroying Alex

1795
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:55,008
Trumped if anything it's expressing a very understanding

1796
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,824
Little desire to see

1797
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,104
Be forced to exist

1798
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,128
In space where they

1799
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,152
Not lie

1800
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,968
Of course the fact that Alex being under oath is ultimately

1801
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
Meaning listen

1802
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:05,760
Simple deposition

1803
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,296
And the fact that he knew that and

1804
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,856
Need to lie Pretty consistently in the deposition

1805
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
Should be evident

1806
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
What's that if anyone took the Alex deposition

1807
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
Consolation prize for

1808
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,280
They're not dealing with reality

1809
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
So I don't

1810
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:25,984
He's going to get back to complaining about it later we'll see what happens

1811
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
To him sooner

1812
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:30,336
Complaints about this article Zoe

1813
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
The times

1814
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,152
Is that they talk about how Alex

1815
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,944
I got grilled about things

1816
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,248
Hook

1817
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,784
And that was

1818
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,672
They say that I'm making it up

1819
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:49,024
Camouflage

1820
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,328
Newscast

1821
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,984
But show it all eyes are rolling

1822
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,520
With everything I say

1823
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,056
This is

1824
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:09,504
A little bit later about something we're about to see

1825
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:15,904
See things go way off the rails

1826
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:18,720
It's towards the end of this episode

1827
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,256
I completely blows my mind

1828
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,792
It worries me

1829
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,352
But also as it like a sketch

1830
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
I think it's hilarious

1831
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
Also

1832
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:41,760
Philosophy professor

1833
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,040
Mark

1834
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,136
Pronounce this

1835
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
Lamparello

1836
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,440
That's real talk

1837
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,056
Police while I was just trying to

1838
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:07,616
Call

1839
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976

1840
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,864
That I had

1841
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:41,920
Not just among

1842
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:48,576
Philosophy professor.

1843
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,160
Burn down

1844
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:57,792
Leo zagami is

1845
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,400
Illuminati Insider

1846
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:05,216
But you also is one of Alex's big resources

1847
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,520
Catholic narrative

1848
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,800
It's about the ideas

1849
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:15,200
Sex chapter

1850
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,760
Church narrative

1851
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,808
What's the through line

1852
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,720
Throw it on the wall

1853
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:34,656
This guy Barclay a ellos a 37 year old college professor

1854
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,448
Who's simultaneously also

1855
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,216
Student desk

1856
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:37,984
CU NY

1857
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Pursuing

1858
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,312
I can find no evidence

1859
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:42,592
What is a leftist

1860
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Anybody

1861
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
Pursuing a degree in philosophy

1862
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:55,648
Stefan molyneux

1863
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:58,464
As someone who was a sloth

1864
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,488
I can detach

1865
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,936
There's a lot of philosophy

1866
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,520
A lot of directions

1867
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,688
I'm not sure but nothing I can find gives me

1868
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,296
Whatever his politics are was arrested after walking

1869
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:26,368
Patrick's Cathedral in New York

1870
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,672
Two bottles of lighter fluid it's a barbeque lighter

1871
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,464
Those long lighters

1872
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:36,352
I would call this by the police who are able to clearly

1873
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:43,264
Thrown out of the the cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in New York Newark New Jersey

1874
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,032
Prior

1875
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:47,104
Because the scene at the church and refused to leave after repeated requests

1876
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,152
Ultimately on the floor

1877
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,992
He was arrested for trespassing

1878
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
Resisting arrest

1879
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
With a court date scheduled for May

1880
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,856
He arrived at st. Patrick

1881
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,648
Funeral on Wednesday night

1882
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:02,464
Suspiciously purchased a one-way ticket to Rome

1883
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,536
Shows leaving from Newark on Thursday

1884
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,120
You don't so cancel classes

1885
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:12,704
Supposed to

1886
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,264
Call claiming that he was sick

1887
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
So

1888
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:20,640
12

1889
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,200
Emily is very

1890
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,600
Upset with the investigation is still ongoing is still in progress

1891
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,928
Doesn't look good

1892
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:35,488
There's a very decent

1893
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:43,168
I was just going to

1894
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:49,312
About time saying that it was that is what you said

1895
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,176
What is motivation was is anyone's guess

1896
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
White Witch

1897
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,736
To cover this

1898
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:04,160
I'm in his article about Mark

1899
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:04,928
From a heavy

1900
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:05,952
Call about him

1901
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,584
Twitter and underneath

1902
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,608
Completely out of

1903
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:15,168
Video of a Muslim Church

1904
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,448
Which is plaintiff

1905
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,472
Either from 20

1906
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,008
From August 4th

1907
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,032
28

1908
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,872
Depending on which part of the body of the article you look at it

1909
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,432
In the article itself

1910
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:33,088
They have two different things for the video

1911
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:39,488
You look in the artist video that is unrelated to this particular incident

1912
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:43,584
Unrelated

1913
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,632
2DS story home

1914
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:47,680
Videos

1915
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,472
Permit account whose name is storm

1916
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,520
Trooper with three American flags after

1917
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:57,920
That's pretty much a Muslim

1918
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,456
Did the United States

1919
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,248
Is Venus mostly just

1920
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,296
Read tweets from Mogadishu

1921
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,648
Interesting is that

1922
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,672
16.6

1923
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,952
Thousand followers

1924
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,720
And yeah whatever

1925
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,256
Self

1926
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,304
We struggled to get any kind of

1927
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
Which makes me think is accounting

1928
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:16,864
Kind of in a facade

1929
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,680
It just seems like a

1930
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:21,984
Voice article

1931
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:26,592
Concludes with the Paul Joseph Watson video about how Muslims were celebrating the Notre Dame fire

1932
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,944
Based pretty much entirely on his crack investigation of Facebook smiley faces

1933
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,736
That we talked about a little bit earlier

1934
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,808
Well here's an Intrepid reporter

1935
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:39,904
Interested in the story about Mark lamprell

1936
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:43,488
They're only interested in using it as a waypoint

1937
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:46,304
To what they want to talk about namely that Muslim

1938
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,096
Even though that has literally nothing to do with

1939
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:50,144
The story this article is supposedly

1940
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,216
Also you know how I told you that a war story about the

1941
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:53,984
This guy's really just

1942
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
Copy and paste

1943
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:59,872
The article includes this passage

1944
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,944
Forgot to mention there are two

1945
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,224
On Reddit

1946
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,248
Quote response

1947
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:10,368
Story in 2018 about people disliking President Donald Trump more than

1948
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
Merkel

1949
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:15,232
He wrote quote all I know is it the French just like us for something

1950
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,024
We must be doing something right

1951
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:20,096
They think they're so much more sophisticated and culturally alluring enough

1952
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,400
But secretly they're jealous of us in water.

1953
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,448
Never forget that fellow Americans

1954
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:30,848
Oh boy sounds like doesn't sound like a demon left really doesn't sound like a leftist

1955
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:35,712
Demon left us to hate any leftist Dino that would say something

1956
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:41,600
What's the French just like us

1957
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,696
Yeah usually reluctant usually

1958
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,488
Surrender monkeys ironic

1959
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,048
It's a it's a fun little switch up

1960
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,096
Interesting is

1961
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:57,216
Absent from any of his coverage this guy went to Saint Patrick

1962
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:01,056
Cathedral in New York lighter fluid lighters

1963
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:05,408
Try and talk about these unrelated

1964
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:06,688
Muslim

1965
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
Fire

1966
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:10,784
Situation

1967
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
Of Muslim

1968
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
Other

1969
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,816
The coverage is really seems like

1970
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:28,960
Don't talk about the show that I've heard or it on their website

1971
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Week Holden

1972
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,056
The 21 year-old son of a sheriff's deputy

1973
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,848
Setting fire to 3

1974
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,872
Historically Africa

1975
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,640
American Church

1976
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,664
Doesn't Louisiana

1977
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
Matthews has pled not guilty but

1978
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:44,320
The fire marshal has provided evidence including cell phone tower records showing the Matthews was

1979
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,600
Ff3 churches

1980
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
And images recovered

1981
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:50,720
His phone of the church is on fire before firefighters arrived

1982
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:58,400
We have got to get a higher class of criminal

1983
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:04,800
You know it is until proven guilty

1984
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:13,504
That was

1985
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,576
Three hate crime charges have also been filed against

1986
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:19,904
The prosecution is indicated they have evidence

1987
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,928
Motive

1988
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,512
A search of Infowars website for the name Holden Matthews

1989
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:26,304
Yielded zero results

1990
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:30,912
The same is true of newswars and Paul Joseph Watson stomach.

1991
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,960
Not at all

1992
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,496
Did you know they're small operation

1993
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:37,568
The time to cover all the news

1994
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,152
There's a lot of other stuff that they didn't cover why aren't you talking about that

1995
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:44,736
Like I in Chicago

1996
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:49,600
Are you kidding me we don't have time to cover that why would we cover these historically black church

1997
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,136
Churches being burned out by white supremacy

1998
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,976
It slightly less relevant to the

1999
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:58,560
The topic is other articles you're writing about fire and

2000
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:05,728
The intersection thereof

2001
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,288
With right now

2002
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:12,128
Never expect

2003
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,664
But I would expect him to

2004
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,480
Use those as act like it's a false flag

2005
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:21,088
Muslims really dated

2006
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,368
Other narrative

2007
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:29,024
Cuz he's always

2008
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,424
Here's what they're going to do they're going to come for him to be like

2009
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:44,896
The drugs he plays video games and all that stuff literally every episode

2010
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:48,480
Maybe I missed

2011
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Stupid if you

2012
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,016
Researches website

2013
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
Nothing

2014
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
So now finally Alex

2015
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,648
Give two bars Prescott

2016
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:05,120
And the FBI

2017
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:10,496
Leftist groups were funding the fake pee pee dossier BuzzFeed

2018
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,104
Michael Steele

2019
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,200
Yeah no I see mentions

2020
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,480
Thedirty.com

2021
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,760
I don't know

2022
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:25,856
I mean it comes up in the report

2023
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:26,624
The press conference

2024
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,672
I don't care for us to listen

2025
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:33,280
Too much of Alex licking Trump's boot by proxy lavished Praise on William Barr

2026
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,560
This press conference about to release

2027
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
The Mueller report

2028
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,704
We know how he would respond

2029
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
Who was taken in response

2030
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:46,336
Is there report

2031
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:50,432
If the report finds serious wrong

2032
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:55,808
There's no real world

2033
01:36:56,320 --> 01:36:57,088
Is the definition

2034
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,392
Trying to hold Sam's slipping through your fingers

2035
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,440
His idea of like a holic's

2036
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:03,744
Yeah this is the direction he's going

2037
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:07,840
There's not a whole lot

2038
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,632
What is Aries

2039
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,424
Super predictable I'm not all that interested

2040
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,752
I kind of feel like covering it is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic

2041
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,568
There's something more important that we could be doing

2042
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,664
Mainly discussing what the hell is Alex thinking supported William Barr

2043
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:26,272
What the f*** is you doing

2044
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,600
Oh Dad

2045
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:37,024
What's getting the history of William Carrick

2046
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:37,792
77

2047
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,864
Pretty f*****-up stretch of time to be in the CIA

2048
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:46,496
Watergate was unfolding all around president

2049
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:52,896
On top of that just released the Family Jewels reports the outline of the CIA totally

2050
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
It illegally spied on

2051
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Pizza purses

2052
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,504
Like members of the Black Panther

2053
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,528
Women's rights

2054
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,064
Israeli Embassy

2055
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,600
Are various anti-war

2056
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
Your response to these Revelations

2057
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,416
Republic

2058
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:06,976
Position

2059
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,256
Congressional investigation

2060
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,560
Good messed up time to be in the CIA

2061
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,608
Also 1976

2062
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,656
CIA

2063
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:19,008
George h.w. Bush was named director of Central Intelligence

2064
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,032
Interesting

2065
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:22,848
How is May 9th

2066
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:28,736
George h.w. Bush appointed William Barr Deputy Attorney General

2067
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:33,088
General on around that

2068
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:37,184
Time for HW that William Barr would be

2069
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:40,256
Parallel

2070
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:45,888
Attorney general report titled

2071
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:51,264
Which operation of justification

2072
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,288
Explode in the decade

2073
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:55,872
The 1992 report is laughable in its

2074
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:01,760
Ranging from things like we shouldn't release people from prison early because some people commit crimes after they're released early

2075
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:06,880
No one goes to prison for their first crime they're hardened criminals by the time they go in

2076
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:10,720
The basic point that bar is relying on to make his ark

2077
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:14,560
Incarceration go off they cause crime to go down

2078
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,888
The years of 1992 and numerous academic studies

2079
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,168
Have not been kind to this

2080
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:22,496
In 1992 the US held approximate

2081
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
600000

2082
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:24,800
People in state and federal

2083
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,872
Later that number was almost 1 million

2084
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
Can people hire

2085
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,712
In all fairness the upward Trend begin for bars

2086
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
And even more fairness

2087
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:36,320
He still has blood on his hands for how the report was used to

2088
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,112
Prison industrial complex

2089
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,672
Is one of the sections in his report is about how we need

2090
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,952
Need to build more prisons

2091
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:52,704
His solution is literally counter to one of Alex's acceptable firmly held belief steaming civilized

2092
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:57,568
Authority for asset forfeiture

2093
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:03,712
Literally used hundreds of millions of dollars from its asset forfeiture fund

2094
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,016
Have the office of National Drug control policy

2095
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:06,784
Special 44

2096
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,344
Construction of new federal prison

2097
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,928
Criminals to pay for prison

2098
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,488
Except

2099
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:17,536
Except for a lot of that stuff steak

2100
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,608
Itsfunneh

2101
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:24,192
Can sometimes just mean Injustice

2102
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:28,288
Do you mean you mean the evil one of Alex's websites Prison Planet

2103
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,176
Architect

2104
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:37,248
Who advocated using civil asset forfeiture

2105
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,528
Construction Amor prison

2106
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:40,320
Is now loaded as a hero too

2107
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,624
All it takes for the worst

2108
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,976
Monsters take a rehabilitated

2109
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,536
Alex Jones the stupid cowardly empty

2110
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,816
He stood over a dress shirt

2111
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:53,120
It's collar on button cuz it's big neck is

2112
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
Too f****** thick

2113
01:40:54,656 --> 01:41:00,800
He's always the worst the worst

2114
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,872
William Barr

2115
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:14,112
Owosso

2116
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:18,720
Effectively being instrumental in helping Bush cover up his own involvement

2117
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,584
This life New York Times writer William safire

2118
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,912
To give him the honorific title cover up General Barr

2119
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:31,776
Almost it's almost like there was something in his past that

2120
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,056
LED Trump

2121
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:35,360
Choosing him as the attorney

2122
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:40,224
I know it feels like that and honestly

2123
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,016
There may be something to it but

2124
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,552
It is it is like

2125
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:45,856
Yeah

2126
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,280
Wonder Woman

2127
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,144
Attorney General's office

2128
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,168
Has he started

2129
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,960
Working for a lot of

2130
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,008
Since

2131
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:09,408
How It's Made

2132
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:13,248
Attorney General

2133
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,672
AutoZone website

2134
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,744
Oh yeah

2135
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,328
Steve Watson Road Norco on December 10th 2018

2136
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,168
Is Attorney General

2137
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,448
The article quotes

2138
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:40,640
But I can the first things I've learned

2139
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,920
Very very true

2140
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:43,456
I'm disturbed

2141
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,272
Civil asset forfeiture

2142
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,296
Without a conviction

2143
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,368
As far as I can

2144
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,648
William Barr

2145
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,696
Has never appeared in an article on it

2146
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,744
Infowars newswars or prison

2147
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,024
Planet before

2148
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,096
2018 article by Steve Watson

2149
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,240
Completely ignore or dismiss

2150
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,264
Pre Trump career

2151
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,312
The idea that he has this all this

2152
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,336
Intense bag

2153
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:12,640
It only appears in this December

2154
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,688
2018 article by Steve Watson

2155
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,968
And I know

2156
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,624
Archives of articles on newswars

2157
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,928
Kind of Newark

2158
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:25,952
You can find stuff from

2159
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,256
Like early 2000

2160
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,144
You so preoccupied

2161
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:38,496
What William Barr advocated for

2162
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,544
Something about odd Bella bedfellows

2163
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,896
Cuz I believe Thomas Jefferson

2164
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:48,224
William Barr press conference

2165
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,016
Does being completely exonerated

2166
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:51,040
Ofcourse

2167
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,088
That's the talking point

2168
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,928
But he's also pretending to have some sort of an awareness

2169
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,720
Like he's listen to it already

2170
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:03,584
Which is kind of undermined by his response listen carefully

2171
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:05,120
This is

2172
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:07,936
Very soon after he starts playing the press conference

2173
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,776
At the special counsel

2174
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,568
Report makes clear

2175
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,432
The Russian government sought to interfere in our election process

2176
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:23,296
For the special counsel Starr investigation

2177
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,904
So that's gonna leave it

2178
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,440
That gives you like

2179
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:33,024
If you just listen to that it kind of gives you a sense of how this goes

2180
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,096
There's not a ton more other than

2181
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,120
The singer

2182
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:04,256
So

2183
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:11,168
Jordan I think I know a lot of powerful people

2184
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:16,544
230

2185
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:26,016
Away from the Mueller report

2186
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:29,344
The stuff that I'm most interested in is all the stuff at 3

2187
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:35,744
Corsi mileage

2188
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,376
Quite honestly I will come around

2189
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:44,960
Trial start

2190
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,776
A lot of this is stuff

2191
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,336
What will see you

2192
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,640
39

2193
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,456
In that report there is a

2194
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:57,504
Not reliant on the Steele dossier

2195
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,344
The possession of the Russian

2196
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,672
On October 30th 20

2197
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:08,512
16 Michael Cohen received a text from Russian businessman

2198
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,792
Risk.

2199
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,864
Stop the flow of

2200
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,168
Perm Russia butt

2201
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:17,216
Just so you know...

2202
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:21,568
Georgi said tapes refer to compromise and tapes of trump rumor

2203
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,848
Be held by personas

2204
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:24,896
Associated with Russian real estate

2205
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,664
Conglomerate

2206
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:26,432
Crocus group

2207
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,736
I'm not real

2208
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:33,856
I'm just saying that I wasn't about it just got a whole lot cuz that's not the

2209
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:35,136
The Steele dossier

2210
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:37,696
Text messages that they recovered from

2211
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,720
Michael Cohen

2212
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:41,792
What if I remember correctly though

2213
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:45,376
The theory that they had for that was they were f****** with Michael Cohen

2214
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:52,032
Shut up a pizza

2215
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,312
Guys were actually just

2216
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
F****** with Michael

2217
01:46:54,848 --> 01:47:00,224
Invisalign

2218
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:06,624
Pauses at bars press conference

2219
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,416
Bank of

2220
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,232
You don't really know what

2221
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:18,656
First the report details efforts by the internet research agency

2222
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,448
Ties to the Russian government

2223
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:24,032
Is so social Discord among American voters

2224
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:27,872
Information and social media operations

2225
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:37,856
You don't watch RT now it's the most leftist

2226
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:10,112
Alex

2227
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:11,904
Mueller report is real

2228
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,928
Just evidence

2229
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:14,976
Republican

2230
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:16,000
Conservative

2231
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,304
Like I tried to bribe them

2232
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:22,656
To lie about Trump

2233
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,680
Really don't think so

2234
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,896
It's only proof

2235
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,944
That they tried to pay Republican

2236
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:40,832
But I read it

2237
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,160
There was a lot of proof

2238
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:46,208
Nope

2239
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:56,960
Sorry

2240
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:16,160
None of them

2241
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:22,816
Independent

2242
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:35,616
Sound effects I have to fall asleep to thunderstorms every night as a white noise machine

2243
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:39,712
Americans and their enemies over weird

2244
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,064
That's the

2245
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,112
I don't know

2246
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,392
It's up dehumanizing

2247
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:48,928
Still like I guess

2248
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:56,352
Their enemies they deserve

2249
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,376
Whatever

2250
01:49:57,632 --> 01:49:58,144
Bigot

2251
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:12,992
I'm not saying what to do with that check you nowhere to go to the bad guy it doesn't mean that's not literally what he say

2252
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:17,088
You know we know from living long enough and know enough history to that

2253
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:22,464
That's the directions to sort of rhetoric tends to take pens to go get better

2254
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:23,744
Like it's not like you

2255
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,024
Start from a position of

2256
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,840
This group politically disagree with

2257
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,888
Members of our society

2258
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,912
And then you're like

2259
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:34,752
And you know what two weeks later I think they're great

2260
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:40,640
Towards that never ends with

2261
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,688
Look these guys aren't Americans

2262
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,712
There are enemies

2263
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:47,040
But they've got some pretty good ideas and I think we should hear him out

2264
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,576
That goes

2265
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,904
Alex

2266
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:54,464
You can always listening to this William Barr thing

2267
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,000
The reason I yelled BS

2268
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,792
Earlier

2269
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:00,864
But wasn't the Russians it was the Democrats who hired the Russian

2270
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,752
Alex does not believe it was a rush

2271
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
Talk about a little bit

2272
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:14,432
Where's the beef will see what he saw prophet

2273
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:17,760
Where's the proof that I send the report

2274
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:21,856
As we know it

2275
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:32,608
Cotton on

2276
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,192
Amazing

2277
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:37,728
It isn't made

2278
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,336
Conspiracies without having to take the risk

2279
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,920
Narrative

2280
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:49,248
Hillary Clinton is actually in bed with Russia

2281
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:52,832
And so she's sold off

2282
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,744
The gru0 Russian operative

2283
01:52:01,280 --> 01:52:02,560
Manager

2284
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:04,608
Please email in an effort to

2285
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:07,168
Do you understand how stupid that sounds

2286
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,192
Both of those

2287
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:08,960
Arkansas

2288
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:13,568
They're very difficult to hold as

2289
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
Famous Amos

2290
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:21,248
Professional cognitive dissonance would still have trouble with that

2291
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,296
Kahoots but also

2292
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,576
Hamster

2293
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,672
He's done this

2294
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,952
This makes sense that

2295
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,744
It wasn't Russia behind

2296
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,536
She's actually Secret

2297
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,656
Just stated Stockbridge leaked the information

2298
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:40,192
Wikileaks on Hillary killed

2299
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:43,520
In the present-day he's being sued by murder

2300
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:48,128
Cautious but creating more of those situations

2301
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:55,296
It's been pretty clear that they're sick

2302
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:56,832
To keep his name out of his mouth

2303
01:52:57,856 --> 01:52:58,368
But

2304
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:06,560
Is that explanation for the Providence of emails goes away he's left with having to accept that Russia

2305
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:11,168
Email of the person that they were working with in order to help the person who is running against

2306
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,960
Which is a tough needle thread

2307
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,520
Alex needs the Seth rich

2308
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,056
Narrative

2309
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
He has to be

2310
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,664
So he just uses the part of it that you just

2311
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:23,968
The idea that download speeds work

2312
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,736
Too fast

2313
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,528
In order for it to have been

2314
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,088
You couldn't get this over the

2315
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,880
It had to be a flash drive

2316
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:36,256
Memories download

2317
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,792
Right

2318
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,608
We didn't have the technology to put things in the air

2319
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:43,424
Information from William Binney

2320
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:47,008
A man who

2321
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,408
Public Storage Chicago

2322
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:58,784
He began appearing only on

2323
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,856
Conspiracy shows and eventually became

2324
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,904
His credibility is

2325
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:10,816
My favorite examples from our show Alex's show pretending that he had a copy of the classified

2326
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:17,216
Devin Nunez Memo from me

2327
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:23,616
Latest and very old

2328
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,152
Betty White

2329
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:28,736
Benny is part of a group called the veteran intelligence Professionals for

2330
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,272
VIP

2331
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:35,136
It's unclear how many members of this group there are

2332
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,416
And honestly who gives a s***

2333
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:39,232
They were formed in January 2000

2334
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:40,512
Inspired by

2335
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,304
The intelligence that was being used by the bushes

2336
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,840
Administration to go to war

2337
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:47,168
Their first effort stands up to historical scrutiny quite well

2338
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,472
The wrestler work is scattershot

2339
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:53,568
What are the reasons for that is that their members often don't agree on that

2340
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:56,128
One Wing of the group were released a memo about

2341
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:58,688
Released

2342
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,504
So they're like The Strokes

2343
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,576
You know they had a really great first album around

2344
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:10,208
I would agree or disagree other than The Strokes first album

2345
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:17,888
In July 2017

2346
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,912
Someone who only

2347
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:29,920
I'm not making that up the forensic

2348
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:38,112
So this people argue that there's no way that the DNC files were copied by a

2349
01:55:38,624 --> 01:55:39,136
Because the size of

2350
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,184
Copy

2351
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
Sprint possible to square with a physic

2352
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,256
Impossible download

2353
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:47,840
How many reported this

2354
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:49,888
F******

2355
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:53,472
Who naturally this

2356
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,496
I gave it to you.

2357
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
The credibility

2358
01:55:55,776 --> 01:56:00,640
Here's this group of Veteran intelligence professionals thing that it's literally impossible for this to have been hacked

2359
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:02,944
So therefore

2360
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:06,528
Even got the forensic cater to sign off

2361
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,296
I mean

2362
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,184
What

2363
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:23,168
Sentences to use

2364
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:31,616
Alex started promoting this narrative let everyone know that William

2365
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,384
Leatherback and it was

2366
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,176
Impossible that Russia hacked

2367
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:40,320
Unfortunately people started to do some examination of the claims

2368
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,088
Complete

2369
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,648
The forensic cater cater

2370
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,672
That's what

2371
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,280
Klein Center

2372
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,560
Technology

2373
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,608
Did analysis and found that the memo

2374
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
Some really faulty

2375
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,144
Assumption

2376
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:57,472
He found it while the claim that the download speeds required to copy all the

2377
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:00,032
Formation in the time allotted

2378
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:00,800
Using Comer

2379
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,336
Internet

2380
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:05,664
Connections available from like Xfinity

2381
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,688
Say you were

2382
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,504
Pru so speeds

2383
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,624
Those speeds variety of other digital Communications configuration

2384
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:20,000
A high-speed business-grade internet service provider an interoffice local area

2385
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:20,768
Communications

2386
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:21,792
Servers with

2387
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:28,448
Cloud provider and even said yes those speeds would be what you did with flash drive also but there were other possibility

2388
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,520
It would have to download it

2389
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:35,360
10 megabytes per second and we don't have the technology

2390
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:40,224
All these possibilities were just discounted by the VIPs memo because they were working

2391
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,248
Towards the Flash

2392
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,296
Flash drive conclusion as opposed to

2393
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,576
Considering all possibilities

2394
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:45,856
Is a good reason to

2395
01:57:47,904 --> 01:57:51,744
After the memo was used as a basis for an article in the nation other members of

2396
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,536
Navigation

2397
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:55,328
Speak up and point out that they didn't agree with it

2398
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,608
The conclusions being put forth

2399
01:57:57,376 --> 01:58:02,752
These other memos chastise the writer of the original memo for not including any qualifier

2400
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,776
Dissenting views

2401
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:06,080
Nor offering any alternative Theory

2402
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,384
Representing their argument is a quotes

2403
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,944
They some of their feelings

2404
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,736
The bottom line

2405
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:17,344
This rips memo was hastily written based on analysis of third-party analysis

2406
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,112
The Friend Locator

2407
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:20,160
I've been thrown against the wall

2408
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,184
What would stick

2409
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,000
There's only one reason to hold on to this

2410
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,024
Impossible download

2411
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,048
Be documented this

2412
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:28,608
Husband on on it

2413
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:30,144
The only reason

2414
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:34,240
Conspiracies long past their expiration date and

2415
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,264
It's bad

2416
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,056
It's real it's really bad

2417
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,592
That's what I was doing

2418
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:41,920
David Naughton

2419
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:44,224
Confirmer

2420
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,760
I wasn't good

2421
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:52,672
The idea that in the Mueller report

2422
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,952
Chances of trump

2423
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,256
Clearly obstructing justice

2424
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:05,984
As I read it

2425
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,752
Which is

2426
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:07,776
What are the

2427
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:09,056
Justin things everything I

2428
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:09,824
Keep reading about

2429
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:12,128
So all lacrosse

2430
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:18,784
People bring a lot of Their Own

2431
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,320
Yeah yeah

2432
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,344
Basically

2433
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,392
Muller concluded

2434
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,160
Obstructed

2435
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,184
And

2436
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,464
Conclude that there were

2437
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,768
No collusion because that's not really

2438
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:32,608
Would be impossible

2439
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:34,144
Impossible to prove

2440
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:40,544
Because everybody was lying or destroyed

2441
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:42,336
Clear him of Illusion

2442
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,104
Conspiracy he said

2443
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,200
We couldn't prove we were unable to confirm

2444
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:54,880
Saying we were unable to prove that this mob boss killed everybody because for some reason nobody's testifying

2445
01:59:56,416 --> 02:00:00,768
I was looking over like

2446
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:04,352
Trump's answers to questions

2447
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:05,376
Whatever at the bottom

2448
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:09,984
Isaac

You can find text message

2450

Build

2452
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,320
More understanding

2453
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,624
Just read it over Trump Sukkot answers as

2454
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:29,184
Who didn't think that was what's going to happen

2455
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:33,280
Just like I don't remember if the truth

2456
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:36,352
And then as far as the obstruction

2457
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:39,680
Total of 11

2458
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:42,496
A based on every kind of

2459
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:43,520
Prosser

2460
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:45,824
Acute Oriole review of that

2461
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:48,128
If they had

2462
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,456
They would get a conviction in two weeks

2463
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:53,504
Right right

2464
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,296
You wrote them a conviction

2465
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,648
To actually convince him because it

2466
02:00:59,904 --> 02:01:00,672
With against the justice

2467
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:01,696
Department memo

2468
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,304
Right right

2469
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,096
Started from the point of

2470
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:13,472
We are not going to convince him of a crime

2471
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:15,008
Describe and then Congress

2472
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:17,056
If you were a functioning tomorrow

2473
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:18,080

Trump did that

2476
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:24,480
Obstruction that are reference

2477
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,504
Constantly

2478
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:30,624
Hello stuff for Alex to get around whoops

2479
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:34,208
The area obstruction

2480
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:48,544
Blue

2481
02:01:57,248 --> 02:01:59,552
America

2482
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,000
Guitar Blood temperature

2483
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,840
You would have struck Justice

2484
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:14,400
You at

2485
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,472
What's play that out

2486
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:18,496
Alright alright

2487
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:36,160
Be like Alexa

2488
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:46,656
I always loved it so much

2489
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:49,728
You don't know who that person is

2490
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:54,080
My favorite part

2491
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:56,128
Are so ridiculous just because

2492
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:56,896
It's like

2493
02:02:58,432 --> 02:03:01,504
Every part of the Mueller report that isn't a

2494
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,528
A direct

2495
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:05,600
Look like proven obstruction of justice is always

2496
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:06,368
Because it was

2497
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:17,376
Go commit instruction of Justice you possibly can do you like telling McCain

2498
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,144
Fire

2499
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,936
Notes

2500
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:24,032
My other Lords don't keep notes

2501
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:26,592
You're the notable

2502
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
Yeah

2503
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,992
Distinction to that like

2504
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:39,648
Obstruction of justice doesn't require an underlying crime

2505
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:41,184
Obstructing justice

2506
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,232
For whatever reason

2507
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,456
For his body

2508
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,784
Showing your car whatever

2509
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,320
Enemy

2510
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:22,144
Globalist coach Warren to conquer the nation

2511
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:25,472
Well I mean cool what are you doing

2512
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:27,008
What are you what are you doing

2513
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:30,336
I mean you're telling people to put up signs anime

2514
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:32,384
You're saying they're sworn to

2515
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
To destroy the country

2516
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,832
All right you know

2517
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:43,392
Now you don't want to

2518
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:49,792
Executed innocent man on death row so you make sure that everything is taken care of we have to leave all you have Democrats alone because

2519
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,328
Whatever is whatever the case

2520
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,168
That's pretty

2521
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,776
I made some of the people that he

2522
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:00,800
Clearly

2523
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,592
Media Democrats

2524
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:03,872
There are people who

2525
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:06,432
Maybe some of them work for the New York Times

2526
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:10,784
True

2527
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:17,440
Show many New York Times article on the front page of the website

2528
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,536
That would be

2529
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:28,960
Is true I will always err on the side of Truth when he says he didn't read

2530
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:35,872
What is there so many front-page stories in the New York time about

2531
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:40,736
Because you read them

2532
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:45,600
Such liar

2533
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:48,160
It's crazy

2534
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:49,952
I don't believe it Alex's

2535
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:50,720
Ever been on the

2536
02:05:52,512 --> 02:05:54,048
Maybe like when the Sandy Hook

2537
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:56,096
Lawsuits broke or something like that

2538
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
But I can't imagine

2539
02:05:59,424 --> 02:05:59,936
What would I say

2540
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,496
The over-under is

2541
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:04,544
Is 3 1/2 *

2542
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,080
You think so

2543
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:11,968
That's why I took the under

2544
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:14,528
If I was going to lay odds on this one if I was

2545
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:17,856
Vegas betting over unders two and a half

2546
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:20,160
Alright

2547
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:24,256
Somehow I want to have this over under B- one-and-a-half just in case

2548
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,536
Just in case they

2549
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:28,864
They put him on the New York Times front page one time and then

2550
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,400
Ripped all of them off

2551
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,936
A couple times

2552
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,704
Him being on there

2553
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:37,056
You think maybe I could really like

2554
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,616
Oh he wouldn't be the headline

2555
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:42,688
Under the fold

2556
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:49,088
I don't know seriously

2557
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:55,488
Exaggerating

2558
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:02,400
Wedding announcement of the f****** globalist New York Times

2559
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:05,472
So Alex got a call from

2560
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,240
From The New York Times

2561
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,544
Reporter who wrote the story

2562
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,568
Video I think

2563
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,104
No nevermind

2564
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,384
This is about

2565
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:18,784
Talking about that New York Times article the writer who called him different guy

2566
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:21,344
Different guy

2567
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:24,416
He's on the cover of the New York Times

2568
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:25,184
The story

2569
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:25,952
Also

2570
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:35,168
They said you need to

2571
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:38,496
Operator conversation

2572
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:41,056
What

2573
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:50,016
Detroit Bass

2574
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,512
Against the Republic

2575
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:04,864
Point of order Alex's at this point turned on trop like 4 times

2576
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,544
Call me again

2577
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:18,688
New York

2578
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:21,760
What's the reason

2579
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:22,784
What are the three

2580
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,320
People say things are off the Record

2581
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:26,880
Agree to it

2582
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:33,280
Right if part of your Converse I've never talked to you

2583
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:37,888
Need to bring that child deals with off the Record

2584
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:43,264
You made you made the both like

2585
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,104
Remember scaramucci's article or is like I thought that was off the Record

2586
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,200
Why would you think that

2587
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:56,320
Also a lot of the time whenever things are off-the-record you're not allowed to talk about them

2588
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:59,392
Not just who said so

2589
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:04,000
He's holding to some sort of journalistic standards

2590
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:09,120
He's making a voice modulator so we couldn't even tell

2591
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:10,144
Who the person was

2592
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,680
And the first thing the guy said was

2593
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:17,056
New York Times robot

2594
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,080
That's good babe

2595
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:21,664
That article

2596
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:22,688
About himself

2597
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:23,712
The New York Times

2598
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,736
To talk about

2599
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:27,040
Consolation prize

2600
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:33,952
Unfortunately part of the text that said

2601
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:40,352
Does he have commanded us to see Jones you know we can't get drunk

2602
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:44,960
Controller consolation prize in Westbury

2603
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:51,616
For the horrible miscreant

2604
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:56,224
With one of their people just got caught trying to fire bomb

2605
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:03,904
New York yesterday

2606
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:07,232
There's no evidence that that was one of the last

2607
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:09,792
One of their people

2608
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:16,448
Open up there's no indication that I was just making s*** up something like that

2609
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:19,776
Does classical logical fallacies

2610
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:21,568
F*** off with that nonsense

2611
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:25,920
The reason that Alex is talking about this

2612
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:27,456
This article

2613
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:30,528
It's really stuck in his craw is the idea

2614
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:33,856
That the article is pointing out under oath in the deposition

2615
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:36,416
Provide any evidence

2616
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:39,488
Of the claims that he was making about Sandy Hook

2617
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:42,816
Particularly the incident of him talking about there

2618
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:45,120
Someone arrested in squash

2619
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,656
Deer in the woods

2620
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:48,960
So Alex is decided

2621
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:52,032
No Alex no

2622
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:53,056

Clip is

02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:09,952
There's something going on here

2627
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:19,424
Article

2628
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:20,704
Well

2629
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,544
Newscast

2630
02:11:25,056 --> 02:11:27,104
So you just end up playing the clip city-based

2631
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:33,504
2 conspiracy on the first time what's going on

2632
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:34,784
Credibly f*****-up

2633
02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:38,880
He's talking about there's something up here is that he is

2634
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:41,696
Now found out Chris Murphy

2635
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:44,512
Blumenthal

2636
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:50,144
Classic vaudevillian Duo

2637
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:53,216
Murphy apparently ran on

2638
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:56,800
What

2639
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:59,616
That's what Alex is alive and then

2640
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:03,456
Is like related to somebody works at a business of some sort

2641
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,760
Conspiracy

2642
02:12:06,016 --> 02:12:12,160
To our attempt because of Sandy Hook because there's some grander conspiracy but also Alex

2643
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:16,768
You to know that there's a second shooter that he believes it's still all the way okay

2644
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:23,168
Just trying to add like Amicus brief

2645
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:28,800
Is he trying to get a class action lawsuit you have a class-action defamation lawsuit

2646
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:30,080
You could

2647
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:31,104
I think

2648
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:31,872
You know he's

2649
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:35,456
Propound

2650
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,736
So why not make the

2651
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:42,624
Everyone

2652
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:46,976
I don't know because it's not what he's doing isn't illegal

2653
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:50,560
Like

2654
02:12:50,816 --> 02:12:53,632
Second shooter

2655
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:57,984
Stupid KFC double down which is not illegal

2656
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,264
But it's f****** stupid

2657
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,824
Play zeze

2658
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:02,592
These videos

2659
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:05,664
System news articles

2660
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:09,760
That justify his like this

2661
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,296
I will see how good these

2662
02:13:12,832 --> 02:13:16,416
Grill

2663
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:20,768
This is an article on

2664
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:21,536
Skeptoid

2665
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:22,816
Is a blog post

2666
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:28,192
There was a drill that overlap with the shooting

2667
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:35,104
Shooter drill

2668
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,384
Also Alex

2669
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:38,176
Not want to drop

2670
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:44,064
Article as it very clearly says the idea that attacks on drills are related

2671
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:51,232
This Theory seems to have caught fire thanks to a post from Alex Jones at the light Mike Adams

2672
02:13:51,488 --> 02:13:53,792
Conspiracy

2673
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:57,888
It goes on

2674
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:04,288
Also have to realize that for the few times drills and Terror attacks coincided with each other

2675
02:14:04,544 --> 02:14:06,080
Conducted without

2676
02:14:06,336 --> 02:14:07,616
Or anything unusual happen

2677
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:10,432
You just don't hear about them because there's no reason to

2678
02:14:10,944 --> 02:14:13,504
Nothing happened doesn't make for much of a conspiracy

2679
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,272
After all

2680
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:16,064
Well the headline that Alex

2681
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:16,832
Read

2682
02:14:17,088 --> 02:14:18,368
Used to look good for Alex

2683
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:22,976
Does point the body of the article is actually a condemnation of his world

2684
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,256
Try and exploit

2685
02:14:24,768 --> 02:14:26,304
I feel like this is a theme on

2686
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:30,400
People really

2687
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:32,448
What is a stupid

2688
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:38,336
So he comes up with another piece of information from you know

2689
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:40,896
Right around

2690
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:41,664
Sandy Hook

2691
02:14:44,224 --> 02:14:46,528
Cites potential

2692
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:47,552
Suspects

2693
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:49,600
A witness

2694
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,304
3 months later

2695
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:00,864
February

2696
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,736
He's spreading

2697
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:18,272
Wow

2698
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:19,552
This isn't

2699
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:21,600
Suspicious at all

2700
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:31,584
This article came out on February 5th 2030

2701
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:33,376
Only 54 days after the

2702
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:37,984
Shooting reasonable to believe that the investigation was still very much ongoing

2703
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:39,776
Healthy ideas

2704
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,056
DEA thought there were multiple

2705
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:41,824
Suspect

2706
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:44,384
Totally accurate based on the article

2707
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:45,664
The article goes on to

2708
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:49,504
The quote to a public affairs officer

2709
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:53,344
Whenever you conduct an investigation you don't speculate as to where it's going to take you

2710
02:15:53,856 --> 02:15:58,720
As I said we're going to look at every single thing every piece of material and we'll take it from there

2711
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:00,512
The article explains that the

2712
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,048
The DEA was concerned about

2713
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:05,632
To the case because it would quote identify person

2714
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,168
I'm cooperating with the investigation

2715
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:08,704
Navigation

2716
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:14,592
Oh yeah what is their names got out and some crazy conspiracy website which

2717
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:15,872
Just go

2718
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:19,456
Give their names out maybe

2719
02:16:19,968 --> 02:16:20,992
Mixer people

2720
02:16:21,248 --> 02:16:22,016
I thought that they were

2721
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:28,672
He didn't specifically say that it was dangerous because the secret other shooter would get them

2722
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,232
Their safety

2723
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:34,304
Is your point

2724
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:36,608
Conspiracies about Sandy Hook we're already running

2725
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,376
Fullsteam

2726
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:39,424
This isn't the basis for

2727
02:16:39,680 --> 02:16:40,960
Conspiracy theory

2728
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:42,496
Conspiracy theories flying around her pretty

2729
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:47,360
Very easily were able to stop.

2730
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:48,896
Nasyid

2731
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:52,736
Talk about in the article that the idea there could be other possible

2732
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:56,064
Talk about other suspects in the

2733
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:58,368
The shooting for possibly investigation

2734
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:01,440
Or something like that

2735
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:03,744
The idea of online contact

2736
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:04,768
He could have had

2737
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:08,352
Suspect doesn't mean suspect in the shooting

2738
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:09,888
Necessarily

2739
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:12,448
More suspect of a larger investigation

2740
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:13,728
Is another

2741
02:17:13,984 --> 02:17:15,776
Entirely sensible

2742
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:18,848
Interpretation of that article

2743
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:20,128
That we've seen where

2744
02:17:20,384 --> 02:17:21,664
The shooter was

2745
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:26,016
The only crime you know they got their guns legally they got all that stuff legally

2746
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:27,808
It was just the the one crying

2747
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:29,856
But they're also tons of other time

2748
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:31,136
X wear that one crime

2749
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:34,208
Was the culmination of 15 other crimes

2750
02:17:34,464 --> 02:17:34,976
That had to happen

2751
02:17:35,488 --> 02:17:36,256
To get there

2752
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,024
You know

2753
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:40,608
At this point alexplayz that video

2754
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:41,888
Helicopter

2755
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,192
Footage of the three cops

2756
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:44,960
Together

2757
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:45,984
Pierced

2758
02:17:46,240 --> 02:17:48,544
Cuz one of them is dressed differently than the other

2759
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:51,104
I thought you was just going to show the footage from Rocky

2760
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,408
Before we're Rocky and Apollo Creed we're running

2761
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:56,992
That's one thing

2762
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:59,808
Nick begich takes over Rocky

2763
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:01,856
Great

2764
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:04,160
So Alex plays this video

2765
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,720
Proof

2766
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:24,640
Black shirt camo he's in the grass

2767
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:29,504
That's not true

2768
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,272
They don't have gun

2769
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:31,552
Nonsense

2770
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,392
The videos of them

2771
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,184
Is casually walking

2772
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:39,744
This guy at all

2773
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:43,328
And we already talked about that what's going on

2774
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:44,608
So big ears

2775
02:18:47,424 --> 02:18:48,192
I'm not sure how I feel

2776
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:48,960
What's

2777
02:18:49,472 --> 02:18:50,752
No Doubt

2778
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:52,544
On the one hand I think this is

2779
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:53,312
Kind of funny

2780
02:18:53,568 --> 02:18:54,592
But on the other hand

2781
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:56,384
Scary about with the consequences

2782
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,432
Could be

2783
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:01,248
Based on Alex's Behavior over the past week

2784
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,784
I'm pretty convinced that Alex Jones

2785
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:03,552
2019

2786
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:04,576
Is confused

2787
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:07,136
About what happened in late 2012 and early

2788
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:08,160
2013

2789
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:09,440
I get the sense

2790
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:11,232
But he doesn't remember the arguments

2791
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,816
Most likely because you just can't get him

2792
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:18,912
Now because he was confronted about making up

2793
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:20,960
Members in the woods

2794
02:19:21,216 --> 02:19:21,728
Deposition

2795
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:23,520
He feels compelled to go back and

2796
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:25,056
Confirmed himself that he wasn't

2797
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:26,080
Just making that up

2798
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:27,872
Which is a pretty good impulse

2799
02:19:31,968 --> 02:19:32,736
Can you find the video

2800
02:19:32,992 --> 02:19:33,504
3 cops run

2801
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,528
In the woods that looks

2802
02:19:35,808 --> 02:19:37,856
He finds this video of a man said he saw the police

2803
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:39,648
Please walking a guy in camo pants

2804
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:40,416
Squad car

2805
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:41,440
He finds this

2806
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:47,072
All these things are examples of

2807
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:49,120
The concept that were taken out of context

2808
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:50,144
In Spanish

2809
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:53,728
Helicopter footage of the three cops don't show in

2810
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,520
That's very clearly amiss

2811
02:19:59,104 --> 02:20:00,128
And also has been

2812
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,432
A responsible way for Alex

2813
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:03,968
The cover this would be the show these

2814
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:07,040
And explain to his audience

2815
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,880
It wouldn't jeopardize his legal case right now at all

2816
02:20:11,136 --> 02:20:15,488
Eddie would still Chivas desire results

2817
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:18,304
The deposition was wrong about him

2818
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,840
He was basically

2819
02:20:20,352 --> 02:20:21,376
He was just responding

2820
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,912
People who they got it wrong

2821
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:24,192
That would be

2822
02:20:24,448 --> 02:20:25,216
Totally fine

2823
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:27,008
It would be humiliating at all

2824
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:28,544
It would be a sensible way to

2825
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,312
To present this

2826
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:32,896
These people in this New York Times article or lying about me

2827
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:37,504
I was wrong conclusions that we were led to but it would based on this visit

2828
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:39,808
Alex isn't doing

2829
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:41,344
No no

2830
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,904
I get the same

2831
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:46,208
He's having his mind blown all over again

2832
02:20:54,656 --> 02:20:56,192
This is just a

2833
02:20:56,704 --> 02:21:02,848
Started

2834
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:05,920
There's a second shooter

2835
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:10,272
I'm just worried that what's happening is that Alex watch this helicopter video

2836
02:21:10,528 --> 02:21:11,808
His response was

2837
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:14,368
We got that wrong but

2838
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:22,816
I need to retract my apology from a couple of months ago my God I was wrong

2839
02:21:24,352 --> 02:21:27,424
I think he's forgotten

2840
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:30,752
That these things are all explained already because they're

2841
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:37,152
There's an energy about the helicopter footage

2842
02:21:37,408 --> 02:21:37,920
DEA

2843
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:40,224
I'm inside the multiple Shooters argument

2844
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,272
There's a there's an energy behind

2845
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,296
Drills

2846
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:44,320
A text

2847
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:46,368
Confluent

2848
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:51,232
I don't know if he's going to but I'm worried this is going to

2849
02:21:53,536 --> 02:21:55,072
What is rubeola

2850
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:59,680
How to say the hook denial

2851
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:02,752
Blumenthal and Marie

2852
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:04,032
Murphy Murphy

2853
02:22:04,288 --> 02:22:05,568
So that means that he's

2854
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:11,200
Still looking for more evidence that it was to find a new way

2855
02:22:11,456 --> 02:22:12,480
To do the same

2856
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,248
Amstaff

2857
02:22:13,504 --> 02:22:15,040
Present himself as a

2858
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:18,880
Intrepid in the line of

2859
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:21,696
Outright libel slander

2860
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:27,072
But it's it's really weird cuz when I heard

2861
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,120
When I heard him first say

2862
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:35,264
Like much earlier the episode did like I found all the stuff that the proves that I wasn't lying

2863
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:36,544
And suppose I could never go

2864
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:38,848
Play that s***

2865
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:41,664
Wow you're not explaining why you were wrong

2866
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:44,480
You're playing this stuff in it

2867
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:46,272
Reinforcing an argument

2868
02:22:46,528 --> 02:22:48,832
Question things

2869
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:55,488
But there's a cover-up

2870
02:22:55,744 --> 02:22:56,256
Sewage

2871
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:59,328
Well

2872
02:23:01,376 --> 02:23:07,520
Private lawsuits are an attack on him probably from

2873
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:13,920
Colin Murphy

2874
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,944
That's where this is going to go

2875
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,760
Ikea I don't look forward to it

2876
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:20,064
I see him on his bed just throwing

2877
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:25,440
Hundred dollar bills in the air lighting lighting a cigar with a Bernie wants Benjamin like this

2878
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,976
This is insane total mess

2879
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:28,768
Call my God what an idiot

2880
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:32,864
Calls if you wants to take calls on the Mueller report

2881
02:23:33,632 --> 02:23:35,424
He's not getting a lot of good

2882
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:36,192
Stuff

2883
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:40,800
It's his listeners

2884
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,504
Maybe

2885
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:56,928
He was talking about you know I know that

2886
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:02,048
Maligned and what have you but

2887
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:04,864
Would you you're being delusional if you're looking at this

2888
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:09,728
Report you're not imagining Obama's

2889
02:24:09,984 --> 02:24:12,288
Can Furious everyone on your side would be

2890
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,480
Got to go

2891
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:25,344
I'm so angry at how effective that that line has become

2892
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,624
I've just him

2893
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,928
Look it was obstruction he was just mad

2894
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:40,960
Stink a lot of people

2895
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:43,264
Look what we need to know in advance

2896
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:44,288
Is that yes

2897
02:24:44,544 --> 02:24:45,824
Maybe he obstructed Justice

2898
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:47,616
But he was out of frustration

2899
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,408
He was angry

2900
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:50,944
He was having a tantrum

2901
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:57,344
Yeah it was mad that it's legal to commit crimes when you're angry and frustrated with people

2902
02:24:58,368 --> 02:25:02,208
Exactly

2903
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,256
Alex don't have much time for that guy

2904
02:25:05,536 --> 02:25:09,888
Quickly as I thought he would but there's a very short call

2905
02:25:10,400 --> 02:25:13,472
Another call and this one he is way more into

2906
02:25:14,496 --> 02:25:15,776
This lady is

2907
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:19,360
Democrats are the demon party

2908
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:25,504
I renamed the demon party because they can President Trump clever

2909
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:38,816
Will you know Alex God knows what they're doing

2910
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:45,216
Retired firefighters that I watch on YouTube is it he's from Florida his name is Mark

2911
02:25:45,472 --> 02:25:45,984
Taylor

2912
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:49,824
If you never heard of them look them up

2913
02:25:51,104 --> 02:25:51,616
Response

2914
02:25:51,872 --> 02:25:52,896
Mark Taylor

2915
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:58,784
I don't follow

2916
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:01,856
Complete lunatic

2917
02:26:05,696 --> 02:26:06,464
That's right

2918
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:10,816
You probably most notable for releasing a movie called The Trump prophecy in 2018

2919
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:14,144
The movie was based on a book he wrote about

2920
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:18,752
Can 2011 election was ordained by God

2921
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:23,616
Interesting Lee this book came out on August 23rd 2017 and I can find no evidence

2922
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:30,272
Suspicious at all

2923
02:26:30,784 --> 02:26:32,832
You know what you tell people the prophecy then it won't come

2924
02:26:33,856 --> 02:26:35,136
That's just that's everybody

2925
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:41,280
Taylor claims his prophecy that was confirmed

2926
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,304
Funeral

2927
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:48,192
But if you go back to scalia's funeral when they were carrying his body up to

2928
02:26:48,448 --> 02:26:53,312
There were two signs that were given by God that the confirmation of Merrick Garland was not going

2929
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,080
To happen

2930
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:56,896
The two signs that were given there was a

2931
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:57,664
The reverence

2932
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,712
Quiet

2933
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:01,760
The background at the bottom

2934
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:02,528
Steps

2935
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:04,320
Well when they got to the top of the steps

2936
02:27:07,904 --> 02:27:10,720
And what the Lord was saying don't fear America

2937
02:27:10,976 --> 02:27:12,000
Help is on the way

2938
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:12,768
The siren

2939
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:15,072
This being reserved from my anointed

2940
02:27:16,096 --> 02:27:16,608
From the Trump

2941
02:27:16,864 --> 02:27:17,888
Train

2942
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:19,936
Crazy

2943
02:27:21,472 --> 02:27:22,240
Crazy

2944
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:24,288
Nut you do it

2945
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:27,872
Enlightenment when a crow dropped a pebble

2946
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:28,640
Into the lake

2947
02:27:30,432 --> 02:27:34,528
Channel

2948
02:27:34,784 --> 02:27:38,624
Taylor

2949
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,440
Mostly

2950
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:44,768
Completely insane qanon

2951
02:27:45,792 --> 02:27:47,840
Just last month he released this prophecy

2952
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:50,912
The Lord's Prayer

2953
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,192
Another Trump coming

2954
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:56,032
This morning and in the dream I saw Donald Trump jr.

2955
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:59,872
It was just a really quick snippet of it

2956
02:28:00,128 --> 02:28:01,152
And then I thought

2957
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:03,200
JFK jr.

2958
02:28:03,456 --> 02:28:09,600
I knew it had something to do with JFK Junior and it goes on to say that.

2959
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:10,624
Going to run together

2960
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:17,024
Cannot be true because they believe you

2961
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:22,144
Another big problem for the DJ

2962
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:26,240
Situation going on here is that even in Mueller's report

2963
02:28:26,496 --> 02:28:28,288
Donald Trump jr. is not

2964
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:34,432
Investigated and indicted committed

2965
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:37,504
It's a good day

2966
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:41,856
What Marine Le Pen being legally a fascist

2967
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:42,880
You know it's like

2968
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:47,232
According to a real person

2969
02:28:47,744 --> 02:28:53,888
Christian Broadcasting Network website about the Trump prophecy

2970
02:28:54,912 --> 02:29:01,056
Divided nation right now so I hope this film can be a way to Baby Pointe 14

2971
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:07,456
Is actually an office because the will of God

2972
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:12,320
And the people who are

2973
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:16,160
That's something you might do if you were interested in installing a theocracy

2974
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:20,768
Which is totally

2975
02:29:22,048 --> 02:29:23,328
Which is healing

2976
02:29:24,096 --> 02:29:28,192
Everybody else went to everybody who has been hurt

2977
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:29,216
Ventec

2978
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,568
Insanely

2979
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:38,176
$2000000 is what

2980
02:29:38,432 --> 02:29:39,968
2 million-dollar budget

2981
02:29:40,224 --> 02:29:43,040
It's all on the screen

2982
02:29:43,296 --> 02:29:45,600
I'd like for you to try

2983
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:49,952
Well are we

2984
02:29:50,208 --> 02:29:50,976
Gross or net

2985
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:52,000
I don't know

2986
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:54,304
Cuz I'm ready to go with net I'm going to say

2987
02:29:54,560 --> 02:29:55,840
-2 million-dollar

2988
02:29:56,864 --> 02:29:57,376
No

2989
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:01,472
It made 607

2990
02:30:02,240 --> 02:30:08,384
They have an elevated bottom

2991
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:12,224
How much

2992
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:18,624
Desperate 10 be like buses of no church groups

2993
02:30:18,880 --> 02:30:19,904
There's a built-in

2994
02:30:22,464 --> 02:30:28,608
Is a good way to guarantee you're going to make

2995
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:33,472
Pile

2996
02:30:34,240 --> 02:30:36,544
You got an audience we could make a movie for likes

2997
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:37,568
15 grand

2998
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:38,592
At most

2999
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:39,360
And make six hundred

3000
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:41,152
No we couldn't

3001
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:43,712
Cuz I'm not doing it

3002
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:48,832
Also in September 2018 Mark Taylor other internet

3003
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:52,672
Are going to declare martial law

3004
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:59,584
Iview martial law under this Administration

3005
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:07,520
That was their plan all along but are now we're going crazy

3006
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:11,360
A.m.

3007
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:13,152
So excited that people like

3008
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:20,576
God dammit because he calls himself a prophet

3009
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:22,880
Supposed prophecies

3010
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:25,952
Trump is the leader that will lead us out of the desert

3011
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:27,488
You know all that sort of s***

3012
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:29,024
What

3013
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,304
12

3014
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,608
Global World Government

3015
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:35,936
It's demonic is going to put us in FEMA camps

3016
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:41,312
There were power but now that's actually really good because we can do it to them

3017
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:44,384
Yeah there's another path

3018
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,920
C-walk similar paths

3019
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:47,712
Yeah you're absolutely right

3020
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:59,488
Yeah I like Mark Taylor he's a good guy or whatever I thought that was

3021
02:31:59,744 --> 02:32:00,768
Dismissive

3022
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:07,168
Yeah because it usually is kind of recommend other people

3023
02:32:07,424 --> 02:32:13,312
To me this is my show what's the point of fighting right but

3024
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,848
Weird fake Christian prophet

3025
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:21,248
For Humanity is destroyed Jack Dorsey will be destroyed

3026
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:24,320
Thunderbolt

3027
02:32:24,576 --> 02:32:30,720
White shawl

3028
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:33,792
Can a process

3029
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:39,424
Jack of Twitter

3030
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:41,216
She didn't say he was a prophet

3031
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:51,456
He knows Mark Taylor is I don't know

3032
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:52,224
Seagame sohee

3033
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:53,504
He's jumping in on that prophecy

3034
02:32:55,552 --> 02:32:56,576
She was talking a lot about demon

3035
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:58,880
Guns and stuff like that

3036
02:32:59,392 --> 02:33:03,232
I'm not totally sure but either way it doesn't really matter it's just illustrates

3037
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:04,512
F****** world

3038
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:05,280
So connected

3039
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:06,048
So f*****

3040
02:33:07,072 --> 02:33:07,584
Why

3041
02:33:09,888 --> 02:33:13,984
Gas-lit like this so hard life of Alex

3042
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:15,776
The Democrats have no bottom

3043
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,104
You

3044
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:20,128
I can't

3045
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:21,920
Where are we

3046
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:23,968
So weak

3047
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:25,248
Weak-willed

3048
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,528
The present

3049
02:33:26,784 --> 02:33:27,552
Committed

3050
02:33:28,576 --> 02:33:31,392
The Democratic Leadership is like

3051
02:33:31,648 --> 02:33:32,416
Let's let him

3052
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:34,720
Run roughshod over the country for the next

3053
02:33:34,976 --> 02:33:36,000
18 months and then

3054
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:38,048
The forest

3055
02:33:38,304 --> 02:33:39,584
Hayden

3056
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:40,608
Sure

3057
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:43,168
There's not any consequence

3058
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:48,032
Cranston the globalist of power

3059
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:49,824
Alex

3060
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:50,848
That's true

3061
02:33:51,104 --> 02:33:51,616
So right

3062
02:33:51,872 --> 02:33:54,176
They have no bottom

3063
02:33:54,688 --> 02:33:58,016
If you if you don't allow Alex what won't you do

3064
02:33:58,272 --> 02:33:59,296
If you take Alex off

3065
02:33:59,552 --> 02:34:00,064
Facebook

3066
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:02,880
Absolutely

3067
02:34:04,672 --> 02:34:07,744
The political aspirations of

3068
02:34:08,256 --> 02:34:12,096
Someday they will people keep Point Mark Taylor prophecy

3069
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:15,168
These globalist

3070
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:25,152
Interesting is almost

3071
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:26,688
Of coverage

3072
02:34:27,200 --> 02:34:29,504
Stories

3073
02:34:30,016 --> 02:34:31,808
You know Notre Dame burning

3074
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:36,928
Aspire was built in the 19th century

3075
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:38,720
Doesn't mean it's any less tragic

3076
02:34:38,976 --> 02:34:40,000
What's it from

3077
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:41,280
11:00

3078
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,632
Feel like I'm minimizing I don't mean to

3079
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:47,680
Spitfire

3080
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:54,336
If you want to enjoy the Notre Dame

3081
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:57,152
Therefore you have

3082
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:58,688
You know the Mueller report coming

3083
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:02,784
Sammy's great

3084
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:04,064
Yeah or no

3085
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:06,112
Really at all

3086
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:12,512
Alluc in the aftermath of note is to make everything about

3087
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:15,584
Is that all you have

3088
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,120
Aftermath of his mother is

3089
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:19,680
A very predictable this is a cover up for what

3090
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:22,496
Hillary Clinton was doing need that report

3091
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,056
Pocket matter

3092
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:27,616
We'll see what happens

3093
02:35:27,872 --> 02:35:30,176
Most excited about the prospect

3094
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:30,944
Sandy Hook

3095
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:32,480
Actually I'm not

3096
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:33,248
Cuz

3097
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,040
It's not you can't enjoy it

3098
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,064
No

3099
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:38,880
Like I said it's

3100
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:41,696
Hilarious

3101
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:42,720
People's lives

3102
02:35:42,976 --> 02:35:44,768
It would be very very funny that this

3103
02:35:45,024 --> 02:35:46,304
Stupid assholes forgot the

3104
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,072
Conspiracies

3105
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:49,376
But he was telling Emma

3106
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:54,240
Got very excited about the New Year's Eve

3107
02:35:54,496 --> 02:35:55,520
Is right this whole time

3108
02:35:57,824 --> 02:36:03,968
People tell me that I was like

3109
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:06,528
Go to the Sandy Hook victims houses

3110
02:36:06,784 --> 02:36:07,552
Dammit man

3111
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:09,088
Itsfunneh on paper

3112
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:09,856
Yeah

3113
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:11,136
Not funny in real life

3114
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:13,440
Now I walked myself

3115
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:14,208
Full circle

3116
02:36:14,464 --> 02:36:18,304
Zaltrap

3117
02:36:19,584 --> 02:36:20,352
You know what's interesting

3118
02:36:20,864 --> 02:36:22,400
There's a very real parallel

3119
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:23,168
2

3120
02:36:23,424 --> 02:36:26,240
Notre Dame burning down but they're being a perfect digital

3121
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:27,008
Recreation of

3122
02:36:27,520 --> 02:36:28,288
Inside of a video

3123
02:36:29,056 --> 02:36:29,568
Isn't that

3124
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:30,592
Anything isn't that

3125
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:31,360
Exactly like

3126
02:36:31,616 --> 02:36:36,480
You dying

3127
02:36:39,552 --> 02:36:40,576
Food for thought

3128
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:48,512
Food for eyes

3129
02:36:48,768 --> 02:36:54,912
You can buy the new shirt and call Larry Nichols

3130
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:58,496
Federal Building

3131
02:36:59,264 --> 02:37:02,592
Missy Elliott I don't expect anyone to be able to remember that stuff

3132
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:11,552
Yep we're on Facebook

3133
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:14,368
Leave a review at

3134
02:37:14,624 --> 02:37:16,416
Cetera

3135
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:17,440
So I guess

3136
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:18,976
We come to the end of this

3137
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,560
Anna

3138
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:27,936
What is Bernie impressions

3139
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:33,312
I don't know if that's true but you know what

3140
02:37:33,568 --> 02:37:35,104
Who does that impression

3141
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,384
We probably had

3142
02:37:42,784 --> 02:37:46,624
Alex
