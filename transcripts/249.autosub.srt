The people have donated to the promotions tab

Talk about how

104
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Claims

105
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
He predicted

106
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,855
All right I want to go into that a little bit

107
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
I'm trying to assess exactly

108
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,975
If we want to give him credit for that

109
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,071
It's sort of up in the air a little bit

110
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
Are we going to

111
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375

Function the way it was

116
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:11,103
I'm not sure even if that's how I would phrase it going to say just taken is

117
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
He predicted 9/11 because he says

118
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
So

119
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,503

169
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
He's not talking about that in the predictive

00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,863
Capacity

171
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887

00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,511
Specific

178
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,327

It is interesting to me you know

187
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023

188
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375

Alex is going to have said something similar.

192
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
It still would have made the exact same amount

193
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
He did do it.

194
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
The Boogeyman

197
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,863
Of some sort

198
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,143
The 2nd

199
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Second

200
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,471
There's also

201
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,239
Reconsider

202
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,031
So he also is comparing

203
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,615
The idea of some terrorist attack that's to come

204
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
Larry and rice tags

205
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
Fire

206
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,943
Which is an important thing

207
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Keep in mind as we

208
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
We go along

209
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,295
Interesting

210
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
There's another guy

211
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,391
The conspiracy world

212
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,487
I don't know if you've ever heard of Bill Cooper

213
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
I do not know anything about Goku

214
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,583
Well let me tell you a little bit

215
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Derek bill

216
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,055
William Cooper Bill Cooper also first name Milton William

217
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,335
Musically

218
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,711
Gucci near the paranoid militia broadcasting world

219
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,271
It is absolutely an early $0

220
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
There's literally no way around

221
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,183
From January 1993 to the time of his death in November 2001

222
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,303
Bill Cooper distributed his own of the time

223
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,095
Then later on a weekly basis

224
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
He covered it all

225
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,935
He dabbled in UFOs and mystery religion

226
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,519
But more importantly the world he was also deeply

227
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,311
Interested in the idea of a one-world government

228
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:06,175
He was a staunch defender of Randy Weaver the central figure Ruby Ridge

229
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,039
It did frequent episodes about hello Oklahoma City and Waco didn't go down the way the government said

230
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,695
He covered the difference between gold and silver as hard money versus the idea of soft currency in paper money

231
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,255
On a March 11th 1990

232
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
3 show

233
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,863
He didn't episode about the internet intentional devaluation of the dollar

234
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,935
He covered the Federal Reserve and how income taxes aren't real

235
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
Derailed on socialist

236
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Spread suspicion about the

237
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,287
Council on Foreign Relations

238
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
And trilateral commission as far back as 1990 when Alex was 19 years old and still years

239
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
From ever being on the radio

240
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,807
On February 18th 1994

241
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,831
Episode

242
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,135
Bill Cooper interview Sheriff Richard Mack

243
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
A central figure of the

244
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
Susanville Sheriff's movement

245
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,743
If someone who go on to be a freak

246
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
There are a lot of overlaps

247
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Between cast

248
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,703
Including Aaron zelman the president of Jews for the preservation of firearms

249
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,311
So it was an early sponsor of Alex Jones

250
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,127
Really gets to the point

251
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
All this is to say

252
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
If you look at spiritually at the stuff

253
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,999
The bill was

254
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
The world

255
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Alex wasn't a big

256
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
I probably was deeply inspired by

257
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
What do you nationally syndicated or was he around the southern Market

258
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,591
Show but it was

259
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,991
You know it made the rounds

260
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Very big deal

261
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,063
You wrote a book called horse

262
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
I don't know if this is true

263
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
He says it

264
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,487
Number one most underground Duster

265
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Computed book

266
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
In the world

267
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
In all of history

268
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:04,447
Because that's no marketing numbers on there is no marketing and nothing really behind him or anything

269
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,823
It's a very very popular book in these world

270
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Who's doing that since

271
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,479
The New York Times number one ranked on Reggie's

272
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
Bestseller

273
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
Sure why not

274
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,879
Books

275
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
I don't know I don't know how you quantify it but it is

276
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
And here's the part where I should probably just

277
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,167
I don't know what time about Bill Cooper

278
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
Yeah I'm going to learn a lot more time

279
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,871
I don't f****** know a whole lot about it

280
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
I know a lot of it matches up with Alex

281
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
And then there's a lot of stuff that Alex

282
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Drive to

283
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Yeah yeah

284
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
But

285
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,023
Bill wasn't too that

286
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,143
The course of his career that the militia Patriots

287
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,775
Interesting UFOs

288
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Question

289
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:19,711
Alex is a huge fan of like coast to coast and George Noory

290
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Turn off

291
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,319
Music I'm sure I'm positive

292
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Alex love

293
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
When did Alex

294
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
Who died in 2000

295
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:35,839
November 2018 November 2000

296
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,167
Fairy shot to accompany head twice

297
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:43,775
Okay

298
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,591
Charged with bank fraud

299
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:52,991
We're not going to f****** fulfill that warrant because we're afraid of an armed standoff

300
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Come out of his house

301
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,319
With a

302
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
He would commonly tell people to

303
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,207
Be quiet right that sort of thing

304
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,487
Cuz I knew you had weapons cache

305
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
Coyote running videos only did this because he had

306
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,447
Reports that

307
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,471
Threatening

308
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
Local residence

309
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:18,591
With weapons

310
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,151
Go through with it

311
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,175
So they do this

312
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
He shows up at

313
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
The car they announce themselves

314
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,039
Police officers

315
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:33,183
All right. The best way for things

316
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Clear that

317
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Didn't believe

318
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
You've been arrested for the

319
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,703
Tax evasion

320
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:49,055
And all that

321
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,615
So he had already made clear

322
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,663
Email to friend

323
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Too long before it all went down

324
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,271
He had said I'm going to take as many down with

325
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
Suspect this is probably what's going to happen

326
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
His house

327
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,743
Or something like that is a real

328
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
Nono for the police

329
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,119
I'm not idle I never liked it when the police kill anybody

330
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Luther Wright

331
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,823
Cuz I understand

332
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,943
Yeah it's the number 2000

333
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
See the way that you

334
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
He described his

335
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Radiokorea

336
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,807
18

337
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
More like he had died

338
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Because he was a

339
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,159
Precursor to Alex Jones

340
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
Apparently he was

341
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Just like

342
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
A sovereign citizen

343
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Like a regular sub

344
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
There's no way you can

345
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Keep your job

346
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,447
With a warrant on you

347
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:55,103
Play themselves well he wasn't living on the lamps

348
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
Uneasy truce

349
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,991
Trouble

350
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:05,343
Execute the warrant

351
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,623
The people around

352
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
It almost doesn't make sense

353
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,439
Do okay

354
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Now alternate

355
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
Alternate Theory

356
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,815
Alright he predicted the

357
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
He did but he got it right on

358
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,167
He said almost the same

359
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Something is Alex

360
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
The government realize

361
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,007
Is that

362
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
In order to

363
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,615
To prop Alex up who is an operative of the CIA

364
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Isn't it always

365
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:30,687
Government control

366
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Control

367
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,015
He's too nice to Israel according

368
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Stormfront

369
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
The reason that they left

370
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,855
Alex a lot

371
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
With the Takeover

372
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
No bill Cooper's I understand

373
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,703
My magic.

374
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
Reality is both of them could have continued to

375
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
Suggested that sword

376
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Perfect which is

377
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,711
Unhinged

378
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,247
Untethered

379
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,599
Criticism of Alex

380
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,439
The system he had them take out

381
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:19,071
More like what you're saying

382
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,399
Conspiracy theory web

383
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Cooper ENT

384
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
More about him as as

385
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063

We can know

388
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,023
That on June 28th

389
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:55,167
2000w before Alex predicted 911 on his show

390
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,191
Bill Cooper

391
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,055
Show hour of the time

392
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:04,383

Play Kiss From a Rose

394
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
Of the Oklahoma City bombing

395
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,952
We were bombarded with anti Patriot anti-morsi to anti

396
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,048
Who's panel look that people believe

397
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:24,352
Are the Constitution for United States of America

398
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,168
Anti-American propaganda

399
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:33,056
Airbnb Timothy McVeigh occurred once again

400
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,848
Prior to

401
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
And immediately following

402
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:43,808
Look cream thing occurred against a word extremist would use over and over and over and over and over and over and over

403
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Over and over and over again

404
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
How many time

405
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
Now we're being bombarded with messages that will, Bin Laden is planning to attack the United States

406
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:53,536
America

407
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
And Israel

408
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
And I'm telling you deep a

409
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
For a major

410
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,616
But it won't be on, bin Laden

411
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:12,992
It will be those behind the New World Order once again

412
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
Want to take

413
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:22,208
The Gardens and the freedom away from the American people because we're the only ones left in the world

414
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,256
Who can oppose

415
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
The destruction of freedom in the world

416
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,960
The implementation of a one-room for solitary in socialist government and that is the goal

417
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,800
So you have basically he predicted

418
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,336
Specifically

419
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,712
Preemptively

420
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,016
Inside Job false flag narrative

421
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
Already before Alex is supposed

422
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
New Theory

423
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Alex

424
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Got his hands

425
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Spawn

426
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,744
Sumerian ritual

427
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Okay

428
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Leadville Cooper out

429
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,240
Look directly into his eyes and

430
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Soul

431
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,080
And that's why

432
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,640
911 he lost his

433
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:16,224
And

434
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
Spoiler alert after 9/11 Bill Cooper

435
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:25,184
Necessarily

436
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
The police

437
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,536
Very much so he's had several

438
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:36,960
Play Don King character

439
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
Chicken standoff

440
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Sound

441
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,872
A little bit later

442
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,152
2001 episode

443
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
You'll hear bill

444
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
Layout almost

445
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Entirely with Alex's 911

446
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,040
The Narrative will end up being

447
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:54,112
And you'll hear a little bit of a similar

448
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,416
To Alex's

449
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Months later prediction

450
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,744
But he makes about

451
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,144
Hitler could not have ever come to power absolute power in Germany without the right

452
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Stag party

453
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:12,032
Hitler was a socialist

454
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
Social engineering

455
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,664
How to get the support of the German people

456
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
I need dirt bike Burning Down The reichstag

457
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
Well

458
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,368
In our country

459
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,160
It would be the Capitol building

460
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,208
Brickenstein

461
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
House of Representatives

462
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:39,936
Somebody were to go and burn down the Capitol building today

463
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,520
They would use that as an excuse as Hitler did

464
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
Round up all of the enemies

465
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:49,152
How the new world order

466
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:51,200
Which would be named

467
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
Both of you look me

468
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,808
Florida prison or Instituto

469
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Declare martial law

470
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,440
I talked to Absolute and total power the surface

471
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
I wonder what

472
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
Karma bin Laden

473
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,864
Target Circle close to me

474
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,960
You know if it doesn't materialize next 2 or 3 weeks

475
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
It will eventually materialized because

476
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
They haven't succeeded

477
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Getting the garden

478
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:25,760
Out of the hands of the American people nor have they succeeded in taking our freedoms away and practice been

479
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:27,808
Great Awakening

480
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
Backlash

481
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,392
Against the Market Common

482
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Naki

483
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,472
Did somebody steal his thesaurus

484
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,544
But you can see a little bit of Alex even there

485
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
-

486
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
Bombast

487
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,760
Explosive Showmanship or whatever you want to call it

488
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,624
Calling these people

489
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:04,160
Now there's a there's a little bit

490
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,464
50mm of

491
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,768
Are there doing these terrorist attacks

492
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
In order to

493
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Bring in

494
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,360
New World Order movement is gaining traction and that's why they're going to have to do this

495
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
In order to

496
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,664
Cut it off at the pass

497
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,992
Or whatever to Alex's version

498
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,808
That it's almost impossible to imagine

499
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,600
Listen to this episode

500
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
And that a month later

501
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,464
Your credit a little bit kind of my big series

502
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
In terms of these

503
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:42,560
2001

504
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Very paranoid man

505
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,168
Quote predicting

506
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
I don't like that

507
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:51,520
You turned every

508
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,288
Things that I believe

509
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Into a lie

510
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
Because even his

511
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,896
F****** Origins

512
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
Everyone

513
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,600
Every Every Little Feather never happened pretty much

514
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,928
Everything Supply behind everything

515
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Totally

516
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,024
Completely dismantled

517
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
Does man's mythology

518
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:19,680
Subway

519
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
Was very helpful

520
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
And now I see no getting in

521
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,848
Little bit of this.

522
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
Giving a shout-out

523
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
The other thing

524
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,504
One I don't like that he had trouble reading

525
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Constitutionalist

526
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,160
I think that was for dramatic effect

527
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
He sounds

528
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:49,120
Super good at his job

529
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,520
I think I think we listen to a lot more episodes

530
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,592
Do you have less of that

531
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,640
He's not is he secretly right about ever

532
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
I can say no

533
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,016
Interesting

534
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
A lot of episodes

535
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
The show where callers call in

536
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
And he'll push back on

537
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
Alex.

538
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,304
Complaints about Alex Jones later on

539
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,144
What is the idea that Alex just listens to rumor and reports it is true

540
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,288
So he like on his show when someone calls in

541
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Tennessee Department of

542
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
On the streets

543
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
Or something like that

544
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
Where is Alex Wolff

545
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Turn that into

546
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,624
The Bill Cooper knows a lot or is right about

547
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,672
No

548
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,280
He does have more of a measured approach to broadcast

549
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,096
Which is why he was never going to become a

550
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:52,864
Successful is out

551
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,680
Already

552
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,264
There's other reasons why Alex

553
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,032
Pay the taxes

554
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:06,432
A bunch of that does hurt your ability to Syndicate probably assumed is active

555
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,576
Lawrence

556
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
I'm telling you

557
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,136
Give me a job

558
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
Dude we're going to have to

559
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
We're going to have to garnish your wages before you start

560
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,048
And also turn you off

561
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,376
We should be having this interview right now

562
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,960
He would have been perfect

563
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Alex

564
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,776
Richard Anderson

565
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,312
Yeah but I think based on the

566
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
Reality

567
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Through the years

568
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,968
You're wanted

569
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,272
You could do that if you're sad

570
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Even more under

571
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,832
He's the number one most

572
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:48,672
Best selling Underground

573
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:53,536
There's a little bit of a beef between Alex Jones and Bill

574
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:57,120
It exists within the Patriot militia world

575
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
This is really

576
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:09,408
This is Drake

577
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,736
I don't have a good grasp on Bill Cooper but I do have a grasp on Alex Jones

578
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,272
It is interesting to see

579
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
Disfigure

580
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:15,808
Come into His

581
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,624
This world is such a demonstrable

582
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,416
Alex is wrong kind of

583
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
In the same way in the sentence

584
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
The first part

585
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
Is it looks

586
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Pretty clear

587
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
That Alex

588
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,864
Number one has to be a huge fan

589
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
Of his rate of the hour of the time

590
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Yeah

591
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
Almost certainly stole that 911

592
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Now

593
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,872
Along the line

594
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,200
This has to be after Bill Cooper was dead

595
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,992
But I'm not sure exactly

596
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:47,296
Alex get to call about Bill

597
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Asking

598
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,088
About

599
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
What do you think about Bill Cooper

600
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,464
What did you think of Bill Cooper

601
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,096
Never try to attack him

602
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,680
Put me on that night

603
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:10,080
He thought I'd never heard it show because I didn't look.

604
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
In Aliens and all the stuff and I've tried to never attacking but people resurrected old tasty out of them and stuff and

605
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
Okay alright

606
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,144
Well

607
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,216
Or whatever I mean

608
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
His

609
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
It's a no too much but

610
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,360
From what I understand he believes that Eisenhower met with aliens

611
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:50,784
Episode

612
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,904
Not too far off in terms of being like I was a little bit

613
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Not

614
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:03,328
We haven't listened to a lot of it has sounded correct on everything Sophie

615
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,400
Is in reference to Uber after

616
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,168
The whites

617
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:09,472
UK episode of the show

618
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,800
Together

619
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,080
Very out of line

620
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
On Y2K

621
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
Of which we covered on I think our second episode Alex

622
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Like

623
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
Episodes of time about how f*****-up Alex's

624
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
Hold on

625
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,376
So somehow will Cooper

626
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,424
Inspiration for Alex

627
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,472
His progenitor

628
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,752
He will

629
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,288
Send timer hours

630
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,384
Yeah it is weird isn't it

631
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:59,648
It is interesting my working theory on a Tuesday Alex hero-worship

632
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,696
Bill Cooper 2

633
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
Disposition

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,304
Is malicious stuff

635
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Salt

636
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,912
Become a bill or something like that

637
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,192
Batman started

638
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
Interact

639
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,520
In some way

640
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:20,128
Hatfield didn't like Alex never lost lyrics

641
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
That's my hilarious

642
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
There's more to this called

643
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,784
How do you spell sorry for Bill and he really let him set them up and

644
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,856
And I ran out there and help them killing

645
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,208
And distractions her I don't talk about flying saucers and

646
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,608
All that stuff man I'm sorry and football team

647
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
Sorry for Bill

648
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,640
Okay thank you

649
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,528
Never caught the guy customary custard everybody

650
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Is that your answer you like that answer

651
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
I believe me I know you're putting

652
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
Uber to

653
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,040
Falling down drunk

654
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,064
Okay

655
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
Needed help

656
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:39,232
IRS

657
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:03,040
Newark

658
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:17,120
How triggered Alex

659
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,680
Brings up the name Bill Cooper

660
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,728
Issues are intense

661
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:29,152
And all across the board but don't you find that interesting like the color just asked what do you think of Bill Cooper

662
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:35,552
Very different is he launches into that with no help from the college

663
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:44,768
And even halfway through the colors like Alex I believe you I trusted you know like interesting I'm

664
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:47,584
I'm on your side still defensive about it

665
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,192
And the reason for that

666
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,472
Is Alex

667
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Is f******

668
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
Totally lying

669
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,312
Absolutely

670
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
Categorically

671
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Totally lie

672
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,456
Bill Cooper has been on Alex Jones Show exactly one time

673
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
In 1998

674
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Yeah

675
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,832
And when he was on

676
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,136
It did not go the way Alex doesn't

677
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Absolutely

678
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,976
There is no indication that

679
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
He cusses at all

680
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,560
Who's on the radio for over 40 minutes

681
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,888
Not including commercial breaks he's probably on an entire hour

682
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,216
Of Alex's show

683
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:33,664
But here is how the interview start

684
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,688
Hello

685
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
My friend just called and he's got an Apache over his house with camera pods and infrared taking

686
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:43,648
Play that on our TV show just wonderful

687
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,208
Call around my unmarked police car

688
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:50,816
Openly taking photographs of this wonderful isn't it

689
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
So you see already this is how we like almost

690
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:59,264
Friendliness

691
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,824
And then immediately starts launch again

692
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:09,248
Impress belt just called in that has a black helicopter over his house

693
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,296
There's a sense of that

694
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
Just another manifestation of the

695
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,280
Nazi gestapo police date which is taking over this country

696
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
Practice

697
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,424
I talked to you this week

698
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,264
44 years old

699
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
He doesn't ever anger you

700
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
Well course it does what angers me most is the stupidity of the vast heard of American people out there

701
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,976
It's also Bill Cooper is one of the people

702
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,000
Noted

703
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
Popularising

704
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Him to thank for that

705
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,448
It seems like the person who's more unhinged has

706
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,056
He's screaming about how mad he is and then there's a long

707
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
Don't you ever get mad almost

708
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,480
As a way of like trying to find the common

709
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
First memes

710
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,904
Heather think they know something and they don't even know what planet they're on to tell you the truth

711
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,000
Simple Thing by private bank print the money and enslave everyone

712
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,792
Simple things like Clintonville

713
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
Transnational Asian

714
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
Will you book Behold a pale horses

715
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,496
Well now and almost everybody that has

716
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,824
Any know-how bond any of these subjects

717
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,688
He's already plugged

718
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
You claimed he hasn't read berlioz

719
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,832
Stupid

720
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
He knows about that book

721
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,392
So he's already

722
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:55,232
If you look at the exit very clearly

723
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,792
100-percent lying about this interact

724
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
88

725
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
Ben 10 years prior to

726
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,448
Track to Lil

727
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,824
Well after I wrote it over a. Of years back

728
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,384
Beginning in the early eighties and continuing up

729
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,944
Into about 88

730
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,784
Senator I believe in 89

731
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:24,928
And I may have added a couple of things in 90 and then it was published in December 1990

732
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:27,232
December 1990

733
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,304
How many copies are out

734
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:37,216
I love you have no idea bendy number one underground best seller of all time with no advertising what's the weather

735
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
River

736
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,264
Amanda

737
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:46,176
People sell it on the street corners in New York City had to take it off the shelf and then

738
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
New York City bookstore because it

739
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,296
Everybody wanted making it the most stolen book in their inventory

740
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,136
The most stolen book in their inventory

741
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,696
I'm around here

742
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,584
Basically an overview of what Behold a Pale Horse

743
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,144
Tell the public and now it's

744
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,496
Even more incredible that so much as what you've written has come through in the last 8 years

745
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
He's

746
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:18,688
You giving him Prosthetics status yeah

747
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,480
Have come true

748
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,272
This interview to me

749
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
Knowing Alex isn't

750
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
From his work

751
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:28,160
I hear an insecure Alex

752
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:33,024
Alex in 98 wasn't the Alex of

753
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
You know the mid

754
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
Delete 2000

755
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
Liqe

756
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
He's not the same broadcast

757
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,984
With the same status in the world

758
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,312
He wants to be a part of

759
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,104
He's a hero in that world

760
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
Totally

761
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:54,272
You like the way he's asking these questions and you heard it twice

762
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
Almost

763
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
I was at 4

764
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,464
There's a sense of reverence

765
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:08,864
Minuscule and I think it's his way of covering not really knowing how to interview this guy that he likes a lot

766
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,656
Yeah that's the sense that I get

767
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,704
It's exactly like

768
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,800
Edith exactly like so many of the times to see Alex

769
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,848
Does daddy issue show up like what the John Birch

770
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:24,736
Oh I'll give you whatever you want please please just

771
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,016
Give me some sort of

772
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,832
F****** there are remnants of that

773
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,880
And you could make the argument

774
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Like Alex

775
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
Future from

776
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
The color glass.

777
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
You could

778
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,816
You can look listen to that and you could say

779
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,400
Well that's not Alex being insecure and Reverend

780
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,752
Sure fired

781
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
That doesn't track with the way he's lauding

782
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:52,128
The way you think that your book all these things

783
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
Been proven true in the last 8 years

784
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:56,735
Keep calling him sir thank you for being here

785
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,087
For sure

786
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Elizabeth

787
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
Much more of the interview itself

788
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,743
Because it's 40 minutes and it's mostly the

789
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:09,791
And more

790
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
You know

791
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
It doesn't serve our

792
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Too much

793
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
To go over that

794
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
Find the whole thing

795
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
A what

796
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,103
Heard from bill which was interesting

797
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:23,871
Based on

798
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
What we know about the

799
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
He is like giving those stock

800
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,087
Like he doesn't believe

801
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
That there's a Blackhawk

802
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:42,559
He doesn't he's just like maybe there is maybe there is

803
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,143
Exact part of reinforcing this

804
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,007
Noahsnoah

805
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
I think that's

806
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,567
Probably

807
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
And I think

808
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
You just hear a guy who's doing the radio

809
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:58,431
Any plane is rolled

810
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:05,855
The end of the

811
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
Where Alex

812
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,791
There are going to be absolutely amazed

813
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,655
A couple times and it is a lot of good information people see and I

814
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,703
Hi I do respect you and

815
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,983
And I

816
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,799
I certainly hope that the FED do back down

817
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:29,663
Because I know that the revolution in this country we've had a couple of them

818
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,455
T1

819
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:35,295
And that's it the whole thing starts I know that I'm on the way

820
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:41,183
Website

821
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,463
And actually before that

822
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,023
Cut that clip terribly before

823
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
To stay over another break

824
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
I love the idea of

825
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
Kick him off the air isn't true

826
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:53,471
They'd already run over the time allotted for their interview and he was asking

827
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,847
Stick around later I'll stick around but I've got a plug my website

828
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,247
For the weekend can't you stay one more day discussion

829
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,807
With the collar about Vale don't track with reality

830
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,599
At all

831
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
Start swearing Alex

832
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:12,927
None of that is

833
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:16,767
Defend themselves

834
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
That is a hundred percent

835
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Is that what I

836
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
I was really hope

837
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Hoping for a repeat

838
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,287
Okay

839
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Interesting Lee

840
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
September 11th

841
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,831
Gentleman who put out their words

842
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
So Bill Cooper ends up dying

843
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
In November

844
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,231
2001

845
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,511
Thought before he died

846
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:49,791
On the 26th

847
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,583
For September 2001

848
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,143
He puts out an episode of our of the time

849
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Titled

850
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,191
Alex Jones

851
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Liar

852
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,311
This is cool here is the first clips

853
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,199
Tower of the time William Cooper Good Evening Post

854
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:11,039
Probably get started after clear up a little

855
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,831
Discrepancy here

856
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,207
Who did the last week

857
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:22,815
Beginning work email about this and receive One telephone call

858
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:27,167
Apparently somebody call the Alex Jones

859
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Broadcast

860
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:33,823
I didn't have me on the air ask him something about me

861
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:37,919
Alex Jones Eddie and have me on the year

862
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,711
Before

863
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,735
Several years ago

864
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:46,111
And had to cut me off the air because of the foul language that I you

865
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:51,231
Sony air tonight I'm going to tell you Alex Jones

866
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
You are a bowl

867
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Face

868
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,071
Miserable

869
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
Thinking little

870
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
Howard liar

871
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:05,823
Don't say that again cuz there's no mistake about it you can all tell Alex Jones that I said there

872
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
He's with me because he does

873
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,431
Alex Jones

874
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,271
You are bold-faced stinking rotten little coward liar

875
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,879
Feels good

876
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,487
There's a piece of this that I kind of decided to do this episode

877
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
Partially because of

878
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:27,839
Alex's weird 911 stuff last week

879
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Yeah

880
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,935
Prediction but then I also really wanted

881
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,703
Adjust

882
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Take a

883
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
Tikka sort of

884
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
I don't know it's almost to walk

885
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:43,455
A little bit for an episode of just like we get to Cooper telling Alex Jones

886
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,575
Go f*** himself interrupting everything

887
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
And especially you

888
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:58,047
I want to listen to all of this

889
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
Whatever I said that

890
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,703
Was the precursor for Alex Jones are showing ours

891
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,543
Really right on well

892
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,383
He was kicking ass dude what we're doing now and Noble

893
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,455
Where are you hope that we

894
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,991
We get a review on iTunes

895
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,719
But it's not like every episode of his show is about exposing the b******* of the hour

896
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,767
Like you is one episode here from the 30

897
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:35,167
18th of September next I want to listen to that

898
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,191
Biological attack

899
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,471
October 9th

900
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,799
There's a lot of like

901
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:44,895
Most of his show it does appear that

902
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,967
Is crazy conspiratorial nonsense

903
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:52,063
Okay and I will try and

904
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,855
Make a real-world corollaries

905
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,927
Alright Year from September 11th

906
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,231
New York attack 9/11

907
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Number 8

908
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:00,767
Cheetah 10 episode

909
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,119
I really nailed that one probably

910
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:15,615
Let's try this one owls from the 14th of February 2000

911
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
The guardian

912
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:25,855
Owls of Ga'Hoole

913
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,279
Abundantly clear and I think I have already

914
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:37,375
I don't know a ton about Bill Cooper it's nothing that I'm saying

915
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,911
In any way

916
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:44,799
Ice cream that I

917
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:50,175
Cooper has been right about everything I'm certain if I listen to a ton more of these episodes

918
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,199
I would find

919
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
Hunza problems and probably incredibly late

920
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,231
And probably really scary dangerous

921
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,047
I am certain of that

922
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
In the same

923
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:13,471
I can say I'm interested in his interaction intersection with the world then we cover bees ivy

924
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,519
Did Heathcliff

925
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,799
Clearly his

926
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,847
And clearly

927
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,383
It didn't work out for Alex

928
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,943
And that's pretty funny

929
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Broadcast

930
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
Kerry Cassidy

931
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,831
It's hard to tell her YouTube channel probably started

932
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:29,855
2010

933
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,903
Butcher project

934
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Before that

935
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,767
Board mean that it started in November

936
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,559
2001 when the

937
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
Bill Cooper

938
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
Was was

939
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
Instead transported

940
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
Into the body

941
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,103
Films made by

942
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
Hours

943
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:59,807
Kerry Cassidy is a fan of Alex Jones isn't that point

944
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,879
William Williams

945
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
Nearest

946
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Okay

947
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,287
Air raid siren in Menlo Park

948
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:30,783
But I'm also glad we don't have a theme song

949
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,367
I don't want to get too into the weeds because like I said I do have some

950
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
Some very strong reason

951
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
The suspect the Bill Cooper

952
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:41,791
If only

953
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:46,399
Vacations good indication

954
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
Drawings

955
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:52,287
Pictures of red flag of some, I mean like from I mean like

956
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
His work

957
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:56,895
Don't know enough about it to be conversing

958
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,711
So this is one of these weird

959
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,735
Before we started the show.

960
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
Your place for me to be in because

961
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,855
Cuz we're covering a topic that I admittedly don't have a good handle

962
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,647
Like I only know

963
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,695
As much as I know and it's

964
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:15,071
The world I know

965
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
Have a hold on a tiny piece

966
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:20,447
So I feel out of my depth

967
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Variance

968
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:21,983
Insecure but

969
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:22,751
This is

970
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,031
This is more like

971
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
Teaser episode 4

972
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Text timey wimey Wednesday

973
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:32,991
Bill Cooper

974
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:35,551
I want to know all about Bill Cooper and about how he

975
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:40,415
I'm absolutely certain of that

976
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:45,791
Is there a Monday episode that I should say

977
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:46,559
That

978
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,863
2009

979
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,655
The one of the big reasons

980
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:54,751
In addition to last week Alex re bring up 9/11 all that s***

981
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
2000

982
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,943
Hazzard episodes

983
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:11,135
You can call out

984
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,767
I was only on the Alex Jones Show

985
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,351
Years ago

986
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,399
I didn't know who he was

987
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,751
When I didn't the realize little liar and a coward and a

988
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
Tapetilla

989
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
Bulshit artist of the year

990
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,735
Biltwell 14

991
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:42,879
Broadcast that's when I was doing guest appearances on broadcast years ago

992
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,695
I was not cut off

993
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,303
I did not use any kind of foul language so ever

994
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:54,143
He treated me very well

995
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
Track

996
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
For the whole show

997
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,055
Totally true love you in Texas

998
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,103
Know that that's true because you

999
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,895
Heard the broadcast

1000
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:09,759
Who Alex Jones was and what he was doing to the truth

1001
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,391
Cowardly liar and can't April she really is

1002
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,463
Israeli tiny calls me

1003
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,487
After that

1004
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:22,559
I've always refused to appear on a project

1005
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:26,143
Absolutely refused to lend him any credibility whatsoever

1006
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,191
Bye.

1007
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,727
Broadcast

1008
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:32,287
Very angry

1009
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:39,199
I believe everything

1010
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:44,831
Alex

1011
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,999
Like I said probably wrong about just about everything

1012
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Morningside Alex wanted me to come back on

1013
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,887
Three times before the cock crows

1014
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
Is that you said about

1015
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,311
You can get away with appearing on shows that

1016
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
You don't support

1017
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,359
A little bit

1018
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:13,247
Like with that you know that that have idea because I don't think you should crucify somebody

1019
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,551
For appearing on a show that asked them to

1020
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,087
To be on that you don't

1021
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
Like

1022
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
Know your episode of punk

1023
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:22,463
It was weird I got that was just

1024
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
Timberlake

1025
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,279
The only reference I have for Punk

1026
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,607
The reason I'm thinking about this is like there's

1027
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,631
Tons and tons

1028
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,191
Cast of Alex Jones Show who have been guests

1029
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,471
On Red Ice Radio

1030
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,751
Red Ice TV

1031
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,031
Yes I'm out right

1032
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,823
White nationalist

1033
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:42,175
Know what it was

1034
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
And got asked

1035
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:43,967
To come on

1036
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,247
As like a

1037
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
To show there's some listeners

1038
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:54,719
Everybody's got a

1039
00:54:54,975 --> 00:55:01,119
You can blow it every every

1040
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,143
I should have done that

1041
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,287
Later realized

1042
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:18,271
Turn on red eye sport

1043
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,671
You do not know the character of the show

1044
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:29,535
If you're able to learn the character I'm just saying I'm just saying

1045
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,607
I'm just saying

1046
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,911
I'm just saying

1047
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Inside

1048
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
So I believe all that

1049
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,775
I think that's a bills probably

1050
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,383
The idea that Alex wanted to back on said no and I do

1051
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,151
Think there's nothing

1052
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:50,015
Nothing terrible about it

1053
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:51,551
And how he reacts to

1054
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:52,575
Situations

1055
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,855
Exactly what

1056
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,647
Exactly like what Bill Cooper

1057
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:56,927
Alex's

1058
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Exactly

1059
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:00,511
Is acting like everything good Bill Cooper says was 10

1060
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Hundred percent correct

1061
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,559
It feels like

1062
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
All the things that we would have

1063
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,679
Just listening to Alex

1064
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:14,591
Oh yeah

1065
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,855
This thing here

1066
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,951
Infowars

1067
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,719
Used to have

1068
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:37,375
Video up

1069
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,423
Alex is trying to

1070
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,471
To bury this part of

1071
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,799
He hear that Bill Cooper is right about everything

1072
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,383
Siri can only go so far as

1073
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,663
He's right about Alex

1074
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,247
Yes that doesn't mean that he's right about other things

1075
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:00,415
God knows

1076
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,487
Should have seen what I ate yesterday

1077
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,511
Call boy

1078
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Pennywise

1079
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,727
I'll tell you who's never even

1080
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:19,103
Untrue certainly certainly

1081
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,663
He makes his chili homemade

1082
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,599
In his talk with a collar where he's lying about Bill

1083
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:32,159
He says the bill edited up videos of me

1084
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,535
You was about to

1085
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,839
Calling Alex Jones wire tuck

1086
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,887
He brings up why he did

1087
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:46,751
I'm also we do him for the lying-in-state Coronavirus

1088
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:48,799
Bulshit artist of the year

1089
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:53,663
To your attention

1090
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,223
The lines under the feet

1091
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
A rumor that he spread

1092
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Over the airwaves

1093
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,343
Better not good

1094
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,743
How about AR Presley not good for Melissa

1095
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,767
And Patriots

1096
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,887
Broadcast you ever did

1097
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,935
Garner

1098
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,959
New Year's Eve

1099
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,519
What year

1100
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,311
2000

1101
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,871
The New York

1102
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:25,663
1999

1103
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,967
Bring your beer 2000

1104
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,063
What you went completely out of his mind

1105
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,087
Queen

1106
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
Intercontinental

1107
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,719
Ballistic missile

1108
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,511
With multiple Warheads

1109
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,911
After United States of America millions of people who are putting their children and their

1110
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,959
Borinquen their cars and heading for the Hills

1111
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,799
So right there on

1112
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:53,567
I think it's

1113
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,591
Really important

1114
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,895
The point out that what bill is taking issue

1115
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
So personal

1116
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,711
Offended by this

1117
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:01,247
1

1118
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,783
It's Alex has no respect for

1119
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
Effacing is operation

1120
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,135
Reportaj

1121
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
Entirely on rumors and

1122
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,207
Conjecture and hearsay

1123
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,791
The second Bill recognizes that

1124
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
Alex

1125
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,351
Have an effect on the

1126
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Go hear them

1127
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
He's taking

1128
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:22,495
Yeah it's strong issue with the idea

1129
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,543
People heard them and got into a panic

1130
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,615
That's part of his negative consequence

1131
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
Yeah

1132
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,479
Who the f*** is Bill Cooper

1133
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,575
Recognizes

1134
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,879
Responsibilities of someone in a position

1135
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,927
Or like

1136
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
That is

1137
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,975
Don't get people in

1138
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
To the place

1139
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,143
Hear your life

1140
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:52,191
And that's important

1141
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,823
Yeah I can we try and bring it up but it often gets buried in terms

1142
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,639
Except for whenever people talk about Alex

1143
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:01,663
Visa vie

1144
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,967
Getting Sandy Hook families harassed

1145
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:09,087
The human element of it is so

1146
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,647
It's not ignored but it's

1147
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
It's very rarely

1148
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Made

1149
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:14,975
A big part

1150
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
Yeah

1151
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Stoneberry

1152
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:26,239
He's got Alex Jones's ideology Dan Rather

1153
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
It's it's like

1154
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
Call me in the

1155
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,639
Saying that everybody is going to

1156
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:38,015
A little incongruity

1157
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:39,039
In the Deep

1158
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:42,879
Boring

1159
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
And they're coming

1160
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,719
To murder you

1161
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
Zombie

1162
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,071
The hours of time

1163
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,887
Go to shows it like

1164
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,679
Few not boring

1165
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:02,079
Is much different than having a boring delivery

1166
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
Stephen with his

1167
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,383
Terrible delivery

1168
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,663
Get well soon

1169
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:10,015
Nobody needs to lie about me

1170
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,087
Sometimes I am irritated

1171
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:19,743
Sometimes I absolutely will not suffer fools and am just as rude as I can be

1172
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,071
Alex Jones

1173
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:28,959
Next time somebody calls your broadcast and ask them about me you tell the truth

1174
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,775
Lots of fruits that you can tell about me

1175
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,591
Don't ever lie on me buddy

1176
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:37,663
You off at your uncle

1177
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,967
I will chew you up I will

1178
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,807
Put you out for the lying stinking rotten little coward that you are

1179
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
It's a lot of the main points

1180
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,671
Yeah I will I'm going to give him a

1181
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,695
Slight

1182
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
Look just

1183
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Studio notes

1184
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,143
You were doing great

1185
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:04,543
It is a little bit weak

1186
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,079
You off at the ankles it's kind of like

1187
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
It's on gratifying as a threat

1188
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,223
I don't know yeah you're not wrong

1189
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:15,807
Now

1190
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,111
Redundant

1191
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:19,391
Forgiving others

1192
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,743
Studio notes the idea of life

1193
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:27,071
Never be said enough quite frankly but

1194
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
Yeah

1195
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:29,887
What's interesting

1196
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,423
Is that called we heard

1197
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,191
From Alex

1198
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:38,847
Talk to the caller Bill Cooper

1199
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,759
Bill was Devin of 2001

1200
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,831
Bill put out this episode responding to a caller

1201
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,111
Calling into Alex

1202
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:50,879
To show

1203
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,415
And Alex responding.

1204
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,231
Exact same what do know that at least

1205
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,255
From 2001

1206
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:58,559
Onward that's been Alex's

1207
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Sort of

1208
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
Rewriting of the interview

1209
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Area was like

1210
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
Do you feel that

1211
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,943
That's true but I think it's because it highlights.

1212
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
What's so important

1213
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,503
About his own self

1214
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,271
Mythology

1215
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,599
Yes

1216
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:24,671
He is a coward

1217
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Bill Cooper

1218
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
And I don't mean to say

1219
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,767
Admirable

1220
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
He is the one who

1221
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,911
Clearly was willing to

1222
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
To stand on

1223
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,007
Whatever principles no matter how dumb

1224
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,311
Or backwards

1225
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,103
A f****** cop

1226
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
And got killed

1227
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,455
Rather than own up to the fact that he's got to pay taxes

1228
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:54,111
Like that's not a good thing but if you look at a propaganda

1229
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
You have your principal

1230
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,719
Yes

1231
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
Good or bad

1232
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,095
You present yourself as believing in

1233
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,887
And with Alex

1234
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,215
Alex

1235
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,751
Position

1236
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,543
And all of those things and we've said

1237
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,103
According to your own principles

1238
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,639
You should be against the

1239
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,455
Just be

1240
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:26,367
Like fuk about other than believing that the government was coming to kill

1241
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
Plane

1242
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:30,719
What's up

1243
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
Ideologically

1244
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,303
Consistent as he was

1245
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
Hughes crazy cancer

1246
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:44,287
It does appear that way again

1247
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,823
It's hard for me to say

1248
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,479
Is that it is that there is a

1249
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
He wasn't deviating that

1250
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,647
Did the clip show

1251
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
Supposed to just

1252
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Doing the beat

1253
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:05,791
So that's the thing that gets me as far as

1254
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,607
As far as the conman non-con man level

1255
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,679
Recognize that the beef

1256
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,727
Yeah you know but they don't do

1257
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,543
Specifics about each other

1258
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
Clip show

1259
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,151
Not generally

1260
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:25,759
Alex was shooting all over the bed doing the Glenn Beck

1261
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
Expose

1262
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:33,951
But Bill f****** did it man he went straight for the car

1263
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:38,047
He sells books

1264
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,935
Episodes that I've listened to a number of

1265
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,287
I listen to a number of them and he doesn't ask

1266
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
For money

1267
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
Really

1268
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,103
Like the car

1269
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,151
Isabel

1270
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
And there's even a

1271
01:05:54,687 --> 01:06:00,319
Call that I heard where this guy was talking about how he doesn't have a lot of money but when he does he's going to send Bill some

1272
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:04,927
Have all the air time

1273
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,975
Like not mentally but she's like haha

1274
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,023
Alright well thank you

1275
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:09,791
Florida

1276
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
It doesn't seem like he's motivated by the sea

1277
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,423
In terms of

1278
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,727
Things that are true for his own enrichment

1279
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,543
Primarily motivated by

1280
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,847
I want to know more about Bill Cooper

1281
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
Open episode

1282
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,527
Open up way too big of a Vista

1283
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,575
You know like the horizon

1284
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:33,599
Two large

1285
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,903
What's the name of this Tower of the

1286
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,439
The time alright well

1287
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,511
About Alex

1288
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,071
And it was knowledge

1289
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,143
Alright so now we just moved Cooper

1290
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
Legit

1291
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,591
Only interest

1292
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,895
Really in as much as he is sort of a

1293
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
Prototype

1294
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,735
Precursor to out

1295
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,807
And someone who seems to believe that much more than Alex

1296
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,855
And Alex was able to use

1297
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:11,999
A lot of fields good for in a lot of the world that bill was right as the window dressing

1298
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
Camouflage

1299
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,839
For him to sell Ted Anderson's gold and all the other scams

1300
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:22,495
Approach to cover and more

1301
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:26,591
Let's just talk Bill Cooper for a bit

1302
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:31,711
I understand about him but

1303
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,015
Enrich our understanding

1304
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:38,111
Early Alex Jones

1305
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:39,135
Alex Azar

1306
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:45,791
Like a lot of that you can't find on the internet and man I've been trying to

1307
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,839
Males have been returned

1308
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
No idea

1309
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,143
Cuz I can't find

1310
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,959
These early days Alex Jones episode

1311
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
Super easily there's very few

1312
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,311
Resources

1313
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,847
No

1314
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,151
But this does give a window into

1315
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
What that world was like

1316
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,831
What is this

1317
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
Formed

1318
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Into what he would but

1319
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
Abundantly

1320
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,351
The Logical endpoint

1321
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:22,911
Alex Jones

1322
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,191
InStyle propaganda

1323
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Who actually

1324
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:30,335
The Logical endpoint for an Alex Jones that believes what

1325
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
How do you say

1326
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:33,151
Is to be murdered by the cops

1327
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,455
Like that's the reality of it

1328
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
Simply by his continued

1329
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
Existence

1330
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:44,671
We can surmise that Alex Jones because we have a case study

1331
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
They're saying

1332
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,975
F******

1333
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,583
Just a tiny bit

1334
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,375
Because it didn't have to go that way

1335
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:55,167
Because

1336
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
Bill could have continued doing a

1337
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,727
Exactly what

1338
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,751
You was doing if you wasn't

1339
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,031
Threatening local

1340
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
With guns

1341
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,079
And stuff like that

1342
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,103
It wasn't just

1343
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
His presence

1344
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,919
Threatened that he was going around harassing

1345
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,223
And Alex

1346
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
I don't know

1347
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:13,087
Book fair

1348
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,623
He doesn't have an outstanding

1349
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,695
Warrant for bank fraud and tax evasion that the cops could act

1350
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,511
You'd have to be a new

1351
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Moshe

1352
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:23,071
For the directive

1353
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
Bill Cooper

1354
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,887
To commit suicide by cop

1355
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,959
He didn't have to go that route it's not the logical

1356
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,007
Propaganda

1357
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Just like the Superbowl

1358
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,847
It's a logical endpoint of abrupt

1359
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,383
Believes this load of stuff

1360
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,455
And also likes to threaten people with guns

1361
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,503
I don't want to give him

1362
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
For his death

1363
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,831
Beat like being like well

1364
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,135
We are saying that it's like

1365
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,671
You believed it enough to get there

1366
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,999
But

1367
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,047
Really precipitated it is him being

1368
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
F****** a******

1369
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,119
And also

1370
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
Gone pee

1371
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:10,943
Ms like if the cops come for your guns you need to be prepared to kill the cop

1372
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,783
Present

1373
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,487
Weird

1374
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,559
To see the parallels between so many Underground

1375
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:29,887
Like Comedians and musicians who

1376
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:36,543
Everybody's like I should have been more a bigger than Nirvana

1377
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:44,991
Bill Cooper

1378
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,295
And I think this is one of the reasons why

1379
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
The difficult episode

1380
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,367
For me to do is like a lot of people

1381
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,207
I thought you know exactly how cute

1382
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,559
And then there's a lot of people who listen

1383
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:01,887
No quitters were built

1384
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,655
The showare

1385
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,191
We're giving an introduction

1386
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,215
Sort of tooth

1387
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495
As another topic

1388
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
It will come up over the course

1389
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:08,543
Podcast

1390
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
End

1391
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,615
That might be unsatisfying

1392
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:16,479
Metaphorical mudhoney fans or whatever

1393
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:20,319
You don't need because because what you're expressing isn't

1394
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,135
Truly

1395
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
He was cute

1396
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,439
He's very big

1397
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,999
But obviously

1398
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Commit suicide

1399
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,815
That's probably one of the reasons

1400
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
Is lingering

1401
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,143
Poni

1402
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,703
Computer stuff after that

1403
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
But

1404
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,287
He's not a miner variable

1405
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
He is someone who was

1406
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,103
Very important

1407
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
To this world

1408
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,175
Piercing propaganda

1409
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
Banana.

1410
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:56,415
You want to you want to bring a button

1411
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:03,583
No

1412
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
It's all just

1413
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,959
Like what I've been expressing this

1414
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
Entire time at what I said

1415
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,311
I don't know a ton

1416
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:15,359
I want a gun to learn more

1417
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:17,151
But as we're doing the show

1418
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
This episode

1419
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,711
It's not

1420
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
To give like

1421
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
Peterbilt

1422
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,063
Uber

1423
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,391
Here's an interesting incident from Alex's career

1424
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
Cooper

1425
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:39,167
I know you're Furious that you're conversant and not a PhD in the subject or less

1426
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,495
And I just have to make

1427
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,823
It'll happen

1428
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,383
We already know that

1429
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,151
Who's lying

1430
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
But in this next clip

1431
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:59,647
Fill your hand first tuition what else is what else is Alex feeling

1432
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,463
Truck delivery companies

1433
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,255
No building kill nog

1434
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:08,863
On bills show where you talk about Alex Jones is a liar

1435
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,143
Yeah which again

1436
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,191
We don't need a backup to prove

1437
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,215
It is the case

1438
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,799
Bill take some calls and they all have his back

1439
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,103
Music near me

1440
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
1998

1441
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,183
Yeah I heard it

1442
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:36,511
1992 did he hear

1443
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,983
Thank you for dinner

1444
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:50,335
Alex Jones is a miserable rotten little

1445
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,895
Howard Lebow Facebook

1446
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,199
Boring

1447
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:02,111
All these people are no better than to mess with me because I don't take any crap

1448
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,647
From anybody

1449
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:10,047
I'm not afraid of the whole national anthem for the entire government gestapo what is my helmet

1450
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:15,423
Aljo place that I would ever be afraid of his cowardly little rotten butt

1451
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
Pretty think you're near

1452
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,591
Said about the Alex

1453
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,943
Archived on the internet at one time and I did hear that interview

1454
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,831
And I wasn't thrown off the air

1455
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:39,743
Interview I ever did without it goes as soon as I found out what he was doing and who he really was I

1456
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
100 times in France

1457
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,119
I've always told him to take a hike

1458
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,215
Appreciate

1459
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
So

1460
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,359
Interesting things to wrestle with

1461
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:56,127
Is that

1462
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
Bill is right

1463
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,247
Like he's on your percent right

1464
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,783
The circumstance

1465
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
B

1466
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,415
He's also probably

1467
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,487
I think he's probably worse than Alex

1468
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
In terms of being really extreme

1469
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:16,095
You're insane

1470
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,887
Banality of evil

1471
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,751
Alex is an impotent

1472
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:30,431
A small cross-section of his audience will end up doing terrible things

1473
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
Just get lulled into a

1474
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,271
Learned helplessness in by Prada

1475
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
Nature of the scam

1476
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,135
I think the people who listen to

1477
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:51,167
Whatever was serious and focused and likes when they're talking about a subject

1478
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,471
Directly talking about it and then when they're done talking

1479
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
You know like how I f******

1480
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,615
Serial killer is goddamn organized and ready

1481
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,919
Alex Jones

1482
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Prince Humperdinck

1483
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,039
Bill

1484
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,087
Is Christopher Guest

1485
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
The torture in

1486
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:12,415
Christopher Guest

1487
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
Don't give a fuk

1488
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
He's just going to do what you can

1489
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:18,559
Twilight

1490
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:21,887
Apparently everybody was out

1491
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,679
50/50

1492
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:29,823
I don't know I don't know how to your right or earlier I don't know how to put a button on this and there is nobody this is just kind of interesting

1493
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:31,359
Snapshot

1494
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:34,431
Ideally we'll build on more as time goes on

1495
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,759
But it's a Snapchat worth looking at even without brand

1496
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:38,527
Context

1497
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
Cuz

1498
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,111
We Now understand a little bit better

1499
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,903
Where Alex gets these ideas

1500
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,439
11

1501
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,975
Which is worse it on its own

1502
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
And then beyond that week

1503
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:52,095
Hear someone call

1504
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:58,495
Which is always fun season we're introducing a new villains and we're f******

1505
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Course your first step

1506
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
Going to get closure

1507
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:02,847
Nope

1508
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,383
Season monarch

1509
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,687
Or not we could

1510
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,599
As time goes on I'll probably go ahead and read

1511
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,951
In the past but go ahead

1512
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,583
