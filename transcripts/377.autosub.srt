1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,328
Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
Jordan

6
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:15,008
If you recall everything I have perfect recall

7
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:20,128
Absolutely you had a bet with a friend and your hair was incredibly

8
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,688
Yeah my question

9
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,736
Yeah would you ever grow your hair out again

10
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,040
BMI of course I would but I don't

11
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
Voluntarily

12
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
My hair grows really fast

13
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,136
It's a real hassle

14
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,208
For me like it it's a situation where I have to either like

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,000
Except very heavy

16
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:42,912
Expenses going to a barber shop or just buzzing my head in in intervals and that's the method

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,680
I'm going with

18
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
You stick with Matt Yanik buzzing yeah I just

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
Yeah yeah

20
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
Good with the hairdos or

21
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,944
Moose put mousse

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,296
What have you put mousse in your doing I was much younger Paul made

23
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,600
You are a

24
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
I don't know if your

25
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:09,024
The part in the middle or to the side I don't understand I don't get a hip it

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
My head looks

27
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,072
Pretty decent

28
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
Just buzzed

29
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm kind of like I'm cool with that

30
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
I'm just hoping like

31
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
Eventually I either go bald or gray figure out what to do with it

32
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
I don't have to worry about it for too much

33
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,176
I know that when I had hair down to like me

34
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
My shoulder

35
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,040
I don't want to do that ever

36
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,088
Yeah yeah that's too much

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
You had to condition the s*** out of

38
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,928
I imagine right one by

39
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,024
Pareidolia

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,840
I really really hate

41
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
When my hair gets long enough

42
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
Yeah really find that to be

43
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,752
Especially that middle ground grits

44
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
Short

45
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
To put behind like an ear

46
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
And too long to not keep out of the eye

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Anyway I probably just

48
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Keep buzzing my head for a bit

49
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
I don't know a lot about the moose

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
But I do know a bit about the Alex Jones

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
So do I figured you do today is like

52
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,536
Continue a little bit in the present day

53
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
I felt like there was stuff that was going on that felt a little unresolved

54
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,144
Like that I didn't

55
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,752
Hill at the end of our last episode Alex was really freaking out about something

56
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
And it definitely appeared to be that New York Times story that it come out that same day

57
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,272
Ballet cats probably what's going on but I wanted to know a little bit more wanted to test my assumption

58
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,088
You know if that was actually the case

59
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:41,952
And see if he actually responded to that story at all so I continued here

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
Discovering

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,768
December 6th

62
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
To the 10th

63
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,072
But it's really just

64
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
The SEC

65
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,448
It'll become clear why the temp is involved

66
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,008
There is a coda

67
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,616
Butts

68
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
Say thank you to Spokes

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664

Knock because I'll have to run our policy wonk

78
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
IQ policy Nook

79
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Where's Malik

80
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Where is

81
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,623
If you were out there listening like they showed like support

82
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
This courtroom

83
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,815
So quick a little note here

84
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
I'm

85
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,607
Getting into this

86
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
New schedule here

87
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
Ruby Tuesday Thursday

88
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Episodes 2-week

89
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,239
I'm not enjoying

90
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
I know it's not the two episode aspect of it I just doesn't feel right

91
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
That's all I think

92
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:12,319
I hate to make these fine-tune adjustments after we've already made and adjustment natural they kind of have to

93
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,879
So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to say

94
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
Starting next week

95
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
We're going to go Monday Wednesday

96
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,511
Yeah I think that feels a little bit more

97
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,279
Better

98
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,327
Feedback from listeners if they miss

99
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
Starting to the week with the show

100
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
Yeah that works

101
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,239
I meant to make sense cuz a lot of people listen at offices

102
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,567
I've heard enough of that kind of feedback

103
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
And I'm also have experienced a little bit of

104
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,735
Myself that I think that's a much better

105
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,087
Schedule and I only chose tuesday-thursday because it seems like it was spread out

106
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,623
Throughout the week

107
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
Right I have no marriage to those dates or anything

108
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Sing like that so

109
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,815
Will have episodes on Monday and Wednesday and then the other thing

110
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,119
This is not a backdooring of train

111
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
How to get back to three episodes really feel like you're about to

112
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
I'm not specifically doing that but

113
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:07,615
Having Monday Wednesday be the episodes allows us to in case there's an emergency

114
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
Having episode on Friday

115
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
That possibility

116
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:15,039
Is much better than having the tuesday-thursday where it's like well

117
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
If something happens at the end of the week that's like

118
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
Critical talk about scramble

119
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
It allows us a lot more Flex

120
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Disability and

121
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,095
Better serves

122
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
The people who have

123
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,727
Responded

124
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
Moving for everything to do Monday Wednesday

125
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
Well businesses

126
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,455
I think that's a good idea

127
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
Learning by doing

128
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,551
And so you could start doing some

129
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Adjust

130
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,111
A little bit

131
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
So

132
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Get ready for that

133
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
Let's do next Monday

134
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,047
Text the 5th was the day of the last

135
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
Should we cover to Alex and the show and just

136
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,935
F***** up headspace he needs to get off there he's talking about how like

137
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
It's coming time

138
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,495
Kill people

139
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,287
And it's just it was very until

140
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:09,823
Yeah

141
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
Zoe starts on the sick

142
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
And Alex is a little bit more

143
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
December 6th

144
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,463
I tend to get in here

145
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Broadcast

146
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,279
Have this whole transmission planned out

147
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Really mad

148
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
Myself Simon try as best I can

149
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
In the first 30 minutes to just

150
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,687
All this New Zealand I just mention it

151
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
That's not helpful

152
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,319
We can open the phones up

153
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
This is so standard now

154
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Like this is become

155
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:04,607
Just like his boilerplate enter intro to episode like it's not every episode but it's Gary regularly

156
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,375
Shows with

157
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,983
I realized that I never get to anything

158
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
I'm going to do it and I'm going to take your calls it's going to be great I'm going to do what I

159
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Set out to do

160
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,919
Right it makes me it makes me worry that he's never going to quit

161
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:23,039
Well I don't know I don't know if he's drinking

162
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
We've discussed in the past that like Alex has

163
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
Said that he stopped drinking

164
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,951
Singing that he's like I don't know it was like 90 days

165
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,231
Off booze rack

166
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
Rogan said that Alex had told him that behind

167
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
Great entirely possible I'm not

168
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,887
I'm not one to be like

169
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,423
Make accusations on

170
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,751
On that cuz the kids behaviors that we could pinpoint as

171
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:49,151
Is drunk behavior is like yelling at that woman cupcake on the street talking about pissing on a tree stumbling stag

172
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,295
Slurring words are those and drinking on are like those I have not seen during this time

173
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
Sorry I believe that

174
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:01,439
However is it saying that I'm going to get down to business and really take care of s***

175
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:07,839
That is never willpower I'm not saying that his willpower is not the strong enough to quit drinking

176
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
But to do his job well

177
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,727
The different muscle

178
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
I think I think that

179
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,335
You know

180
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
What what what is going on is

181
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,943
Is that he recognizes

182
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:23,967
Is that there is an issue

183
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,527
But he also doesn't have a solution to that issue

184
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:30,111
No it's definitely not mentioning fix buckling down

185
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:30,879
Actually getting to be

186
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,951
These new stories would require like actual meat

187
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,231
Substance

188
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,047
He knows that there's nothing past headline

189
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
You knows if he talks about any of these stories

190
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,119
Without

191
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,519
Ranting about the devil if he takes more than a minute or two on any of these stories it immediately falls apart

192
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Reno's he can't buckle down but he also recognizes

193
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
That is what I should be

194
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:56,223
Please start every episode like this is the time I'm going to actually get down to it

195
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
That's great

196
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:01,087
Adidas actually talk talk about some news headlines

197
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,879
He doesn't mention something

198
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,695
Carrying over from the 5th

199
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
Is it the end of the episode on the 5th

200
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,351
Alex said that there was a story a big story about Putin that he needed to go

201
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,679
Get to I didn't even do it to the story

202
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,959
Answer here on the 6th

203
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Makes right

204
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:23,615
Some of this news is news I didn't get to yesterday that's so important

205
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:24,639
Today

206
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
And that of course is Putin

207
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
In some countries the world

208
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
Some countries in the world

209
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
The word mother

210
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,975
Is being replaced

211
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
How big is statement is that actually true

212
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,351
And just let that sink in

213
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
Play Thinking Jordan

214
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
Okay I've let it sink in

215
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,359
So Alex is covering the story about Vladimir Putin expressing

216
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Comments in a meeting

217
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
That was taking place with you Russian

218
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Council for inter-ethnic relations

219
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,783
Putin said quote

220
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,087
You see the word mother cannot be replaced

221
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:10,975
Turns out maybe a can they replaced it in some countries with parent number one and parent number 2

222
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
I hope that never happens

223
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
1

224
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
Not even the people who encourage the use of

225
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,959
Did your terms like parent number one or two or stop saying mother and father

226
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,359
More of an effort to society recognize that not all families but the same quote on quote traditional definition

227
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:29,663
They've been considered the norm for so long

228
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,711
For instance on school forms that makes

229
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
To have parent number one and two

230
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:39,647
Since the child's parents may not be one mother and one father in terms of that formed the language does nothing to diminish one's

231
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,671
Fatherhood her mother

232
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
No it's so perfect

233
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
No but a man it sure seems like some really stupid people get up in arms if somebody with power

234
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
It's one of those things that is

235
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
It's

236
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
It's a way you can really incite somebody overnight

237
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,799
Easy stuff real

238
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:01,151
I think that Putin thinking about this is a little bit lame at least the way it's being a

239
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:06,783
Expressed but I think it's even Lamer how is this article that I read about it on rtn

240
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,367
The article was written by Neville nabo sommelier

241
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
Who's credited as a senior writer

242
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
But this last paragraph reads more like a f****** Facebook post

243
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Quote

244
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,839
Well Western quote-unquote human rights

245
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,655
Groups maybe girding their loins to condemn Putin

246
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,727
These remarks as yet another example of Oppression in Russia

247
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,799
They should hold their horses before cashing those lobbying checks

248
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,663
In the meeting he also talked about welcoming the except welcoming and accepting immigrants

249
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
Condemnation of ignorance and

250
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,527
Extremism and support for Russia's indigenous peoples

251
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,111
Who live in better conditions in in Far larger numbers than Native America

252
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
It should be sad

253
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:49,791
That would complicate The Virtue signaling morality plays the pay their bills though so we shouldn't hold our breath

254
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,375
Damn what was that was that reported

255
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
I'd like news article or was that a op-ed for the Wall Street

256
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:06,431
It's hard to tell because the article is presented kind of is

257
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
AZ news

258
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,247
Yeah about the

259
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,295
These comments that Putin said in the

260
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,367
But it also could have been more of an editorial

261
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,439
Yeah it could have been but whatever the case is

262
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
Yeah whatever the case is that tone at the end there's

263
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,655
Like what are you doing sounds like a Paul Joseph Watson

264
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,983
Scrap Salute You virtue-signaling morally

265
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,079
Stigler players unquote human-rights groups

266
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:40,735
With your lobby answer your sort of your virtue signaling

267
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:42,527
Putin bring back mother and father

268
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
Roof

269
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:47,647
So I complained about this seems to come from a place of admiring Putin

270
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Standing up to the PC

271
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:54,047
Police were completely out of control and they wish to minimize language in order to control the population

272
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
That's an absurd notion

273
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,983
Sincerely believe that that's what the poop what Putin's doing considering that the Kremlin band swearing and quote book

274
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
Books films Music Theater and popular blogs

275
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
2014

276
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,407
Which was to quote a quote from an article

277
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
The guardian

278
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,527
AAA quote attempt to cleanse the Russian language in order to insure it

279
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Purity

280
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:20,415
Just imagine for a second how Alex would feel about the US federal government Banning swearing-in the Arts

281
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,255
Are you bb-8 absurd like his is that

282
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Unhinged reaction to that

283
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:30,911
Also there's a law on the books called article 281

284
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
In Russia which makes it

285
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Prime to make statements

286
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
Denying the territorial Integrity of Russia

287
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Which is a

288
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
Pretty serious impediment to opposition Oregon

289
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
I don't understand how that could be

290
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
In 2015 to 26

291
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
16in that year 15 people were charged under this act

292
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
Eight of whom opposed the annexation of Crimea

293
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,415
You can see how the sort of law should be a pretty huge red flag

294
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
For someone like Alex says it's kind of

295
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,023
Nationalist states rights mentality

296
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
But Alex does

297
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
And yet

298
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
I've never heard this come up as an example of Russia's Crackdown on speech

299
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,727
None of this is ever it's just hate

300
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,823
You said the same sort of s*** I say about other trying to ban the word mother

301
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Yep

302
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
You can also see this weird sort of chauvinist

303
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
To there's a there's a

304
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,439
Women

305
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,207
Yeah

306
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
So

307
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
If this is a big piece

308
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,559
Shoes for Alex although he does

309
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
That didn't match his

310
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:35,167
Normal Style just touch on it and then move along

311
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:41,567
I imagine he agrees with the whole swearing thing but that's mainly because he agrees with any statement that begins with

312
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:47,967
Cleanse and ends with Purity I don't think he worries about the middle

313
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,551
Grounder the middle parts of that I do think those get his ears

314
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,743
Yeah you could say like hey the federal government does

315
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Enact

316
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Swearing laws

317
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:05,119
In terms of the FCC but of course that does

318
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Cover a whole host of

319
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Media that is covered

320
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
So that argument doesn't

321
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
The Afghanistan

322
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
That argument doesn't really attract

323
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:16,895
Aequitas

324
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Not even

325
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,247
So Alex doesn't talk about this story that much

326
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,855
Assertive a hoorah how great it is to have

327
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,623
Putin

328
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
Making these statements

329
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Bed support myself

330
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,255
Stupid yeah world leader is saying something that I would

331
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,791
So I'm going to Crow about

332
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,143
He's writing an article that sounds like my second-in-command

333
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
Editorial copy

334
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,239
Butter Alex

335
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,823
Is much more interested in talking about this New York time

336
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
So he finally whereas

337
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,687
On the 5th

338
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,295
New response was I'm not going to dignify that with a response and then freaking out on air

339
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,319
5:55

340
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,343
He's got a

341
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,415
Pretty robust in dignify it with a

342
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,095
Now he could talk about

343
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
New York Times article yesterday

344
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,495
But I secretly hunt

345
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,567
And cover-up videos of animals I've shot

346
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:22,687
Aliens that live in New York some areas most high-rises

347
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,319
Like hunting be legal

348
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
Covering

349
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:34,463
Videos of

350
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
We played some of those

351
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
Sexual

352
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,311
Strata creative strawman should bypass article

353
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
Yeah because you are unaware that they're listening

354
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,383
One of Alex

355
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
Ex-employees Road nautical

356
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,527
For the New York Times called I worked for Alex Jones I regret it

357
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,831
He discussed his time there and Alex

358
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
News

359
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,135
Presented as a really abusive

360
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
Employer

361
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,255
And one of the main takeaways that everybody had about it was

362
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,839
His discussion of a time that he was sent to cover

363
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,655
Community of Muslim Community

364
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Recalled islamberg

365
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
And I

366
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,495
In the other Northeast

367
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,615
And he didn't get the story that's at Alex would have wanted and so they manufacture

368
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
True story out of it

369
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,991
And so that that's kind of the thing that I think people take as the most

370
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Important piece

371
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:30,783
Of that

372
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:35,135
Did anybody think that they weren't making stories up or something

373
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
Well I think that you know people give a lot more credence

374
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,255
Do you like I worked there this is

375
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,023
Is my

376
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
Personal experience

377
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,327
Then

378
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,095
The very

379
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,679
Clear evidence you can get by just watching his show

380
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:52,031
Because now have someone who's like what about this

381
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
Sure

382
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,895
I thought that it ate

383
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,711
What expresses it didn't come to me until later

384
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
And that is it no matter what I might feel about that article and how like a lot of it isn't really stuff that you can act

385
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,903
You know cuz there's a lot of Pikachu

386
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,487
Is this is like well that's not true he's lying

387
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
Whatever I might feel about it there's an overarching positive to it that I don't think that we

388
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
Pointed out

389
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
There's a possibility that there are many former Infowars employees that would like to come out and talk about their experience at

390
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,151
The company but they've been too afraid to based on the nda's that Alex allegedly has

391
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
Sign

392
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:35,295
If Josh Owens has the guts to come forward and the result is that nothing bad happens to him

393
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,367
That can have the effect of emboldening others to speak out

394
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
And then the stories of what work is

395
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,695
Cuz like it Infowars could be more than

396
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Subjective

397
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
Telugu Tales

398
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,815
There could be people like yes I can back up at that did happen

399
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,143
I was there when that happened now you've got corroborating

400
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Stories

401
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
And if that's the result

402
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,495
The destruction of the illusion that Alex can

403
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
Keep people silent then I think that this could do a lot of good

404
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,895
Sure I think that's a positive that maybe we didn't pay too

405
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,431
Do on the last episode

406
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:06,015
And possibly one of the reasons why Alex would be

407
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
Pretty upset about

408
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,391
If there's a puncturing of his ability to

409
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,927
Have control over thing

410
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,719
Sure that would be very threat

411
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
As for the stuff about Alex hunting with the handgun that's in the article that's cruel and it's a betrayal of Alex's supposed

412
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,911
Responsible gun use

413
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Narratives

414
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
But it's also something that you just have to take

415
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
Crossword for

416
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
Plus if Alex is already answered that he hunted bison with

417
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,103
Inappropriate weapons

418
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
I don't think they'd care at all

419
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Which is why this is

420
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,455
Is the safe subject

421
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,503
Alex greatest Ramen of the article

422
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,343
It's just like oh yeah they just they can't handle hunting

423
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,231
So

424
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
I was going to get back to this is going to be sort of a running fee

425
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,583
Him

426
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Responding to this New York Times article while saying I'm not going to respond

427
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,703
But

428
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,751
Discusses

429
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,567
Text clip how at the end of the day on the 5th

430
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:02,591
You wasn't

431
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,455
Because of this New York Times story

432
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,039
Like it was that

433
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
He comes out

434
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
He literally just said in my first love

435
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm not going to article that I'm not going to dignify with a response

436
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:24,608
Here's my response to the hunting party

437
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
I miss you

438
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
No it's

439
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,704
Although all appearances

440
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
And assertive

441
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:34,592
Friends you can pick up from Alex's psychology would tell you that is absolutely wood

442
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,664
Alex has a big story

443
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,784
And then let me just tell lister's about sound distracted towards the end the broadcast yesterday

444
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
We're working on big

445
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Stories

446
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,280
Confirm

447
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
Man's going around

448
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Picking people up

449
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:00,192
All over the United States

450
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Sneaking around

451
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
The bushes

452
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,576
Hoopa

453
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
What bush

454
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
We got is so big

455
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
I'm going to be up here Saturday and Sunday

456
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:28,608
Shepherd with a regular Sunday show out of normal here from about 2 to 6

457
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Working on

458
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:36,544
Empty

459
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
Documents and the witnesses

460
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
When people see

461
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Both being put in the van

462
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,856
Black SUVs by men in suits

463
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,256
People just do instinctively that's scary

464
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,280
Sure

465
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:01,632
Not going to disagree people being thrown in vehicles is scary

466
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:08,032
There was one purple Buick though and that was it that was less scary somehow little bit less

467
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,896
I'm so this is a little complicated so I'm going to try my level best to lay this out for you

468
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
Alex has been pushing a narrative for a couple days now but how their people in white Vans were driving around the streets Snapchat

469
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Can people up

470
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:26,976
Now it apparently has evolved into involving black SUVs as well and it will be telling people to fear

471
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,512
All cars

472
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
There's two basic elements.

473
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:37,216
The first is a story that Alex reported from zerohedge back on December 4th with a headline quote

474
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,080
Baltimore mayor warns of body snatching white Vans targeting young girls to sell their org

475
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:46,176
In an interview with wbaltv11

476
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,968
Mayor Young said quote

477
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,320
We're getting reports of somebody in a white van trying to snatch up young girls for human traffic

478
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
A selling body

479
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
His only reference

480
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
And citation for this was post on Facebook

481
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Though he said it was quote

482
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,096
Something that are police officers are aware of because it's been reported

483
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:11,008
This was immediately refuted by the Baltimore Police Department

484
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,800
Are these random Facebook post

485
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
Door explicit that they have not received

486
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,920
Any reports of actual incident

487
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
BFDI DoubleDown

488
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,064
And said there was nothing to this but they would be willing and happy to investigate any such

489
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
Report that would be made if they're ever met

490
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,928
This is an urban legend

491
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:34,816
That's been repeated by a major cities mayor and that's given the level of credibility that it does not Merit

492
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,888
However this order thing as a self-fulfilling nature

493
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:42,496
An internet hoax an urban legend to start circulating on social media

494
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,032
Which that enters people's conscious

495
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
People exposed to this hoax or now living with a heightened suspicion of white vans

496
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
That's such

497
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,248
The Experience encounters with them differently than they would have previously

498
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
If they see a van parked in the residential

499
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:59,392
No previously it wouldn't have even registered in their mind

500
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:04,000
But now with the colonel this paranoia in there it becomes a deeply suspicious site

501
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,816
Cuz maybe there's kids walking around this residential neighborhood

502
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:10,144
That means that's why that van is there obviously

503
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
So they can have this

504
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
This heightened

505
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Suspicion

506
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:17,312
Which might prompt them to post their own story to Facebook

507
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,128
To add to the urban legend or even call the police

508
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,712
Thereby leaving the paper trail that seemingly justifies the urban legend

509
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
With official documentation

510
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
Phenomenon happens

511
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
More than

512
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
You'd like

513
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Cuz people are sick

514
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
What was the scene that movie

515
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:35,232
Urban legend

516
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:40,096
Where everybody gets everybody gets murdered by a separate urban legend

517
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,680
And there's like a guy and they're all doing it to make urban legend

518
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,960
True terrible book

519
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,008
I feel like I probably saw that but

520
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,032
It came out

521
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,080
I was pretty much

522
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:53,920
The only one I remember is that apparently if you are passing a car

523
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,528
Lights off right flashlights at it

524
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:04,928
Kill yeah I remember that from like just being younger

525
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Are all white vans

526
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,792
True

527
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:17,216
But this is more or less the process that took place on Facebook regarding white Vans particularly in Baltimore through November twenty

528
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
That's started to ask

529
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Escalade quite a bit

530
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
And now here we are

531
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:26,176
Oxygen reported that on the possibility that this has already led to one murder

532
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
In Memphis Tennessee

533
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
Where man named Anna's REO Garcia

534
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:33,088
Who drives a white work van was killed by the two sons

535
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:38,208
The woman who had hours earlier posted on Facebook about a guy in a white van trying to abduct her

536
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:40,256
It's unclear if there was a

537
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,864
An attempted abduction underlying this but police have been clear that there's no evidence

538
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
That Garcia had interacted with this woman

539
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,448
Do that

540
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,984
The earlier in the day or anything

541
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:54,848
It's unclear if this was all related but it seems like a distinct possibility

542
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,664
And if this white van paranoia is at the root of this killing

543
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,456
It really highlights the danger that

544
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,504
These sorts of mass paranoias carry with them

545
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:06,880
If you create enough of a fever pitch of people thinking the folks driving around and white Vans or sex traffic

546
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Kidnappers

547
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:08,928
It's

548
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,512
Not unlikely that a certain number of innocent people who drive white vans

549
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,536
Could get hurt

550
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
France 24 reported back in

551
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,424
Can March of an outbreak of white van abduction related to

552
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,496
Asteria which resulted in what they described as quoted

553
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,520
Kawneer lynching

554
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,872
Urban legends recirculating on Snapchat WhatsApp and Facebook

555
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,688
All surrounding the idea that white Vans were going around

556
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,320
There is no truth to these rumors but that didn't stop gangs of Vigilantes from attacking

557
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,880
Camps of Roma people in Northeast Paris

558
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:41,184
Setting their vans on fire and terrorizing

559
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,024
These sorts of mass hysteria is a profoundly dangerous

560
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:49,888
And when they express themselves people seem to have a troubling tendency to director aggression

561
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,936
Towards vulnerable and alienated classes

562
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,704
Does a people

563
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,496
In France it was the Roma

564
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:57,824
In our satanic Panic of the 80s was largely the lgbtq

565
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Community

566
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,896
It remains to be seen how far this

567
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:04,992
Current American white van paranoia Alex is trying to stoke is going to go

568
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
And who will be hurt

569
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,808
But it is clear that if it does

570
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,576
Progressed

571
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,600
Someone will get hurt

572
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,648
It's not going to go well

573
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
It's a it's really

574
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,720
Disconcerting

575
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,256
How easily a

576
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Meme fear

577
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:19,584
Just

578
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Grip everyone and get people

579
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
Sure it should be harder right

580
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,800
Oops if you just get a Facebook postings like white Vans are stealing people you should be able to go like

581
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,200
Turn on the f****** news as well when there is a tantrum

582
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,248
Now that's kind of

583
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,064
That's upsetting that's not good

584
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,880
It's pretty disappointing to have

585
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,488
What would be the equivalent of like Grandma for your emails

586
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
Being repeated by the

587
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,304
Mayor of Baltimore

588
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
So the other thing Alex is working in here to build this narrative

589
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,424
Is that recent release

590
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
The FBI documents

591
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
About the finder

592
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
The suspicious group from the 80s or as I call it

593
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,312
These satanic

594
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,848
We thought had ended

595
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:09,248
This situation is a big kettle of fish and it might be something I'll get into it a later date but for now

596
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Suffice it say Alex

597
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Does not read those FBI documents

598
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:15,648
He just knows that the story involves two suspicious men who drove of

599
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,488
I don't believe Alex was creeping around in the bushes Last Night Train

600
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Navigate to Van snatchers and honestly if I had to guess

601
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,864
He's just seeing all the hoax Facebook post

602
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,656
News reporting of his hard news

603
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,448
Abby far from the first time he's ever

604
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,520
So he's got this big narrative

605
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,568
It's all like this white van

606
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,384
The hysteria is is coming in its

607
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
It's rising in the Infowars Arena

608
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
Okay are you saying to me that

609
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
He his big news

610
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,600
Is that he stayed out

611
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,368
At 10

612
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
When you know

613
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
The world is

614
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,720
So quiet not

615
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:51,744
Nothing

616
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,816
That's when the white van hiding in the bushes

617
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,424
Videotaping to see if there's any White Band anywhere near

618
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,240
See if complicated because that is the way that he's

619
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,008
Presenting

620
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
But I know from

621
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,384
Knowing where this goes that it also involves a secondary narrative that has

622
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,408
Has nothing to do with it

623
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,432
Video combiner

624
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,760
He loses interest in the white van part of it

625
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,856
More into another side of it as things go along

626
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,440
But we'll get to that it's really hard to sneak around the bush

627
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,464
Whenever you parked

628
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,816
Louder little bit obvious Where You Are

629
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
So he's

630
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Still on

631
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
Vivere narrative

632
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:30,912
Here but this is

633
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
Kind of where

634
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Aleve

635
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,824
The river is there taking organs

636
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
Which organ

637
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:47,552
And we know some people have been kidnapped and organs have been taken I've got all the documents all the article to call the crime statistics that's in our room

638
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,112
Everything's okay

639
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,464
But this is even more diabolical than that

640
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,888
This one story of his somebody broke this one story

641
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,168
In their lifetime

642
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,408
Because it's so incredible

643
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
So this is the sort of

644
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
Self-fulfilling prophecy

645
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:23,392
No one cares about whatever bulshit I'm coming up with

646
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,952
So big not because it's misrepresenting

647
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:26,976
Mission of everything

648
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,256
It's the stuff of Legend

649
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Mainly because

650
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
It's not true

651
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,096
This is a career case

652
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,240
This is where you put this where you make a name for yourself in the movie

653
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Totally

654
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:43,360
They say this is me finding carcosa

655
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:46,432
Whatever Alex Finding Nemo

656
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
It's

657
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,808
You hear them say they're that this is

658
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
Is bigger than

659
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Yeah we're here

660
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
The bigger part

661
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,976
Will take up a bit more later in the episode

662
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,768
But he gets distracted

663
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,536
Because

664
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:03,840
This guy named Donald tusk

665
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
Who used to be the head of the European

666
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Teen Council

667
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:09,216
Tweeted a picture of himself putting like a finger gun

668
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,312
Up to Trump's back and this is really angered Alex

669
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
And guess what even though

670
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Dave prior

671
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,992
Alex said that Trump has committed treason yeah maybe working for Satan

672
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,600
Which are both things that you would assume the punishment for

673
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
Wow

674
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,904
I mean you know

675
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,928
Whatever

676
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,000
Turns out that this guy tweeted out a picture

677
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
And now Alex's

678
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,304
Pulley back on board with Trump

679
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,608
100%

680
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
This is the Big E U

681
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
Party head

682
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,544
Is Merkel

683
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,848
Simulating shooting trap in the back

684
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,920
He had his assistant put the photo out he had minutes

685
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
Removed

686
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
He's openly calling for people to kill

687
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
Caesar

688
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
Caesar's dad

689
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,952
Any says Trump is just to season he's going to be gone very soon

690
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,560
And when I see stuff like that

691
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,936
Really shows you how real Trump is he's a real president he's really trying to the best job

692
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
My heart

693
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,552
And that's my gut

694
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
And I'm just back in truck

695
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Really bust their rash and that means well and

696
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,168
Or smart

697
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,848
With all this

698
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,664
Plus job

699
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
You know what what

700
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Station

701
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,392
We should thank God

702
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,184
And

703
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
What to try

704
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:16,448
I mean this is just such a clear-cut thing I'll get it it's so in line with Alex's

705
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,728
Psychology like

706
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
He defines himself so much as like

707
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,336
Like almost just a reactive Force

708
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
Blankets

709
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
He needs

710
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,688
The appearance of fighting against

711
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
Something or something fighting against

712
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Him to validate

713
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:31,296
Justify anything

714
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
So you've got this guy whose former head of European Council

715
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
And he puts

716
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
This picture out and it's like

717
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
Aha proof

718
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:42,048
The Trump is the enemy of the globalist therefore

719
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,840
I have to support him 100%

720
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,376
You'll meet yeah it is

721
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
It's absurd

722
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544
It's fascinating to me how lame it

723
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,944
Okay so let's say Bernie Sanders become president and there's an overwhelming Democrat

724
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Majority in the

725
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
Congress and we packed the courts and we do everything that the liberal dream would always want to be in the global trade and the globalist

726
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
But if you left me out

727
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
To dry

728
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
I will give him a Beat

729
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:18,400
Like I'm taking it down at least a little bit sure he's accomplished every liberal goal that I've always wanted but he's left me personally out to

730
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,960
Right right right right but you're not taking

731
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,800
Into account is Alex's version of leaving me out to dry

732
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,360
Part and part and parcel of it is

733
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,224
Did Trump is selling us out to China which is the end of all civilization

734
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
It's not just like he has

735
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Uno

736
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
Not been cool with

737
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,184
Or whatever it's not like he's not returning my calls its

738
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,536
Leaving us high and dry is the end of civilization as we know it

739
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,096
So that I would give him a seat

740
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,680
It's not a minor thing it's kind of the whole thing

741
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
You know you say that

742
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
But just because there's the Optics

743
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,056
Send the appearance of

744
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
The opposition with Alex's imagined enemies

745
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
And prompt like there's tension between them

746
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
He has everything he needs to his back f*** it

747
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
Whole Hog

748
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,296
100% I'm on board

749
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
Should take longer

750
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,416
You should take more very simple

751
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Nope.

752
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
God dammit

753
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
Alex

754
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,304
Donald Tusk guy

755
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
But that finger gone right up his ass

756
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,912
Some of that gun to my face

757
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,984
Cuz I'm going to take it out of your hands and shove it up your damn

758
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
Excuse me delay that for family to yours

759
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
This is a Bentley

760
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:35,712
How about you stick that breaks your jaw you little rat

761
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,088
I bet he doesn't

762
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,328
Tamal

763
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,120
Bring it home

764
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,912
He's the man in the arena

765
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,568
Is all the only justification for supporting Trump that lingers

766
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,384
Outside of like a really like

767
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,664
Signaling

768
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,200
Xenophobia

769
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,504
The all that s*** outside of that

770
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,552
Want to make that two over

771
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,344
All it is is Defiance

772
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,368
Like it's just

773
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
8-bit just adjusted

774
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,672
Location through defiance

775
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
Advair

776
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Very low

777
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Level

778
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,792
Kind of reason to surprise somebody

779
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
It's kind of sad

780
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,144
I mean it is one of the it is a major part of it

781
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,168
Though is that

782
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,568
A large number of his supporters are happy with a crumbling country just so long

783
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
Long is somebody finally

784
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
Tell everybody to shut

785
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
Shut the fuk up

786
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
Don't like

787
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:41,248
That goes a long way for a lot of people

788
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,576
There's a cathartic versus to it

789
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,368
But it's also again

790
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,696
Very low-level level rationalization

791
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:51,232
But that's where we are

792
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
But just like their products

793
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,536
70cc we love

794
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:54,816
It's getting lower

795
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:57,120
So if you need to

796
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,192
Be spelled out for you Alex's supporting Trump 100%

797
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
And he will piss on you

798
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
If you think he's wrong for

799
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,848
Clearly clearly

800
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Because he's really the president

801
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
A hundred percent

802
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Today

803
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:20,416
Criticize

804
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
Atone for yourself they're all into this

805
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:28,608
Fake moral justification out there the moral Authority

806
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
Absolution

807
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
To be lectured to by the left

808
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
About about

809
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Trump support

810
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,504
Proud

811
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:49,344
I'm glad I got something off I'm proud of being persecuted

812
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
No.

813
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:57,536
Mythology is like I'm being targeted

814
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,072
Because I'm right is like

815
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,352
It's such a dangerous

816
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,680
It could be because you're very wrong

817
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
Sure

818
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,288
Absolutely you could you could save it

819
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,872
Evil bad guys are targeting you cuz you're too close to the truth

820
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:17,760
But it's equally likely that just people are saying hey you're being a piece of s***

821
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Totally possible

822
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
It's that same thing as that like

823
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,392
That Gandhi quote people Trot out

824
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
Like the first people make fun of you that your

825
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
The revolution is like

826
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,328
They mock you and then eventually you're right

827
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,264
Is the progressive this always goes down

828
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,312
Really terrifying if everybody

829
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
People we ever mock

830
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,872
Eventually took over

831
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,664
Yeah that would probably not work

832
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
I mean eventually sided with adjust towards like

833
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:53,600
My instinct is to block this person but I know that everything will go right especially

834
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,904
So I don't know

835
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,024
Anyway now we get to wear this white van narrative

836
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:04,352
Involves the offshoot of it the other p

837
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,376
Piece of it comes at the

838
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,960
Play it involves people experiencing homelessness

839
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
In Austin

840
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,800
We've already heard back in October Alex

841
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
The beginning

842
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
The narratives about microchipping

843
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
And

844
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,760
Yeah he he goes pretty deep into this

845
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,576
On this episode and it leads to one of the like

846
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
Most exciting thing

847
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
I think I've ever heard

848
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
On Alex's show

849
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
But also just

850
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
A lot of bulshit

851
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:34,048
Use the UN invasion

852
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:35,328
Can you find out

853
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
They set it up in Austin

854
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,616
Cover for it is the giant homeless problem

855
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,944
When the mayor said here in San Francisco here in LA

856
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
If you're in Portland

857
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,552
If you're in Kansas City of here in New York if you're anywhere

858
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
Free stuff

859
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
Old

860
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Hotels big one

861
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,256
Refurbishing for you and you get free money free everything

862
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:07,328
And we're building warehouses with your own Apartments come here

863
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
How much

864
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
Triple

865
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
They're every

866
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
We look like La just like that

867
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,640
So I don't care about Alex's dumb xenophobic b******* about refugees and immigrants

868
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:26,784
Is discredited himself 100 times over on that front so I get can't even find the energy to respond to his attempts

869
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
Humanitarian

870
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Doesn't look like devilry

871
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,624
The story he's telling

872
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,024
Is the evolution of a larger narrative that we talked about a while back where he's been yelling about how they're putting microchips in people

873
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Experiencing home

874
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:44,448
We already discussed the reasoning for this and the reality of that proposal so be a waste to go over all that all over again

875
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,032
I mostly pulled up his clothes because Alex is just making things up

876
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,663
CBS Austin ran a story and March which covered the stats put out by a number of homelessness advocate

877
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:56,223
Cgroups and in the past year there was a 5-4

878
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,295
Reason homelessness triple not a tripling

879
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,111
It's entirely possible that the number has risen since

880
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:06,719
That point but we don't know that we won't until the beginning of January twenty

881
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:10,303
20 with the advocacy groups do their annual information

882
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:16,191
Put simply Alex's just making up the idea that the number of people experiencing homelessness has tripled in off

883
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
There's literally no way for him to backup

884
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:23,359
It called on it he would probably just appeal to ideas of seeing more people on the street

885
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,919
And meaningless subjective things like that

886
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,759
He's not making this number up to better serve these people who are in need

887
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,783
He's doing it

888
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
It's 2

889
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
Make them

890
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,343
Threat

891
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,391
If if the homeless population

892
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
That would be Fox news's

893
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
Is only Story 2

894
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:41,535
Track from the impeached

895
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
Be all day every

896
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,935
Right and it would be something that people would be talk

897
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
Think about you vanilla sauce made

898
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,799
Yeah it would be a big big

899
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,615
So the issue here is what Alex

900
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Is putting forth

901
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,407
Is the

902
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
Un is set up these

903
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:03,039
PG centers and stuff along through Central and South America

904
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:08,159
And they're trying to build them in Austin as well under the cover of a homeless

905
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,207
Shelter

906
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,535
Is anything else microchipping them for some reason

907
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,071
So this is Ghana

908
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,655
Double devil going to evolve over the course of this

909
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
And like I said there is just a real big

910
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
Like amazing

911
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
Moment

912
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,847
Hey this is a crescendo of this

913
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,895
Lego builds and it builds

914
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:34,527
Okay I'm turning the homeless into cyborg cyborg Warriors

915
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
You're thinking way too small

916
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,743
This is the crescendo is not a narrative crescendo

917
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,815
To a declaration

918
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:51,423
That I couldn't predict possibly and I found to be

919
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:55,007
Startling okay and completely non-believer

920
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:58,335
Okay we'll get to that as as it as a belt but

921
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,663
And the sex club Alex lays out what the plan is moving

922
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Going forward

923
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,479
And it has to do with like 10

924
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Taking out Trump

925
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
And then the ball gets rolling

926
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,927
Bill Ayers and all them it comes out in court that a plan to put 15 and re-education camps

927
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,463
Kill 25 million

928
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,023
Excitement

929
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Court

930
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,703
Connors Steakhouse

931
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,007
Kill Trump

932
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,615
False Flags blame right-wingers they say we're terrorists

933
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
About to the leadership

934
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
Thousands first

935
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:38,527
You don't respond then they start arresting hundreds of South

936
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,855
Take your property

937
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:45,695
Your Republican donor your NRA member young a car dealership

938
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
Nubian the second

939
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:57,215
Where

940
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,311
Complaining won't turn your bank account

941
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,223
Roundup need to buy a new car

942
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Deserve to be arrested

943
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
He fought back for the other day

944
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:19,743
And they're testing and they're doing it and Searles are spending billions on this right now

945
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,887
We've confirmed they got Parabellum

946
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,727
Rouses ready they got the food ready

947
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
The first wave of a collapse

948
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:38,943
Stabilize the economy cuz they were

949
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,023
This feels so familiar

950
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:54,303
Like this is the same

951
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,887
The Galaxy's now weaving back to a lot of the old

952
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Same narratives from like 2009 forward like Oprah FEMA camps

953
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,847
But it has a new mascot

954
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
Like it hasn't new layer

955
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,175
In the sense that like

956
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:16,831
Back then there was the summer of Rage coming and they were going to crash the economy and that was going to lead to people going into

957
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,855
FEMA camps in

958
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,719
But now Alex is far more obsessed with false flag

959
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Certainly

960
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:24,767
Like you

961
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
He was

962
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,119
To an extent back in 2009 feel like after the boss

963
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
Embalming and

964
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,983
After Sandy Hook pretty wild I surely haven't

965
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
Everything

966
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,567
Everything

967
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Becomes a big piece

968
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,663
The Narrative and now Trump is also like

969
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Secondary aspect

970
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Of the nerd

971
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,295
Like what existed before was

972
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Like

973
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,343
I don't

974
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
There's some reason

975
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,279
And why they haven't done this yet there's some reason the plans aren't in place

976
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,863
Already whatever and now Trump is filling that role

977
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,471
Trump is like cheerleading and riding the economy afloat because he knows that the

978
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:08,543
The first Domino that falls in their plan

979
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,335
He's just repurposed

980
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:15,967
Their plans aren't ready Trump is stopping them he's the bulwark against their plans being implemented

981
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:21,343
What is our only like form of the the

982
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,367
The same

983
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:24,159
Conspiracy That Never Was

984
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,207
The eventual

985
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
Forced collapse

986
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,023
Leading to

987
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,559
Alex and his buddies

988
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
He's being taken to a fever

989
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
FEMA camp

990
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,655
Cares

991
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:37,215
I made it who cares if it was real I would be against

992
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
But like

993
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,543
Maybe they're even coming after

994
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
Car dealerships that is weird they're coming after our car dealership

995
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,807
Hamburg Republican don't realize that

996
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,599
Car dealer was such a like

997
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,975
Synonym of right-winger I realize that offer 0% financing for

998
00:47:59,231 --> 00:47:59,743
For five years

999
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,791
Doesn't even matter if it's at a car dealership

1000
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,327
I mean I guess that's

1001
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:07,423
Maybe that's true baby that's a stereotype but I was I was unaware

1002
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,215
They car dealers are all Republicans

1003
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:14,591
Third on the list third on the list yeah Republican donor

1004
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
Scott Wayne LaPierre

1005
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,455
And we got Danny's Discount Auto

1006
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,527
So Alex gets into talking about being in the bush

1007
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,551
I think

1008
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
It's unclear

1009
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:26,367
Alex has been speaking very own

1010
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,647
Precisely

1011
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,207
Play here but I think he's talking about when they went out to go

1012
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Get footage

1013
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:31,743
I've stopped

1014
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,047
And he sees immigrants being bussed

1015
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
Somewhere

1016
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,863
It's unclear I don't think any of this happen

1017
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,703
Then some people Alex's decided or gay start insulting

1018
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
I'm in various m

1019
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,495
That way

1020
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,823
Hi I don't I'm not okay with that sentence

1021
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,919
I don't think any of this is real but here is Alex.

1022
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,223
Across the street

1023
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:57,343
Hundreds of people have to put on buses

1024
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
America

1025
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
Play psychotic

1026
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,871
Microchips

1027
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,175
Hotels in Austin

1028
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
We've been there

1029
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,831
Government you screwed up he didn't stop at we got in all facilities

1030
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,183
Hahaha

1031
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:36,255
Hey Brother

1032
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,887
Is the beginning of what really excites me

1033
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,935
It's all coming out next week

1034
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:47,775
I like there is going to be

1035
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
No this is not happening I'll be pumped and I swear to God if this is the Obama Phone Lady in a hotel

1036
00:49:54,687 --> 00:50:00,831
I'm leaving I legitimately have no idea what Alex is talking about but if I know anything for my years of listening to him what he says he is

1037
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,927
Is a big scoop coming next week it means that scoop is not real and it's never come

1038
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:09,023
The only other possibility is that something doesn't upcoming would it

1039
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Huge letdown in nowhere near what Alex

1040
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
What is claim it is

1041
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,143
And honestly I don't know what the big can

1042
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
Beersy is he

1043
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,775
KVUE the local Austin news channel reported back on November 4th

1044
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:26,175
About the city council granted unanimous approval for the city to repurpose an old hotel to be converted into a homeless shelter

1045
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Yes

1046
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,271
It's not a secret it's been publicly debated as a

1047
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,807
Plans vary out in the open

1048
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
If I had to guess

1049
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,671
Someone who works at Infowars read the story about

1050
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,743
And realize that the name of the hotel they're planning to you

1051
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:40,511
It was public

1052
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,839
Okay bue article clearly says that if the Rodeway Inn

1053
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
It even gives the location of it

1054
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:52,031
It's the easiest thing in the world for Alex to send someone down there at night to get footage of the building in disrepair

1055
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Because it's an unused Hotel

1056
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,175
Airport with the city council is voting on was appropriation of funds to renovate the hotel

1057
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:00,991
I predict Alex my down there and got some shots

1058
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
The place looking like a disaster area

1059
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:07,903
I don't really see what the other play is here because the story is a zero based on everything I do

1060
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,231
Until the one area for manipulating objects

1061
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:15,583
Is gaining footage of the pre-renovation building and pretending that it's

1062
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,863
The condition it'll be in Watts

1063
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
It's up and running

1064
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
But we'll see

1065
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,495
It's also entirely possible that nothing ever materializes

1066
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,799
Cheaper than sending somebody to islamberg

1067
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:25,823
That's true

1068
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,711
It's possible nothing materializes in this is yet another instance of Alex bring up something he has in his possession that worked

1069
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
Definitely sink

1070
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,247
Enemies

1071
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,831
That them seriously has forgotten about within a few days

1072
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
Time to play it

1073
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:41,951
Then there's just too much noise too much news than this

1074
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,743
Has shades of that time

1075
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:50,143
Jerome corsi had a dead man switch for some bombshell Seth Rich info it was going to get him killed the definitely never

1076
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:56,031
No that was real that was 100% real it's just waiting there for somebody to kill Jerome corsi

1077
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:02,943
If I recall correctly the day drunk or is he was supposed to reveal that information Alex didn't even show up for his show

1078
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:06,527
First half-hour with special report and then Rodger Stone interviewed

1079
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:09,343
A Musician's Friend

1080
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:15,743
That is sad that is that is called a real good.

1081
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
So Alex says this narrative

1082
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
I guess there's

1083
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,679
Immigrants refugees that are being bussed places

1084
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,263
Disguised as homeless people or something

1085
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Microchipping

1086
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
Putting in hotels

1087
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,103
Very

1088
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,407
I don't know I don't know

1089
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
Breakfast Point what the f***

1090
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
He's talking about

1091
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:40,319
No I don't know what the conspiracy is I don't know how this fits in with his

1092
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,087
Collapse

1093
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,927
Plan that Trump is stopping by keeping the economy afloat

1094
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
I don't understand

1095
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
They're going to

1096
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,815
Teach all of the homeless people how to drive

1097
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
Specifically white Vans or black ass

1098
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:55,423
Those are the only things that they can do

1099
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,983
I could be part of like a job training program

1100
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,031
You know like a lot of white Vans or work van

1101
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,335
Yeah I have the Cure people carry their tool

1102
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
Dodge

1103
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
Until

1104
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,663
You know if part of

1105
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
You know

1106
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
Getting back into life

1107
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:12,575
Can you get my baby you're getting trained in carpentry you might drive away

1108
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:16,159
Somebody make sure that Austin doesn't allow people to drive white vans

1109
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:19,743
You know what I've got I've got the solution

1110
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,655
Everybody puts a Yes album cover decal on their white van not a bad idea

1111
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,471
Never but everybody knew that unicorns on the side of vans

1112
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:33,567
One day one day that runs into money

1113
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,407
That's fair to talkin about how evil the government is

1114
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,175
Is as is his

1115
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,247
But he realizes that like

1116
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
Ash

1117
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,551
I'm talking too loud

1118
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,831
Bad stuff about like

1119
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
People who might

1120
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:52,767
Be inclined to like me I'm supposed to be a guy who the military likes supposed to be a guy who liked the people

1121
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,583
On the ground like the suits snow

1122
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,143
And so he has to correct himself really

1123
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,239
PeopleSoft

1124
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,511
That's a that's why I called plugging on a dime that was a that was that him

1125
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
Yeah yeah yeah

1126
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,399
That was that was like a white van coming to a stop

1127
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,447
Joe Alex

1128
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:38,335
He's laughing about like haha we got it and we got all the footage yeah hog you're all done

1129
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,871
He said next week

1130
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
House like s***

1131
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:43,455
I don't maybe it's

1132
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,247
I want to cover this if

1133
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,831
He's teasing and I wanted to know when it's going to be out and luckily

1134
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
He gives a specific

1135
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,463
Open borders the Caravans

1136
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:59,071
Simon in the news but we've confirmed it that all the documents I mean it's just crazy

1137
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,375
Call next Tuesday

1138
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,167
Next Tuesday

1139
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,311
All the stuff is just amazing

1140
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,343
So this is why we are going to December 10th because that's Tuesday

1141
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,743
Sweet dreams it Tuesday when we are recording this is yesterday so we know for sure what this is

1142
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
Is going to be very excited

1143
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:36,959
I had this situation on my hands where I was like all right I want to check in so you could I figured eventually

1144
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,287
We'd have to talk about the New York Times article in specific

1145
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,687
It's was like okay I feel like that's at least something that we should cover I think it's response to it might be kind of interesting

1146
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,503
Until I got into that he reveals

1147
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,063
I'm going to drop this on next

1148
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Tuesday

1149
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,135
I'd like I got a I got to get on my horse

1150
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:58,719
And ride I've got to I can't allow him to

1151
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Tootie's that

1152
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:03,071
Absolutely not

1153
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,607
I can tell you

1154
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
That I do know what happens

1155
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
News on Tuesday

1156
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:12,799
And I do know what Alex says is going to happen on Tuesday cuz he gets even more explicit later

1157
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
Hibbets

1158
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,639
East 141

1159
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,455
If there is an Alex that I enjoy

1160
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,479
This is

1161
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:22,015
This is pretty close to

1162
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
Hubris

1163
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,135
Certainly tried coming before the fall

1164
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,463
Silence announces big news is coming on Tuesday there's a lot to die

1165
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
So he's not going to

1166
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
I get to it now

1167
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,559
CAP Talk

1168
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,863
About the Vegas shooting

1169
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:38,399
No

1170
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,167
He doesn't

1171
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
This is really interesting because Alex

1172
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
Has had a lot of ideas

1173
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
About the Vegas shooting

1174
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,103
Mandalay Bay shooting

1175
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
SOS tpp's

1176
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,479
Well Steve said it didn't happen at all right

1177
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:56,063
Weather

1178
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:57,599
Bulshit

1179
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:04,255
Alex has a lot of other ideas he said that it was a Saudi Arabian Civil War or something

1180
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:06,303
Do Saudi Arabian

1181
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,071
Attacking

1182
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:09,887
So we know that he has that in his Arsenal

1183
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
Narrative

1184
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,215
You can't even more explicit

1185
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,263
In this clip and like

1186
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:16,799
I find this to be upsetting

1187
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,431
Tell you what happened and I just said don't ask questions

1188
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,319
People getting shot inside Hotel 2 miles away and they showed shot out windows

1189
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,647
People sitting on the ground here and there were

1190
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,999
Attacks all over the town

1191
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,095
Saudi Arabia

1192
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
Bath Royal housing

1193
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
The Saudi Arabian Arabic

1194
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,223
The top

1195
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,951
Yeah that all came out right

1196
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:08,767
No

1197
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
You know what that uses torture centers

1198
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,167
Fancy hotel Aruba Tuesday

1199
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:20,799
Put the homeless and former hotels in Austin really

1200
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:31,551
Did they collapsed GOG

1201
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,599
Civil unrest that comes out

1202
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,647
Bring Anna permanent

1203
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,695
Martial law

1204
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:39,999
Everyday

1205
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,279
I probably do

1206
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
Don't cover

1207
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:48,447
10 articles I would say that a much higher

1208
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,519
I guarantee he doesn't cover waiver

1209
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:52,799
Definitely

1210
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:59,199
DC that like a week hinge thereof like a hotel hotel everything's related

1211
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:02,783
Harvey Oswald driving a car who else drove a car

1212
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:07,135
JFK we always knew it was going to happen they're the same person

1213
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,951
The Las Vegas shooting was not a series of terrorist

1214
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
Although a lot of really sloppy conspiracy theorist has made a bunch of very flimsy and ultimately debunked claims about the shooting

1215
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,399
Attempting to make that very argument

1216
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:25,311
Alex is that a lot of these people on to disseminate their bulshit people like Shepherd ampless who contends that there were helicopters

1217
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,359
Shooting on the crowd that music festival

1218
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
And it's

1219
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:30,687
Review that

1220
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
And I'll find it lacking

1221
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
Can't believe

1222
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Beds

1223
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
Josh Owens was

1224
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:38,623
Was telling the truth when he said they made up story

1225
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:44,255
I just ate some amazing I've looked into a lot of the stuff and a fair amount of it is just completely unfounded

1226
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:46,047
Another chunk of it is

1227
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:49,887
Based on pretty easily explained quirks of science like how acoustic

1228
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:56,287
It's working can make it appear there multiple sources of gunfire when in reality you just hear different sounding shots it's the results

1229
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Some echoes

1230
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,407
Another segment is people misunderstanding or misrepresenting erroneous immediately

1231
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,943
Reports are police scanners

1232
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:07,295
And the rest of it is just the lingering Remnant from people creating outright hoaxes

1233
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,343
Intentionally in the aftermath of a tragedy

1234
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:13,439
But Alex never really looked into and it sent incorporated into his view of what was

1235
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Is real

1236
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
I know I've heard Alex say that there was a Saudi Arabian

1237
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,559
Element to the attack

1238
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:23,167
Before but the part about Trump involved invading Saudi Arabia as a response is

1239
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
Kind of new

1240
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:28,287
It said any principles this imaginary action should absolutely make it in

1241
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,055
Possible for a

1242
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
Support Trump

1243
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,127
If what Alex is saying was true

1244
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
Then Trump would have

1245
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Clandestinely

1246
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:39,039
And without the approval of Congress carried out a violent action against a sovereign foreign power

1247
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
With a goal of regime change

1248
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
I don't understand what your problem is

1249
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:45,183
This is something Trump would have to have been doing secretly with Alex

1250
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,975
I should be against seeing as this would be Akin

1251
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:50,303
Receive that has enormous geopolitical ramifications

1252
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,607
And we can see the results that have come from

1253
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,727
From the gigantic weapons sales to the turning a blind eye to the murder of Jamal khashoggi

1254
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,799
YouTube Trump veto on the resolution that would have ended our support

1255
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,103
A Saudi Arabia's actions in Yemen

1256
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,943
Alex always says you could judge a tree by its fruit and if that's the fruit

1257
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,783
Trump's imaginary coup in Saudi Arabia that tree is not good

1258
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
What he did

1259
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,855
Was he invaded Saudi Arabia

1260
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:20,255
Performed a coup of their government and then gave the previous government everything that it ever wanted

1261
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:25,119
That makes perfect sense merrily executed people on behalf of us

1262
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,191
Soap for real that's all nonsense I don't really care.

1263
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
Take all that stuff

1264
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,775
However this one important feature that I think the

1265
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
Escape highlights

1266
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,847
Really well and that Alex Jones seems

1267
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,943
To be way less interested in sniffing out conspiracies and yelling about them

1268
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,991
If he feels like he's a part of the

1269
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:47,903
He gets to act like he's in the know about this secret Trump invasion of Saudi Arabia he's not concerned really about how

1270
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,951
How that action recounted a literally everything

1271
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
He stands for

1272
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
He's on the team

1273
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,791
So it's okay

1274
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,839
That's bad

1275
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,631
That's probably not good

1276
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
Indicates

1277
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
To me it sent

1278
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Is it like

1279
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
He doesn't really care

1280
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
No I don't think

1281
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,567
So Alex

1282
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,615
Soon as I get back to the New York Times article

1283
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
And

1284
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:10,943
He feels like he's probably address

1285
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,223
The fact that

1286
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:12,991
You know

1287
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:15,295
There's accusations that he made up news

1288
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,831
About the Muslim Community

1289
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,695
Now he's addressing this immediately after making up news about Muslim

1290
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:26,303
I don't know if it's immediately after but yeah it's after that

1291
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:30,143
Within that space

1292
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,215
Great

1293
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,799
New York Times that affect new story understanding almost all it was complete

1294
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,383
Afros

1295
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,175
Michelle Dockery

1296
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,455
Dignified

1297
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,759
You're talking about it now

1298
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:49,343
Demanded stories be made up about Muslims

1299
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,903
You understand

1300
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,791
Articles

1301
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,375
Allah Akbar I don't need

1302
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
It doesn't

1303
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
Great

1304
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,311
Totally believable denial there

1305
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,359
Manufacture

1306
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,967
That's not good

1307
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
But it gets worse

1308
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
Because Alex

1309
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:23,391
Now has a conspiracy theory about this article in the New York Times

1310
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,415
That's what I was looking

1311
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:27,487
And here it goes okay

1312
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:34,655
Don't secretly slaughtered animals that wanted it kept see

1313
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,447
300

1314
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,263
What

1315
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,431
Crazy lady

1316
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
What

1317
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,759
Hold on

1318
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,647
To write for the New York Times

1319
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,999
People go out on a hunt

1320
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,303
Trailer

1321
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:12,287
Alex's got more specific about this conspiracy theory but he apparently believes that some older woman named Elizabeth

1322
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:17,151
Wrote the piece in the New York Times and then put his former employee Josh Owens name on it

1323
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:17,919
Which is why

1324
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
How does he know

1325
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:24,319
A very small but incredibly specific

1326
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
Set of details about Elizabeth way

1327
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,183
About

1328
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:29,951
It's not a number real

1329
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:35,839
Part of this is probably his way of getting out of having to publicly show that he has no control over his past employees

1330
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
If you tribute this article to this other person then it's not Joshua and seeing these things and therefore he hasn't broken his

1331
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,263
Is NDA

1332
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,847
So there's nothing Alex can really do about the globalist attacking him

1333
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:51,967
Another element is it Alex probably feels hurt by his former employer betraying him

1334
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:55,551
The dude worked at Infowars for 4 years he got it thank you

1335
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,319
Do you know the guy

1336
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,623
Alex wouldn't want to show that kind of weakness

1337
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
When it comes to be

1338
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:03,999
The Optics of it being too mad about it

1339
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,023
Call Vicky

1340
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
Really wants

1341
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Show that

1342
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:10,655
So Alex thinks that Elizabeth Williamson wrote the story

1343
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:12,703
She's a writer for the New York Times

1344
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:16,287
And she's written many stories about Alex in the past is probably pretty

1345
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:17,055
Fixated on her

1346
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:20,127
Williams didn't write that story Joshua instead

1347
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
But that reality is

1348
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,455
Pretty hard to accept so this is the way Alex

1349
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,735
Deciding to play it with

1350
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
Got a bump

1351
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,527
Meowth

1352
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
One of the ways Alex is using this

1353
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,111
Completely made up narrative

1354
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,695
Williamson wrote the article is to say that you some kind of knew

1355
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:38,303
New York high-rise living Elite who's never been to the real America where people hunt

1356
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:45,471
Leaving aside that you was born in Chicago went to Marquette which is in Milwaukee and doesn't live in New York

1357
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:49,311
This is just stupid pandering to some kind of folksy notion of Americana

1358
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,127
You can't take with this Elite New Yorker who may as well be

1359
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
The Real Americans like I seriously

1360
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
That's basically the mess

1361
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,271
Socialpoint

1362
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,855
Like honestly how many Alex Jones listeners do you think actually read the

1363
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:03,647
Like what

1364
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,695
What kind of an actual threat is this

1365
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:06,463
2

1366
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,231
Whatever holding

1367
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
I mean

1368
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,119
Probably at least read the

1369
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:18,495
So if they're scrolling through whatever Newsfeed that it is they've got they'll get one

1370
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:24,639
Headline of Alex Jones Alex Jones fan and you see that's

1371
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,175
Posting the New York Times

1372
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,247
Like you're not going to take yeah you're already done

1373
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
It's not theirs

1374
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:34,879
It's ridiculous that he needs to come up with this this deflection of

1375
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,927
Someone else wrote the story

1376
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:42,815
Also there a high-rise live in New York and Lee do doesn't know what it's like to be out in the field

1377
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:43,839
It's a

1378
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:44,607
Kind of absurd

1379
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,399
You know

1380
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,215
I would say yeah it's probably more just the person

1381
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:53,823
It has nothing to do with what his listeners are going to like or dislike about

1382
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
New York Times you everything to do with him just being like

1383
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:58,943
I need to create a story for me

1384
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,063
Make me feel better feels like whatever is going on

1385
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
What is about addressing

1386
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
Those cancer

1387
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,951
In the same way that you knows

1388
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,487
He doesn't care about conspiracies

1389
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
You feels like he's in

1390
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:16,351
Not them and he needs to guard his ego by

1391
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
Pretending someone else wrote this story

1392
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,423
All about him

1393
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,007
So in service of that like

1394
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:23,775
Like these

1395
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,311
Rich Elite New York

1396
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,383
They're so different from us that alien

1397
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,431
Alex descends into like

1398
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,223
A really weird

1399
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,831
Start a diatribe about these are these

1400
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
High-rise living Elite sure

1401
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,927
And I remind you before we listen to

1402
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
Is a family

1403
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,535
I've been around the generational rich people talk

1404
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,327
Don't know

1405
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Anything

1406
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,191
They just grown up

1407
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,359
Horse

1408
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
Seen any other

1409
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,791
You know it started a woman that's never gone out again

1410
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,815
A Big Field

1411
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
Truck Farm

1412
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,399
I don't know whether

1413
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,679
Is going

1414
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:26,495
And put them in there

1415
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,799
What's a metaphor

1416
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
In the house with a woman pulled their clothes off

1417
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,687
Because it's so instinctive

1418
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
With the sound of the bugs picking vegetables

1419
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:37,503
With a man

1420
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
Serial killer

1421
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,535
Because I shoot animals at 6

1422
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887
Squash cooking

1423
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,215
What if Japan

1424
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:00,287
What's the grossest thing ever

1425
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,823
Is grosser than anything else

1426
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:05,663
I did seem like it was a grouse nest

1427
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,223
Aldi's

1428
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:13,855
Diesel leaks fuel York high-rise living people that want to f*** you when they coming to you

1429
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
That's

1430
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:21,791
So like crazy

1431
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
That's insane

1432
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,863
Lovett that's where his brain work

1433
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
These people don't know they

1434
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,727
Pick vegetables and then they f******

1435
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:33,567
I'm so horny gardening as foreplay

1436
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,919
Guy that's so

1437
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:44,319
And not just that but most of the people who write for the New York Times can't afford anything let alone at the people who are

1438
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,367
Are New York Elite through right for the New York Times

1439
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,671
Probably agree with Alex more than not

1440
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,207
It's possible

1441
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:52,767
I don't know it's just it's just

1442
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:53,535
See the way his

1443
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,815
His brain

1444
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
Deals with information

1445
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:58,911
But I love that at the end very sorry

1446
01:09:59,167 --> 01:09:59,679
Potatoes

1447
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:03,007
And it gets into like this I do this stuff for myself

1448
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:05,311
Myself kind of thing

1449
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,335
And I think

1450
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:09,663
Thinks he's going to end this list on like oh really

1451
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,271
Punch okay accidentally said something I think is if I

1452
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,343
Use the word Freudian slip

1453
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
But it is

1454
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
Feels like

1455
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Okay

1456
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:23,487
On groceries

1457
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:33,215
That's such a weird

1458
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:36,287
I think what he's trying to say is

1459
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:41,407
I don't have other people kick ass 100%

1460
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:48,063
There's a truth there's a truth to it as much as he creates his own problem

1461
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
Bio-data

1462
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:56,767
You globalis at the New York Times trying to destroy me I'll do it for

1463
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,607
Probably needs to be dealt with I will deal with him myself

1464
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:04,703
Yeah I heard that I was like that goddamn

1465
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,775
I buy my own groceries and

1466
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,847
I kick my own ass and I'm all out of grocery

1467
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:17,247
First thing he's ever said

1468
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:23,647
So Alex Goes to break and he comes back and what do you know he continues to not talk about this New York time story

1469
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:27,487
I'm not going to even take us out.

1470
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:30,815
No reports mention of indicted signify

1471
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:43,615
Must have been trying to impress his reporter that he was moral

1472
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,383
What

1473
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,663
The hell

1474
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
Really talk about

1475
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,183
That doesn't sound good

1476
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:00,511
They would never write a big check to somebody.

1477
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,703
To be clear in the article Josh Owens says quote

1478
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:14,847
Once when I went to interview a frequent guest of Jones's I was sent with a check to cover a potentially life-saving cancer free

1479
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
Larry Nichols

1480
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:22,783
During the time frame to do one's work there it's pretty safe to say that there is only one frequent gas to sounds a lot like that and that is

1481
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
Larry Nichols

1482
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:30,207
So that would raise the question of whether or not there was a time during Josh's employment when someone from Infowars would have been in Arkansas

1483
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:32,255
Talk to interview Larry in person

1484
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
The answer that question

1485
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Is yes

1486
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
In 2015 Alex released

1487
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,191
The new Clinton Chronicles which is basically just Larry rambling a bunch

1488
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:42,751
Bulshit about Hillary being a witch

1489
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,311
It is

1490
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,335
Professionally shot

1491
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
It was done through info

1492
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:52,479
He was never released an actual DVD or anything so really it only exists

1493
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,503
Listed on YouTube

1494
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:56,575
That makes it damn near impossible to track down any credits for it

1495
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,903
As such I can't prove definitively that this was the time when towing

1496
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,207
Deliver to checked one of Alex's frequent guest

1497
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:04,511
But I'd be very comfortable and assuming

1498
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,535
That's the most likely

1499
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,303
Play situation

1500
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:12,959
So probably that and Alex's Alex like yeah it was just someone who we were interviewing who

1501
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:16,799
Wanted to help him out you evil people would never do something like that

1502
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
Kind of feels more like

1503
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:20,383
Alex is paying for Larry's

1504
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,663
Interview exactly

1505
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
It's

1506
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,271
Josh

1507
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,295
It's lovely that you

1508
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
Yeah yeah

1509
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:39,071
Continues to not talk but this New York Times story that he won't dignify with

1510
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,631
It's just when you get into the mindset

1511
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:46,239
It's so weird it's so bizarre

1512
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,799
Now do always my ride a fake piece

1513
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,455
The only take something from Hollywood

1514
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
In their face

1515
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Peace

1516
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,063
I guess the other

1517
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,647
Wall Street or somebody grabs

1518
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,415
Somebody fish

1519
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Like fish

1520
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,583
Employee fishing killed

1521
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
50 something so over-the-top

1522
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Turtles

1523
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,767
Turtles

1524
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
Cool

1525
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,911
So is defensive shot Turtles didn't kill that goldfish

1526
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
His defense is also

1527
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
Baby I

1528
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,591
Good morning

1529
01:14:54,847 --> 01:15:00,223
Klepto is am accusing the globalist of using things from movies yeah

1530
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:06,111
Hey guy a guy who thinks that childhood's end is literally real

1531
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,415
Haggai

1532
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,559
That makes me believe it even more that he knows that it's from Wolf of Wall Street because that suggests to me that he

1533
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,839
He probably watch

1534
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
Wolf of Wall Street

1535
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Close to that event

1536
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,191
And then decided to do it

1537
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:22,751
Oh that's interesting that makes the most sense

1538
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:25,311
Yeah I didn't even consider that that's a possibility

1539
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,431
I don't know I just think it's funny when someone whose worldview is almost entirely based on science fix

1540
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Jason movies and books

1541
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,759
Accuses the globalist of using

1542
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:37,599
Always using movies

1543
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,135
And now it's possible that

1544
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:39,903
He actually

1545
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:44,767
Just watches a lot of movies and then applies whatever is in a movie to what

1546
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:51,423
Happening yeah you know me always put it in there for him to find you know those people that you'll run into wherever

1547
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:56,031
Free joke is like some reference to a movie

1548
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:00,639
It's probably socially would be fairly close to that and maybe acts out things

1549
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,455
I think he feels I think he still does my wife

1550
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,503
Navigate to I think he still does

1551
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,831
No he probably doesn't hate that's true

1552
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:13,951
Probably starts with a

1553
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,511
Punches a wall

1554
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:25,471
Alex is done for now talking about the New York Times story but he hasn't turned out

1555
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
Story the day that he

1556
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Right

1557
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,383
It's 21 but he didn't

1558
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Cover

1559
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:34,175
And it's about like

1560
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,479
Some sort of a polyamorous relationship

1561
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,295
Okay that was covered in a V I didn't even look

1562
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,087
Can't really even care

1563
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:47,231
It has to do with like a woman who's with four men or something and okay Alex's real judgy about

1564
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:47,999
This I'd like

1565
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
To point out there

1566
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,559
He's a libertarian

1567
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,095
I got this video I didn't get to

1568
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,495
Polyamorous couple of four men and a woman are you there

1569
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
This woman is their mom

1570
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,527
She treats them all like they're her twelve-year-old son

1571
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,135
AOL

1572
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,487
Sun

1573
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,655
Like if she's really going to protect them from the Army

1574
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,983
This is what are friendly nice

1575
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,287
Society not giving people guidelines

1576
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,591
Follow has created

1577
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,127
Hey guy you want

1578
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
Guidelines

1579
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:42,015
What word would you use

1580
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:44,575
The government

1581
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,695
You want start of like enforced

1582
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,767
Relationships trucks I'm pretty sure that he does yes

1583
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:59,167
I don't mean like it's hard to say that that's exactly what he's advocating but it isn't outside

1584
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,191
The possible

1585
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,727
Absolute

1586
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:05,055
But I think we use more interested in then government doing it

1587
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:07,103
Is society enforcing it

1588
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:08,127
Themselves

1589
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,687
Right people in these sorts of relationships

1590
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:11,455
Being like

1591
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,527
Marginalized to the extent where they're not welcome

1592
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:19,135
Scarlet Letter type shed

1593
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,415
Libertarian at all

1594
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,439
That's not

1595
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
I would say

1596
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,535
Mind your own business

1597
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:28,351
Who gives a s*** if this first of all

1598
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,911
Who gives a s*** if this woman is dating for dudes

1599
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,191
Work together with four Dudes

1600
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,775
Who cares everybody who gives a s*** if there are

1601
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,335
She's pregnant by one of them everybody who cares

1602
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,383
Let them be

1603
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,663
Hey Alex

1604
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:43,711
Excommunicate you do you know it's

1605
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
Not going to workout

1606
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,527
Why do you care this is

1607
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
Literally every time

1608
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,855
He even mentioned

1609
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,415
Gay people he always follows up with

1610
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:57,023
And I don't care what you do in bed you can be you can be with anybody that you want

1611
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,071
You cannot be with more than one person

1612
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:02,399
Yvette is where I draw the line very clearly does

1613
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,191
Oh absolutely

1614
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:08,799
It's very bizarre 100 million percent

1615
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,103
Not about multiple people

1616
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
Being with one person

1617
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:16,479
No it's not no it's about multiple men being with one woman f*** you

1618
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:22,879
That might be

1619
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,975
Or not

1620
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:30,815
Primitive levels

1621
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,631
It's not manly it's not cool it's not

1622
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,727
Confident

1623
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:47,455
Thought my thought was to that that's that's a completely once a year on a certain

1624
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:59,487
People watch

1625
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
Scott Manley

1626
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:05,631
Domesticated

1627
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,447
So-called Mothership

1628
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,104
Absolutely is the family show Jordan

1629
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,944
Family to do this but it is mainly to go fuc

1630
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:24,832
If you've ever read the book sex at dawn that is actually what the beginning of civilization looks like

1631
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,368
Pointed

1632
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,392
It's not manly

1633
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,464
To be in a situation where there's one woman in for dudes

1634
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:31,744
He is so threatened

1635
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,584
Yeah that is very such a weak-willed

1636
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
It's very revealing

1637
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,400
Cuz

1638
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,936
The it's still

1639
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
The way he's talking

1640
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,520
Think about it is like it's manly to go to an orgy

1641
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,824
But it's not manly

1642
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,592
To share

1643
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,384
EvanTubeHD

1644
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,152
Framed

1645
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:52,992
In the terms of Manliness and manliness is what needs

1646
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
To be retained

1647
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,552
Very

1648
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:59,392
Messed up I'm always amazed at how

1649
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,416
Manliness

1650
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Is

1651
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,720
Maybe the most

1652
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,256
Fragile thing in the world

1653
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,536
These guys

1654
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:08,608
Whatever it is is there is very threatened by this

1655
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:15,008
Potential polyamorous couple that he's heard about it has nothing to do with his life at all

1656
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:19,616
Is manlier than being terrified at every moment that people will find out you're not a

1657
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:24,224
People are happy in that sort of arranged

1658
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:25,504
Why the f*** do you

1659
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,880
You care because

1660
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,952
Even if even if they have an arrangement that

1661
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,720
Involves likes

1662
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:40,096
Some sort of a maternal dynamic between them

1663
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,680
One woman and four children

1664
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,704
That's against the rules

1665
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
So crazy

1666
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,568
Any consensual relationship that I don't approve of should be ended

1667
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,848
Family

1668
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,128
Show

1669
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,688
Got to go f*** each other

1670
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,504
Alex's brain is

1671
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:58,784
So

1672
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,064
Fascinating

1673
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
In Florence

1674
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
Like the question

1675
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
Where do you draw the line

1676
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
For so many people is relative

1677
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,232
Simple they can draw the line invented

1678
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,768
Places very quickly

1679
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,864
For Alex the line is zigzagging upside down

1680
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
And then at certain points

1681
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,984
Parallel but also never to know Claritin Bunnell consisting

1682
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
Falcon

1683
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,312
Knee-jerk

1684
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,872
Whatever the f*** makes me feel weird

1685
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:26,944
Cuz it'll change tomorrow

1686
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:29,248
So we get back to this

1687
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,016
Story about people

1688
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
Put Spirits in Houma

1689
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:37,696
And like I said when Alex from flights mopping to get back to homelessness

1690
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
Okay

1691
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,816
Because what happens is Alex's an interview with former MLB player Aubrey Huff

1692
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:49,472
Because Aubrey Huff post a picture where you was out at a shooting range with his kids he said

1693
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:55,872
I got to teach him how to use a gun in case Bernie wins San Francisco

1694
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,688
What what

1695
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
She's a gun guy

1696
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Anyways

1697
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,528
Oh no by the way most baseball

1698
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,064
They're all f******

1699
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,416
What about Brian Wilson

1700
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,184
Yes

1701
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,256
So look

1702
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
He's on

1703
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,304
Interviews whatever it is

1704
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
Who cares

1705
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:21,472
In the middle of that Alex gets a call from a woman in Florida who claims to work

1706
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,752
In the homeless

1707
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:23,520
Population

1708
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,336
And she has also heard of somebody getting a

1709
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,688
So this turns Alex into like going deep in that direction

1710
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,248
Alex is already revealed that on Tuesday

1711
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,808
He's going to break his big news

1712
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
Bombshell little destroy the globalist

1713
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,440
Alex reveals what

1714
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
Plan is

1715
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,768
Made me

1716
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,816
Like over-the-moon like Jess

1717
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:48,608
I was so excited okay

1718
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,448
All this stuff

1719
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:57,824
Areas to get more contacts

1720
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,880
Tampa forms everything else right now okay

1721
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
We're going for is the

1722
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,744
On TV will the doctor here next week okay

1723
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:20,864
The whole world's a stage

1724
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:29,824
Wow so real quick PT Barnum

1725
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:36,480
PT Barnum what I believe his quote was all press is good press that kind of

1726
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,040
Alex what he does is so much closer to Barnum

1727
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,856
So it makes sense that's where's mine will go

1728
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:46,720
Like getting someone in studio to cut a chip out of them is absolutely carnesha.

1729
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:52,352
And I love listening to that my first reaction was amazement that Alex announced that he was planning to do that

1730
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,424
Which very quickly became a certainty that this was never gone to

1731
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,008
I feel like this is Thomas Edison

1732
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:03,872
Electrocuting an elephant level ship but he backs out van like

1733
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,200
This is

1734
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,480
I mean

1735
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:09,248
Sure

1736
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,320
Publicity stunt maybe this is a way to call Bud

1737
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:15,904
So what's going on here like I said is this woman called in from Florida

1738
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,440
She claims to have 30 years

1739
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,208
Experience

1740
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,744
Working with people experiencing homelessness

1741
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,840
Specific about what any of his experience is

1742
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:26,912
You mentioned that you work for a nonprofit but I don't

1743
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:32,288
It's weird and a white van only nonprofit and I don't know what she's doing at their very vague

1744
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,616
Anyway she meets a couple who then disappear for 6

1745
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:36,384
2/8 weeks

1746
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:41,760
What you meet back up with the dude from this couple it turns out that he was arrested for trespassing

1747
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:43,808
In the process of being booked

1748
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:47,136
Is offered at to be part of a program where people who would speak

1749
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,672
Helplessness would be given

1750
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,696
Implantable chips

1751
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,744
Dan all of the relevant medical records

1752
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,024
Navigation

1753
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,328
Anyway we talked about this on pass that by

1754
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:59,424
That makes a lot of sense for people who are living with housing vulnerability

1755
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:01,216
To explore that kind of a notch

1756
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:04,288
They don't have no secure place to keep important documents

1757
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,080
And that could be the difference between

1758
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,640
Progressive towards stability and being trapped in a never-ending

1759
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,224
Cycle of consistently having to get new copies of necessary

1760
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,832
Willie gums up the word financial burden physical burden

1761
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,136
Anyway this woman calls and it's

1762
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:24,512
Completely freaking Alex out because he hasn't even broken his big news that he was planning to break on Tuesday

1763
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,584
Because I've already heard him talk about this back

1764
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,352
October

1765
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
And even at that point that wasn't news

1766
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,216
Other mainstream media Outlets have been discussing this

1767
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:35,008
Proposal for months even a year

1768
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,288
Before Alex

1769
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,056
Even caught wind of it

1770
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,896
The bottom line is what they're talking about has this Colonel of

1771
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,504
It is much as there is a plan that's being discussed and being worked on

1772
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,296
It's all bulshit when it's being

1773
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,064
Combined with this

1774
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,088
FEMA camp fantasy

1775
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,112
Seeing all the globalist

1776
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,904
Which Alex is doing

1777
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:57,792
I should also say that I don't find this caller to be someone who strikes me as being a good source

1778
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,352
Here's a clip of her talking to Alex

1779
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
But I think it's full of

1780
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Red flag

1781
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:06,496
And being a liberal for 30 years

1782
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:10,592
Being a liberal for 30 years

1783
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,128
Hello

1784
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:18,528
Somebody's trying to microchip me and then I'm listening to Alex Jones because I want to be

1785
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:22,112
I want to be enlightened

1786
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:28,512
Habanero's only for weights

1787
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,352
Space and yeah there it is Kelly

1788
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
What are you going to do now

1789
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:40,288
So In that clip this person claims have 30 years experience in the field refers to these people as my

1790
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,056
I homeless

1791
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:45,408
She's using a possessive descriptor which I think seems really weird and kind of gross

1792
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,944
Doesn't make a lot of sense

1793
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:49,248
Amy at very least

1794
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,576
It's an indication that she has a pretty weird View

1795
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Of the work

1796
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,904
She's doing 30 years of liberal

1797
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:58,464
Liberal and then

1798
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,744
One of

1799
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,024
My homeless

1800
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,072
They they got microchip

1801
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:05,120
And I was listening to Alex Jones

1802
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:05,888
Switch

1803
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,704
All three of those make perfect sense in the sentence

1804
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,080
I mean like beat that's so glaring claiming to be a liberal or decided to listen to Alex Jones

1805
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:16,384
The year of Our Lord 2019

1806
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
Search for enlight

1807
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,992
Where you have to really go find Alice

1808
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:24,576
You can't just you too babe looking for enlightenment

1809
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:29,184
Like either the liberal past that she

1810
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:35,072
He's describing is being manufactured to give her story more credibility yeah like as if to say you know like you can take

1811
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,888
For me I was part of a group that hates you even I think you're

1812
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,680
Or she's just delusional

1813
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:44,544
You just can't have it there's no kind of liberal principles you can hold

1814
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,384
32in in the Infowars and fake Hades people are really swinging yeah yeah

1815
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:53,760
It's totally possible that she's a real caller but this is the closest I've come to think

1816
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
Caller wasn't

1817
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,832
Yeah that sounds like a plan

1818
01:28:57,088 --> 01:29:00,672
It's just really hard to swallow Dan elements of her story

1819
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,440
That's

1820
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:02,208
You know

1821
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
I just don't

1822
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:06,304
I mean it's possible it's entirely possible these are things

1823
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,328
They could exist

1824
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,680
Perceived yourself to be liberal

1825
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,472
It just being a completely

1826
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,496
Inaccurate

1827
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
Alright

1828
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,312
Frederick possible

1829
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
But I just I have a tub

1830
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176
It works too well

1831
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Towards

1832
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Justifying

1833
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,992
Alex is narrative

1834
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,528
Spitting his narrative

1835
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
Exactly

1836
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,088
It's it's almost 2

1837
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,368
But again

1838
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440
It's not impossible that some listener

1839
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,464
Would be

1840
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:39,072
Exactly what Alex need you could take that call

1841
01:29:39,328 --> 01:29:44,448
I thought before you can play this

1842
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,240
That we were leaning more towards this

1843
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,824
It's like the letters that the veterans get

1844
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,848
And the guys like

1845
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:57,248
Well I haven't gotten one but I haven't checked the mail recently or the other guys like I heard someone

1846
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,808
Got one I thought that she was going to be like

1847
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,344
I work with the homeless and

1848
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,624
What I heard that

1849
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,904
Kind of

1850
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,464
She heard from the sky

1851
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,512
He's got he's like showed it to

1852
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,560
He didn't get it

1853
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,632
Oh you didn't know he got an offer to get this

1854
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,936
As opposed to like doing

1855
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,752
60 days in jail for the trespassing

1856
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,056
Like almost like drug court

1857
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:23,360
Like it's an option that you can take

1858
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,176
Being involved in a program

1859
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,504
And I don't know if that's true that's just what she's saying

1860
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,808
And so like that

1861
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,576
Commands to her

1862
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:37,696
So a lot of this is being driven by a video that made the rounds at the end of November

1863
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:40,000
Beginning of December area

1864
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:43,072
Supposed to do on YouTube by a channel called beardbrand

1865
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:49,984
In the video of Barber is giving a nice haircut and beard trim to a man living with all listeners who apparently it help the shop out with some

1866
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,520
Cleaning like the windows and stuff

1867
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:58,176
The video itself is meant to be a heartwarming thing where you see the difference that little things like a haircut or the human interaction with the

1868
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
Barbara can

1869
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
It is really

1870
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,856
Kind of moving to see like the end

1871
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:06,880
Like how much

1872
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,696
How much different this guy Peter is it

1873
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:12,000
The beginning and kind of like

1874
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
Disheveled

1875
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:16,096
Really great haircut

1876
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:19,168
You see his face lighting up more yeah it's nice

1877
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
At the beginning of the video

1878
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:25,568
Getting haircut says that there's a plan he heard about

1879
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
I'm trying to put a device on

1880
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
People at the house they're important

1881
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:32,992
You've even expressing it is like this is not a bad idea

1882
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,296
So naturally Alex sees this as an ex

1883
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:37,088
Slip-up admission of the grant

1884
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:37,856
Conspiracy

1885
01:31:38,112 --> 01:31:38,624
Perfect plain

1886
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,392
Insight

1887
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:42,720
There's nothing secret Anna farias about the my Pass Program.

1888
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:43,744
That's being disgusting off

1889
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:49,632
It's been really public and I can find articles going back to at least April of last year covering the launch of the plan

1890
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
And how they're working with people

1891
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,752
And with blockchain technology

1892
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,288
In order to try and navigate

1893
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,568
Some of the larger data privacy

1894
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,336
The issues that

1895
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:00,128
Nothing like this would bring up right

1896
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:05,248
We talked about this last episode so I don't want to belabor it but it's worth recognizing that this is a real thing

1897
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,272
It's being lied about

1898
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,320
And the real-world function of what Alex is

1899
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,600
Who's fighting against

1900
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:12,160
Is the development of a program that

1901
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,696
Could you people experiencing homelessness

1902
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,720
Greater access

1903
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,744
Do the tools they need

1904
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,024
Need to manage their lives

1905
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:18,816
Victim

1906
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,096
Of his narrative

1907
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:22,656
Well he doesn't want any problems to be solved

1908
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,448
Because then he wouldn't be able to yell about

1909
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
That problem

1910
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Sure

1911
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:28,288
Alex covered the story weeks

1912
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,152
As if it was breaking news even though it been public and covered for over a year by other Publications

1913
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,432
But then he let it drop

1914
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:39,040
That was good enough for him just to touch on the story to come back to it if you need it

1915
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:42,368
But I think you knew there was no legs to the story and it is what it was

1916
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:46,464
But then this beardbrand video came out and it went really viral

1917
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:50,816
It raked in millions of views with a currently being at about 6.5 million

1918
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:51,840
On YouTube

1919
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:56,192
Is it clear demonstration that the public was interested in the story so Alex

1920
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,216
Reprioritize

1921
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,800
I can't see any other reason for his increased Focus

1922
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
What's narrative

1923
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:05,664
There's no other news other than what he's already lied about back in October

1924
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,992
And nothing that the man in the beardbrand video said

1925
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,784
Adds anything more to the story

1926
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:15,392
Yeah all that happened was there was a video that got millions of views and Alex realize that maybe

1927
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,952
Disturbia story he could take ownership of

1928
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:18,976
And get some of that at

1929
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,256
I'm self

1930
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,816
From his perspective that makes total sense

1931
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:28,192
Give us the keys and he no longer has access to the means of guiding the conspiracy world's attention

1932
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,776
Since much of it lives outside of places where you can exert his influence

1933
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:35,616
He's less relevant to the larger world than Facebook hoax

1934
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,664
So what do you have to do is bases

1935
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,200
Content that on chasing

1936
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,736
Topics that resonate

1937
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,272
With the consumers a thing

1938
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,808
Like Facebook hoaxes

1939
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,160
You can see it with the white man narrative you can see it further with this microchipping

1940
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:48,928
Bulshit

1941
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952
Again

1942
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
Just chasing down

1943
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,512
Whatever scraps

1944
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,304
And trying to

1945
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
Build it in

1946
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
So

1947
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,704
That's all here there's a viral video of a guy getting haircut

1948
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Dimensions

1949
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:02,240
This

1950
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,264
Program

1951
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,056
Been publicly discussed and

1952
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,336
The secret to anybody

1953
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,384
And I was just turning it into

1954
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,920
I'm going to cut a chip out

1955
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,456
Somebody on Tuesday

1956
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736
Yeah

1957
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,528
That is absolutely no

1958
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,576
But it's overwhelming

1959
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,344
Alex

1960
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
You just can't handle

1961
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,696
Process

1962
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
This much stuff

1963
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,352
Exaggerate

1964
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,728
Giant stories

1965
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,824
It's always 10-7 of a completely confirmed

1966
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,664
Shaking

1967
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,784
Problem

1968
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
Are the same story

1969
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
What does that mean

1970
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:53,440
I got 10 stories 7 or confirm for the same story

1971
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,744
I've no idea

1972
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,560
Is this a real is this like what has

1973
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:03,680
Two legs and what has one leg in the morning two legs at night and four legs at dinner

1974
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:07,008
Doctor is the mother

1975
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,056
I am the greatest

1976
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:10,848
So Alex

1977
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:13,664
I guess he's 10 stories he doesn't say what they are

1978
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,944
He has four of them

1979
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:17,504
Or

1980
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,040
Are we actually dealing

1981
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,088
With eleven stories better actually

1982
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
8 stories

1983
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,648
Who knows

1984
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
Doesn't matter

1985
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,208
None of it's real

1986
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:28,768
But then Alex has a little bit of

1987
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
I'll break.

1988
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:36,192
Is a deep state was going to try to have an economically implosion in martial law which they admit they want a civil war

1989
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,776
America will never come back

1990
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,896
The planning and the money and the infrastructure that will go into that

1991
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,432
And then imagine

1992
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
Coverstore

1993
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,016
For the different pieces of

1994
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,904
I have reverse-engineered

1995
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,184
Troy

1996
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:59,232
Hold it in my brain

1997
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,816
Write out the basic skeleton

1998
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:06,144
Has a paper

1999
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:09,984
Double space

2000
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
Handwritten

2001
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,128
100%

2002
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
Confirm

2003
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:20,736
At this point it's not like I'm looking at something

2004
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
Connected

2005
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,320
This thing is crystal HD

2006
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,976
This is such a classic con man shyt

2007
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:35,328
Like Alex is sitting up here and going on about how he's figured out the entire globalist plan

2008
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:38,656
He can hold it in his head and maybe write it out in 20 pages but

2009
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:40,192
Can't seem to just explain it in

2010
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,472
Clear concise language

2011
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,776
It doesn't end up turning into a pointless rant of

2012
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,312
Time-filler about the devil

2013
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:50,688
Is Alex Andy does have this entire globo's plan figured out that he has a responsibility to put it out for the

2014
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:56,576
If you can write it out the skeleton and 20 Pages he needs to sit his ass down and write it out

2015
01:36:56,832 --> 01:37:00,928
Getting through that 20 Pages shouldn't take more than half of one of his daily shows

2016
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,208
He writes it all out

2017
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,768
Teacher class dick

2018
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:09,888
There's literally no excuse for him not to do that just take one day who cares

2019
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:14,496
The world keeps on moving you'll miss your ability to rant about to

2020
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,800
Putin say mothers are being outlawed

2021
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,616
Take that day

2022
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,640
Do your business

2023
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:23,200
Get down to business to get really specific

2024
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,736
Site things clearly

2025
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,504
Don't go away

2026
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:30,112
Open the pointless rant about nothing in the devil is lay out the picture that you claim to see

2027
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,392
So Crystal clearly

2028
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,672
And everything's proven

2029
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:33,952
Not going to do that

2030
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
Lil Boosie

2031
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,000
Talkingshit

2032
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:37,024
This is

2033
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,072
This is this is abusive

2034
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:42,656
Yes

2035
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:45,472
This is such a crock of s***

2036
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,288
It's like that really kind of like make me

2037
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:54,688
I'm amused by a kind of way

2038
01:37:54,944 --> 01:38:01,088
Just that like I am the Oracle cannot tell you his ways

2039
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:07,488
Do not look behind the curtain my friend I'm telling you that because that used

2040
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
Hotels in one place

2041
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,328
Then the fact that use hotels other places

2042
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:15,168
Means that the thing people it's this sense of like okay so what

2043
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,704
What what I'm telling you is I feel

2044
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,520
It's all perfectly prove everything is Krista

2045
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,824
What would so what's going on

2046
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,616
I can't I can't I can't

2047
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:25,664
Commit to slow it down

2048
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:32,064
Just take your time to think through it I've got the money empty pages for you to write on typewriter

2049
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:36,672
Handwritten I'd love person would even work I would love to do that but it's

2050
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Too much

2051
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,232
Even really tell you

2052
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,024
So what I can 41 pages

2053
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,608
Now what I can do

2054
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:46,656
It's because I can hold it all in my head

2055
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:51,520
I can do is I can have you tell me a headline

2056
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:53,312
And then I can tell you what it means

2057
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,336
Okay I like that

2058
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,616
It's not a parlor

2059
01:38:56,128 --> 01:39:01,504
That is nice okay grand mother

2060
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:09,440
OK Google what's a different hat on

2061
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,208
Mother

2062
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,512
I am balux girl

2063
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
Soothsayer

2064
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:20,448
Yeah I mean that's all that's going on though really is just like the making a rationalization for why he's not there

2065
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:22,752
Doing the thing that his show is

2066
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
Supposed to be

2067
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:28,384
Is it like I can hold it all in my head that's why I just end up ripping about all this stuff

2068
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,944
Whatever I could give you all the information

2069
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,760
But how about you give me the information

2070
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,808
And I'll move some blocks around and I'll go

2071
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,344
Give you different for guys

2072
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,208
Instead of teaching a class I would rather do an improv show

2073
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,256
That's all it is yeah pretty much

2074
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,792
So Alex now lays out the

2075
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,328
Plan about like

2076
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,632
How this all fits

2077
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,960
Gather you know cuz he's already said that like they're going to take out Trump

2078
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:54,752
And then that's going to leave

2079
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
To the

2080
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:58,592
Collapse or whatever

2081
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,920
They're microchipping people experience because

2082
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:06,528
There's something that it's disconnected I don't really understand how it all works

2083
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:09,600
I understand how it all works together within this clip

2084
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,928
Tries to bring it all under the umbrella

2085
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,744
And I would say this need to rewrite okay

2086
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,864
They are intending to remove Trump one way or another

2087
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,632
Step one

2088
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,496
Winger's blue stuff up wind up to

2089
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:28,800
They're going to truck mom and mash

2090
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,336
And say we did it

2091
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,872
When they removed from

2092
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:43,136
There's going to be homeless running around crazy everywhere what

2093
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:44,160
5% of the opiates

2094
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,208
Cut those off for about a month

2095
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
Set for

2096
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,560
And it's going to look like a zombie apocalypse

2097
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,864
Un vehicles

2098
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:56,704
Hundreds of ngos running around getting emergency centers ready

2099
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,776
For the homeless

2100
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,800
Explosion

2101
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:05,664
Microchipping ready they call Andrea education camps

2102
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,712
Obama army manual

2103
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:12,064
2014

2104
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,368
Sorry that we talked about that already put

2105
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:17,952
So Alex is basically laid out of this microchipping the homeless population

2106
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:19,232
Complacent the globalist

2107
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
Again

2108
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:24,096
I have to stress that none of this is in his film endgame

2109
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:29,216
Which is another version of a totally proven Crystal Clear Vision of what the globalist playing for their endgame

2110
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:35,872
They're all this stuff about the Chinese cutting off the Fentanyl and behind so we need

2111
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:42,272
Endgame he didn't realize that they were going to have to update their stuff as whatever

2112
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
PlayStation

2113
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:43,808
Update whatever

2114
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,344
You got to just download it

2115
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,904
It takes a 45 hours but you just lived through

2116
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,440
So Trump gets removed

2117
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:54,304
Then we end up in a situation where right-wing extremist pull-off more attacks

2118
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,352
But naturally these are false Flags

2119
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,632
Like all the other ones

2120
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,680
Right-wingers never commit Viber

2121
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,216
Is this

2122
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,776
Civil War will break out the economy will

2123
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:10,176
At that point the Chinese can cut off the opiate Supply which will make the homeless population turn into a walking

2124
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,200
Zombies

2125
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:15,040
And then all the old school Alex Jones FEMA camp fantasies finally come into

2126
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,344
Honestly

2127
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:21,184
I think that the element of this narrative involving homelessness is

2128
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:23,488
Kind of Superfluous to the larger plot

2129
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:29,888
I don't understand once a civil war breaks out I really don't think the government would need any other excuse to an active form of martial law

2130
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:34,496
I don't know how people going through opening doll Everman is my quest

2131
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:39,872
I don't know how people go to open withdrawals is going to like Ray's the steaks from a civil war

2132
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,944
Is this where screenplay and I was giving notes I would say take

2133
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,712
Take that part out

2134
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,760
It just over complicates things

2135
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:50,112
It would make me think that I was talking to a writer who maybe it was try

2136
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,392
Trying too hard to jam

2137
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,160
Time to plot

2138
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,976
Baby baby kind of just doesn't

2139
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,560
Russian novelist

2140
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,120
Also Alex is making up that statistic

2141
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,656
90% of opiates come from

2142
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,424
Vagina

2143
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,496
You may be spiritually right that a majority of fentanyl comes

2144
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:09,056
China but that's not the totality of the opiate crisis

2145
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,336
Anti

2146
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:16,224
He's not taking into account the people who have used fentanyl also probably use other oppa

2147
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,576
No it's not like fentanyl disappears and then adequan to say like

2148
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,880
I can't use heroin

2149
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:24,416
It's just not as good

2150
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:30,304
It's just not a good enough hi I understand the fentanyl is way stronger you know whatever but it doesn't

2151
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,352
Once you go

2152
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,656
Once you go with fentanyl man you can't go back

2153
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:35,680
This is August

2154
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:39,520
Completely disconnected from reality I even more so than normal

2155
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,288
For Alex

2156
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:44,896
It's a lazy and sloppy although I will say it does feel a lot more like Alex's old work than

2157
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,664
His current work

2158
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:49,248
There are these elements of it that are much

2159
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:50,016
More

2160
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:51,808
About this

2161
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,344
Like it cuz the FEMA camp stuff

2162
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,160
Was so Central to like the older days

2163
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:59,232
And having a lot of that like really really emerged as a

2164
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:03,840
Is this overcomplicated scenario that is going to take place

2165
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:08,704
If Alex isn't successful and then it all leads to the predetermined destination

2166
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,984
Alex being dragged off to

2167
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,520
It is

2168
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,568
Much more reminiscent of that

2169
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,432
But the problem is that he's been goofing off and do dump truck bulshit for the last 4 years

2170
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:20,224
So those muscles are not

2171
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:26,624
Is good as it used to be good at doing that anymore

2172
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:28,928
Simplot that has nothing to do with anything

2173
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
I mean it

2174
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,488
You still got a monster of the week

2175
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,072
You know you still going to have a monster of the week

2176
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,376
He can't just cuz he has a overarching

2177
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,656
Storyline doesn't mean that

2178
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:39,424
You still don't have to

2179
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,472
To fight the gray man every now and again

2180
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:43,520
Gray man

2181
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,800
Trying to make

2182
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:47,360
Connected to the overarching

2183
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,896
Plot is not

2184
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
Right right

2185
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:53,248
Anyway the FEMA camps

2186
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,016
For longtime B

2187
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,552
Trump was literally

2188
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:56,832
Doing all of that stuff

2189
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,904
Yeah that silly wanted to avoid the

2190
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,208
That did probably put a wrench in

2191
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
Focusing

2192
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,024
Too much on that

2193
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,072
It's weird cuz it

2194
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,864
Sore bubbling back up at

2195
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,144
Same time that he said

2196
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,752
Trump committing treason then that a couple days later side.

2197
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:15,520
That's weird

2198
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:16,544
Anyway

2199
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:22,944
I mean well I mean he's committed treason on the show too so it's like Hoosick treason is off

2200
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
Again I mean it's

2201
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,320
Value neutral

2202
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,344
World

2203
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:31,392
So much like Steve

2204
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,928
We have another return

2205
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
Guest here

2206
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:35,744
Although we have seen him

2207
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:37,024
Not to dis

2208
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:39,072
Austin passed but another person who

2209
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:41,888
Is from Alex's Salad Days who is

2210
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:44,448
Now we're coming back into the fold

2211
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,984
And he might have gotten a check

2212
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,848
Larry Nichols and the clintons

2213
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,664
Rockefeller Foundation others healthy

2214
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:55,456
Handle them

2215
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:01,856
Killing even neighborhood

2216
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,904
So he found Jesus

2217
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,208
Vagina cancer has adjustable

2218
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:11,584
And that we found Christ and repented difference of info

2219
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,144
Larry Nichols and Courtney famously suppose

2220
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:18,496
Famous Tate

2221
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:21,824
Larry

2222
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:28,224
As best as I can tell none of that was true 0% of that was true

2223
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,504
I do eat the boss

2224
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,064
Expensive part was

2225
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,696
Larry's been a good source of information the most flagrant lie

2226
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,256
Introducing a man who famously got

2227
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:41,792
Everything wrong

2228
01:46:42,048 --> 01:46:43,328
Where is Kate

2229
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,864
Which is an

2230
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,656
Meaning of itself

2231
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:48,704
So Larry's on it's kind of boring

2232
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,264
Especially compared to the last time he was saying that Adam

2233
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,664
A shift isn't where is Egyptian garbage goes to ritual sacrifice

2234
01:46:57,920 --> 01:47:01,504
No it's but at least his last appearance when he returned

2235
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,784
And from his long absence

2236
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:05,856
At least there was some juice

2237
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,160
This time it's board just like

2238
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,184
Where we're up against

2239
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:10,720
The Wild Things

2240
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,512
Jack things are bad Alex

2241
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:17,120
Okay it's very standard boring Infowars gas

2242
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,680
But because they're talking about this

2243
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:20,704
Like how bad thing

2244
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,728
Things are for

2245
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:23,520
There Patriot

2246
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,312
Community or whatever

2247
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:27,872
Alex gets back into that headspace of like

2248
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,920
Think it's time start killing

2249
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:31,712
And John

2250
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,504
Dammit

2251
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,808
Larry's response is really interesting

2252
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,392
So what are you do when you're facing an unlawful row government

2253
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:43,488
He's got to go to the people and prepare to go with the people in the US Military

2254
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:52,704
Winnie-the-Pooh

2255
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,568
Be honest Alex the one thing we got left

2256
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,896
Play Spirits say this country we got one

2257
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:05,760
November 20th November 2020 the election

2258
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:12,160
Alex is being what the f*** just happened there damn nickels as big a voice of reason how dare you

2259
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:15,488
Alex Alex is being like we need Trump

2260
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,024
To get the f****** military to

2261
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,888
To clean out our enemies in the government killed millions of people

2262
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:29,312
Trump to use the military to unseat people that we deem

2263
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:31,872
To be part of this globalist cool right

2264
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,152
Which is

2265
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:33,920
Bad

2266
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,200
Obviously

2267
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:37,248
Mary's like nah man

2268
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,016
We got an Alexa

2269
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,576
I'm coming

2270
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:41,856
Hold on 1

2271
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,160
We need to focus on the

2272
01:48:44,416 --> 01:48:45,440
Peaceful transition of power

2273
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:51,840
But hold up until the election happens before we say

2274
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:53,376
Murder millions of people

2275
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:56,448
Yeah but man if millions of people die it's just

2276
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,216
Globalist

2277
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:59,520
So Alex doesn't care about that

2278
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:01,312
I don't want this to happen

2279
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:03,104
Trash

2280
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:12,832
That's why when I got cockroaches refrigerator I just

2281
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,120
Clouds

2282
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,680
Are really asking for it

2283
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,104
Becoming like the sunshine

2284
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:40,992
So I mean

2285
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,344
If Alex is saying a million globalists are going to

2286
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,880
To die then

2287
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:48,160
This isn't

2288
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:49,952
The same conspiracy

2289
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,744
He's always been talkin about

2290
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,024
Because

2291
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:59,168
I believe you said there's 60,000 globalist in the past I don't think that you could take

2292
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:03,520
The people who are in these bureaucratic positions and add them up to a million

2293
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,336
Like whatever he's talking about is Slaughter

2294
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:09,408
It is a massive he's already said like

2295
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
All these Democrats are all globalist

2296
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,760
Call Satan worshipers and

2297
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:15,296
The minions

2298
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,856
I mean like this is a

2299
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,880
Horrifying

2300
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,672
Thing that you suggesting happen

2301
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
Cool

2302
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,256
So much like

2303
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,280
F******

2304
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,560
It's just like

2305
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:28,864
Whoa whoa we can all have an orgy

2306
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:29,888
But if

2307
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:33,216
Three or four Dudes with the same woman that.

2308
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:36,032
That defies manliness and almost died

2309
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:40,128
It's the same ship just like other government is doing something that I

2310
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,944
Don't like I got so let's kill Millions

2311
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712
People

2312
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:48,320
Great so I should also say that Alex one of his main things

2313
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,624
He talks about all the time is that the globalist

2314
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,416
They're trying to destroy the family

2315
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,952
I like a family is

2316
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,976
Is the most of the day

2317
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:59,072
Right so the mother for fathers to kids

2318
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:00,096
Perfect family

2319
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:01,888
This next clips on Ebay

2320
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,656
Estranged mean

2321
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,424
For someone who

2322
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:04,448
Love's family

2323
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:14,432
People's family disowned the converse of people's wives need to leave them out to submit to them

2324
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,880
Republicans

2325
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:25,696
Absolutely

2326
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,584
Lose

2327
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,400
Are losing their job

2328
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:43,360
So Alex is saying that if you don't support Trump your family should be destroyed which is like

2329
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,128
Okay

2330
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,968
School so in the last clip he says I don't want to do anything offensive

2331
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:49,248
And in the next clip

2332
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:51,808
He says we're at War and we should all take off

2333
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,368
Well under assault

2334
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:56,928
I mean it is incoherent but its intention

2335
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:03,584
In the same way that you like I understand crystal clear all the things globos they're doing but I walk sit down and just

2336
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,376
F****** teach a class on it

2337
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:09,728
It's the same thing he wants you to be like we're in a war we're being attacked

2338
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:13,056
I won't do anything offensive Lee but giving every just

2339
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:19,456
Application for why whatever you might do is actually defensive and you probably didn't do it anyway with a global sports wagon

2340
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:24,064
Same thing try and keep people in this weird state where they

2341
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,600
You don't know what he's saying

2342
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,904
But Larry is

2343
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
Is

2344
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:31,744
The same thing he's always been saying

2345
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,024
Which is it

2346
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:33,792
PeopleLink

2347
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,560
Congress

2348
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,608
Are too cowardly to do anything

2349
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:39,936
Because they need to keep their jobs because when the trouble starts

2350
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:42,240
They become dukes and duchesses right

2351
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
That is true

2352
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,080
He can't possibly still thing

2353
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
He does

2354
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:49,152
The president becomes king

2355
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:52,736
Okay or queen alright everyone in Congress is Doutzen.

2356
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
Okay so then in that case

2357
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,808
The Congress people

2358
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:58,112
Would it be super for

2359
01:52:58,624 --> 01:52:59,392
This happening

2360
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:02,208
Because then there is a table

2361
01:53:02,720 --> 01:53:04,000
It's just the king and them

2362
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
Dukes and Duchess

2363
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:07,584
And when you get there if you got a lot of dukes and Duchess

2364
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:08,864
Somebody's going to over

2365
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,144
Okay

2366
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,424
I just going to happen

2367
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:17,824
You think yeah but the King has the praetorian guard I forgot about that

2368
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,128
Procedure to he's back for season 2

2369
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
Yeah

2370
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,736
But I wouldn't be learn Echols appearance on the show if something

2371
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,808
Completely absurd wasn't said by him

2372
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,088
I had to get back here

2373
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,672
You have got to engage over

2374
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:39,840
Galaxy angel

2375
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:43,168
250000

2376
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,192
Uintah

2377
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:47,776
It can be here in 6 hours

2378
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,104
Why are there

2379
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,640
Why are there Alex

2380
01:53:54,944 --> 01:54:01,088
I have literally no idea where after Larry's getting this 250000 un troops

2381
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:05,440
Being S3 from

2382
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:09,536
Every more than that I think the population of Cuba is like

2383
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,560
11 million

2384
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:17,216
Yasso 250000 80% profit yeah

2385
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,752
Bored

2386
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,520
It would be like

2387
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:25,664
Half of the population of the second largest city in in Cuba it's absurd to imagine

2388
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,456
But what are they doing

2389
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:33,856
According to the UN there are 11 un police officers are experts on missions in Cuba

2390
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:40,256
Jason is part of peacekeeping Missions

2391
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:43,328
Actually I misspoke there were 11 back in 27

2392
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,888
Okay well

2393
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:49,984
If Larry wanted to like have a higher number on our border than you should have gone with me

2394
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
Mexico

2395
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:52,288
But even they are

2396
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,056
30

2397
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:58,688
Do you want to not have troops in the way that Larry is making me audience

2398
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,456
Think

2399
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,504
They have peacekeeping forces their station

2400
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:06,880
Countries around the world with more being in countries that have greater unrest unless in relatively stable

2401
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,720
A lot of what they're there for is monitoring

2402
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:12,256
Not actually

2403
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,024
Engaging

2404
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,816
I made it through there also to

2405
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,376
Assist to be country's existing power

2406
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:21,728
Currently there aren't even 250000 un peacekeeping

2407
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:23,776
Troops in the entire world

2408
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,568
Not even half of that there

2409
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:28,640
The current latest tally is just over 100,000

2410
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,432
They're spread out everywhere

2411
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,200
In about 40

2412
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:34,784
2000 of them are not even uniformed individuals yes just civilian

2413
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:35,552
Yeah

2414
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:38,368
I tried to look up where this information was coming from

2415
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:43,744
The only other place I can find a reported was a YouTube show called The Common Sense Show

2416
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:48,608
Which is hosted by guy sitting at a desk and has American flag there and a cactus

2417
01:55:48,864 --> 01:55:50,912
His name is Harry lickle

2418
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:53,984
Don't know why he's got Cactus but

2419
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,264
Isaac actor alright

2420
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:56,800
So he's interviewing guy name

2421
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,568
Paul Martin

2422
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,616
Who tells him without citing any source

2423
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,920
But there's 250000 un troops

2424
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
Cuba

2425
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:06,016
The host decides that the most likely reason there there is

2426
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,552
Planning a jailbreak

2427
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,600
The free the terrorists being held in Guam

2428
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:16,000
I don't think you need 250,000 to Weekender Guantanamo

2429
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:22,400
I'm sure he imagines that it's like a full prison with an entire Army in it but he must be forgetting that Obama kept trying to close

2430
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,424
Who is the Detention Center

2431
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,728
And that led to their only being 40 people.

2432
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,496
They're currently

2433
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:29,056
And honestly if he's imaginary un troops

2434
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,336
Planning anything I would say

2435
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:34,176
Finishing the job of shutting down Guantanamo which Trump is refused to do

2436
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:36,736
That's not the worst thing they could do

2437
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,528
Also I feel like you could probably

2438
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,088
Do a successful jailbreak there with like

2439
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,904
10 guys and a montage

2440
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,512
I have no idea who Paul Martin is

2441
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:52,352
I have no idea who the host of the show is or why you're the cactus on his desk

2442
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:56,448
But I heard this show and I thought well this must be where Larry is getting his info from

2443
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,544
It's complete bulshit but his version matches up exactly what was being done

2444
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,568
Just got done the show

2445
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:08,480
Listen to little bit longer and they make clear that their source for this information is Larry Nichols

2446
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:13,856
It's a circle time is it

2447
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,136
Time is a flat

2448
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:18,208
They treat him as a credible Source but the host does ass

2449
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:24,608
Quote did he say where he got this information from to which Paul Barton replies no he did not

2450
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:27,168
He knows a lot of people

2451
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:29,728
Exactly 250,000 people

2452
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:33,312
Business libel individuals is a classic Larry Nichols trick

2453
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,872
Cross-pollinated right-wing media

2454
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:42,528
He's so stories in various places coming through various mouthpieces to create the illusion of a reality behind his story

2455
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:45,600
There's not 250000 un troops in

2456
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:48,416
Cuba but you'll see the story being reported in Baltic

2457
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:50,720
Full dum dum right-wing media Outlets because he

2458
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:51,488
You made it up

2459
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,512
And told all of them

2460
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:56,352
He comes from the days of like the old-school what do you plant

2461
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:01,216
Stories that like tabloids and that helps to reinforce

2462
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:03,008
What you put in this one is back

2463
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:04,288
Buy this one

2464
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:08,896
Even though you are the same

2465
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,176
Anyway

2466
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:15,296
Kind of how I know all these people are f****** liars and they know it

2467
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:18,624
Larry Nichols has been wrong about pretty much everything he's ever said

2468
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:22,976
He's been a terrible repeatedly discredit source for information

2469
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:23,744
Concentra the 9th

2470
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,024
Babies to the present day

2471
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,840
He said Obama was going to suspend the 2016 election

2472
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:29,120
We could remain president

2473
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:31,936
Then declare America a Muslim Nation to make himself

2474
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,960
The king of Islam

2475
01:58:33,216 --> 01:58:39,360
And he was being abetted by Congress cuz it all gets become dukes and duchesses when he made his move right

2476
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,896
That was some completely unsourced

2477
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:43,456
Clearly made up bulshit these hosts

2478
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:46,272
Eat it up and treat him like he's got a Hall of Fame batting a

2479
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:49,600
They know what they're doing they know he's full of s*** but they just

2480
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,624
Like the kind of shity

2481
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,672
There's something

2482
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,696
Is all natural

2483
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,976
I just another hoax

2484
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,512
Hilarious come up with

2485
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,536
Cuz he's a board

2486
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,304
Psychopath

2487
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,864
Yeah that sounds about right

2488
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,424
God can you can you imagine if the UN even

2489
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,192
And had to endure

2490
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:08,544
Well it's people would lose their s***

2491
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,080
Opposed

2492
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:14,432
And actually 250,000 was a number that was suggested

2493
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:16,736
In the past when they have tried to make

2494
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,272
These moves

2495
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,808
It's never half

2496
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:23,392
No because people would lose their right but the fact that

2497
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:29,792
It's been suggested is what Larry can fall back on when he's trying to spare his client

2498
01:59:30,304 --> 01:59:30,816
You think they did

2499
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:31,840
Actually make it

2500
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:34,144
Sure that that

2501
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:35,168
We didn't find what

2502
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:39,776
So I meet that that would be where he falls back to if pushed on it

2503
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:42,848
And I think that's the reason that uses the number 200

2504
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,640
50000

2505
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:47,712
We talked to him I believe what he would fall back on his

2506
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:51,040
You can believe what you want to believe and I'll believe what I want to believe him

2507
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
Mine happens to

2508
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,368
That is probably also

2509
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,696
So here's how it sends the show and I think it's

2510
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,720
A bit grim

2511
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,280
And I can tell you the people in Kauai

2512
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:02,048
The people in

2513
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:04,096
Areas of

2514
02:00:04,608 --> 02:00:07,424
Pacific other people and places like Tasmania

2515
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,216
These are the people like that globally

2516
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:11,264
To apply to their readout

2517
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:15,616
What they were supposed to already have the robot fortresses automate

2518
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,408
Security

2519
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:23,552
You know the guy that comes to do maintenance on their underground bunkers. Down pouring bleach down it

2520
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:33,024
Hot down the ones that are left that rattles I'm not

2521
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:41,984
5%

2522
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:52,736
That sucks I mean it's just becoming kind of

2523
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:57,344
Standard for him to make these like you're all dead if you don't back off

2524
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,648
Kind of it's much more consist

2525
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:01,952
It's pretty it's pretty regular and it doesn't

2526
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,512
It doesn't feel good

2527
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,280
Hey

2528
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,560
Don't make me kill

2529
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:07,840
I don't want to do

2530
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:09,632
I don't feel good about murdering

2531
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:12,192
Bring you a be terrible but I have to murder you

2532
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:15,264
Because you're doing something that I imagine is real even though

2533
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:20,640
Well now you're going to talk me but people I talk to whoever killed it

2534
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,456
They would never use them because all right wing

2535
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:25,248
Alright Wing murders are false

2536
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:29,088
Right there is at 2

2537
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:32,160
Some globalist redoubt is flooded with chlorine

2538
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,464
Absolutely

2539
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:37,536
Absolutely where does this fit in with his

2540
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,560
Pre-post riprap

2541
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:42,144
Unclear of all human life

2542
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:44,192
Including the globalist who caused the human

2543
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,008
Is that part of the trip probably okay

2544
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:53,408
So Alex very heavily promoted on this December 6th episode that he was going to break this big news about the microchip

2545
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,688
Keeping up the homeless population

2546
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:58,784
He's planning to have a surgery where they remove one from a person on air

2547
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:01,600
Obviously I had to check out the show

2548
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,904
From hell yeah hell yeah

2549
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:04,928
You cannot knock

2550
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,232
No they read be irresponsible

2551
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:09,792
It might surprise you to learn that Alex never

2552
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:10,560
Forgot to that big

2553
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,328
I don't

2554
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:12,608
He totally could have

2555
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,680
He spent almost the entire show on the 10th

2556
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:16,704
Calls

2557
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:20,544
What are you saying you was going to do was a very high preparation presentation

2558
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:23,616
And what he delivered with something that requires literally

2559
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:24,896
No preparation

2560
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,176
What a surprise

2561
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:31,296
I generally just listen to these episodes since watching Alex really annoys me

2562
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:34,624
Menow his facial gestures alternate between the smug

2563
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:35,648
Dissension in

2564
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:37,696
Sweetly tragic deflation

2565
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:40,000
And I find it really uncomfortable to watch

2566
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:43,072
Adding to that the way he just can't sit still

2567
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:44,608
They just visually

2568
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:47,424
Pleasant thing to to watch that I usually just listen

2569
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:50,752
However I'm glad I tuned into this show on video

2570
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:52,288
Because it's Christmas season

2571
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,616
So he's updated the big video backdrop screens behind them

2572
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:58,176
The one who is left is a big fireplace

2573
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:58,944
Very quaint

2574
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:02,528
I think the one that's directly behind him misses the mark a little bit

2575
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:05,600
That though it's just a Santa hanging from it

2576
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,392
That would be Autumn brand

2577
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:09,696
It's a nighttime shot of a snoke

2578
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,464
Mountain top

2579
02:03:10,976 --> 02:03:12,512
With a constant trickle

2580
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,304
Snow slowly falling

2581
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,352
Space to Serene

2582
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:20,704
When is juxtaposed with Alex wiggling around desperately trying to lie

2583
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,008
Well his face is just screaming to feet

2584
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,080
It looks like it's freezing

2585
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:31,456
You've got the fireplace right they're just trying to survive

2586
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:33,760
Suppose with Amad desperation

2587
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,784
Just varies

2588
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,808
Bizarre

2589
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:39,136
There's a scratch on the eye when he shows where Alex is trying to

2590
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:45,280
The claim that the media was reporting the Owen Shroyer had yelled about lynching Obama when he disrupted the impeachment hearing

2591
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:48,352
It's very clear that they were reporting that he disrupted the

2592
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,120
Impeachment hearing

2593
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:51,424
And had previously on air said that

2594
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:53,472
He belongs in Guantanamo Bay

2595
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:58,848
I mean look I'm not saying this should happen but Barack Obama you know find the tallest tree in a row

2596
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,200
It would be pointless to put them in Guantanamo Bay we already know there's 200

2597
02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:04,224
50 un troops

2598
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:07,296
That's what the

2599
02:04:07,552 --> 02:04:08,320
Waiting for God

2600
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,112
Alex is trying to

2601
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,160
Pretended it media is saying that

2602
02:04:12,416 --> 02:04:16,000
He said a few things about Obama when he disrupted

2603
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:16,768
Clear

2604
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:20,096
Yeah Alex's face as he's trying

2605
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:22,144
Find a thread this needle is really sad

2606
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:24,960
You can see the recognition in his face that there's

2607
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:26,752
Heap of Owen Shroyer saying those

2608
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,288
You can see him

2609
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:31,360
Fully aware that if any of his listeners actually read the articles

2610
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,128
Exciting in life

2611
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
Vanity Fair salon

2612
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,760
The see that Alex is lying about what they're claiming about Owens disruption of the

2613
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,784
The preceding

2614
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:42,880
You can see him flailing you can see in his eyes that the gears are moving

2615
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:46,464
But they're fully aware that it doesn't matter if the gears move

2616
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,512
He's spinning plates for no reason

2617
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:51,840
And it's all falling snow behind him makes the Tableau more

2618
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:52,608
Profoundly Dupree

2619
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:59,008
And there's no that's not even saying anything about how bad the Optics are when he's rambling about how you should buy his dumb pills

2620
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,568
Because shopping anywhere else is giving money to Satan

2621
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:03,872
Are the snow slowly fall

2622
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,664
Very weird

2623
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,736
So he doesn't get to his big story cuz there is no big

2624
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:09,504
Big story

2625
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:13,344
I went back and checked his Saturday Sunday and Monday shows to be sure and

2626
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:16,416
Nope knowing show in studio surgeries

2627
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,696
No big bombshells

2628
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,976
I'll just hype for nothing

2629
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,512
On the 6th

2630
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:22,560
Alex who sang they had everything confirm

2631
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:23,840
Add all the footage

2632
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:25,376
The interviews they have the doc

2633
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,448
He set a date for the breaking of this big story

2634
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:30,240
F****** way

2635
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,568
You had 5 days to smooth out the edges

2636
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:37,408
Seems like it was just a matter it's using a filling out Hippa form

2637
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
That doesn't take long

2638
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,992
It couldn't be more obvious what happened

2639
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,552
Alex thought this kind of publicity

2640
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:45,856
Restart was going to be a good option for him to get a tent

2641
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:52,000
Owen Shroyer disrupted the impeachment inquiry which was a way more potent option for free press

2642
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:56,096
I just ran with that completely forgot that he promised a big reveal this bombshell

2643
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,888
It would bring down the f****** blah blah

2644
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:03,008
I don't know maybe he had to push it back cuz he couldn't get that Hippa form so it was sorted out

2645
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:07,872
Recording this on Wednesday so I have no idea if he finally took down the globalist on Wednesday show

2646
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,896
One day late

2647
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:09,664
I guess we'll have to see

2648
02:06:10,688 --> 02:06:12,480
I want to leave things on here

2649
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:15,808
It's been a long time since I've watched Alex's show

2650
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:17,088
And he absolutely doesn't look

2651
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,112
Same as I remember

2652
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:23,744
It's not about his beard or the weight fluctuations that happened in fact I would say you look slimmer than I remember

2653
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:24,768
But he looks

2654
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,536
Crushed

2655
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:28,864
Even when he was ranting about winning his eyes are Hollow and

2656
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:31,168
Is facial gestures come often

2657
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:31,936
Contrived

2658
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,216
He's constantly looking at the

2659
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:36,032
So he knows how long he has until he needs

2660
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:36,800
The Dismount from

2661
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:37,824
Current nonsense

2662
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:40,384
So I have time to get an ad in before the commercial break

2663
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:43,200
His anger reads more like frustration

2664
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:46,016
His rants about the evil globalist take

2665
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:49,600
Trying to take him down now see more sincere

2666
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:52,160
We're only when he's yelling about how you have to take the

2667
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,976
You know like around the office

2668
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:57,792
Rio Vista

2669
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:01,632
Adding visual component is

2670
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,448
Yeah

2671
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,728
There's one thing that's too

2672
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,752
Stuck out to me the most

2673
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:08,800
In these other days of shows

2674
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,080
Was from his Sunday show

2675
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,616
Where is responding to

2676
02:07:11,872 --> 02:07:14,688
The part in Josh Owens article where he says that Alex called him

2677
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:16,224
And said that you wants to

2678
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:20,576
I wanted to quit doing a show

2679
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,904
I may have to quit

2680
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:25,696
Just because I can't handle

2681
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,720
Caring this much

2682
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,512
And I see everything

2683
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,096
Just reaching a point where I

2684
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,120
Can't do it

2685
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,216
Every little point

2686
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:38,496
Every article

2687
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:40,288
Another article

2688
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:44,384
Everybody put out I can pull up a whole system otherwise

2689
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:48,224
How they cooked up the decision

2690
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:54,624
7 years later the reason some white paper got a report about a committee meeting and they say exactly what I am

2691
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:57,952
Vision word-for-word in the meetings I knew was going on

2692
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:00,768
I've studied them so much

2693
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,840
And how evil they are that I'm inside their head

2694
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:05,888
They're inside mine I can't stand

2695
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:12,800
That's just f****** absurd wow Alex hasn't studied Global is so closely that he's in their heads and can predict their every move

2696
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:17,920
Move even read any of the Articles you can claim they can connect with 1,000 other articles

2697
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:22,016
Expect anyone to give him credit for psychic level scholarship about a secret group

2698
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:23,040
Runs the world

2699
02:08:23,296 --> 02:08:24,576
Best childish it

2700
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:26,368
The f*** out of here with that

2701
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:28,416
You just a propagandist who realizes it

2702
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:32,256
The time is up and the desperate way for him to go out looking good is

2703
02:08:32,512 --> 02:08:33,792
In the case that happen

2704
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:36,608
He's no Bill Cooper so he's not going out like that

2705
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:40,192
Do you knows everyone's laughing at David Icke sweet like going down that path either

2706
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:44,544
The way he's making it sound here he's preparing for people people

2707
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:47,616
For him to be the one world government conspiracy version

2708
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:53,248
That 45 year old is at the bar talking about his Glory Days playing High School football now we could have made the end

2709
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
NFL

2710
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,552
You can hear resignation

2711
02:08:55,808 --> 02:08:57,856
But an insistence that everyone know

2712
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:59,392
But even if he gives up

2713
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,672
He knows everything

2714
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:02,208
He could have stopped the globalist

2715
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:04,512
If only people I bought more of his pills

2716
02:09:05,024 --> 02:09:06,304
If you would have been allowed on Facebook

2717
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:07,328
Yep

2718
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:10,400
That's amazing to Dupree a justification for like

2719
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:13,216
It is this is all going to go

2720
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:16,800
You know what I just can't handle the burden

2721
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:18,848
Of being the person who

2722
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:19,616
Can win

2723
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,968
I heard that music This is

2724
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:29,088
Bummer no this is slowly falling snow behind

2725
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:31,648
He's a

2726
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,416
Fragile little

2727
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:36,512
Really it's really paper thin

2728
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,280
It's

2729
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,304
It's just like

2730
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,376
It went when the

2731
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,912
When the kid was having a

2732
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
Tantrum

2733
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:44,960
Was so loud and boys

2734
02:09:45,984 --> 02:09:47,264
Build this adult man

2735
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,056
Dancebody you're like

2736
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:51,104
Fun and scary and now you see just

2737
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,640
The very small 12 year old boy

2738
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,664
Who can't see

2739
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,432
Sit still

2740
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:56,992
Who is afraid of anything that's

2741
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,296
Who can't handle

2742
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:01,344
The idea of masculinity being

2743
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:02,880
Different than his own

2744
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:09,536
And who is dealing with the disillusionment of this cycle

2745
02:10:09,792 --> 02:10:15,936
Sort of Father Figure in Trump who would protect him and thought he would bring about all of the

2746
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:22,336
Things that he right now he's going to get me a pony or whatever

2747
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:27,968
Pony in the form of kicking out all the immigrants

2748
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:31,040
Disillusion that that isn't coming

2749
02:10:31,296 --> 02:10:32,832
And not only is it not coming

2750
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,368
I'm not even going to protect

2751
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,160
Do you know what you having this

2752
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:36,928
Crisis

2753
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,768
Everything you saying is not 7:50

2754
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:42,304
Proofing it all in

2755
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:46,912
Yeah there is no in-studio surgery that he's promised right

2756
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:52,032
Wouldn't be surprised if this was so reminiscent of when he

2757
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:53,568
He was 12 and his dad's like

2758
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:58,944
Take over and they're going to kill all of us that happened and then

2759
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:02,528
Yeah I mean you know it's it certainly

2760
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,088
Narratively seems pasa

2761
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:08,160
I wouldn't want to speculate on that just because it feels like

2762
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:09,184
You know

2763
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:14,304
Personal we have no idea where it is going to be Rosebud

2764
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:17,632
That's all I'm saying

2765
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,680
Creative nonfiction story

2766
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,472
Follow that path

2767
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:23,520
But it may or may not be true

2768
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:26,848
Anyway I just I mean this present day is

2769
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,432
Is getting weird this show is crazy

2770
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:32,224
Love

2771
02:11:32,736 --> 02:11:35,552
The stop where he's talking about how orgies are man

2772
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:37,600
Like

2773
02:11:37,856 --> 02:11:40,160
I would probably listen to

2774
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:42,464
I show it if it was all that

2775
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:48,864
Alex getting into like being Tom Leykis I would like to know exactly where he stay

2776
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,448
Hands-On all kinds of s*** like that like a polyamorous relationship

2777
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:58,848
Don't know no more than one dude or a bunch of dudes and a bunch of ladies can't do the other way around you imagine

2778
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:01,152
Jerome is fine but not the reverse

2779
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:02,176
Is this all falls

2780
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,712
Alex starts doing what

2781
02:12:04,736 --> 02:12:07,808
I love linetype shell that would be amazing

2782
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:09,344
Jerry Kids

2783
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,136
Terrible advice

2784
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:14,720
You don't even need to ask where I stand on pegging I'll tell you that right

2785
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:17,024
Not manly

2786
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:18,816
Also I love it but

2787
02:12:19,328 --> 02:12:22,912
I like that silver stuff is so insane until out-of-state

2788
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,680
That was what he

2789
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,216
Thinks his show is

2790
02:12:25,472 --> 02:12:27,776
Find a kind of

2791
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:30,336
I find that kind of delightful

2792
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:32,128
On some level even though it is

2793
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,408
Gross

2794
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:38,528
Batman when you got a show in a situation where he's building this

2795
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:40,320
Stuff about the like

2796
02:12:41,344 --> 02:12:42,368
Got this out of a guy's arm

2797
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:44,416
It's just such a bust

2798
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:47,488
I can handle that too

2799
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:48,768
Like in the present-day I can

2800
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:50,560
That's that's fun

2801
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:53,632
That's good fun shouldn't be allowed to do

2802
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,448
If you are

2803
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:59,520
Violating chekhov's

2804
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:01,568
One big rule

2805
02:13:01,824 --> 02:13:02,336
Oh yeah yeah

2806
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:05,408
Especially the way that that Tuesday show was just

2807
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:06,432
Taking calls

2808
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,736
Disrespect

2809
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:11,296
If you if you have a gun on the mantelpiece

2810
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:13,600
Then leave that girl alone it's scary

2811
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:15,904
Jones's

2812
02:13:16,416 --> 02:13:18,976
Yeah so we'll see what happens we'll be back on Monday

2813
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:21,024

Not just going to be covering the present-day stuff just wanted

2815
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:25,888
To get back up to

2817
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:32,032
This week just in case he does that serve
