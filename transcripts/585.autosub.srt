Along those lines

18
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:47,008
One of the things I didn't do last time but I decided to do this time was I wanted to keep track of where I'm sending them to like

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,800
States and countries in

20
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
And just for fun

21
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Just because I was curious

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,456
And we officially now have sent button

23
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:00,320

Oh that's cool do you think the whole that was really the last one was

25
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
You know I want to say

26
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
You know it seems like it would be obvious that it's like Alaska or Hawaii but I feel like the real answer is Utah

27
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
No you told me that you said the number of buttons

28
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Alright

29
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712

Peoples in the middle Idaho

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
At this point there are two states

32
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
With only one

33
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
2 States with only one

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,448

44
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,704
I would be more fun if you said

45
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
Something like their butt

46
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
Is it all 50 countries

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,104
He said those are the ones we recognize beyond that no more buttons

48
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:33,760
Definitely more countries than I would have expected also

49
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
What is the best country

50
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
Supposed supposed to answer that

51
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,976
It's just a fun Quest

52
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
You like total numbers of

53
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
People

54
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,424
That's certainly where the most of the buttons are gone

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,216
Internationally

56
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:00,384
My bright spot then is going to go with a double Brightside cuz I got a real short one

57
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,112
It's where you stay up till 3:30 playing Mortal Kombat together

58
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:16,512
Oh Wonder

59
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
Middle School

60
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
Exactly and it felt so good to just do that again you know just to be that kind of person

61
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,263
Is it a situation where one of you was winning every match

62
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,359
No, we played the story mode and we just kind of

63
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,199
Switch controllers that you know that way you don't have any hard

64
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,783
Feeling Jersey game that was like

65
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,623
Mortal Kombat but you could play was like a two-player thing

66
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
Like you run around and you would do that one that almost like a platformer I think so remember he's out there

67
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935

Some people might say hey

121
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:31,071
You're doing a sneaky snake episode here on Wednesday and I think it's essential that we do

122
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,119
Cuz today is the dreaded

123
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,703

That Marshal office

126
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
One of the things that I kind of thought was that like you knows

127
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
The trip to the FEMA camp is probably going to be like an hour and a half for most people

128
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,623

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023

00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,399
It's going to be a long drive for a while

132
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,263
Figured it'd be good to have some new content for books to enjoy

133
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Fat boarding

134
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,991

171
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,999
Maybe not like Compassion or at

00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
One of the largest newspapers in Germany

186
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,775
The largest regional newspaper

187
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
3 German states

188
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,127
Weather headline

189
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
That the largest

190
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Medical Union

191
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,759
In Germany

192
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
The pathologist Union the corner Union

193
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Gals know what kill

194
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,791
40% of the dead people

195
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
That they're seeing I've been killed by the vaccine

196
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,447
And then it's eating or body switch all the studies show it would do

197
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Oh boy

198
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,031
Alright

199
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
This story is not about some pathologist

200
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,175
Union and Germany although I do love how Alex always is like

201
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,319
Whatever newspaper he's talking about his biggest newspaper in Germany

202
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,439
It's everything they say is right on this is about one pathologist named Peter Schumacher

203
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,791
Who's coming out with some concerns about that that's after vaccination Maybe

204
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Under-counter

205
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,607
Hamburg Germany to do further work assassin

206
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Cause of death for both covid related deaths

207
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
And people who died after vaccination

208
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:28,543
Schumacher estimates that 30 to 40% of the

209
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,895
40 people who died after being vaccinated who have gotten autopsies quote

210
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Died from the vaccination

211
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,759
But this is absolutely not an opinion that shared by other

212
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,623
According to the underlying primary source article from osterberger almanyam

213
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
The federal Association of German

214
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Pathologist

215
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
Did not actually agree with your markers opinion

216
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,303
But encourage more autopsies

217
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Spectrum

218
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,471
You know you were the reasons it is because that's the only way that you can disprove or prove any

219
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,263
Conclusion or any claim

220
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:00,031
Such as this

221
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,823
So they're finding was

222
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
It's fine Devin

223
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,919
Johann Friedman the head of the autopsy work

224
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,735
Working group of the Pathologists Union

225
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,039
Federal Association for German pathologist

226
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
You don't know anything yet

227
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,159
Yeah that sounds about right

228
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,951
Other groups like people are licking

229
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,023
Institute and other German doctors who were interviewed did not

230
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,303
Share schirmacher is

231
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:29,727
This isn't interesting perspective that your marker is bringing up but at this point it's not based on any hard data or prove so it's not something that should be

232
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Reported as fact

233
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,799
But Alex is doing is actually worse

234
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
He's not just assuming sure baugher's position is correct

235
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,711
He's embellishing on it and exaggerated exaggerating it.

236
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:41,759
A completely fictitious headline

237
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:42,783
How to report

238
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
To guide the coverage

239
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
Today's Show

240
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Yeah that's

241
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,671
Actually gets way more fun later holy

242
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:52,767
I can't wait for you to see where this goes

243
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
If your

244
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
Contention is that 30%

245
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Of

246
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
40 people who died

247
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,423
Died of

248
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
The vaccines

249
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Specifically

250
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Then

251
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,311
He's making an estimate

252
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
Right right

253
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
But I mean

254
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
You put the numbers across there there been

255
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
A lot of people backs

256
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,527
Trueno so

257
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Those numbers would

258
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,599
Suggest we would see

259
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,159
Apatis

260
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,791
Being carried around with bring out your dead signs yes

261
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,071
That's kind of number is

262
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,191
It seems like a number that would be really difficult to extrapolate to larger populations

263
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,471
Is true

264
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,591
Would probably mean that this select group of people have something about them

265
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,895
Write that would make them

266
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
Allergic to the vaccine or something or the estimation is incorrect

267
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,367
There's an others of variable that's being missed

268
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,135
Something

269
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
And that's why I think

270
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:56,255
That's certainly this person isn't from everything I can

271
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,815
Yeah some crazy person

272
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,935
But the the perspective that he's bringing is something that needs more examination before you can really

273
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:04,959
Really yeah

274
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,519
Take it ride

275
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Like different

276
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,919
Skipping that step

277
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
Save it at the most prestigious paper in the world and this guy is one of the best

278
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,087
Yeah it's important to remember that it does not matter at all what it it like

279
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:26,463
The guy could have come out and said like I think 30% of the people died of the vaccine specifically

280
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:29,535
However I will admit the 40 stab wounds and each

281
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,303
Was it

282
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,351
Contributing factor Alex was it will be like

283
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Kelly people comorbidity

284
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:42,335
Article to talk about today he also came across a bill

285
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,431
Was in the bill Friday evening

286
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,039
Promise my wife and family I was not going to come to work on Saturday

287
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,599
Given the Saturday crew the day off

288
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
That didn't happen.

289
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,927
4 Hour forts

290
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,999
When I saw this on Friday I had to come in

291
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,791
Responsibility

292
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
I'm an accessory to murder

293
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,519
You're an accomplished what I came in

294
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,687
Is the infrastructure bill

295
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
They found the enforcer

296
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
Thousands of page-long infrastructure to help

297
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:26,879
But he hasn't read

298
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
No no no

299
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,207
Yeah that sounds more

300
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
More accurate

301
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
So we'll get to his take on that but before we do

302
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,167
There are some things that are actually causes for celebration in my life

303
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
Okay one of them is

304
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,519
When Alex

305
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:46,591
Has a new song that he likes to rant over

306
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,943
Whenever we discovered you belong to the city and Alex's amazing day

307
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
I think that there's a new contender in

308
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,807
In the clubhouse for another song

309
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
No

310
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:03,743
Angle my friend evil will fail

311
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
Slowly building power

312
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,239
There's a great Flash

313
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,591
Asteroid

314
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,431
Rolike poison Prion

315
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
That's once again

316
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Until the break

317
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,087
What are universes

318
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,951
Minions in prison

319
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
One with God

320
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Amazing

321
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,375
What is it about heaven and 80s

322
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Inspired Bob

323
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,703
That just makes you like it works

324
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:50,079
Like I mean I want him to why isn't he talking over Fascination Street

325
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,615
The Cure is his

326
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,199
F****** Zone man I feel like it must take him back

327
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:59,551
To like the blow Hardy Daisy 1213

328
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,927
Pontificating to your friends over there at the radio hit

329
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,047
I enjoy quite a bit

330
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
Pop Plus

331
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,095
Alex's

332
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
Weird I just like autocrat

333
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,519
Jeff compilation

334
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,359
Commercials that you can like that at 2 in the morning

335
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,895
Always with you

336
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:31,295
Crazy like every time he should just have one of those can you believe that all of these hats are together as one

337
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:36,415
If you believe I think I talked one of those commercials

338
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,743
Recently and it blew my mind because

339
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
Dude

340
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,399
Technology once I get

341
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,423
Back then

342
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,727
How are you going to get all these songs

343
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:54,591
All-in-one place now it makes sense

344
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,127
Tape to CD

345
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,151
Very exciting

346
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
$0.01 for $0.01 for 10 CDs there's no way this will come back and I thought that that went away

347
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
People still can't

348
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,439
Directions

349
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Swing of the internet

350
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
It will bring us all together

351
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
And apparently that will lead to the

352
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
The singularity

353
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,399
That's not the singularity that Alex is talking about in his neck

354
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,423
Text clip I think it's

355
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Just the devil

356
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,031
Broadcast then just to say it upfront

357
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:30,175
Everyday

358
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Singularity

359
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Everything

360
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Become an instant everything

361
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,903
That's Titanfall singularity

362
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
What

363
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
What's Singularity of

364
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
Evil

365
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,607
Evil has taken completely over and is operating on all cylinders

366
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Assault

367
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Everything

368
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,471
In creation and trying to overturn logic

369
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,519
I just common sense because that is it odd

370
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,799
I would have Carson

371
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
Mechanic

372
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:03,967
So there's three singularities here there's a lot of talk about

373
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,759
The futurist version that

374
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:09,343
Is what we understand as the singularity

375
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,367
The devils

376
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:12,671
Fake version of God's real

377
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
Singularity

378
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
Different version

379
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,535
There's a third one

380
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Just talkin about

381
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,375
And that is the evil is banging on all cylinders

382
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,399
And destroying Lodge

383
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Jake or something

384
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,191
You know Dion

385
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:25,983
Words

386
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Words

387
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,543
Words words words

388
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
The word

389
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Itself

390
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Defeats

391
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
His conversation

392
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Sing

393
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
You Larry single single

394
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:50,815
Clarity X

395
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:51,839
Singularity

396
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:56,703
Go back to Germany now I am here's here's how the story is developing

397
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:01,055
So let me tell you what's coming up on this live Sunday transmission

398
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:07,455
First off the largest German pathology Union

399
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,735
One guy

400
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,015
That's corners

401
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
People study disease

402
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:15,647
Oscar single dude

403
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,744
That come out and said months ago the vaccines are vaccines are killing people

404
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Didn't say that

405
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
Right now

406
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,192
Some months ago they came out and said a vaccines you got to stop

407
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,544
And now is the time to bring that knowledge to life

408
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:34,336
Ridiculous

409
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
Breaking news

410
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,408
So apparently everybody

411
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,688
Who's

412
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,968
They're getting covid

413
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,736
They're all blacks

414
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
This is sort of the essential shell game that's being played by people like Alex and a lot of the right-wing media

415
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
It is as

416
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:54,304
As greater numbers of people are vaccinated a higher proportion of people who get sick

417
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,120
Will inevitably also be vaccinated right

418
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,424
It is an unfortunate reality of

419
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,192
How

420
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
That's how it is but it's something that can be misrepresented and misused in order to create perception

421
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Oceans of like

422
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
Everybody who's got vaccinated is

423
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,272
He's getting sick and that's just absolutely not the case

424
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,320
Describe this is

425
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,856
Is really actually kind of funny

426
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
You have to understand that he just makes up

427
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Like

428
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
Listen to this

429
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,048
If I get a national reports of 95 to

430
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,352
Israel in 95

431
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,936
Australia it's 99 and Indian

432
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,728
Other countries

433
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,896
Chili's only 20-something percent

434
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:50,112
23% of Australia as of this morning Ice Age been inject

435
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,000
99.9 per cent there's one person in

436
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Australia

437
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,608
Can a hospital tested positive for covid

438
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,912
Batman shot

439
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,264
One person one man alone

440
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,544
Fighting against

441
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,152
Thanks to the tyranny of not having the disease everybody else

442
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,760
Is vaccinated and they got sick except for one guy there's just one example

443
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,528
Only one

444
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,552
I don't

445
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,112
Show any proof of this

446
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:29,792
Just one guy you know how you know how you can be confident it's just one guy because in a continent and

447
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,840
Country filled with millions of people

448
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,960
Rampaging pandemic always just one guy

449
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:42,080
Yeah and I'm like yeah in a New South Wales there is a bit of

450
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
Bit of a resurgence

451
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,408
Yeah little bit of an outbreak going on

452
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,944
What are the reason

453
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,736
If you read about the articles

454
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
But there's one of the reasons that people cite

455
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:53,088
This being

456
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,624
You know what what

457
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
Contributing factors let's say

458
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,000
Is it Australian had a difficult time with the vaccine rollout

459
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:02,560
They've had supply shortages they've had

460
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:06,656
Under performance in terms of local manufacturing of the vaccine

461
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,960
So there is there's a number of issues that have

462
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
Slowed vaccine

463
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,032
Coverage

464
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,336
In Australia

465
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,968
Everything I can tell literally the opposite of what Alex's Hangout

466
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
But button

467
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:22,784
Itsfunneh

468
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
It's just so frustrating that they can use

469
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
That

470
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
Bypass of that emotional just respond

471
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
Lots of just like that lives are stupid

472
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Because if

473
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,328
If you could stop for one second if you're on the right then

474
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Can you confuse

475
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,120
To be like

476
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,424
Okay at the beginning of the pandemic

477
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,448
They said it was

478
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Going to kill all of us

479
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,032
Then they said it wasn't going to kill anybody

480
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,360
Then they said it was going to kill some people

481
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
But it was fake

482
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,432
And then they gave us the vaccine

483
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
And now the vaccine is killing people

484
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
But then

485
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:58,624
Now that people with the vaccine are contracted covid now the vaccine does

486
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,904
Do anything against

487
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
The people

488
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,696
With the covid

489
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Like

490
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
The Narrative has changed

491
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:09,632
And twisted around on itself so many times it has short. Of time it's hard to keep

492
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:12,192
Keep track of your heart

493
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:18,592
You forgot about that short. Of time where they were dipping their toes into is there even a

494
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
Didn't stick around too long

495
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
Did not work how can you not just look at that and be like okay

496
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
The other guys have said the same thing to her

497
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,952
Varying

498
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
Degrees of the same thing

499
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
And also cautious

500
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:39,072
Yeah

501
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:45,216
The fair amount of caveat of like this is a developing thing we don't really

502
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:49,824
Have all of the information when I made it to learning that information

503
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,104
Confirm

504
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
Repetition

505
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
It really is weird

506
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,808
I think that some of the messaging that's been done obviously by the Light

507
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,368
Like the normal media hasn't been ideal

508
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,184
Obviously other profit-driven to

509
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,280
But yeah the message world

510
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,352
Is absurd

511
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:17,472
Let's get to this little clip hereabouts talking about the infrastructure bill

512
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Thought

513
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
I'm usually tomorrow's news today

514
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Louisville

515
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:29,760
Talked about for months yesterday before but I had no idea I thought was just be

516
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Infrastructure plan

517
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:42,560
Has in it stops at when I read it in the bill I couldn't believe

518
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
My God

519
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:45,888
Okay

520
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
So

521
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,568
Breathalyzer

522
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,384
Assistance by law

523
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,408
I don't know

524
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
What

525
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,248
That's the Holy Grail

526
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,832
Always known this how is he not happy with this

527
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,672
Because he's so mad whenever people don't wear seat belt

528
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,208
He is a seatbelt

529
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,632
So this infrastructure Bill does include a requirement that the national highway traffic safety administration

530
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,704
And come up with rules to require alcohol monitoring monitoring system

531
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:21,984
In new cars

532
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:28,640
This is specified as a passive technology so it by definition wouldn't be a breathalyzer type thing

533
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,968
It seems like the sort of thing that this bill is

534
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,736
Disgusting

535
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,088
Really be feasible unless there were self-driving capabilities for all new cars

536
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,880
Since it would aim to quote

537
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
Passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle

538
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,280
The accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired

539
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,840
A a tour limit motor vehicle operation

540
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,376
If an impairment is detect

541
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,168
Is someone swerving

542
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:55,008
Great you've identified a possibly impaired driver but in that situation

543
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,568
It's not like the safest thing to do would be to shut off

544
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:58,336
The car

545
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,408
Figuring out exactly what to do is probably going to be

546
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Real challenge

547
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:09,600
I suspect the reason that the language in the bill is pretty vague and it's just about getting the highway traffic safety administration to come up with

548
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,184
Rules is because there isn't a definite solution ready to go right now

549
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,768
Maybe some of the Technologies are at the beginnings of being

550
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
Minnow on the way but they're not there

551
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:25,216
I'm not sure what Alex is talking about in terms of retina scanners but I imagine if that's real it has something

552
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Do it like me

553
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,752
Making car theft

554
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,520
More difficult

555
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
I imagine that I would have had the same like

556
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,640
Like concerned if it was like when they introduced

557
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
Kyiv

558
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
But what

559
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,952
I think these types of bills that are over like a cow

560
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,720
Open pages long

561
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,024
. that seems off-topic sometimes

562
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Kind of worst

563
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,912
At best they seem an efficient and it worse the way they cover these for ranging topic

564
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Excuse the appearance

565
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,496
Do politicians trying to sneak things into bills that could

566
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,776
Couldn't pass otherwise saying

567
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,592
That's said I'm not sure if Alex's argument make

568
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,944
If this whole thing is about spying on you and your car and like having

569
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,968
Some kind of database

570
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:14,368
It doesn't really make sense that the bill also repeals the national driver registry advisory

571
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,464
Exactly counter to the conspiracy Alex's pitching

572
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,512
But whatever

573
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,536
Right

574
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,168
This is terrifying overwhelming government surveillance they're watching all of us but if you

575
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:31,776
Told any one of those people we're installing Jarvis into your car

576
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,592
And if you are drunk you walk in your car and you say Jarvis

577
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,920
I'm s***-faced drive me home every single person would be like

578
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:44,320
I want that in my car

579
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:46,368
Everybody would do that

580
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:52,768
Yeah if you could give it a character people would probably enjoy

581
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,864
Okay my retina Jarvis of course I will you're such a kind person

582
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,936
So here here's some more stuff from that bill that is

583
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Criticizing

584
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:13,760
Transgender singer in any bathroom I want with children you name it

585
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,832
Mendon feather women it doesn't matter

586
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
Everything else

587
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,928
Bornstein from there

588
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,768
That's an infrastructure bill that's just mad libs

589
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,048
Just throw it out yet

590
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
Spaghetti at the wall

591
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:35,520
I'm too or the ability to read that entire infrastructure Bill do some word searching

592
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,080
I will tell you that we're bathrooms not in it

593
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,712
No only time the word restroom comes up in the bill isn't a section about provide Grant

594
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,272
That's for gas stations that provide access to Electric

595
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
Charging state

596
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:47,808
That's great

597
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:51,136
But it turns out the bathroom

598
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
That's a consideration in terms of their ability to get a girl

599
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,512
Great

600
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,096
No I think I don't know what I'll just talk about

601
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
I think about Kaepernick

602
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
No

603
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,216
Weird

604
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,032
That Kaepernick is invention of the infrastructure bill

605
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Yeah

606
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:15,200
So it's kind of gave me the impression the Kaepernick was going to be very heavily and I think I was

607
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:19,552
Not a whole lot of analysis of the infrastructure bill

608
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Broadway button

609
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:25,696
Sure is that but that's because Alex is mad

610
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
Esau picture online

611
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,840
Obama dressed in a baby blue outfit with a big

612
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:33,888
Platinum chain around his neck

613
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
No no no he's an African god

614
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,408
Super spreader

615
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,992
Palpatine

616
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,832
Hollister

617
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
We got about strain

618
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:01,536
They want to stay lockdown and you should stay locked

619
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,960
North Korean style worship

620
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,752
True Jim Jones style worship

621
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:16,640
So I want to ask you a question about like if you hear clip like that what is the story that's even being cover

622
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:18,432
I mean I guess

623
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Yeah

624
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,760
Obama's an a****** for throwing a big ass party

625
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Congrats

626
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
It seems like that

627
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
The story

628
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
Seems like it would be with the news item

629
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
It's not

630
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,744
It might appear that the story is at the lives or hypocrite

631
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,792
I don't follow their own Public Health guidance

632
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:36,608
But really if you look at the way that this is being reported that

633
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
That's not the story either

634
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,472
The story as it's being presented by Alex is about how the left

635
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:46,592
Worships people like Obama and allows them to get away with the things that don't allow people like Alex or Trump

636
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
To get away with your

637
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:50,944
That's the story that's interesting to me

638
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,808
Hey don't forget it's also a story about how black men wear jewelry

639
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:02,208
And we need to fear ants African god or something. It's very important that we mention

640
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,560
That about Obama feel like later coverage of the story will get more racist but

641
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:13,216
The underlying story here is that there is a picture of Obama from his 60th birthday party that got released where he's dancing around without a man

642
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
Mask on

643
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,312
Obviously Alex can't be outraged that he's not wearing a mask

644
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Because Alex doesn't think anyone

645
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,408
Find a different Lane to attack

646
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:25,504
From apocracy angle that's more of a Fox News kind of ploy

647
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,272
Yeah that's kind of

648
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
Sweet tea

649
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,344
Second-hand suit

650
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,112
Criticism

651
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:33,184
Yeah let him have that I will say that everyone

652
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,488
On the left are cult members

653
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,816
Who want to be locked down to pick up Mama's special right

654
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
Yeah that's

655
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,656
Right right right

656
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:48,032
I think certainly the Optics of that are bad

657
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,408
Oh yeah I haven't having this party I think that there there's Fair criticism there

658
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,712
I think that Alex is

659
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,992
Being a little bit of a dick

660
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Yeah

661
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:01,344
I also think that there are marked differences between

662
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
This kind of

663
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Bad behavior perhaps

664
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,464
Sore Maybe

665
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,280
Unwise behavior and certainly bad

666
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Publix

667
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Responsibility

668
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:14,144
You do have a certain amount of responsibility

669
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,424
Republic when you've

670
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
You know your robot

671
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,032
Yeah I think there's a difference

672
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,104
Between that and the kind of irresponsible ship people like

673
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,128
Trump

674
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:24,896
Alex do

675
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,688
Around the virus

676
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,480
Around around public

677
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,808
Yeah that's why I refuse to even accept any kind of

678
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:32,832
False

679
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:34,112
Equivalent

680
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
Between the two

681
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:41,280
The bad faith argument I can say is that while still having some criticism

682
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
M4

683
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,328
The bad Optics

684
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
The unwise decision making

685
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
Having a party that doesn't follow

686
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,984
Right

687
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,264
Right right

688
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,312
Hey this guy's driving around

689
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,360
Swinging a baseball bat in people's mailbox

690
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,896
What an a******

691
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:57,664
That isn't

692
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,712
Exactly like Hitler

693
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:02,528
All right it's the same level of crime

694
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,552
Yeah it's

695
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
It's it's not difficult

696
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Quotes

697
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
They're not difficult

698
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:17,120
Thomas Jefferson Thomas Jefferson

699
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:22,752
Hello Institute quotes are difficult

700
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,360
Service here is Alex doing a doing one of the old

701
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,384
Sambuca

702
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,200
Thomas Jefferson famous by French reporter

703
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,272
What is the level of tyranny in which humans will except

704
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,808
Lee said the level

705
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,464
That's the level that people take us to

706
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
Lee said the level you will except

707
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,536
Very simple

708
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:46,304
Sounds right

709
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
Death of Frederick Douglass quotes

710
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:52,192
Do things that I want to bring into Focus here is

711
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,104
The way that Alex is telling a story he's now added a French reporter into it and famously this was

712
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
The reason that I think that this is important

713
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
Just craft this this year

714
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
French reporter in there

715
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,672
Speech at other point that yard sales around this don't matter

716
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:18,048
So you've already decided that you're going to erase a black man from history so you might as well add French

717
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,584
Hoverboard

718
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,864
I don't even think it's

719
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
Conscious on Alex's bar

720
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
He is

721
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,728
His politics would

722
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Erase

723
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,056
Frederick Douglass in favor of Thomas Jefferson

724
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
But I think that it's

725
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,872
Just that

726
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
He has this

727
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
Little bit of

728
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,480
Trivial grasp

729
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
To this this

730
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
That this kernel of information

731
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,904
Then he just wants to flush it out with details to make himself sound like more of an expert

732
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
That's all he does is like his version of quoting a

733
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:52,864
Exactly deadline Dash 1109b section 111

734
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
It's an act

735
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
I was it was

736
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,192
I think poor

737
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,264
Taste for him not to try and do an offensive Fred Jack

738
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Exactly

739
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,640
More headline

740
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,576
Becoming fauci says

741
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
In full FDA

742
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,488
Will inspire a flood of vaccine requirements

743
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
Play that next time cuz it's

744
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:29,216
It's not enough to just read the quote

745
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,496
I want to

746
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,800
I want you to hear it for yourself next time

747
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,248
Flutter vaccine requirements

748
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,904
These comments were very specifically about how after the FDA fully approve the covid vaccine you're likely to see a ton of

749
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,696
Any local level regarding vaccinations

750
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,256
This isn't him threatening mandates he's just

751
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,280
Just expressing the Sun

752
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:58,912
The many areas probably already want to put in local mandates but are reluctant to because full approval Azan

753
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Immigrant

754
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,592
In the same interview fauci said that further lockdowns were unlikely but I expect Alex is going to ignore that part seeing is that

755
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
Predicted that August 11th

756
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
Today if you're listening to this

757
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,224
The beginning of martial law

758
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,528
Weirdly hasn't come up on this episode yet

759
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:18,112
I wonder I wonder what Alex is thinking about that

760
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
It's it's so funny to me how many

761
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,208
How local restaurants

762
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
Can put in a vaccine mandate

763
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,280
And then immediately be like

764
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:29,120
Oh I also got rid of all the customers that I didn't like from before

765
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:35,520
Is that weird or also the assholes that I hated who came to my restaurant before I think it's real

766
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,312
Really strange to how like

767
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
People of Alex's politics

768
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,640
Don't believe

769
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
In like

770
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,432
The Civil Rights Act

771
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,784
You should be able to ban people from making their cake

772
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:51,136
Homosexual requirements your religion

773
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,536
No you can't have a vaccine the little strain

774
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,912
You can also tell by the exact wording that Alex is using there where he's getting this new story from

775
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,264
That headline is from a newt from a Nigerian Outlet called The Paradise

776
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,848
I switch is just reinterpreting a primary article from USA Today

777
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:15,712
The headline on the blog is far more Sensational enough Alex is going to tend to cover that

778
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
As opposed to the underlying actual article Which is less useful

779
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
For his purpose

780
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
Yo

781
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
You know it's fun to always like

782
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,160
Back

783
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,512
You're not reading the paradise.

784
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:30,048
Website

785
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,608
Get out of here

786
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,632
You had to put it back

787
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,168
Text through Google translate twice

788
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,960
It's okay you're not you're not reading

789
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:39,264
So what we got going on now

790
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,104
Is the culmination of like a century

791
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,896
Evil plan

792
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:47,200
The globalist

793
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
If they were 10 years

794
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
True

795
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,040
Got a lot more coming

796
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Today

797
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
My friends with

798
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:55,648
First thing I want

799
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,440
Before we go

800
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
Emporia you to realize how

801
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,608
This is the big Global smooth

802
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,936
This is a hundred years of Robber Baron planning this is

803
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Everything launched

804
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:12,032
It's not going as well as they wanted

805
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,104
They're just going to pour on More Steam Moses going to get

806
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,128
Very destructive

807
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,176
Very Reckless

808
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,712
Very very dangerous

809
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,040
And so does Tobin

810
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
We don't have a choice

811
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
To do whatever it takes

812
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,672
And that's where we are right now

813
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,256
A piece of cake

814
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
There are 23 years that

815
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,608
Population

816
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
From

817
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:43,264
Because the devil logic

818
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,616
Even those being killed one admitted if that's too scary they have Stockholm Syndrome

819
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:48,640
Okay

820
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,432
Population

821
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Is going to be dead

822
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Soon

823
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,064
You know it's fun

824
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,112
It really makes sense

825
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
You know that after January 6th

826
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,720
Not doing anything

827
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,256
Solve the problem

828
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,352
And there's absolutely no way that a propagandist like this saying that it's

829
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,424
Open season on all of our political enemies

830
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,472
Could lead to a repeat of that event

831
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,776
It's so amazing how doing nothing

832
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:18,336
Worked it certainly

833
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
Alex comes back from break and wants to play this clip

834
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Bill gay

835
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,040
Although this actually is

836
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:27,808
Was just eclipse

837
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Anderson Cooper

838
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,880
Bill Gates

839
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,208
Cut it off before Bill Gates

840
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:39,840
Sorry about this but this is apparently now thing we have a streak

841
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:46,496
This is the second episode in a row where we're going to hear Alex say the word ejaculate

842
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,544
Play this clip

843
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,080
This is Bill Gates

844
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,151
Is on with the

845
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,479
Other globalist

846
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Fortune

847
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:02,879
Anderson Cooper

848
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,951
Cooper is Shang

849
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
Well we should just deny

850
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Social Security benefits

851
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:13,887
Social

852
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,215
But if you don't take the deadly experimental shots

853
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,103
Doesn't even work in the majority of the dying

854
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
Wow

855
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,223
Well then you'll just ended Bill Gates start smiling

856
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
Like a pig and you know what

857
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:30,783
Erdos

858
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,575
They are saying

859
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,927
You have to be vaccinated in order to work at a corporation is that something you support and

860
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Do you think

861
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
Federal government

862
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Or

863
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
State governments

864
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,839
Federal government should mandate

865
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,167
She want to get on the airplane afternoon vaccinated if you want to get

866
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,031
Social Security you need to be vaccinated if you want to get

867
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,591
Whatever whatever benefits

868
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
They give

869
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
You need to be vaccinated

870
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
Therefore is that something

871
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,271
Anyone on the say yes but

872
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,343
Why didn't you let him

873
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,415
Gates looks like he had a funtania see Jackie

874
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
Special powder

875
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
Billy baroo

876
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
This is a big one ballet

877
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
Just

878
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,943
You could have just play Wyclef

879
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
If he had an organ

880
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,855
He had buried sarkari another globalist on CNN doing everyone a year-and-a-half ago

881
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,135
Lisa

882
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,951
Engage did the same thing

883
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,767
He's an orgasm on air

884
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:47,327
You can play that quick

885
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
I think I think he's

886
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Trying to be funny

887
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
I guess I think

888
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,495
Is that it

889
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
I don't know

890
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
That's bad

891
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,871
It's really tough to tell him because he's said this

892
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
A lot

893
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,943
Yeah he talks about Bill Gates

894
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:07,807
Jesus while talking about tyranny

895
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:08,831
He goes to

896
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,367
Semi-regularly

897
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,415
I think I mean you could

898
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Be better

899
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
Just thinks he's got his hands on a good bit

900
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,559
Wow I guess you could

901
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:21,887
I can't tell ya no

902
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,191
Nonono dwell

903
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,727
You have the

904
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,079
He has the intonation of somebody who's like actually saying that this dude

905
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:36,479
Just came at 100%. Like Eddie pepitone zangri with that kind of Limbs

906
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,039
Musical rage behind it it's just

907
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
Yeah it's confounding

908
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:44,159
I mean I can't tell but I am willing to believe that there is a

909
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
That his intention is humor

910
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,535
UK

911
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:55,167
That is about as little criticism as you can

912
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,959
Can give anybody trying to be funny

913
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,007
I am willing to admit

914
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,799
It's possible

915
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
You were maybe

916
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,359
Attempt

917
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Humor

918
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
AMC Hulen

919
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,063
But again I apologize that you had to hear Alexei jaculation

920
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
So Alex

921
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,183
But this is this is also one of my favorites

922
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,719
Thanks there with

923
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,559
The times that he finds a new song to rant over

924
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,095
What he says something like this

925
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:25,119
F****** love it

926
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:28,447
You do not going to play the head of the US teachers union saying

927
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,775
4shared

928
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,663
I love it when he's a quite approved

929
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:43,039
To prove something cuz you're making claims dude everybody knows this

930
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,575
That is my proof

931
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:50,463
Sodium the teachers union did voice support for vaccine mandate

932
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,255
But

933
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,303
Alex doesn't cover it

934
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
And he seems angry about proving any

935
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,191
Your whole thing is proving thing

936
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,215
Iris

937
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:01,983
Zent's

938
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,007
You

939
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:09,407
Forcing me to look into the things that I am making up because they are not true sir

940
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,711
Another thing that he is

941
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,735
Not refusing

942
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
It's the story of Germany

943
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,951
What are the major German newspapers highly respected

944
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Hi largest

945
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:28,607
Medical Union of doctors in the country

946
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,471
All your top doctors is one guy right

947
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,287
Union came out

948
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
In March

949
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:41,151
Looks like these vaccines are killing a lot of people

950
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:45,503
Now they've been doing spot checks on her finding starting to 40% depending on where they look

951
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,551
30 below 40 Bhai

952
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,111
35% of the death of Germany

953
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,415
About people they're giving autopsy

954
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,511
Wow

955
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
Wow

956
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,071
Way to tell the story

957
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,887
But now I want it I told you that you're going to love

958
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,935
The hilarity that ensues

959
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,215
And this is where

960
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,775
You may remember that when I was

961
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:10,079
Breaking down with the story is actually about

962
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Did the original article included some comments from people

963
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
From the Paul are looking

964
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,271
Who were saying that this doesn't match up with anything that we're seeing

965
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:21,855
I assume they own the Wuhan Laboratory

966
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
Okay Alex

967
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:26,207
Makes a crucial mistake

968
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:30,559
Eugenics organization that calls for worldly population

969
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,863
Paul Ehrlich Society

970
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Has come out in

971
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,663
You're not at your not epidemiologist

972
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
Your environmental organization

973
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:51,551
Cuz you're not environmentalist

974
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,159
Environmental organization, environmentalists

975
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:59,231
Bill Gates

976
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:08,959
Never heard that before

977
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Open

978
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:12,799
Open

979
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
Because they wrote the battle plan

980
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:23,039
Alec doesn't talk about Paul Ehrlich all the time but he does bring him up sometimes mostly it's John holdren.

981
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,879
Ecocide derelict was also the co-author of that

982
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,487
Institute is not an environmental organization

983
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:35,071
Text me part of the German government and it's a biomedical research center

984
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,607
About the polarity

985
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,143
Society

986
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
No

987
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:40,447
It better

988
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:46,847
Alex is confusing Paul are like who the Institute is named after with Paul are are like that fell off

989
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:59,647
No no no

990
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,303
Maybe this is just embarrassing obvious you have no f****** clue what you're

991
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,631
Talkin about

992
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:13,471
For this log

993
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:15,007
No idea what you're talkin

994
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Pretty amazing

995
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:20,639
Wow Paul Who The Institute was named after was an immunologist who cured syphilis

996
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:25,247
He died in 1915 a good 62 years before the other Paul co-authored

997
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,783
The textbook Alex him

998
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,111
Sure just amazing how f****** stupid Alex amazing

999
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:34,719
Again this is one of the things that's like it seems like maybe we're just nitpicking

1000
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
Reality

1001
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,071
You have to understand how Alex processes information

1002
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,351
When keys

1003
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:43,679
Doing these things about headlines he writes a story in it and he just

1004
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,727
I have extraneous details to stop

1005
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
He sees the name Paul Arabic

1006
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,335
Institute is like oh my God I know who Paul are looking up

1007
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:54,175
And he just decides to write a story about it based on like oh I have this

1008
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,479
This textbook that I've made everyone afraid of

1009
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,063
They're the same person no they're not you have no idea what you're talkin about

1010
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:06,463
You just just presenting things with the authority and confidence of somebody who knows what they're talking about

1011
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
When in reality is just a

1012
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
F****** idiot

1013
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,815
But it's not it's not nitpicking

1014
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
If he misspoke

1015
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
You know like when he plays the clips

1016
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,447
Does Nancy Pelosi misspeaking and all that s***

1017
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
That's

1018
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:18,751
A mistake

1019
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:23,615
This is a foundational element of everything he believes

1020
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,407
And he just has no idea

1021
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,175
No idea

1022
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,199
It doesn't matter

1023
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:30,015
It doesn't it's like with the it is one guy

1024
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:35,391
It's one guy you know like he's basing and now he turned into a whole you if it was like the f******

1025
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,951
If it was like the octopus that picked world

1026
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:41,791
Winners who is life just picked out of a can like maybe it hurts

1027
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:45,631
He be like the entire Union of American Pathologists Eric

1028
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:47,167
But he's insane but what's he

1029
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,751
His version of it if you

1030
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:51,775
Like it makes sense

1031
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,567
So like Paul are like

1032
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,615
Beholder

1033
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,639
Eco science

1034
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:02,271
That apparently has to do with how you kill off a population using vaccines and blah blah blah

1035
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:04,063
So yeah it's it's in there it's

1036
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
It's great it

1037
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
If the planets

1038
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,927
It's a battle plan the original battle plan for 1977

1039
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,719
It gets implemented in

1040
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,815
To the world right everybody is doing it and now their plans are coming to fruition

1041
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Visa vie

1042
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
The covid vaccine

1043
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,423
Korloff everybody

1044
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
There is a guy

1045
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,239
Germany

1046
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,567
Who's trying to say hold on now the vaccines are killing everybody

1047
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,847
And the Paul are like

1048
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,431
Institute is the one who tries to debunk that it makes total sense

1049
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,735
Except for the part where there's poop all Airline

1050
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,015
Reincarnate

1051
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,551
No

1052
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,647
If not

1053
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,415
For that

1054
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,951
Very important facts

1055
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:47,839
Civilian Tire Roofing makes a great story except for

1056
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Blackjack

1057
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,399
Yeah yeah yeah

1058
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:55,775
Critical it's like whenever it's like in that eleventh-hour situation where somebody finally

1059
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,079
Confirms your Alibi after you've gone through like

1060
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,103
15 days of

1061
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:01,151
See

1062
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:04,991
We've made our case and then the person's like where there's one problem though

1063
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:11,647
He was not there to do that they do the different person with the same name

1064
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,951
Almost got him though

1065
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:20,863
So Alex gets back to complaining about Obama's party and he doesn't seem to know that it was a birthday party

1066
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,167
I find this very weird

1067
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Bananas work gets a little bit more race

1068
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,311
Play It Again with audio Barack Obama's in a baby blue outfit

1069
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:35,711
Big rapper chain

1070
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:47,743
Look at the list who's there as much balls scum

1071
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,191
People are all going straight to hell

1072
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:00,031
Something more

1073
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,567
Disgusting in this

1074
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
What do they celebrate

1075
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
We overthrow the election

1076
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
We overthrow Trump

1077
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,271
We Trump vaccine

1078
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:15,391
Celebrating Obama's 60th 60th birthday that they're celebrating

1079
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
Inherent

1080
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:22,303
Disgusting racism here of like only seeing non-white people as being able to be used

1081
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Birthing

1082
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:26,143
That's how that mentality is pretty disc

1083
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,703
Hey hey this guy works

1084
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,543
Community organizer in Chicago

1085
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,895
Found a bridge of Senator then it became the president United States

1086
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,551
Obviously doesn't have any agency of his own by the CIA

1087
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,087
Absolutely

1088
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
So

1089
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,183
Another another thing that we we notice all the time

1090
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,719
In Alex's coverage

1091
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,023
Is that that that Razor's Edge of it

1092
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:54,303
Extremism which is

1093
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,399
You have to constantly be winning but also losing directions

1094
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,191
Alex takes.two

1095
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:00,959
Parody

1096
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,751
Level here

1097
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:08,895
Welcome back we're now into our number to evil is always going to make a run at good

1098
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,367
Gonzales pro-opposition

1099
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:24,767
It will launch a Full Assault

1100
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
What you doing right now

1101
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,863
I'd rather take overall sneakily but

1102
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,983
Open pedophilia is good World garbage good

1103
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,567
Unapproved inoculations are good censorship good

1104
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,967
This is real desperation

1105
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,247
Astrostyle

1106
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,599
I use the analogy of Blade Runner the original lyrics

1107
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,647
Issued

1108
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
When she realizes she's

1109
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
That's what's going on right now

1110
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:02,143
Question is how many of us are they going to Dragon the hole in them

1111
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:04,191
All these nuclear weapons a bioweapon

1112
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,239
Almost Maine releasing

1113
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,919
Any by any stretch of the imagination

1114
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,223
They are getting their ass handed to

1115
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
We're just

1116
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
The Lust For Freedom

1117
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,391
A good word the Bible but it's a good word to me

1118
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,655
You understand that

1119
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
It's my goddess

1120
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,263
Freedom is his goddess I mean

1121
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,359
He understands that the point of lust is that it takes away from your work

1122
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Bishop of God

1123
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,687
I don't think he understands a lot of the nuances of

1124
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
Of religion

1125
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:51,807
Truth is freedom

1126
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,391
Well that I mean God is actually

1127
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
If part of the point of

1128
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
His religion is

1129
00:55:57,951 --> 00:56:04,095
Is to become a servant before God

1130
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
Lust after Freedom you're literally didn't INB exist

1131
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
Would dig

1132
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:13,055
Satan

1133
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:16,895
Oh man his favorite thing is when God said do what thou wilt

1134
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
I'm telling you it's false flag

1135
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,831
He's been saying the whole time could be

1136
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,135
So Alex is presenting

1137
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:32,511
Like we're kicking the s*** out of these gloves but look out they're going to Nuke us

1138
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:44,543
We are so powerful there won't even press that button

1139
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:48,127
Maybe a bad day from one of these Global it's and we're all f***

1140
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
Deadpool

1141
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:54,271
So Alex gets to talk about how Lady Lady freedom

1142
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,599
And it leads him to get a little bit mad

1143
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,671
About the idea of bowing down to lesser men

1144
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,583
It's first and foremost it's it's it's it's

1145
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
It's my goddess

1146
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Amazon

1147
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:11,935
The goddess worship

1148
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,727
I do like two things.

1149
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,519
Creative but you get what I'm saying

1150
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,823
Northstar unfollowing it's real

1151
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,319
See there's my flashlight

1152
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Felicia

1153
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
I want to burn in hell before I did I love you Jesus help me

1154
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,207
Point is I will not

1155
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
Now about Trump

1156
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,055
Let's get in the big news here

1157
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Joe Rogan

1158
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:58,271
Amazing the big news

1159
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,039
I know.

1160
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,855
There's a progression here that is

1161
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:07,487
It's so goddamn funny he's screaming about how he's not going to bow down to a lesser bad

1162
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:11,327
I will not

1163
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,375
Let's go to the news

1164
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,423
Alone is hilarious

1165
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,263
Wolf Blitzer screaming about how he will not bow to a man

1166
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,919
Newscaster

1167
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:29,503
Speech that Edward armero gave where he just

1168
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
I just went

1169
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:36,927
Off on Eisenhower right just went off on Eisenhower said that Eisenhower the worst president ever

1170
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,463
F****** he's going to

1171
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:44,607
Light himself on fire before the Vietcong ever even f****** tried it he is going to kill everybody and then of course

1172
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:45,631
If you're going to go back to the Dukes

1173
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:53,823
Hilarious

1174
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:57,151
Let's get to the big news and it's big news of The Joe Rogan

1175
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Joe Rogan

1176
00:58:58,943 --> 00:58:59,967
Jotaro vs. might guy

1177
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,527
It's a one-two punch that I I just

1178
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,063
I love that

1179
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,647
Tilex is mad that people are critiquing Joe Rogan

1180
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,231
About is vaccine stupidity

1181
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:16,095
I like how we had a theory that maybe this isn't so not

1182
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:18,655
On purpose this it maybe this isn't

1183
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,679
So on

1184
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:23,519
Unintentional Rogan's platform anti-vax

1185
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,055
Is like

1186
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:25,823
All right now

1187
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,407
Yeah I see it seems like he's

1188
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,711
Vietnamese dipping his toes further

1189
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,039
Hope

1190
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,159
Spotify feels real good about their investment real good

1191
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:43,999
Is on that same path feels like that

1192
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:49,375
18 year older like 14 year olds were on 10 years ago where the YouTube algorithm

1193
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,679
Like all of his friends just keep recommended Hayes

1194
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:57,055
Here's a good guy here's a good guy here's a good guy and then all the sudden the guy from news radio is now like

1195
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,079
I'm going to say it

1196
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:02,175
We're going to have to get rid of the black population in your life

1197
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,247
Yeah I think that there is a dark

1198
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,063
Possible future where Rogan

1199
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,343
Is essentially like

1200
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Another Ali

1201
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,391
Yeah yeah

1202
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:16,511
A passively redpilled assholes I think that he's too old

1203
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,559
For it to be like really effective

1204
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,375
It'll take a while for him to

1205
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,911
Really break hard

1206
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,311
To the extreme as the presentation of a naive dope

1207
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,383
Yeah kind of is a protective shield

1208
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,455
For his hundred million dollar contract

1209
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
I think the

1210
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,015
Saving Gracie has is that

1211
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:44,415
Republican politicians and far-right figures don't do a s*** ton of drugs all the time or at least our open about

1212
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,951
Where is he's just like

1213
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,743
I am high all the time

1214
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,279
What are you going to do follow me

1215
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,047
Get out of here

1216
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,119
Alex plays a clip

1217
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:56,703
Rogan talking about this up

1218
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,007
Episode cuz I do not have the time for that

1219
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,543
Unless Alex is on

1220
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:04,895
But I think there's a really Elementary

1221
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:05,919
Thinking errors

1222
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
That you can pinpoint

1223
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
In Nairobi

1224
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,319
I want to play the club but I want to show you

1225
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:14,111
Just a small snapshot

1226
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
Small snapshot

1227
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,559
Organization sayings

1228
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,887
But the system knows what he says true

1229
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
They are simply

1230
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,567
Hoping you don't look at

1231
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
At the information

1232
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:37,407
So here's what he had to say if you guys going

1233
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,527
Vaccination can enhance the transmission

1234
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,575
Highly virulent pathogen

1235
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,879
Right so this is a scientific paper

1236
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,463
From 2000 and

1237
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,279
That shows

1238
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,167
If here's it's that there's this one import

1239
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Vaccines

1240
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,263
To keep the host alive

1241
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:05,311
But still allow transmission

1242
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,175
Strains to circulate in a population

1243
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
So

1244
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
Vaccine

1245
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
Kill the virus

1246
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,343
Vaccines

1247
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,391
Like this one things were finding out about

1248
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,415
What are calling brakes

1249
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,719
Do people who are vaccine

1250
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
We can still get covid

1251
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
And they can still transmit Kobe

1252
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
Is recently

1253
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
Vaccinated comedian

1254
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,167
Gave

1255
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,215
Cloven vaccinated some of them not

1256
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:35,519
That

1257
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,567
Situation where the vaccine just

1258
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,615
Text you from Sirius

1259
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
Damage

1260
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
Protect

1261
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,967
Text you from really being

1262
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,503
Like badly

1263
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,807
Hospitalized

1264
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:49,343
But doesn't stop

1265
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,879
You from getting the virus

1266
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Kompas

1267
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Sibley lead

1268
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,975
Houghton virus

1269
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
So these

1270
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
People that are saying

1271
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,679
So it's these people that are responsible for the variance

1272
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Actually scientific

1273
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,495
Sick papers

1274
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,519
Set point

1275
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,311
Two singular very

1276
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:12,127
Covid-19

1277
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,943
By having so many people

1278
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
With a vaccine that

1279
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Doesn't

1280
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
Tilly's

1281
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,831
It actually can lead to more

1282
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
Viruses

1283
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,415
So it is

1284
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:31,327
It is true that the fact there are some breakthrough infections that that's not ideal in a perfect world vaccines would stop this

1285
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,863
Of any illness

1286
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:36,447
However there's a critical thinking errors that Joe Rogan is making

1287
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,263
In here that required for this argument to make any sense

1288
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:43,615
He's acting as if the vaccine has no effect on whether or not a person will

1289
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
We covid which is

1290
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,407
Is not true

1291
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:49,247
It greatly reduces transmission even if it doesn't do so

1292
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Completely

1293
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:55,135
Ozark Mendes essentially him taking the present circumstances and comparing them to a perfect

1294
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Vaccine

1295
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,927
In that context

1296
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,975
Yeah this vaccine doesn't look so good

1297
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:02,815
Some people will still get mild cases of the virus and they have the potential to pass it along

1298
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:03,839
The other people

1299
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:08,703
What really should be done however is compare this vaccine to the actual alternative

1300
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,751
I wish things would look like with

1301
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
New vaccine

1302
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:16,895
Even though we do have to stipulate that some people can transmit the virus even though they're vaccinated

1303
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:21,247
The alternative is people who are not vaccinated who spread the virus a lot more

1304
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:27,135
In reality Rogen's argument against vaccinations only makes sense as an argument in favor of vaccinations

1305
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:30,719
If his concern is the potential for viral mutation in transmission

1306
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,071
The risk of that is substantially higher the lower the rate of vaccination isn't

1307
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
The community

1308
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
Also in the front turn of events Andrew read the scientist who authored the study Jose talking about has come out and said quote

1309
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,519
Joe Rogan is getting this

1310
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
Wheatley wrong

1311
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Sounds about right

1312
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,639
Yeah I don't I don't I don't know I don't know

1313
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,943
I don't know if this is the breaking news The Joe Rogan

1314
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
Open Smart that Alex wants to

1315
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,759
Okay

1316
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:54,783
All I'm saying

1317
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
Is

1318
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,367
If it doesn't solve

1319
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:01,695
All of our problems immediately and

1320
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:02,463
Permanently

1321
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,255
What we should do

1322
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
Is

1323
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,559
Wait a little bit

1324
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
See how the science looks

1325
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,423
Let several hundred million people died

1326
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,263
And then I'll think about getting vaccinated

1327
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:19,103
I think I think they went when you create

1328
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:19,871
Sort of

1329
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:26,527
Bizarre alternatives to comparison something to eat you can always make that something look either really bad or really good

1330
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
And that that's

1331
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,855
Kind of the mistake

1332
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:33,183
I'm willing to believe that Rogan is making

1333
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,719
Just like a mistake there

1334
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,559
I in some in some way like I think he just hasn't thought about anything

1335
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,863
Some people are not pointing out

1336
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
That with scuba gear is

1337
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,983
You go too far down

1338
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,263
Sometimes the

1339
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
The pressure will make a

1340
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,055
Did not work

1341
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,871
And that's why we should never go in the water

1342
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,663
This checks out

1343
01:05:53,919 --> 01:06:00,063
Waterford why won't anybody you can't go lower than 1200

1344
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:06,207
So Alex gets a little bit heavy and he starts talking about Bible verses

1345
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,511
I think it

1346
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,559
This is another instance of a thing that you eat

1347
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,095
I think he doesn't understand

1348
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
Bible

1349
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:14,911
Talk to ya

1350
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,239
714

1351
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,543
You understand that your son everything in the universe

1352
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,431
Give my people the people that love Justice and good

1353
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,711
Wannabe good

1354
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,759
Which are called by my name

1355
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:33,855
Shall humble themselves and stop playing God

1356
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,655
13 day was about his own hearts

1357
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,919
David was a man after God's Own Heart because he had unwavering faith in because he was repentant

1358
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:02,015
No not from that is not supposed to be the god also wants to f*** his

1359
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,807
Joshua

1360
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,623
That's what the takeaway from that

1361
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,903
That story is

1362
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,719
Daily that God's your bro man

1363
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:18,143
David the man after God's heart because he like to sling ticker rap-up

1364
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:22,239
That's bulshit you're going to tell me that God doesn't get it

1365
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,311
I

1366
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:28,639
What you think Zeus didn't f***

1367
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,455
Well I mean the problem really that I guess I have

1368
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,991
Is that just one

1369
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:35,039
Well

1370
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:41,439
I always forget to apply the same level of bad reading comprehension that Alex has for the news

1371
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:48,607
Brother just tags have thing that he cares about know why I always forget

1372
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
I'm talking about this

1373
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
This Bible verse

1374
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
Excited about

1375
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,895
It's not unlike

1376
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
Like Isis

1377
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
In many ways

1378
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,991
Barack Obama party

1379
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
Or going to a

1380
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,087
Chuck Schumer party

1381
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,623
Bill Clinton party

1382
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,023
A party is a Chuck Schumer party don't stop

1383
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,559
Bodies in the world

1384
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,447
But you just pull off the side of the highway and some old black church

1385
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,519
White Church some old Hispanic

1386
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
For real people are

1387
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,615
Satisfied

1388
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
You feel real

1389
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Everything they claim they are

1390
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,415
Billiards

1391
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,815
Stop worshipping

1392
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:54,655
Allentown to oven stopped working out of this stupid ass

1393
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,447
You're going to lose this thing

1394
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,775
11 this damn flush given all your power

1395
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
Oceans on it

1396
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
Captain all day

1397
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,151
What is God's Temple

1398
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:08,735
But if you lose your body in the service against evil that is a blessing

1399
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
Alright

1400
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,343
Yeah yeah that's

1401
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Hey hey

1402
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,671
Just so you know

1403
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
That as long as it look

1404
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,999
You're going to die anyways

1405
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,559
So you might as well die in service to the Lord

1406
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:24,095
If you die fighting globalist

1407
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119
The blessing

1408
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,399
Twice as much heavy

1409
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
You get the most happen

1410
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:33,055
That's upsetting also What potions are you putting

1411
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:36,383
In Harry Potter what is happening people

1412
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,479
Play into many Adventure video game

1413
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
Season ocean

1414
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:48,415
I don't understand the lotion he's actually specifically referencing I high potion which

1415
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,695
Florastor 500

1416
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,839
So Alex gets to talk about his commitment to the Infowars

1417
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,887
Andy says something that

1418
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,167
Kind of surprised me

1419
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
Fortune

1420
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
Becoming that's coming up

1421
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:04,031
And I will have all the stuff

1422
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,591
I'll just say this right now

1423
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:14,783
If I had two or three times the funding we've got I could have done a lot more and I'm not bitching

1424
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,135
Completely

1425
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,719
Sell my house

1426
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,023
Which is not even

1427
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
Hard decision to make

1428
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:31,679
Everything's in

1429
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,263
Alien laser

1430
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:39,615
So just go to mypillow.com man

1431
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,175
God that's

1432
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:45,759
Against

1433
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,783
Globalist

1434
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:53,183
Talking pillow

1435
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:53,951
Percent

1436
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,743
Cut out of everyone

1437
01:10:56,255 --> 01:11:00,863
Ouch

1438
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,215
Okay

1439
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,007
This sounds like just

1440
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
A rerun

1441
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:14,431
Listen if I were a better businessman I would have been able to do more for you but I'm not that good so I'm real

1442
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,735
Rub buck and ripping my pillow now

1443
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:21,599
I will tell you I will tell you that we overextended ourselves in the info

1444
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
We bought

1445
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:26,975
They told us it was stupid to buy tanks made out of diamond baby

1446
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,279
Maybe it was a bad move

1447
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
And I see now that they might have been right

1448
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:35,423
But would you consider buying pillow

1449
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:40,287
Let me know the time and I was working at that f****** coupon place

1450
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,847
And one day everybody is

1451
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,175
Working and he's just like the owner of the company is just like

1452
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:46,943
You know what

1453
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:52,575
I'm going to turn the third floor into a coffee shop you know it's going to be like a Starbucks nobody will have to pay for it

1454
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,367
I'm giving you guys again

1455
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
No

1456
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
Hey

1457
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,719
You a******

01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:01,023
Pictures of very Groupon app

1459
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,559
Yeah you're a bunch of dick

1460
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
Yeah alright

1461
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
This little part of the offices decorated like a

1462
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,167
Tree

1463
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:13,567
So it's like a little Forest that you can go do work in a bunch of Lacrosse around

1464
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
Why am I still a temp after a year-and-a-half

1465
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:19,455
Exactly the a****** how your f****** dick

1466
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,271
Alex Quebec to the Germany story

1467
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:25,087
And what now that we know

1468
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,367
He has the wrong air lick

1469
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,439
It's kind of funny to recognize that that's

1470
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:35,583
Basically his entire angle on the store hun real unreal

1471
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,911
That one of the leading pathologist in Germany

1472
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:42,495
He's done his own study of a bunch of that bodies found the same number

1473
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,031
30 to 40%.

1474
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
Bodies

1475
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:50,175
34% of bodies there now autopsy

1476
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,711
The vaccines

1477
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,319
Where's my book

1478
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
What I do in my house

1479
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
Oh no

1480
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,047
But don't worry

1481
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,327
Who's in the article

1482
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:10,399
Dr. John B holdren

1483
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,983
Institution saying was no evidence is not true

1484
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,007
When he wrote

1485
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,055
The science book on depopulation

1486
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,615
Poison vaccine poison Florida and everything else

1487
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
It's playing finally got it.

1488
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,551
Man

1489
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,087
Just embarrassing

1490
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,879
Just I mean

1491
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,695
Could not bet like sitting there I felt like I was

1492
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
Was handing him a rope

1493
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
Slowly

1494
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
Dislike

1495
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:44,191
Here you go I guess you I guess this is all your decision I'm just holding the rope man I'm not doing any

1496
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:46,495
I'm not moving or just my walking cane

1497
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:49,567
Get on your desk

1498
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:56,735
I don't know I always find it interesting to imagine the audience

1499
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
Listening to this

1500
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
I am still taking him seriously

1501
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:06,463
What are the reasons that they can is that the information that there are two politics and Alex has no idea what he's talking about that never

1502
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,743
Never penetrates

1503
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:08,767
Infowars

1504
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:11,327
Contact that never gets on the show

1505
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,143
And if you were just passively listening to this

1506
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,983
It's really easy to assume that it is the same Paul are like

1507
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
Cuz why not

1508
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
There were people are like Institute

1509
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,359
Make that two this famous scientist

1510
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
Oregano

1511
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
One of them

1512
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,247
He's a guy whose work was in ecological

1513
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,039
Concerned

1514
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
You know

1515
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
It's a little weird

1516
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,903
Baby weighing in on the science and Germany about like

1517
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,463
You know it would biological and

1518
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,303
Illogical the only thing that you can do that you're like

1519
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,607
You know what maybe there is a

1520
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:45,887
Italian for sure

1521
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:52,543
Oh and yeah maybe there is this German Paul Ehrlich Institute just really admired Paul Erdos at work

1522
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,639
And so they named it after it maybe he endowed the beginning of the end

1523
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:03,039
2 / Middle School named after him

1524
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,855
Passively listening you could be like I am make sense

1525
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:11,231
It is the same and it's not and Alex's building so much of this conspiracy on the idea

1526
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,511
But it's suspicious

1527
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
Because it's the same person

1528
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:15,583
It's not as if

1529
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
That's not good

1530
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,935
Alex even just reporting on this story you can't help it

1531
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
Themself

1532
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,471
Adding lies

1533
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,359
Received support from

1534
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,175
Association of German pets

1535
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,807
Autopsies of accident people who died within a certain time frame

1536
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,111
Nation should be performed

1537
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,767
Depart at airbnb's Alex

1538
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,327
Editorialize article

1539
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,119
Because the rest of the stuff makes sense

1540
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
The people

1541
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,959
Kalologie Union

1542
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,007
Look at more people should dad be

1543
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,543
Okay I'll talk to you

1544
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,847
Please cuz then we'd have more information to go on

1545
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,455
12 out of 40 is not the sample size you can use to draw a conclusion

1546
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,479
Is about a large

1547
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
Population

1548
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,295
Even

1549
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:11,135
Thirty-two 40% of those people who are being referenced in this article

1550
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:12,671
They did not prove

1551
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,487
That they died vaccination

1552
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,559
So there is more information that is required

1553
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,607
And that is what there's call for

1554
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
More

1555
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,239
Alex adding that other detail onto the story is what he does because

1556
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,775
The actual text of this

1557
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,079
Article that he's reading is underwhelming

1558
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
It doesn't match zika

1559
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
Conspiracies

1560
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,663
But he's built up around

1561
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:37,503
Hey this guy's got a concerns maybe let's find out some more stuff

1562
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,527
Right

1563
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:40,063
Oh okay

1564
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,599
So I got to

1565
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:43,391
I got towards the end of this episode

1566
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,671
And

1567
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
I was

1568
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,487
Kind of

1569
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,511
Feeling

1570
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,279
Empty

1571
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,375
Martial law begins on Wednesday

1572
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:58,239
It seems like that would be more important

1573
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,007
For Alex

1574
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,055
Not knowing who Paul are like

1575
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
But there is

1576
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,615
You know

1577
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
Last episode

1578
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
Pretty intense

1579
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
We're going work with happening yeah there's this emergency alert system thing that's going to be

1580
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,367
Cover for the internet takeover

1581
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
Biden's going to

1582
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
To put in this

1583
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:23,071
Martial law and also maybe a climate emergency but maybe it'll happen a different day going to happen

1584
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:26,655
Does he realize that his sponsor

1585
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:30,239
Is holding a three-day-long talkathon

1586
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,287
To overthrow the

1587
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
The government

1588
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:33,823
He does

1589
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,639
I was I was

1590
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,943
Concerned that it hadn't come up

1591
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,759
That yeah come up on this episode

1592
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:46,367
And now it doesn't maybe we shouldn't worry about it

1593
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:50,975
Maybe maybe the 11th of February

1594
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,791
Maybe but I'm not

1595
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,839
I'm glad that the boom operator

1596
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,863
Mention this

1597
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,167
Real quick

1598
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,703
This boom operator

1599
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,775
Nose without the production credits

1600
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,335
Absolutely no proposal

1601
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,639
Explain the blue ball Creator brought this up

1602
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,175
It's staggering

1603
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,527
This is what this is the VIP of Infowars operator

1604
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:18,367
Cuz it is not their job to give a s*** no and apparently they're coming through in the clutch

1605
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:24,767
And telling Alex hey you forgot to talk about this the only member of his staff who is never f***** up his mic

1606
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:29,887
Has always sounded good but he's wearing like a lapel mic

1607
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,191
Cover today

1608
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,751
I said last week I'm going to head to my bad

1609
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Santa Clara

1610
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Obama

1611
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
Also known as a

1612
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,223
Reporting slip was actually real

1613
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,087
When the president Let It Go

1614
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,135
Still at Meijer

1615
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,975
Passageway

1616
01:18:55,231 --> 01:19:01,375
A lot of dependent clauses there's a lot going on a lot of we've already got a little

1617
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,423
I didn't say anything weird

1618
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,447
Beatles rights

1619
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,007
Always gotten so far

1620
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
Fully intended

1621
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,895
Election to the country again

1622
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:15,711
Domestic Security Forces spies

1623
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
Contact tracers

1624
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:20,063
You have an emergency alert system

1625
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
4011

1626
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,879
Modell's

1627
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Putting it on

1628
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,255
And I'm not saying for sure

1629
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,791
Bible do it that but

1630
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:33,631
In the White House meeting

1631
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,935
Drawing of a plan

1632
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,031
Call

1633
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,847
Show emergency

1634
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:43,871
On the 11th

1635
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,247
They may not do it but

1636
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,087
Emergency alert

1637
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:59,487
Maybe maybe it's not anything and maybe it maybe just like the end of the world

1638
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,279
We listening to this on the way to FEMA camps

1639
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:06,143
I don't know maybe maybe the entire day's programming that I did those who pursue

1640
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:06,911
Sensational

1641
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:07,935
Maybe it was nothing

1642
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:13,824
Now you know but we got a few sales out of it so goddamn the tip of the spear

1643
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Almost Happy

1644
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,944
We would have been at that beer

1645
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:22,272
Stabbing what's happening

1646
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,320
This is kind of impressive in some ways

1647
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:29,184
I mean he's given up on this narrative before it even like he is

1648
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Cut bait

1649
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,768
Easy 100%

1650
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Smartest move

1651
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,352
I think it well yeah I guess if you were just trying to

1652
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,656
Push sales that is a smartest move

1653
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
Smarter move

1654
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:40,960
Bigger picture

1655
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:41,984
For the help

1656
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
Book Society

1657
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:43,776
Is don't do this

1658
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:45,568
That would be the smartest

1659
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:50,688
Yeah that would be the acting this way

1660
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,736
You're making termite lintel

1661
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
Is not worth it

1662
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,040
Now

1663
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:55,808
No it's not

1664
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,088
Speaking of Mike Lindell

1665
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,112
Alex

1666
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,672
Going to be on location this week

1667
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:02,464
I'm going to be in Sioux Falls

1668
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,256
South Dakota

1669
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
2 mi from there

1670
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,608
Is it is working for

1671
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,008
After all of that

1672
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,032
You sound

1673
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:19,104
Defeated

1674
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
Confidence

1675
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
The after this

1676
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
72 hours

1677
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,760
We will have a 90 Supreme Court Justice

1678
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:26,784
Holyshit

1679
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,648
The delivery of him being like Mike's got a lot of evidence and no he doesn't

1680
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,720
I also think that there is like

1681
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,256
Alex

1682
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,048
I think is going because

1683
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:40,096
He might be realize like that like

1684
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,424
Mike Lindell is not going to be able to

1685
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,960
The fun things after this

1686
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:50,592
No it's a last-ditch effort I don't I don't know how deep

1687
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
These pillow bags are

1688
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,712
The pocket

1689
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,552
Pillow Pockets that laundry is running low

1690
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:00,832
Can't

1691
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,856
Possibly

1692
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
Go on forever

1693
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,928
Alex

1694
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,720
He may be

1695
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256
Alright

1696
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,792
Imma take what I can get here

1697
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,608
I'm going to head over there to do some chalk

1698
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,632
And then I'm going to try and

1699
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:17,984
Double my speaking fee for Friday's episode

1700
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,776
What I was thinking about doing

1701
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,592
Is the episode about the end of the world this app

1702
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,616
No

1703
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
Cuz we've already

1704
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,992
So I was thinking about doing something

1705
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,784
Think about Mike lindell's stream

1706
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:36,416
But man I don't know where to start it set like 3 days long I don't know

1707
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:43,072
Where to start or end it's going to be a stream-of-consciousness rant and he's planning on doing it for 72 straight

1708
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:46,656
I've seen some people posting some nice Clips on Twitter

1709
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
And how well it's going

1710
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Insofar

1711
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:53,568
And I appreciate that but what I think I'm going to do is check in on Alex's

1712
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,640
Cara vanity project part 3 think we're going to have to

1713
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:59,200
It's not really a caravan I need another Pawn

1714
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
You come up with something okay

1715
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,808

Cyber Symposium wolf

1718
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
We could

1719
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
Could call it my road trip

1720
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,280
Now

1721
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,608
I want to make a my pillow pain but I'm

1722
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,400
I'm drawing a blank right now

1723
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,448
Brutal to my Thriller

1724
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
It's not great

1725
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:27,872
Tropical Falls

1726
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,736

Very sad

1731
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
Sounding announcement

1732
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:48,096
For him here on the Sunday episode

1733
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:51,936
Leads me to believe that his coverage is going to be a little bit mopey

1734
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,496
Anyway we will check in on that but

1735
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:58,848
Tell them Jordan River website
