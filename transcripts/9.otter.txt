Alex Jones  00:00
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.

Andy In Kansas   00:04
Well, Alex, I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.

Dan  00:07
Hey, everybody. Welcome back to knowledge fight. I'm Dan.

Jordan  00:10
I'm Jordan.

Dan  00:11
Wayne. We are back in the saddle once again, hope you're having a great day out there. Today we are going to have a very special episode of this podcast where I talk

Jordan  00:21
about abortion. No, well, maybe. How has that always happened?

Dan  00:25
He's Alex Jones is a man who is singularly obsessed with race abortion. That's right. All sorts of other conservative issues, even though he claims to not be conservative.

Jordan  00:36
He was an energy that's very conservative whip. All right. All right. Remember at the start of the fucking show. Yeah.

Dan  00:42
Last episode, you spoke prophecy. And you just did again, I guess this episode is gonna deal a lot with energy. It frightens me

Jordan  00:53
how right I am becoming like, the more we do this, the more I can plan Alex Jones's moves when

Dan  00:59
you're starting to war games. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Oh, also, by the way,

Jordan  01:03
I'm on Deep Blue to his Kasparov on Friday's

Dan  01:06
show. He actually had a guest on he's like, let's war games.

Jordan  01:10
No, yeah. I think he's, is he listening to us? God, I hope he is.

Dan  01:15
I gotta check the statistics, if we have any downloads from occupied Texas.

Jordan  01:19
So that's actually what his IP address as to? It's not like Austin, it is occupied Texas. He's got a private server. Yeah.

Dan  01:26
There's no doubt that digital Dropbox, Dropbox. So if you're just joining us, and he does he Ooh, for the first time, if you're joining us, this is a show where I listened to way too much Infowars and Alex Jones in particular. And my friend Jordan over here does not

Jordan  01:41
I have no fucking clue what he's on about. And we're getting to the bottom of it.

Dan  01:45
Yep. And so we're going to explore a day in the life of Alex and today the episode that we're going to cover is not the Infowars what? Who, so for the longest time, Joe Rogan has been trying to get Alex Jones on his podcast, but he can't because Alex lives in Austin and occupied Texas, right. And Joe likes to have people in studio doesn't like to do Skype calls. Right? So finally they were able to make it work. And lo and behold, it was for episode 911. Of course, of course. So Joe brings in Alex they have a they have a little bull session. And joining them along for the ride is a young man by the name of Eddie Bravo, Eddie Bravo, who is a martial arts instructor and all around with all due respect, total idiot. If he could beat my ass like a rented mule, I have no doubt about that.

Jordan  02:41
I'm not I'm not saying that all martial arts instructors are idiots. No, but I'm also saying that all idiots are martial arts instructors. I believe that's how that works. Right.

Dan  02:51
I think that syllogism works.

Jordan  02:53
I think that makes perfect sense.

Dan  02:54
So Eddie, he's not It's not fair. He's not a total idiot. But he believes in a lot of stuff. That's like come on, man. Even for conspiracy theory stuff. Like he really believes in playing trail. We're

Jordan  03:04
we've been listening to Alex Jones and this guy to you is the first time you're like, Come on, man. Well,

Dan  03:10
I have a special relationship with. It's true. We're connected on a soul

Jordan  03:15
right? Rare energies? Yes. Yeah. You guys are very much like, the M Night Shyamalan movie where you're Bruce Willis. And he is Samuel Jackson. I wonder

Dan  03:25
if he felt something weird the day I was born. If there was like a premonition. He was like, oh, wicked this way.

Jordan  03:35
It was just like that old gypsy woman said that he would be taken down.

Dan  03:41
dickhole Chicago.

Jordan  03:44
So that's a very oddly specific old gypsy woman prophecy right? Yeah,

Dan  03:47
mouth honor. Yeah. So sweet cakes. Eddie believes in like chemtrails. He's super into that. He's an anti Vaxxer. And also apparently doesn't believe in dinosaurs. But be that as it may. He's not maybe not a total idiot, but has a lot of total idiot beliefs. He

Jordan  04:06
doesn't believe in dinosaurs. That's where the conversation should stop in determining somebody's idiocy.

Dan  04:14
I haven't studied Eddie Bravo. So I don't know if that's for sure. But they bring it up a couple of times on the episode, but you have studied dinosaurs. touch and go. Yeah, a little bit.

Jordan  04:24
But you had that like, six six year old boy phase of like dinosaurs love, right?

Dan  04:29
Yeah. Jurassic Park came out when I was like 10

Jordan  04:31
stegosaurs Fuck Yeah. Love it. Brachiosaurus. That's real Brontosaurus, not real. Here's, here's the fake news.

Dan  04:40
I overheard a conversation at work the other day. And this guy was like, I'm not sure if I believe in dinosaurs.

Jordan  04:50
If that was a non sequitur, that's the best thing to hear. And if I was just riding on the train, and some dude just woke up like the Manchurian Candidate just like oh, I don't believe in dinosaurs. They'd be the best part of my day, wherever

Dan  05:03
it'd be wonderful. But I know that a lot of people who don't believe in dinosaurs believe that like Jews buried the bones and stuff like do you know that like a lot of the anti dinosaur stuff is anti semitic?

Jordan  05:15
Oh, is there nothing that isn't pinned on the Jews?

Dan  05:19
Nope. Literally everything. Literally everything. Yeah, man. Yep. The media banking, right. George Soros white supremacy.

Jordan  05:27
That is,

Dan  05:30
why do they have to make us like this?

Jordan  05:32
I don't know. It's so funny. It is, man if only they hadn't killed Christ. So

Dan  05:37
the show starts out on a bit of a boring note. Because Alex, you know, he wants to make his presence felt. And so they start the show off. And the first clip I'm going to play is what I would call the first lie. First lie and exaggeration and it's about that is

Jordan  05:58
the new segment of our show, right? First, first live the day ladies, gentlemen, we're gonna go to the first lie.

Dan  06:03
This one is about Alex Jones is sort of political leanings.

Alex Jones  06:07
And he was bringing up this fact for your audience up front, a lot of MSM lies and says I'm this big right wing guy. But you guys know that I was really against George W. Bush,

Joe Rogan  06:15
where you were arrested early on in the Bush administration. I remember when, when we first became friends in 1999. We were running around the White House or the the State Capitol lawn with with with George Bush, Jr. and senior masks on and you were always again, sure the Bush

Alex Jones  06:32
supported Trump is the entire power structure of the media. I mean, the Vatican, the Communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabians all put money in and said stop him stop him and then lied to the Russians were giving him money with no proof. And so the issue is he's simply trying to actually be president and not have special interest in their running him. And that's why the whole power structure is against Trump. So he was asked before we went live, well, how was it your what's up?

Jordan  06:57
You said we were going to do the first lie. I believe we're on lies one through 44. Right. So jazz? Well, one. Does he think the Vatican, the Communist Chinese, and Saudi Arabia are all working together against him? Absolutely. Or does he think they're individual actors? All of them coming to the same conclusion that there is no greater threat than Trump? Then Alex Jones

Dan  07:23
and Trump and Trump, two of them? They form like Voltron. Yeah, I think what he would say is that they're not necessarily working in concert, but it's an enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of thing. All right,

Jordan  07:35
I can buy that.

Dan  07:37
For $1. More, all right, back to the clip, yes,

Alex Jones  07:41
this outside guy against the establishment, but now you're for it. No, Trump's trying to create a beachhead, just to explain it, to try to take the country back and actually devolve power back to the states and back to the people doesn't mean he's perfect. But notice the stock market went up $1,200,000,000,000, just the last month or so, because a lot of institutional investors and others understand with Trump trying to create real prosperity, not a bunch of social engineering, and I'm not here to pitch Trump to people. The issue is, is that there were major intelligence agencies and patriots in the government, who were sick of what was happening, and were sick of Hillary and Obama backing jihadist groups and other things. And so they're rolling those groups up right now. They really are standing up against them. And this is a historic moment. And so there's been a counter coup through the electoral process in our country.

Dan  08:28
What's up? Where did he lose you?

Jordan  08:30
It is amazing. How breathless he is on somebody else's show.

Dan  08:36
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Jordan  08:37
That is a nonstop barrage of nonsense so prosperity can't be the same as social engineering. Is that like a of course that like an unequal sign where it's like he wants real prosperity not social engineering? And I don't know how it is those things are related to each other

Dan  08:56
they're not really but they are in his head because what he believes is social engineering is trying to keep us poor trying to keep us weak that social engineers aren't doing things for our advantage. They want to dumb us down they want to make us pay too much in taxes all this stuff that he's talking about, but

Jordan  09:15
why and how and and again, why and super more why? Whoo because how many Y's can be applied to one sentiment?

Dan  09:26
So so far, you'll have three okay,

Jordan  09:29
so no, I believe a super white coats is for on its own.

Dan  09:33
Okay, using metric

Jordan  09:35
social engineering, right? Yeah. So you're one of these social engineers Thank you

Dan  09:39
exams got a promotion. Oh,

Jordan  09:41
yeah, absolutely. Let's let's go through this

Dan  09:43
all right. You're poor now.

Jordan  09:45
Oh, god dammit, I'm poor. Now. How does that benefit you?

Dan  09:48
Because I'm not you.

Jordan  09:50
I guess that's pretty much again,

Dan  09:52
it's if it's tight, that's an airtight game, then your loss is my gain. But

Jordan  09:58
I mean, isn't isn't The whole like, Okay, why have we we haven't gotten through clip number one and I'm already angry, keep playing and we got, we got a we got a long way to go, I'm gonna let this go all right.

Alex Jones  10:10
And that's what WikiLeaks was. That wasn't the Russians. That was US intelligence agencies. I said two months ago, that Anthony Weiner in New York. Aberdeen's husband, the former congressman, that was working for Hillary, I said that he's under investigation for child porn. Okay. And then now it came out yesterday that they're looking at indicted him for child porn. Well, I heard that from the NYPD that came

Unknown Speaker  10:29
out yesterday. Yes. Wow. Why? What did he do? He had something on his computer.

Alex Jones  10:33
Well, now, they won't tell us but I was told that tied into that whole pizza gate thing.

Dan  10:38
No. Yep. So this is the direction it goes. This is where we're going. So this idea that he predicted or he had sources that told him Anthony wiener was gonna get arrested for child porn. That's like him saying he predicted 911 Because it's like, everyone knew something was common.

Jordan  10:56
Well, they've been investigating him for child porn ever since they found it like that whole like, we looked on humans computer. Yeah, even and that's where we got new emails. Yeah, the reason they were looking on her computer was to find out if he had pictures of that underage girl, but he was texting. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So if that's what the child porn is,

Dan  11:19
that's that's what the article

Jordan  11:21
because just because she's 16 and not 11 She does this drink is not child porn. Like it's if you're 17 and a half. It's still child porn. Yeah, well, that's how child porn is super weird

Dan  11:35
to me. And I'm not saying that this law is bad. But I think it's a little bit weird because my age are fairly

Jordan  11:40
certain you're about to support child pornography. I'm not I don't know what has privacy. I'm not you're a child pornography. Oh, no. Pizza gates,

Dan  11:50
fake news. It is weird to me. I'm glad that the age of like, what's legal is 18. That's fine. But it is weird to me that there are different ages of consent in different states. And that law doesn't change. Federally, you know what I mean? That is a 16 year old in some states, but you can't take pictures of them. That's bizarre to me.

Jordan  12:11
I'm not saying

Dan  12:12
we should change it. But it's bizarre

Jordan  12:13
i there. I don't think there's any part of any of those laws. That isn't bizarre at any given point in human history. There's no doubt like, you know, human beings are fucked up.

Dan  12:24
Yeah. Especially Anthony Weiner.

Jordan  12:26
Yeah, especially God, he was so good for so long appeared to be well, no, but also he did good things. The problem is he also is a horrible fucking philanderer. Right. Like I don't think he's a bad guy because he fucked around on his wife, though. Who doesn't know I don't know if that's other stuff. Yeah, it's all that other child porn stuff that really bums me out. Yeah, that's but during, during his time in government, he was kicking ass for good people. It did seem that way. He was doing good.

Dan  12:56
But unfortunately, we now end up in the murky waters of something I hoped we'd never have to talk about. It's pizza gate time baby. No first 40 minutes of the show Jabal they talk about pizza gate. And it's so fucked up. Because here's why. Okay, what they are wrestling with Joe, also Joe Rogan. Okay. Alex Jones and Eddie Bravo are all struggling with the fact that pedophilia exists.

Jordan  13:29
Wait, do you like in an existential sense, or in like a is this reality? So

Dan  13:34
they're sort of baffled by it. And because they're baffled, they have to be like, now everyone out there listening. This is real. And, of course, we know, we know.

Jordan  13:44
You didn't do their thing. They discovered pedophilia. No, but they

Dan  13:47
think that no one else believes it's real. And or whatever, everyone else whitewashes it.

Jordan  13:52
Really? I think that's the number one fear for literally every parent on the planet. Right. And they're both parents, so it makes sense. Yeah, it's fine. But I don't think anybody doesn't know about pedophilia. What they

Dan  14:02
don't do a good job of at all is tracking from point A to point B where point A is the pedophiles exist, and some of them have been high powered in the past. Yeah, that does not lead necessarily to there is a ring of pedophiles running the Democratic Party and all of our establishment All right now Alex Jones, his worldview is contingently based on pedophile blackmail, keeping people in line

Jordan  14:31
does have a an underlying narrative of everybody's a pedophile. No, no only way. No, no, no, no, hey, whoa, no gets very aggressive.

Dan  14:39
No, because I don't want you to paint him in a light that's not representative of what he says. Okay. What he has said is that pedophilia is used as blackmail. So people in power don't get out of line. He has in the past multiple times said that in order to become powerful. You have to like, fuck a kid in front of the needs, so then they know that you are you're have no morals and that you can be trusted. And if you get out of line, they've got that on you. He said that before on the show.

Jordan  15:13
Yeah. So so let's say I run for governor I'm running for governor of let's not even call it a good state. Let's call it road. i Let's

Dan  15:22
make it Senate just because we're weird. We

Jordan  15:25
need to get into national we need to get into national politics. All right. I am running for Senator of the great state of New Hampshire, which has a population of nobody knows. So could be a million could be 10 million. Who knows? Me all the people. Maybe most of the country lives in New Hampshire. Nobody knows. They're brilliant about most people can't tell the difference between it and Vermont. Yeah, it's the one that goes down while the other one goes up. Vermont makes a fee. Yeah, it's the it's the stalactite versus this the leg might that's how I remember are gonna help. No, that makes perfect sense. So I'm running for Senate. And I'm on the cusp of let's say getting 40% of the vote right now. The only way I can get over that last hump is if the elites all of them a subsection, oh, the pedophile section? Yeah, the pedophile Control Bureau, I believe is what they're called PCB.

Dan  16:22
Yeah, one of the representatives comes over like slug worth in Willy Wonka, except instead of an everlasting gobstopper, like, hey, hey, Jana, he pulls out his trench coat, and there's a kid inside the trench coat. I mean, like, I don't want to make light of this, because it is a horrible thing. But I believe, quite sincerely, that the what Alex Jones does also makes light of the real problem that it exists in the world.

Jordan  16:48
I mean, if you

Dan  16:51
because he's using it for political gain and political points, as opposed to treating it as a real issue. Yeah, but not

Jordan  16:58
least of which if you are, if you are a boy who cried wolf thing all the time, then that diminishes the effect of actual people who are pedophiles? Yeah,

Dan  17:08
so anyway, let's hear a little bit of nonsense here about pizza gate and one of the WikiLeaks emails that Alex pretty much lies about

Alex Jones  17:18
that tied into that whole pizza gate thing, which again, the media misrepresented what we said and did it came out and all those WikiLeaks all these weird codes,

Unknown Speaker  17:27
okay, like they there was a bunch of weird codes about pizza and about a piece of pizza President Obama

Alex Jones  17:32
wants $65,000 In hotdogs delivered. And they're like, are these really good? Hot dogs? Hot dogs weren't as good last Emily's are succulent on dogs. At least that's not about kittens.

Unknown Speaker  17:44
Do you have to be what is that about?

Alex Jones  17:46
It's male prostitutes. I mean, that's what the code means. Really? Yeah. Okay. Yes.

Unknown Speaker  17:50
How do they get male prostitutes to keep their fucking mouth shut? Well, because bad things happen if you don't federal child porn charges possible for Anthony Weiner.

Alex Jones  17:59
But I'm on record months ago, I'm on record months ago, saying that that's the case because I had those sources. And so the government good elements, the government know what's really going on. So the media that misrepresented and said, Oh, look at 4chan. They're talking about a thing called pizza gate and some pizza place in DC. And the media looks at it and says, Oh, Alex Jones is claiming all this bad stuff happening in his pizza place. I'm like, What is this?

Dan  18:23
What's up? You confused?

Jordan  18:26
4chan?

Dan  18:26
You know about 4chan?

Jordan  18:28
I know about 4chan?

Dan  18:29
Yeah. A lot of investigators at air quotes here.

Jordan  18:33
Have they ever?

Dan  18:36
Okay, what what's the question?

Jordan  18:38
Do they know about 4chan? I know he said the words 4chan?

Dan  18:42
I mean, Alex. Yeah, he knows it exists. Right? Heard of it. He's heard of it. He hasn't gone there.

Jordan  18:47
He was he doesn't know what 4chan is. Right?

Dan  18:50
In my experience. It's mostly people posting like, pictures. Oh, there's pornographic pictures and I'm trying to bully people into killing themselves. Yeah, that's a large part of what it is. Yeah, there are there are separate boards that that discuss anime and paranormal shit and

Jordan  19:08
anime, paranormal, body build and all of it eventually gets down into an anime girl getting fucked by a tentacle monster. Yeah. I like how we said that at the same time. Yeah. Yeah, the Abyss does look back. I don't know if you knew that when you learned this learning

Dan  19:27
back. But the thing is that a lot of the stuff about the codes that were used in emails, a lot of that comes from quote unquote researchers on 4chan and Reddit. And now vote vo at that website vo 80. It's a Reddit had too much censorship. So a lot of people ran over to this new Reddit, Reddit clone, but they get to talk about like there was a whole subreddit dedicated to pizza gate. And then they started Daxing people and so they were like you're banned. We might close this thing down like heroes. They

Jordan  20:00
started Daxing people in the TV show heroes. Yeah, why they started Daxing the TV show heroes. Everybody knew that it went down after the second season or the first season. And there we go.

Dan  20:11
I actually disagree. I think the second season had a lot of legs. Right. I never

Jordan  20:15
watched very alone on this. I don't know. I know. It's a reference that one season was good. And one was bad. I have no that's further down the list safe arguments a good point. Well, I am a pedophile. So

Dan  20:27
the thing is, like a lot of the codes were found to be just completely made up. A lot of it wasn't based on any real slang that exists

Jordan  20:37
in the world. And are the status of those hot dogs though?

Dan  20:40
Well, here's the thing. I mean, that was an email, but it was a guy who was writing that last year Obama ordered, like pizza and hot dogs from Chicago to be flown in. It was $65,000 worth for a big event

Jordan  20:54
right now.

Dan  20:55
Sure, it could have been fucking gay prostitutes to suck off. That's possible. But you know what another also

Jordan  21:01
seems like if you're gonna order that from Chicago, it would actually be pizza and hot dogs

Dan  21:06
from Chicago. We are really weird about pizza

Jordan  21:10
and hot dogs. Yeah, that's kind of our thing. Deep dish

Dan  21:14
pizza is something that people touristy. Especially people are obsessed with nobody who lives here eats and we have a way of making hotdogs. That is absurd. And no one else does.

Jordan  21:24
Yeah, yeah. Cago Are you saying that he might be ordering those two things from his city that are most well known about his city? Yeah, exactly. It's not like it's not like we're Paris and he's ordering fucking flan. I don't know what flan is. Are we gonna go? Let's go with Flon. If it's fun, let's go with flood.

Dan  21:44
So that that is one of the emails that I think gets really probably unfairly misrepresented.

Jordan  21:51
And maybe I mean, let's not even go with unfairly metric misrepresented. Let's I'm just calling flat out bullshit.

Dan  21:57
I'm trying to give it as much leeway as possible in case there's some I don't understand

Jordan  22:04
a local bullshit food.

Unknown Speaker  22:07
You're gonna order pizza

Jordan  22:10
comes from Chicago, right?

Dan  22:11
If you're from Chicago.

Jordan  22:12
Yeah. It's not like a you know, it's not like we're getting kebabs from Chicago. Nobody's saying how great kebabs in Chicago are.

Dan  22:18
If I saw like someone, a senator from Maine, or something like that, ordering like $65,000 of crabs. I'd be like, Yeah, that's probably crap, right? It's not dirty pussy, but it's like

Jordan  22:32
what if you saw him ordering? $65,000 where the pizza and hot dogs from Maine? I saw those are prostitutes. Those are totally prostitute wouldn't be. No, it's just totally prostitutes. Anyway, this

Dan  22:44
clip has a little left. I don't even know if Maine has ever seen a pizza. Well, there's that New Haven style pizza that you seem to love.

Alex Jones  22:52
So they divert some probably innocent pizza place to distract off of all the emails that the the New York Police have. And the FBI have that just this monstrous reported pedophile network. So to discredit that they go create a fake story hoping we jump on it to then divert over to that story. And then once we're on that, it diverts everybody off from Anthony Weiner.

Dan  23:12
What there are a couple of

Jordan  23:19
moments where Joe Rogan's speaking for all of us, Joe responds really

Dan  23:23
well to a couple things. But overall, I've got to give him a great of like C minus in terms of him actually calling Alex out on like, oh, that's just not true, or oops, I don't know about this. Yeah, but

Jordan  23:37
I don't think that I mean, a lot of the times in terms of what we're experienced with Alex Jones, I give Joe way more leeway, as well. You can't know it. Well. It's not just that it's that in this particular instance, Joe does not have that job. Now he is a pure This is our entertainment. And this is all like, he got Alex on there clearly to just be like, look at what this crazy shit. He's gonna say, you know, this

Dan  24:05
is gonna be entertaining. It's for episode 911 goof he's,

Jordan  24:09
and he is perhaps the only person in our field of vision on the Alex Jones situation. Who by no means purports himself to be a journalist. No, no, no. Joe Rogan has never once said, You should listen to me because I tell only the truth. I still maybe as I assume he seems crazy enough to say that.

Dan  24:30
No, I don't think he would ever say that. No. Okay, good. He would say that he's curious and he likes learning things. That is a great approach. Yeah, I will say that after listening to this like three times,

Jordan  24:42
because I had we all weep for you. Yeah,

Dan  24:44
I don't hate Rogen. I don't think that I don't have I didn't lose a ton of respect for him. But I think what he did was bad. I think having Alex Jones on a platform like that on on on his show. Reel. Lee can only serve to humanize him and really only serve to normalize him. So you're saying that you're

Jordan  25:06
taking? You're taking the Trump on Jimmy Fallon show?

Dan  25:09
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't think I don't think that's a positive thing to do. Because you get this guy on and you're like, hey, he's just a normal guy. He's Yeah, I

Jordan  25:17
love this guy. You know, I

Dan  25:19
was like, Rogan is going to be like, Oh, Alex Jones is totally cool.

Jordan  25:23
Ya know, I came from that point of view in this particular situation where, you know, I was like, well, it's not his job. And then you pointed out the Jimmy Fallon thing. And I'm like, Yeah, you're 100%. Right. And then taking another Joe Rogan?

Dan  25:36
No, I'm not saying that. But also taking another piece of it.

Jordan  25:39
I heard he's a pedophile.

Dan  25:41
Come on, man. Don't throw bullshit. I'm sorry. But like, there's a lot of people who I think probably would respond to what I'm doing with Why do you care? And I care because Alex Jones is incredibly relevant. Yeah, he's huge. And everyone's ignoring him because he's a joke. Seemingly

Jordan  26:00
irrelevant,

Dan  26:02
cuz he's a joke. Because like, Oh, look at this. Yeah. So yeah, he's not he's, he's funny, but he's dangerous.

Jordan  26:07
We thought Steve Bannon was a fucking joke. Yeah. And now he's the guy running the country. Yeah, he's on the National Security Council. He's the know we're all gonna He's, he's a white supremacist.

Dan  26:19
So yeah. But Alex, like to the point that Joe Rogan has a huge audience, right? He set records with his appearance, like real, like 65,000 plus people who are streaming it live. And now a day after we're recording this a day after that episode came out. It's been watched over like, 1.5 million times on YouTube. No, yes. I mean, it is something and some of those people are looking for a side show. I understand that. But there's that it's scary as shit.

Jordan  26:50
It is a freak show there is that you are bringing Alex Jones on? Because you're like, look at our weirdo.

Dan  26:56
Yeah, but enough of this enough of this discussion of why things are. Let's get back. Let's get to the fucking clips back to pizza gate. And Joe being this is one of the instances where Joe Rogan is actually pretty dumb.

Unknown Speaker  27:08
Okay, for a lot of people that are good, what the fuck is pizza gate? There was this Ben Swann guy who did this recent piece about it and a lot of people got very angry. Did you see the piece? You see the piece that he did?

Dan  27:19
It's, do you know what he's talking about here? Okay, so this local news guy, Ben Swan did a story about pizza gate. And it was like about just the, you know, the broad strokes of it. And it was like a TV piece about what people had found on Reddit and stuff like that. Okay. And people is like a primer. Yeah. And I have a lot of complaints about it, but I'll get to them after this clip has finished. All right.

Unknown Speaker  27:45
seemed to me to be pretty measured. And he was making some connections to between that little that's that symbol for child pedophilia. Yes. And we're just pedophilia, right? And the logo for the pizza place. He also made did he make the Hastert connection with Podesta? Well, we pastored confirmed child molester and best buddies with Podesta and former Speaker of the House and then you expand on that. But let's let's do it step at a time. Okay, this is really kind of important stuff. So that's all 100% True, right? work. So it's true that Hastur it's in jail. It's true that Hastert is a known pedophile that a judge called a serial pedophile, right? Yes, true. Is 100% It's true that Podesta was friends with Hastert that's 100% Right? Yes. And then all this other stuff now becomes odd. Doesn't it become odd and but if you say it's odd, if you look at it, this Ben Swann guy with this what I thought was, he was just kind of expressing what is weird about this case. And when he did it, he got so much shit over it. I was kind of shocked. I was kind of shocked people calling him a moron. And

Alex Jones  28:48
listen, I got the same thing. But but that's what I'm saying. They build a straw man.

Dan  28:51
So people were calling him a moron, not because he covered a topic, but because he did not adhere to any of the rules of journalism. When you're doing a story. You reach out to sources, when you're doing a story, you fact check things. And when he did this, all he did is regurgitate things that were found on conspiracy blogs, and on Reddit and vote and these sorts of things without doing any checking on it. Absolutely none.

Jordan  29:18
So you're saying that he was a moron? Yeah, absolutely. Gotcha. People have

Dan  29:23
such a misunderstanding of what journalism is. It's a very hard job. Because you have to you, you have to dig in. You have to try and get people to talk to you. In order to publish something in a mainstream publication. You can't just have one source for things. You have to double verify things. I know it's, I have friends who are journalists, it's insanely hard.

Jordan  29:47
Did they just do fake news?

Dan  29:48
Do this put out Dirty?

Jordan  29:50
Dirty nasty? Yes. No. Well, here's here's what I think it is. Here's what I think it is. It is that we've gotten to this point now where everything is so utterly and completely baffling to the baby boomer generation. Like it just moved to god damn fast for them. Other generations, you were the same for, like, all the way from your great grandfather to your great grandchild. Yeah, you pretty much live the same life. Our grandparents went from, you know, I don't know, horses, to where now we can fly with our feet. Like it's, it's all moved really, really quickly for them. Sure. So the natural reaction to somebody who is or for somebody who is you know, let's call that let's call them simple, okay, is to want a simple solution. So rather than complicate things with multiple sources and verifying things, you just want a big strong man to tell you what to do. And that is how we got our goddamn president. But

Dan  30:54
I think it even goes to our generation and younger too, because with the proliferation of the internet, and how easy it is to set up your own shop, you can just report things and just say they're true.

Jordan  31:07
Yeah, but that's not exactly a new phenomenon there. No, that's true. Like, that's what we're talking about. You know, William Randolph Hearst, all the way better. 100. Yeah, make sure

Dan  31:18
just make shit up. But like, there's this guy,

Jordan  31:21
I would actually argue that our generation now is much better at filtering that stuff out than you might imagine. I think some are, some are historically speaking, I would say overall, I would say overall, well, we're just like, just like, statistically speaking, crime has gone down. Everybody thinks it's the opposite. Because our personal experience tells us otherwise. That's a fair point. If you learn more about statistic,

Dan  31:43
or, you know, I dwell in this bullshit world. So I see a bad Sam. Right?

Jordan  31:47
Well, and I mean, you go to awareness, and education, and all this stuff, and who's working harder, and the prevailing narrative from that older generation is always going to be, you know, these kids don't do it like I do. And when you go to the actual math of it, it's always true that generations wind up getting better at education getting better at all of this shit. Yeah, it is. It is hard to divorce ourselves from that, like snap judgment. But math is math all the time. It's math all the time. It never stops being math.

Dan  32:21
That's why it's math. Yeah. So we have one more clip here about pizza gate.

Alex Jones  32:25
Talking about we'll have the kids ready, six, seven, and eight in the hot tub at this time. And there, we don't see anything like that. Oh, it gets you gets really weird it say that. There's 1000s of them.

Unknown Speaker  32:37
But it said, we'll get the kids in the hot tub. Yes. I never saw that. Can you? Can you see if you can find that, Jim? That seems like he doesn't the whole thing. So

Alex Jones  32:47
we're gonna have the kids delivered for entertainment. There'll be in the hot tub. Now, these are great kids. But kids can be kids.

Dan  32:53
I mean, he's referring to an email that does exist in those WikiLeaks, but he's totally misrepresenting what it says. It's a lady who's saying that these kids will be dropped off, to be looked after babysitting, whatever. And she does refer to them as entertainment. But not as entertainment. She says you, she's saying that there'll be these three kids. So you'll be entertained. And it's like a parent saying like, Good luck. Good luck with these kids. It's like, you're not going to be bored. Because these kids are ages seven to 11. They're rambunctious as fuck, right?

Jordan  33:29
They it's interesting how any, any and all idioms that we use, just like in daily conversation. If you pull them out of context, in email with any kind of agenda, all of a sudden that ATM looks like your child. Yeah.

Dan  33:43
And they do and the lady who's emailing John Podesta does say they will be in that pool, which you could take as oh, we're gonna get those bodies wet. Or it could be I hope like to swim ever

Jordan  33:54
hear you say that again? Right? But ever again. Don't even don't even look at me in the eye for the next 10 minutes after you said that.

Dan  34:01
If my parents had email back when I was a kid, they would have said something like Dan's gonna be in that pool. I love to swim. I loved it. And we were to poured out

Jordan  34:11
Dan's gonna be in that pool. Yeah, no doubt if I can believe Dan's in that pool. Yeah,

Dan  34:15
no, it's it's insane to me, because you can find whatever you want to find wherever you want to find it. And that is a perfect instance of that. And the way that he's lasciviously presenting it while he's talking about the media misrepresenting him yeah is so fucking insane.

Jordan  34:31
It's really disgusting because it it doesn't have that ring of disgust to it. It has more of that tabloid ring of like, no almost Oh wing. Let me tell you about this. You know, that kind of a thing where

Dan  34:44
I didn't pull the clip later when he's like, almost going into a J slash Oh, fantasy. Yeah. Where he's talking about, like the globalists taking your kids out of backyards. And then like, it's just a big guy comes up behind them and punches him in the head. Yeah,

Jordan  34:58
so it seems like Justin Joining. Well, it's like it to me it Do you remember that scene in the original matrix? Where they go through that office? Lobby, and they fucking shoot everybody up? And it's 20 minutes of just slow mo. Yeah, that whole thing. Yeah, that is a jerk off. festa violence. Yeah. Like there's no, there's no other way to describe that.

Dan  35:22
There's a second of every moment of bullet ism. Yeah, exactly.

Jordan  35:25
And it's, it's just lovingly, like, just masturbator masturbatory

Dan  35:32
the differences in that case, there was sort of like an interesting, artistic thing that they were doing. And in this case, Alex is just trying to convince you of things that aren't true. Yeah.

Jordan  35:41
But it's still that same kind of point of view. Yeah. Where you're, you're turning it into a fantasy. You're turning this horrifying thing. Yeah. of people being shot again and again, and again, horrifying into this, like, oh, yeah, you know, you don't like this, you know, you don't like it. Yeah, but I'm gonna tell you about it.

Dan  36:01
I do think it's appropriate, though, that we give our tip of the hat to things that Alex is good at. And one of them is skirting, slander laws, and the other is completely contradicting himself like a huge hypocrite. Okay, he does both of these in this clip. Wonderful. Now, be careful, because the second part comes kind of quick

Jordan  36:23
microphone doubt.

Unknown Speaker  36:24
So it's one of those things

Alex Jones  36:26
like anything, and you're not saying that I'm not either. That's what's really important. I never even really covered this stuff. And then they had me on the news, and also Swan going. They said these people were killing kids in a basement, they say, okay, Megyn Kelly went on and took a clip, where I was talking about Hillary's funding to hotties and Obama back in the Arab Spring that killed 10s of 1000s of people, hundreds of 1000s of people 1000s of children. Now, al Qaeda was putting kids which is ISIS, into sex slavery, they edited that out and then cut it together on Fox News, with me saying and Hillary Clinton rapes and kills children in a basement at ping pong pizza, they literally now edit audio, but I was able to change your audio, I was able to go find the day with video with what I really said and throw it back in their face.

Dan  37:13
That the the will get to the hypocrisy.

Jordan  37:16
And that did not happen the way you said it did. Did they edit his audio?

Dan  37:19
Not quite? Well. A perfectly honest version of what happened was Alex is spiritually correct.

Jordan  37:28
And that well, he did a worst kind of correct.

Dan  37:32
I just want to say though, first before we talk about that the way they're like, I'm not saying anyone's doing anything.

Jordan  37:36
Yeah, I know. It's, it's such a cowardly dodge.

Dan  37:41
If you stand up you

Jordan  37:43
people people are saying, I'm not saying but I'm hearing from people, that their child pornographers, I'm not saying I would never say such a good way to not have to go to court. Yeah, that would be a bad thing for me to say I would never say but the story is that I'm reporting that other people

Dan  38:00
that say does that like three times in this episode? Of course, it's so smart but it also shows your cards a little bit and that you don't believe what you're saying? It's not smart. It's boldface? No It's smart. Because if he didn't he could get sued. Yeah, but then open yourself up to some really dangerous

Jordan  38:17
that's that's not smart. That's a low cunning well find that's it that's it that's harder than the league well I mean yeah, it's it's not it's self destructive, but it's not smart. Not smart is to not do this

Dan  38:31
entirely. So he's not like Dinesh D'Souza.

Jordan  38:34
Dinesh is self destructive as fuck. And then the thing about

Dan  38:37
Megyn Kelly,

Jordan  38:39
Anthony Weiner is Yeah, no doubt. Also, before we go any further, al Qaeda is not ISIS for the 10,000,000th time. Okay. It is not ISIS. Is al Qaeda. ISIS. Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Okay.

Dan  38:54
They feel similar. If you don't know anything they Yeah.

Jordan  38:58
Well, you mean they have the same skin color? That's it. That is it. Correct. Nailed it.

Dan  39:03
But the thing about making Kelly's hatchet job on him what he's correct in the sense that they

Jordan  39:12
that is that would be my favorite Judy Blume novel, The thing about Megyn Kelly.

Dan  39:18
They took something sort of out of context. So in their piece about pizza gate that they were doing and about how the Internet has sensationalized things and what have you. They played a clip of Alex Jones. He's coming in from break and that sooner or later gonna be waiting in the background of course ruined own for a long time. Okay. And he's like, I got a message for Hillary Clinton. Of course. He's just like, he's doing a fucking shoot promo on her like he's a fucking wrestler. Jesus, he's just doing this like, I'm not afraid to you because you you know you kill and murder. He's like Hillary Clinton has killed and murdered 1000s of Children, she has personally raped children and all this. So he says, like, you

Jordan  40:05
can't take that out of contact. No, but And when you say personally, it seems like you're saying personally Yeah, like she the person now they

Dan  40:13
cut at the end of that. And then on his show what he ended up saying is I'm not talking about this pizza gate kind of stuff. I'm talking about her killing Christians and funding Islamic terrorism and stuff like

Jordan  40:28
that. All right. So the way he backs it off is to say I said all of this stuff, but what I mean is she did this like twice removed through the military or her Yeah, all right. But But he still had he also said he did he personally did it.

Dan  40:42
Yeah. He it's it's a it's a tactic. It's, you know, it's sensational. It gets you attention, and it baits people into taking you out of context rich,

Jordan  40:50
which of course they did, which then gives him the grievance to act like the victim. It's

Dan  40:56
like Richard Spencer getting punched. Yes, it's just like, Milo complaining that people don't want him to speak on there.

Jordan  41:02
They all need to be punched. Yeah, they need to be punched so hard.

Dan  41:05
So anyway, this club slapped on by wow, that's really blatant. It's not but

Jordan  41:12
was that the end of the clip? No. Oh, God, I wish it was I forgot that. Really? She had paused it with that one little sentence to go knowing that you had that in your back.

Dan  41:21
I don't have this prepared that well. It's what we're gonna get to is the rank hypocrisy just on display and Alex admitting to it and who cares?

Unknown Speaker  41:33
That's uh, where's this? Can we watch this? Where's this that they did? Sure. I think you guys have the comparison of the two up.

Alex Jones  41:38
Yeah. It's something like Megyn Kelly caught a giant lie against Alex Jones trying to

Unknown Speaker  41:42
find that we should we should play that. First of all, Megan Kelly. So pretty, she'd say whatever the fuck she wants.

Alex Jones  41:49
I think she looks like an old trainee. I love her.

Unknown Speaker  41:53
Old training. Hilarious. No, I don't like old trainees but I think she's hot. You don't like you don't think

Alex Jones  41:59
Megyn Kelly is not just want to insult you. She's a globalist? Oh, she's global. Obviously. She's pretty.

Dan  42:04
Oh, boy.

Jordan  42:07
No, yeah, that's

Dan  42:08
not okay. No, we have not we have illustrated on multiple occasions, the incredible lengths he goes to insult her based on her appearance, and all this stuff. And now he's on Rogen admitting Yeah, she's really pretty. I just want to make fun of her. That's not okay. No, if you want to have any pretenses of journalism, if you want to pretend that you're standing up for the truth, and you yourself are just like, I'm a bully, because she's on this other imaginary side that I'm against.

Jordan  42:39
That don't saying so what but, but here's what I think his rationale, at least if I'm going to try and engage him on his level, here's his rationale. Even though she is a woman in journalism, To him, it feels like punching up. Right? So she's a very beautiful woman. She's a very successful woman. You know, yada, yada. Yeah, she's done all of this stuff. She's not psychotic. She's not that kind of, so she's ahead of Alex Jones. And all of the way she's not

Dan  43:11
relegated into having a business entirely based on selling fake pills. Yeah,

Jordan  43:15
exactly. So to him that must feel like he's punching up instead of punching down right. Now, that to humans is crazy. Yeah. But well, I can I can at least understand why he can rationalize that in his own mind.

Dan  43:31
Alex doesn't believe in privilege, though, too. So he doesn't believe that because he's white and male. He has any privilege

Jordan  43:38
every single time. I do my best to come to his defense, you immediately come back with why that is the dumbest thing I could say. Well, but I am trying so hard in his worldview,

Dan  43:49
that is sort of Oh, also, if you're listening, we're 40 minutes into this. How are we 40 minutes into this so it's gonna be fucking long as shit. Oh, gee, I want to say this. Don't turn it off. Because at the end shit gets fucked up.

Jordan  44:02
Are you telling our audience not to turn it off?

Dan  44:04
I'm just I'm getting self conscious. Yeah, okay, because this could be two and a half hours. We've

Jordan  44:09
already done several two and a half hours. Oh, yeah. Okay, good point. All right. How about we do this instead? That's let's break it. Let's fucking Run The Jewels fast on

Dan  44:20
that. Let's try this next clip. We're we've now gotten out of the murky waters of pizza gate, and we are getting into something about I believe that this Oh, man, I gotta do so. Okay. This one's about the Iraq War and Afghanistan. And what I would say that this is a lie about a lie, which is interesting.

Alex Jones  44:42
All right. We're doubling down. Ronald Reagan did know about the cocaine dealing. I talked to folks that were involved actually, for the point. He says I want communist knocked out Congress, given the funding they go what you do in the government as you go, the president said do this. We're men of action. We're going to do it. So then there's cocaine already being sold. The contras are using it to get all their funding. We'll see That will just jacket, bring it in using private contractors, right? And then if there

Unknown Speaker  45:04
ever was my first time they did it. But yeah, it was it was a common tactic. They knew that there was money that was being made from selling illegal drugs, why would they let that money be made all around them? They're not going to that's

Alex Jones  45:16
the argument is you don't want to let the communist do all the cocaine and heroin dealing or because then they have more money than you. Well,

Unknown Speaker  45:21
what the fuck is going on in Afghanistan, it's just this crazy people how much heroin production went up since our occupation, anybody

Alex Jones  45:29
can pull this up again, that's what's frustrating is a lot of the fake liberals that see myself as a real liberal, but liberals just go, Oh, that's a lot of stuff. So you can search engine opium production in Afghanistan, pre 2001. And then look at the latest years, it's come out in like 2014 15, it went from 3% of world supply to 7% to 30%. And after 10 years of occupation, it went to 93%. Look at it as terrible supply.

Unknown Speaker  45:55
So look at the heck just went from

Dan  45:59
memory. So the reason that's a lie about a lie is that I don't think that most liberals that I know, deny that at all. Now, the idea that there is a real weird thing going on with opium production in Afghanistan.

Jordan  46:15
You know what I wouldn't who or let's say I wouldn't call it woke. I wouldn't call it weird at all. I would call it the absolute result of demolishing a country. Yeah. But then do you know what happens to militia countries actual economy, they have to switch to something that they can do without any fucking Yeah, of course.

Dan  46:34
And we seem to have a vested interest in protecting that and helping it. So it's a little bit weird, but it is weird how like, we have a stake in it. It's crazy. And I don't think that most liberal people that I know, most people on our side of the fence,

Jordan  46:49
what about the fake liberal people? You know, fuck,

Dan  46:51
I don't know. Well,

Jordan  46:52
we all know there's only one real liberal Alex Jones, Alex Jones,

Dan  46:56
but then also the lie about the it went from 3% to 97%, or whatever, the 3% 83%. The 90, or the 3% statistic is taken from when we were invading. Right. And of course, we destroyed everything.

Jordan  47:10
Yeah. So it's easy to do the idea that turns out when you all your bombs do all the stuff super easy. If you look

Dan  47:16
at the graphs of the percent of opium production, it was it's like flat, like way down here and then back up to like, I don't know what it'd be, like 40 or so. And then it is a big rise. Really? Yeah. But I mean, they make that much opium they make tons of opium. That's a lot of opiates a perfect climate for it. That's the thing. That's a good point. You know, a lot of these a lot of these drugs are dependent on opium also, fucking Opium is awesome. I smoked a lot of opium in college.

Jordan  47:47
I wonder why so many people are addicted to opiates? Yeah, I mean, because it's because it's not great. I took

Dan  47:53
painkillers a couple times in my life, and I didn't really enjoy them so much. And to be fair, opium was really it was just because you smoke it with weed. Right? So it wasn't much better than just being high. But the smell was amazing. smell of burning Opium is so delicious.

Jordan  48:10
Well, if I remember correctly from Legends of the Fall, I know that you can do it on a boat real good. Yeah, I'm

Dan  48:17
sure. But also, this is important. I'm admitting to some past drug use. And it's important to come up later. But I

Jordan  48:26
wonder is I will not admit to my past drug use.

Dan  48:28
I want to be clear. We're not squares. I'm sitting here drinking some wine. You've got some whiskey.

Jordan  48:34
Yes, in honor of how drunk Alex Jones has been. Oh, drink whiskey straight.

Dan  48:42
He's so mad that people think he was drunk when he

Jordan  48:45
was drunk. So I if you're mad that people are drunk that just the earth if you're mad that people think you're drunk. That just proves you're so much more drunk,

Dan  48:54
it means that you have a much bigger problem than you're admitting. Yeah, like if people thought that I was way too drunk regularly, legitimately real talk. My reaction would be please talk to me more about this. I want to know your perspective. I want to know if you think I should get help. Be my response would not like fuck you. I wasn't drunk. Anyway, this next clip, Eddie Bravo has some questions. A Bravo's questions corner his questions ask Alex about

Jordan  49:26
why. Before we go any further. Here's my here's my app on a clean take. Can we isolate all of his questions and then create an Eddie Bravo's questions corner?

Dan  49:37
I doubt it. Too much. Crosstalk

Jordan  49:39
All right. I have dreams but we'll fight we'll be we'll be fine. And

Dan  49:43
I'm not creating more work for myself. This is so hard.

Jordan  49:47
Anyway, no, it's super easy in my chair just being the guy who laughs like an idiot.

Dan  49:51
I had like five hours of prep. Not including listening to this show. But I had to do it. You just get to Walton. My job's easy. You Anyway, he wants to know why people think that Infowars is fake news. Okay?

Eddie Bravo  50:05
Now what Alex, why do you explain the fake news? Cya? Why do a lot of people out there think Infowars is total fake news? Why do they think that

Alex Jones  50:13
that is a major deep state government program funded by Soros mainly and they found the most effective way is anti Israel bashing. And so this came on the WikiLeaks last year that US intelligence leak not the Russians that he's in there saying we're going to overthrow Israel we got to deal with Saudi Arabia and we've got to like up the ante with anti Israel rhetoric I'm somebody that was neutral in Israel never been there had nothing to do with it Israel has liberals conservatives some good administration some bad but I'm not anti Israel it's a tiny little place I know it does some things that are bad compared to what we've done it's nothing so I just don't have giant heart on for Israel you know wanting to hurt him and I'm not against the Palestinians or anybody else everybody knows that show show when they kill Israelis for no reason I say it's wrong when a white phosphorus bomb Palestinians I say it's wrong

Dan  51:00
so that I mean that's not an

Jordan  51:02
answer. That's not an answer, but I I'm happy that he's against I don't think random killings I know that what we're supposed to take away from this sure

Dan  51:12
but I think he's starting to say he's fair, but I don't think that the track record really backs that up. No, of course not be that it's also

Jordan  51:18
I like I like that. I feel like psyops was Kenny was Bravo being as smart as

Dan  51:27
he possibly could there well he gives away that he listens to Alex

Jordan  51:31
ups like all like all of this I ups you know, you know, psyops I'm I'm a guy who knows about psyops you ever sign up. He repeatedly says that he listens to Alex every day. So really, oh, boy, anyway. And then there's also the WikiLeaks, the US leaks, not the Russian leaks, because we always have to make sure that the Russians are taken care of

Dan  51:51
well, but yeah, it's it's the people inside of the government leaked it. It's part of his counter coup narrative. Right, right. Anyway, this clip isn't done. Let's see if he comes up with an answer.

Alex Jones  52:02
Show. I'm sitting there covering all that. And then they just put out that I'm this Israeli agent, you know, all day long. Or I'm the CIA. Let's

Unknown Speaker  52:10
not get into these crazy rants about crazy accusations.

Unknown Speaker  52:15
Why do they think Info Wars Wars is fake news? I don't know you that a lot of people out there smart people really intelligent. They they think that the real news is CNN.

Alex Jones  52:25
Okay. Well, let me explain. You've got attacks from below and above, you've got major funding by Soros and others who's a real life Nazi collaborator, like true, Dr. Evil, which again, is not true. No, the latest James Bond was based on his real a company that's even named after his company. The bad guy in the movies is really was actually Soros. Yeah, he tried to crash the pound bring down England, he's really bad news. So mi 618. But long story short about George Soros. He's funding this attack on me and any independent media, how do you attack independent media, when the public's awake to Deep State and Government stuff? You say Alex Jones is the government. And then they always ignore real facts. I talk about her I admit. So my family of stuff does work for the government. And they said the garbage was corrupted out of control. That isn't even a real debate. But but above that, what was your other question?

Unknown Speaker  53:12
He had a question. I

Jordan  53:13
think he only has one.

Unknown Speaker  53:17
And he let me let me just explained, it's pretty easy. They're in direct competition with him. If it's Fox News, if it's CNN, if it's anybody that's distributing news, you're in direct competition with someone who has an independent news organization, they operate it themselves, they do an online show to shut it perfectly. Well,

Dan  53:32
that's one theory that

Jordan  53:34
it's a very logical theory No, really is if you aren't, if you're not really thinking about it, it does have its own logic of like, okay, why there is a monetary interest from CNN to say that these independent news outlets are fake. Yeah. So don't go listen to them. Come listen to us. That makes sense. Yeah. On a pure level, well, until you think for two seconds, and you see all of the competing news industries, how very many there are and how all of those industries are united in saying Alex Jones is full of shit.

Dan  54:12
Yeah, yeah. But then also you look at all of the people who are in alternative media, and like a lot of these people have fairly I don't know how to describe it. They don't do their due diligence in terms of journalism. Like they just spout bullshit, that's sensational. And it gets reposted repeatedly. Right? And it's all attention grabbing shit. I would assume. I don't know if this is entirely true. But I would assume that people who are legitimate journalists would fucking hate Alex Jones, because he doesn't do the work. Yeah, doesn't do the actual job of journalism. And it didn't means the work that they do. It is

Jordan  54:55
it is interesting though, how we're what we're really doing is turning journalists into diamonds. Like the ones are the only people who are still in journalism are not paid well know, the investigative journalists we have now are Yeah, exactly. And now it's even less than in their heyday. Yeah. And the ones who are doing investigative journalism now our fucking true believers. Yeah. Like these are people who will fight and die for a story. Yeah. So I was one of them. I would put out a hit on on Alex Jones. Like you're you're making a mockery of everything that I believe in.

Dan  55:38
And I think that anybody who has a full awareness of what goes into journalism, and the importance of journalism, would recognize the dangers of someone like him becoming super popular, especially because part of what he's espousing is that you guys are fake. Yeah. And our enemy. So you're demonizing the people who do the actual work while you don't? Yeah, it makes total sense that they would hate him take away the financial aspect of it. Yeah, it's nonsense but

Jordan  56:13
but if you have the financial aspect of it, you're much more you're much more effective in getting that kind of gullibility from people because in and and it's a legitimate criticism for literally all aspects of our lives right now where it's like, it is always that instinct of like, follow the money Yeah. Who's profiting off of Bono who's profiting off of this?

Dan  56:36
Alex even sells a shirt that says Cui bono Okay, so here I gotta

Jordan  56:42
say I would I would sell a shirt that says free Bono

Dan  56:45
as a quick query Boehner. Anyway, here is where the show gets good. excellent. Up till this point, we're

Jordan  56:52
an hour in but up to this point, ladies and gentlemen, disavow this previous hour and now it's time to get into the show a lot

Dan  57:00
of that was just like preamble a little bit. Now we start cooking with gas let's do it. This clip that I'm about to play is the first instance of ALEKS teasing that he's about to break some big news Oh, and then what do you think he does we're bringing a little Info Wars to the Joe Rogan What is What do you think he does? I'm gonna go with he reveals all of his sources

Jordan  57:22
and tells us exactly what it is he's about to get he's about to tell us right correct.

Dan  57:26
But here you're not close.

Alex Jones  57:28
Well, I know these topics can be quite frankly exhausting they are for they are but but I'd like to show them today. Really get into the big picture and what I believe is really going on because I figured out the basis of what's happening. And I'm gonna let you I mean if you want here some follow up stuff today. Okay, because we experienced I mean, I'll go through it. Okay, let's go. Okay, let me take a piss then. Go ahead

Dan  57:58
what a total asshole

Jordan  57:59
is pure fucking Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Level Ball teasing

Dan  58:05
that is unfiltered. Right? That's amazing. I can't tell you

Jordan  58:10
we're gonna do this huge revelation. After the break.

Dan  58:16
We'll be on dealer no deal Yeah, no

Jordan  58:17
shit fuck you. told I

Dan  58:20
look I figured out the truth of the universe figured out that I gotta pee.

Jordan  58:24
Let me tell you something. Do you know what the meaning of life the universe and everything is? I'm going to tell you after I go to the bathroom real quick.

Dan  58:35
So anyway, here's when he gets back from bathroom like three minutes later which is a long pice you might have he might have been doing something and

Jordan  58:44
it's only a long pass if you're, you know, unused to the pressures of

Dan  58:50
Super Male Vitality. exactly. I

Jordan  58:52
was gonna say like, that's a man with prostate issues going left to right.

Dan  58:56
Here's Alex coming out of the bathroom. That represents the

Unknown Speaker  59:01
foxes totally. No matter what.

Unknown Speaker  59:04
Come on. Get one Freddy Bravo two. Let's get crazy. Bring out the hatch.

Unknown Speaker  59:08
I hope that people that listen to your show the people that have never given

Alex Jones  59:13
nervous I want to get going for a while. Let's do it. Let's do it.

Dan  59:15
Bring out the whiskey. So this is where whiskey comes into it. That's what I was hoping to hear. He comes out of the bathroom with a bottle of Jack Daniels gentleman's Jack. Okay. And from this course he does from this point. He does not stop drinking. excellent. And like, you know, it's not like he's chugging it or anything like that. Just kind of chugging it. Yeah. And it's really marked. You can really tell Oh, boy, and this is where we're going to have to start introducing a slight little bit of pity. Oh, Alex. There are a couple of moments that actually made me very sad.

Jordan  59:58
Oh no.

Dan  1:00:00
I believe that he has a problem with alcohol. Okay, some of his behaviors suggest that he is unable to control himself. Oh, boy. And listen, I don't want to go around diagnosing people.

Jordan  1:00:13
That is not our responsibility. And it's dangerous for laymen to do it. But

Dan  1:00:17
what I glimpsed from this, a lot of these behaviors remind me of some of the worst drunks that we know in the comedy scene. Excellent. And he, if anybody other than Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo, were in that room, I think there was be the potential for Alex Jones his career to be ruined by his. Yeah, he gets real drunk. Excellent. So anyway, here's the next clip. This is him teasing information again. And then we have some evidence that Joe Rogan has never listened to Alex Jones as actual.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:52
Okay, don't hold that whiskey hostage. Alex Jones.

Alex Jones  1:00:55
Listen, let me give you guys the big frickin data. Okay. I'm willing to give it to you. Okay. I'm not bullshitting. I got the thing figured out.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:02
Pour one for Eddie.

Alex Jones  1:01:03
I gotta figure it out. Guys.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:07
Pour a little more from me. All right, gentlemen. Cheers.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:10
I'm gonna keep my mouth shut

Unknown Speaker  1:01:12
Robin experience cheers to you Alex Jones. Here's a you buddy. But stuff people were so on one side or the other when it comes to this there's so much anticipation regarding there's so much bullying about don't have Alex Jones

Alex Jones  1:01:25
on it. But

Jordan  1:01:27
do we don't make those noises? Right?

Dan  1:01:30
Those? Oh, no, we do not.

Jordan  1:01:34
We don't do that we that sectional? grossest thing I've ever heard right. Listening. We all want to die. Right.

Dan  1:01:39
Listening to Alex Jones breathe. It makes me sick. And I hate saying that. Because it sounds like I don't want to breathe.

Jordan  1:01:46
I well. I mean, you. Look, I'm not I'm not saying that. I'm saying I don't want him to breathe. I'm saying that I'm reporting that I have a lot of sources telling me that they don't want him to breathe anymore. A couple

Dan  1:01:58
people that we know did a podcast through the Laugh Factory Podcast Network. I tried to give it a listen. And I'm like, dudes, half of this podcast is you guys breathing in? So hard to listen to love? And there's so much of that now it's anyway. Here we go here. This is where Alex or Joe shows his unawareness of Alex's actual positions on things. Gotcha.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:26
Oh, there was a lot of that there was a lot of Google calm on his racist shit. Someone said that to me. Alex Jones is one of the least racist people you'll ever fucking meet your life. I've never even heard you say a racial thing. Race so inconsequential to you. I'm in music and what their stance you've never discussed race ever. In the almost what do I know? You 16 Fucking 17 years. I've never heard you discuss race at all. So someone calling you a racist? Like, we're gonna

Dan  1:02:53
leave that without comment. I don't really think we need to get into Yeah,

Jordan  1:02:55
do we have refer to previous episodes? Yeah. Oh, let's just let that sit. Yeah, no neck club. So

Dan  1:03:05
this is a clip where they're talking about grabbing them by the pussy. And Alex does a remarkable spin job for Donald Trump and lies his ever loving balls off

Unknown Speaker  1:03:17
as Donald Trump's in the kk k is if Donald Trump, are you sure he's racist? Are you sure there's

Alex Jones  1:03:22
any discrimination? hires gay guys are seen as in hotels, and his friends with them. And like gave interviews of the advocate 20 years ago. It's all just complete made up horse crap. He's waving a rainbow flag at the RNC speech. He says Republicans have stopped being mean to gay people and have to be inclusive. And he's about to enforce civil rights laws for gays and others. And they're calling him a literal homophobe. Now, let's get on.

Jordan  1:03:47
And the most recent executive order that they've drafted is him removing any and all protections to the LGBT community. Well, legalizing fucking complete and full on discrimination against them. Well, anyways,

Dan  1:03:59
I agree. But the opposite approach to that is like, Hey, man, why can't you let Christians be Christians? Right. So actions speak louder than word Christians being Christians. Yeah, I don't believe I don't believe that Trump unnecessarily hates gay people, but I think he doesn't care. I don't

Jordan  1:04:15
think he has anything to do with it. I think it's purely Mike Pence. Probably Bannon, but, but you know, he's Donald Trump. He's just gonna sign whatever the fuck is in front of him.

Dan  1:04:24
Yeah, that's entirely possible. Anyway, here's the here we go.

Alex Jones  1:04:28
Upside Down BS

Unknown Speaker  1:04:29
man. This but this is my problem with it. My problem with it is that people want to use a real you're a bigot you're this You're that they want to come up with a nice quick label

Alex Jones  1:04:40
that officially makes them that makes

Dan  1:04:43
it so again, I wanted to I didn't mean to cut there but I want to cut just to talk about this for a second. There's this idea going around and Alex pitches that a lot and a lot of like Owen Shroyer is really big on this one of his reporters. This idea that you You being called a racist is worse than racism, essentially, of course, the idea that it's like an attack on you to have some racist behaviors pointed out, and that it's a control mechanism. And I think that that is dumb on one level. I mean, that's

Jordan  1:05:20
the softest response you could possibly get. Well, I'm trying to be charitable. Yeah, you're being charitable, but what it really is is fucking evil. It's abusive. It is abusive. It's that's like saying to a wife beater. Like, oh, you know, I just don't don't point out his failings. You know, he's trying hard not to be a wife beater. So he's not a wife beater. He slips up and beats ever No Yeah, I don't know what he wants to do. It's not that he does it all the time. I'm not sure I'll have wife beating leanings

Dan  1:05:50
I'm not sure that that analogy is perfect. Because I

Jordan  1:05:55
I am offended by your insinuation that I'm not perfect. Well,

Dan  1:05:59
I think it comes back to this idea that like refusing to acknowledge the privilege is real like it comes back to that in many ways if we

Jordan  1:06:07
were if we were just talking about that we would be in a whole different conversation we're talking about Alex fucking Jones being straight up racist, right but but as well as straight up racist,

Dan  1:06:17
I want to take that away from it slightly and just look at the idea that calling someone a racist is a way to gain power over them. That is not what people are doing

Jordan  1:06:28
if it was man shit would be a lot better right? Well, it's the same thing we actually gain power over races by that that the world will be way better Well, the idea is to only make them fucking stronger

Dan  1:06:41
you can shut them up and you can other people by calling them a racist when they're not racist as opposed

Jordan  1:06:46
to just othering them by race.

Dan  1:06:49
Right? I mean, it's it's it's super complicated, but it's it's the same as this idea of like, calling the alt right Nazis is trying to other them when people were calling them Nazis are doing that because seem to be in bed with some literal Nazi.

Jordan  1:07:07
They're Nazis. So they're Nazis. Yeah, they're literal Nazi there, are you if you can't be offended, like if I look at a rock, and I go, Oh, that's an alt tree. No, not okay. That's a fucking Nazi. Because it really Nazi rock.

Dan  1:07:22
Yeah. So anyway,

Jordan  1:07:24
let's get back to me. All rocks are Nazis. Let's

Dan  1:07:26
get back to policy grabbing bullshit. Let's get back to Fuzzy

Unknown Speaker  1:07:31
finds you and then you have to defend yourself. Look, you said it best at the beginning as Donald Trump is not perfect. He's a man. He's also a super ambitious, super wealthy man. It's constantly on the go. And those kinds of dudes are type a hyper aggressive personalities. And he's definitely said some shit. He shouldn't have said, right. Don't you agree? Like, we all do. Yeah. And this, the big one is one that he said in confidence with that Billy Bush guy, the grabbing by the pussy thing. That's the big one who

Alex Jones  1:07:58
has it in confidence. Especially if you're famous said Man, it's crazy. Women throw themselves on you. You can do anything you want. A woman's climbing up on top of you. You can do whatever you want. That's what mammals do. She's showing she wants it. She gets it. Sexual Assault. It's pure horse created

Unknown Speaker  1:08:13
if a woman said hey, I just I could just see it in their eyes. I could just go and grab him in the balls. We wouldn't. We wouldn't allow for fucking

Unknown Speaker  1:08:21
Rihanna just talked about her. She fucking he got she wants his walks up to him grabs by the deck, we'll be like, totally, we would think it's amazing. The

Unknown Speaker  1:08:29
sound of my group is he wasn't talking about that he hides behind bushes and ropes for joggers reaches out in

Unknown Speaker  1:08:35
context. Out of context. He's having a guy conversation, right? Like he described it as locker room. But this is the recording. I got this. And this is not defending it. I mean, it's definitely something he should have said probably agree to that. But yes, it is. What is he really doing? He's really,

Jordan  1:08:53
he's really doing sexual assault. Well, Joe's really doing sexual assault. This is where 40% of all men should be murdered at this moment. Because of that, you're just 40% of all men should be dead. Now you're opening us

Dan  1:09:04
up to attack now.

Jordan  1:09:06
Now,

Dan  1:09:07
here's the thing Joe is doing. He's derelict in his duty. And I think some of his negative viewpoints are showing a little bit because that's not accurate at all in any way. Well, the Joe and Eddie riffing about women. That is like, that's comedians. That's like they're being funny. So we can sort of discount that. Are we a tiny bit? I

Jordan  1:09:31
seemed real serious. The idea seemed very much like, Hey, we're

Dan  1:09:35
going up and grabbing dudes by the balls as a hypothetical. It's a flight of fancy. So I'm gonna let that go for now because the bigger the bigger and bigger man than I Well, the bigger issue is that they're presenting it as he was describing groupies. That wasn't the case. No, he was talking about grabbing women who specifically did not want him to do that moving in on her like a bitch moving into like a bed. Sometimes I kissed them. I can't stop myself. Yeah. I just kissed them immediately. No,

Jordan  1:10:02
he described all of the things you need to describe to correctly describe

Dan  1:10:07
a sexual assault. And when he when he's saying a sexual assault when he's saying, when you're a celebrity, they let you do it. That's not describing somebody who is all up in your shit. That's describing someone you're aggressing upon. Yeah, they let you do it or not they want it or something like that. So phrasing it like that is fucking really wrong. And then at the end when Alex is like, and those a guy outside with a recorder he had a mic on.

Jordan  1:10:36
There wasn't a No there was not a guy. It was him talking into the microphone. He agreed to have on him.

Dan  1:10:43
It wasn't confident. It wasn't said in confidence. It was part of a building case that a lot of people have that he's gone senile,

Jordan  1:10:52
I don't even necessarily I think he just doesn't give a fuck, he's to me. He's a lot like Robert Durst. Like when you watch The Jinx and you see him just baldface a well actually

Dan  1:11:02
think Robert Durst is a little bit smarter.

Jordan  1:11:05
Well, Robert just got away with a lot of murder over those years. Some of the globalists that's Oh man, I bet Hillary Clinton has personally gotten away with a lot of personally personally, I'm not saying that she's done murder.

Dan  1:11:20
Jordan. Next clip. This goes back to episode two. God damn it for our show. All right. This is a this is some crazy revisionist bullshit that Alex has. Oh, God about what he did on y2k.

Jordan  1:11:37
Oh, no.

Alex Jones  1:11:39
Well, here's the big enchilada for folks, if you want to lay this out Shilada documentary down the road and actually break this.

Dan  1:11:47
I forgot this also is another example of him claiming that he's about to tell a big story and then getting signed. Of course,

Jordan  1:11:52
the great stuff. Is Bravo doing a drum roll right now. I think everyone is I think he's trying to and it's not going like a team and it's not going well. That's a very poor drum

Dan  1:12:03
roll. Well, also, this is where Alex retreats from the whiskey and also starts doing drugs.

Alex Jones  1:12:12
There is a whole breakaway civilization that listen UFOs ready? I don't ever talk about this for real breakaway civilization. Are you ready? Hold on. Joe. How many things that I tell you over the years? Many too many. That's true. That was a

Unknown Speaker  1:12:28
couple that you got wrong. You can give people

Alex Jones  1:12:32
the context my contacts,

Unknown Speaker  1:12:35
okay. Conspiracy Theory is just not trusting criminals. Every now and then you can pin that murderer to the criminal, but he's still a criminal, even though you're wrong.

Alex Jones  1:12:44
Well, one of the things I'm actually embarrassed about is the y2k. Oh,

Jordan  1:12:47
well, hey, well, listen, you're

Unknown Speaker  1:12:48
not you're not a computer expert near him. I didn't go anywhere that night. I stayed fucking home. And I was waiting for that goddamn power to go out

Unknown Speaker  1:12:56
in a minute, but since 2012, I didn't know I thought Damn, the Mayans knew. 2012 license,

Unknown Speaker  1:13:06
I had a December 2012 license.

Dan  1:13:08
So this clip is going to be kind of long because he describes his experience of y2k a total I

Jordan  1:13:15
assume I assume he talks nonstop about how he was wrong about the concentration camps right? No doesn't bring that doesn't bring that up. Okay. How about Space Command does he talk about space commander doesn't bring up Space Command

Dan  1:13:27
also doesn't own up to the fact that he was pretending the head sources. You'll see the cowardly kind of

Jordan  1:13:33
busy have does he have multiple sources confirming that the Arkansas Department of Transportation is out on the roads? No. Nope, none of those. All right.

Dan  1:13:43
But I want to say this because it bears mentioning like when you're listening to Eddie and Joe talk, they're having fun. And like they're it's it's it's different. It feels different because like, even in this case, when they're talking about how the two of them were idiots and they believed in 2012 Yeah, like They're busting each other's balls and having fun when you break like Alex

Jordan  1:14:04
Brown has sounds super sycophantic though Bravo sounds like he's star fucking Alex Jones while we talk he

Dan  1:14:11
has a tiny bit but I also think for as much as I like to get into the show said he was an idiot. Yeah,

Jordan  1:14:17
I would hang out with him. Yeah, but even his even Well, no, he seems like but he seems like a congenial idiot. Sure. Yeah. Even his even his like, oh, I mean, you can't be right all the time was such a like, little like, I'm gonna rub your belly kind of like, oh, you can't be right all the time. I love if I did that kind of I

Dan  1:14:36
didn't know a few of the things that I do know, I would suspect that he was setting Alex up. Like that kind of behavior would be like, Oh, no, you're safe here.

Jordan  1:14:45
Okay, all right. So you're thinking he's playing good cop. If you didn't know any further

Dan  1:14:49
if I didn't know that he actually doesn't believe in vaccines, and he does believe in chemtrails and that sort of stuff. I would Excellent. All right. This hero hero ball is Wild

Unknown Speaker  1:15:02
I did. Oh, is this tobacco? Yes, very strong tobacco from Mexico. I am in California. This is a medical reason and 100% medical reasons and legal. Yeah, man, there's still look there's a lot of things that people think are gonna happen that turn out to not happen. There's always a goddamn asteroid. It's gonna kill us all but

Dan  1:15:17
also, for the rest of the show. He pretends he didn't smoke weed, although it's on camera.

Jordan  1:15:22
That's that. You can hear him Yeah, I don't even need to see him. I hear him go.

Dan  1:15:29
And let me be clear, I don't give a fuck if you smoke.

Jordan  1:15:31
I'm actually down for him smoking weed. Maybe then it won't be such a fucking prick. Nope. All right, I

Dan  1:15:37
do care about is when you are a self appointed leader of the information war. And you go on a broadcast that gets hundreds of 1000s millions of downloads. comport yourself like a fucking professional. Don't go in there and get high when you know you can't handle weed and drink at least six glasses of whiskey.

Jordan  1:15:59
Yeah, but it's it is also kind of a win and Rome situation. If you're on the Joe Rogan podcast, you you

Dan  1:16:06
leave that bullshit aside? Wait, recipes.

Jordan  1:16:09
Okay, so anyway, why is it every time I come to his defense, you come at me, I don't know. I'm trying to do your job

Dan  1:16:17
here. I texted you earlier and told you I empathize with him. Need to stop? I'm trying.

Jordan  1:16:21
I'm trying I want to I want to give him the most benefit of the doubt I can.

Dan  1:16:27
I'm gonna let the rest of this clip play. So feel free to take notes. Let's not interrupt it, because I want him to be able to get his words out and speak his piece about y2k. Okay, now keep in mind that the sponsor doesn't

Jordan  1:16:40
know we just did an episode on white, you know, I'm assuming

Dan  1:16:43
also keep in mind, if you're listening the sponsors that he had back then many of them are the same as he has now. Okay? Also keep in mind when they mock the idea of selling survival stuff, he still sells all of that. Now. Keep that in mind when they laugh about it. It's important to be reminded of that up top. Excellent. Now listen to this wacky bullshit. also admits that he's delusional.

Jordan  1:17:11
I am gonna put the microphone down.

Unknown Speaker  1:17:17
It's important to not inhale. That was the news, Alex. So what? What is going on aliens are coming.

Alex Jones  1:17:22
Let me let me before I do this, let me answer his question is he got a good question, too? Yeah. Well, let me answer why? Because I want to be honest about this, okay. It's just one of the few things that that I have really gotten wrong. And I didn't go with my gut. And so I was proven wrong. And I did it for the wrong reason. So now I'm gonna actually confess your honor. I was on one radio station. I've been on access TV for few years, I was on one radio station already started the show at my house that was on like 15 radio stations. So I had that at least but I had I was on one big radio station at the top show at night on station with Howard Stern's killer was all over the newspaper had huge ratings. And I was bringing in like 2030 grand a month, which was just a huge amount for me building whole operation out of that at home. And they come to the sales guys, and they go look for a year you've not been behind y2k. And you're not letting us have all these big sponsors. And you're gonna basically be fired. If you don't let us endorse the sponsors and have them on air. And so you believe in y2k?

Unknown Speaker  1:18:20
Oh, hold on a second. So the sponsors were like doomsday stuff like canned food and shit and bunkers everything else. So

Alex Jones  1:18:25
leaving food at the station wants to make all the money.

Unknown Speaker  1:18:33
So the station made you push y2k? Well,

Alex Jones  1:18:37
but but let me go further. This is one of the few times in my life that I I don't want to say I didn't have integrity. I kind of let them convince me but I think back to the point in the conference room, I just kind of went okay, okay, okay, sure. I get it and then I went, and then once I decided it was true, I really pushed it. So it's almost like I lied to myself because I'm being honest about this process so so this is what happened. for like a year and a half. I'm saying it's BS it's a government hoax because they're like the Navy says the chips are all bad for cities will completely fall and it's all the death I said, they just want to upgrade with all this new spy hubs, they want to do global standardization for the US is the Telecommunications Act of 96. They want to force all the new chips because I had NSA sources then that I was heading on okay. And I didn't realize how special was that I had the sources they're telling me it's all BS. People like don't argue with the Navy and don't and Fox News and ads to get your food was just everywhere. So I went okay, hell, okay, stuffs gonna be real. So it was like a Black Friday for the Black Friday deal. So the last few months. And the moral was ended up firing me anyways, they did, but the moral was I kind of convinced myself it was real. So by the end of it, of course, they edit like, you know, 12 hours beyond that day, and like five minutes, I'm totally insane, right, but it's like nuclear reactor having a problem here. And it really was happening. And like, you know, oh, and there was a missile firing from Russia, which like, was an ICBM, and they got like, shut down. That was ABC News. So I'm like, alright, this isn't really happening. Okay. We got prepared. It's always good to prepare, but oh no reactor is having a problem. Okay, some stuff. So there was some outages of some problems, but government and MSM had hyped it. Then they use it to demonize alternative media even then, when it wasn't catastrophic. So my gut told me it was BS. It was BS. And so thank God, I missed the whole 2012 thing. But still, they said Alex Jones says the world's ending the bureau 2012 where he restaurants when I say it's all a load of crap, but I didn't criticize you when I saw you doing it. I said I

Unknown Speaker  1:20:31
was balls deep. But here's the thing.

Dan  1:20:39
Okay, Jordan, why don't you take it? i The yelling was prompted by him basically admitting that he is malleable and he is you can just talk him into believing.

Jordan  1:20:54
I don't want to say that I didn't have integrity. I'm saying I let them convince me and then I believed it. Which means that I still had my own integrity. I always have integrity now just because what I believed isn't what happened it is what I said I believe but also I let them tell me that I believe that and then I believe that but I also did not believe that at the time. I didn't listen to my gut. I don't believe anything I believe everything I believe at all my friend praise Jesus. It's time to pray. I block him and

Dan  1:21:21
then once I allowed myself to believe it I tried to get people to panic Fuck him. Yes so much. Also also very important to note he doesn't bring up How he's changed his tune on Putin. No sense then also very important to I brought this up in the middle of the clip and I gotta repeat it Midas resources. We played a commercial from his show from an AI from y2k From Midas resources, they still are involved with him well they convinced him but now they sell like the Dr. Wallach products and shit like that. So

Jordan  1:21:56
Alex product is still gold, golden touch

Dan  1:21:59
he's made a bunch of notes we got Okay. Also if you're listening and you haven't listened to our episode about y2k go back and listen to that it'll give you a lot of context for why that clip was full of shit and

Jordan  1:22:10
then and then listen to that clip and feel my rage on a much more just tech tactile level so

Dan  1:22:18
what are your no

Jordan  1:22:19
okay one did he have the top show with huge ratings? I don't care I don't think so. sales guys sales guy let's say he might sales guy you might have I don't care. That's sales guys. sales guys. sales guys. We're gonna get him fired. Unless he did the most panic inducing fucking concentration camp having the y2k episode. We've got a sales guy. We got to sell this gold. Oh, gotcha. Telecommunications Act of 96. Does he know what that is?

Dan  1:22:51
Based on something he says later? I'm guessing he knows. broad strokes,

Jordan  1:22:57
right? Does anybody listening to the Joe Rogan podcast know what that is? No, but that's the game that he's playing. That is the fucking Gambit right there. Honestly, just don't randomly throw shit out. Just randomly throw that shit out and be like, nobody's gonna follow up on this. Nobody's gonna give a fuck yeah, every every second Russia send an ICBM? Yeah. And he was shot down. That was on ABC News. Was it? I don't know. Does anybody know? Is anybody following?

Dan  1:23:23
I can confirm this? No, also ICBM always makes me think of a cold ship. You see bowel movement. I hate hearing. So are you ready for the next

Jordan  1:23:36
All right. All right. All right. Is that what we're doing? Is that what we've become? Apparently?

Dan  1:23:40
So at this point, Eddie takes the Jesus take the wheel, Eddie, help him

Jordan  1:23:45
out. Eddie Bravo. He wants to get er Johnny Brown wants to

Dan  1:23:49
get into chemtrails. And of course, so he wants to ask Alex a little bit about what's the deal. What's the reality with chemtrails? And Alex talks a little bit about that and then spins it into something wacky. Oops, but

Unknown Speaker  1:24:06
they're doing it for different purposes. Not not to. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:24:11
I have been living kicked on the head of the US weather weapon program for 27 years on my show first, because I saw it was declassified. I saw that he was in the panhandle of Texas. I called him running a major cloud city company with his son and got the 90 year old to Austin. And then after that, he totally freaked out because the CIA came to his house. Do you want the interviews on YouTube? Do you want to know what he said? Yes. He was a World War Two fighter pilot. At the end of World War Two, he flew the first planes in hurricanes, which which are in the Atlantic, that's pretty gangster, and in two typhoons that are even faster in the Pacific. And then he and then he also led squadrons in Vietnam, flooding everything up to 10 feet of water out to clear blue skies within hours. With with their with their chemicals.

Unknown Speaker  1:24:58
You have to be to do that. prevent us flying to a hurricane or a typhoon.

Alex Jones  1:25:02
He's got to do it. Holy shit. Anyways, a super badass. I mean, no, he's alive. He's been living at nine he was still all there and I thought it naughty could kick my ass, big text and I felt like I was the guy was tougher than me anyways. And he gives me all this data and I can't believe it. He sent me all these classified photos and stuff because they just declassified the file. No one thought to call the old man from Lubbock or whatever it was, right. So I call him I get him on. They sent a bunch of people to their company and threatened him the next week after I read it. And he laid it out. He said, In 1967, we certified at the Stanford Research Institute that he was able to control hurricanes, create hurricanes, and steer hurricanes, all that got black budgeted shut down. And then they got into these arrays where they could use antennas. And out of that, and Westinghouse came came the the whole heart program. So in the 60s, they could create control and steer or kill hurricanes. That's why you Google Now, Bill and Melinda Gates bought all those patents, and quote Bill Gates is going to save the world from bad weather. Bill Gates wants to stop hurricanes Google.

Unknown Speaker  1:26:03
So so let me Bill

Alex Jones  1:26:05
Gates owns the weather machine.

Dan  1:26:06
Let me Oh, boy.

Jordan  1:26:10
That was Bill Gates owns the weather machine. That was emotional for you that is that is that? Has he seen the Avengers? That's the plot of The Avengers. Right? This is the first that is Sean Connery as the bad guy on the Avengers

Dan  1:26:24
fun Avengers the other one? Yes. The shitty.

Jordan  1:26:28
Yeah. Well, Uma Thurman was in it. It really is. It is the plot of The Avengers Age. You

Dan  1:26:34
know what there's clones in that movie?

Jordan  1:26:37
He's seen he's seen 10 movies. Yeah. And that is all of his references. Whether whether whether machine whether machine Bill Gates got it, whether machines got it in the 60s weather machine. Yeah. That you can control hurricanes with Yeah. Now

Dan  1:26:55
also, also, Alex has gone on, like whenever he's attacked about this has been like I didn't say they can control hurricanes and start them. All I said is Baba and then he sort of capitulates a little bit, but

Jordan  1:27:07
because of course because it's not

Dan  1:27:09
when he has some Whiskey and weed on Joe Rogan show. Sure. Believe it Yeah. And we're gonna get into some other leaves a

Jordan  1:27:18
moment he said whether weapon I immediately pulled up as much as I could find. So here is the best reference that I could find immediately. Jesse Ventura, oh boy, the former Navy SEAL who turned pro wrestler, not only then to become governor of Minnesota,

Dan  1:27:36
it'd be clear I love Jesse Ventura. Listen up, brother. That's no but that's Hogan.

Jordan  1:27:43
No, I know. I know. I wear what's his what's his thing?

Dan  1:27:47
Man who talks to gorilla gorilla monsoon? Oh,

Jordan  1:27:49
that's right. That's right. All right. I'm weightless. Neither of us are Domi. Yeah, no, it's a domain who has to do that for us? Yeah, so he did a special even on the conspiracy website. It says it's a bit sensationalized. Yeah.

Dan  1:28:05
And Joe Rogan questions everything. He had his podcast or his TV show about conspiracy stuff. Yeah. And they looked into

Jordan  1:28:14
entrails harp. It's H A RP. Oh, yes,

Dan  1:28:17
it is. It is hard. We're gonna learn a little bit more.

Jordan  1:28:20
Are we going to learn a little bit more about HAARP? This is dumb.

Alex Jones  1:28:23
Well, they've got they've got heart bases all over the place. They call them Doppler radar facilities. The government wants your local city to have Doppler radar. So you can find the wind on the screen. That's it like 1/10 of 1%. They can crank those arrays up that have massive your lights might go and they do it a little bit. Really? Yeah, because they'll use the whole power of your town through the Doppler radars, and then they control it. The US has a giant weather weapon hidden in front of everybody and every time city. Poor Russians and Chinese are just discovering all the US is one of the weapons that can knock them all out. Right.

Dan  1:28:58
So this clip is really long because Joe does a little bit of debunking portray respect

Jordan  1:29:04
for China. Yeah, they're just discovering that whether weapons are all around them at all time. There's

Dan  1:29:11
one in every small town every

Jordan  1:29:13
small town 1/10 of 1% are used for Doppler radar, they can just do that whenever they want. But if your power goes down even a little bit it's because they're controlling the fucking weather

Dan  1:29:23
if you live in Centralia, Missouri or Macon, Missouri or I'm just coming up with small towns

Jordan  1:29:29
I love moil Illinois so that you have Doppler radar to Rochester to get whichever one you live in there's so many Rochester so

Dan  1:29:38
the weather weapons so much as it is a way to glean information about the weather yes find out if there's going to be a tornado

Jordan  1:29:45
it does lecture system every every barometer to him seems like a weather weapon right? Like What's What's this magic? You know how much pressure there is in the air? Well, we're gonna give the devil

Dan  1:29:56
we're gonna get to Alex not really believing that people can fake hear things out at some point but this clip is pretty long pretty mystified by all things this I'm gonna I wanted to say we're gonna let this play because there's some rebuttals that Rogan makes and I want to be able to it to be greater

Jordan  1:30:15
the simplest that the the quintessential sign that Alex Jones respects you is if he says you could kick his ass and that 90 year old guy that is the pure distillation of the only thing that Alex Jones respects also is this guy looks like he could beat me up also. He is such a pure like, this is the only way I did it. This is the only way to determine male dominance. This guy's

Dan  1:30:41
a man he doesn't like kids, he can

Jordan  1:30:45
compete he could beat me up who could beat me up only the greatest of men

Dan  1:30:50
also I don't want to I don't want to body shame people because that's not what I like to do. But Alex look like shit. He looked like anyone could have kicked his ass. But also that that guy who flew into tornadoes that he's talking about, or hurricanes as it were, the him being 90 does really call into question what he's telling you. Because I've lunch a 90 year olds and the ones that are like I work with the elderly, I don't believe shit. They're 90 and they're all there is a relative thing. Yeah, it doesn't mean that they're all there. That means that oh my god, they're great for 90.

Jordan  1:31:23
Admittedly, flying into a hurricane is badass. Sure. There's no argument there if he did that. Did it first to ever do which probably didn't. Probably he's a 90 year old man. I don't know if you know that. Sometimes. They exaggerate things possibly. Because who the fuck is going to call him out on it? Certainly not Alex. Nope. But anyway, this,

Dan  1:31:44
this clip news. I'm just gonna let it play. It's important because Joe rebuts some things and then Alex tries to readjust his argument. And then when this clip is over, I'm going to explain why Alex Jones is a filthy fucking liar.

Jordan  1:32:01
Let's learn and grow together. It's control

Unknown Speaker  1:32:03
the weather, ideas for barges to pump cold water from the depths of the ocean to create some sort of a roadblock for the hurricane.

Dan  1:32:11
This what he has done is Googled Bill Gates weather control. And he's Fat Joe has found this article about how cold water does stop hurricanes. And so there's a possibility that you could create trenches that release cold water. I'm sorry, I just wanted to give context because of where we started again, right? Because bill is trying to do good, right? Weather weapons,

Unknown Speaker  1:32:32
weather Robins since hurricanes pull power commanders warm temperatures cooling the water could have theoretically, theoretically dismantle the hurricane. Well, it sounds like a good idea though. The point is loving us doesn't sound like a genius idea. You spray cold water and

Unknown Speaker  1:32:51
John Brennan in the front of the CFR is saying we were doing this because for global warming and you got to save your

Alex Jones  1:33:01
soul about about geoengineering chemtrails. You were wrong about the dinosaurs not being wrong.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:07
But hey, what about that? They're they're coming out saying hey, there's gonna be some countries that did that aren't going to be for it. And we got to figure out how we're going to deal with it. Yes, the big secret.

Unknown Speaker  1:33:18
Yes. That's the big

Unknown Speaker  1:33:21
question. Keep going with that. Come on, man. Don't change the subject. Keep going with that. You're not done with Livingston.

Alex Jones  1:33:25
Okay, imagine you're here but imagine me and Joe were actually got me off on you when we hear about Ronald Reagan to

Unknown Speaker  1:33:31
later finish the s ai pro. He doesn't.

Dan  1:33:35
Alex is drunk by this point. You can tell he's drunk.

Jordan  1:33:39
Oh, yeah. He's ready to he's ready to dish on anything. Yeah, it's only as long as you don't ask him to dish on anything. He will talk about anything. Yeah, the moment you're like, Hey, could you talk about this? His brain goes, Oh, I

Dan  1:33:51
actually can't see certify I don't have the improv skills to Yes. And your question is certifiably drunk because we've been watching him drink whiskey like it's water. Okay, but also, he's behaving exactly like he does in that clip where he was yelling at that lady on the street. He's acting and sounding like he does in the secret of 2017 clip. So it's like, it's kind of reaffirming all of our,

Jordan  1:34:13
like, quick, quick question. Yeah. What is the secret of 2017? Still don't no, no, no, no, Megan

Dan  1:34:19
Kelly's ugly, but he just said she's not. So

Jordan  1:34:23
all of our secrets are gone away. I

Dan  1:34:25
gotta stop interrupting this clip. Here we go.

Unknown Speaker  1:34:27
Oh, he doesn't know about this. I don't know about it. But what do you know about the sai program? Let's get this done when most of

Alex Jones  1:34:35
the real programs are just like fronts for something else. It's not even real. So you don't think they're spraying shit into the atmosphere? No, there

Unknown Speaker  1:34:42
is a program for geoengineering. There's a program in place. You said it's the Doppler radar system in HAARP. And what else

Alex Jones  1:34:50
and an aerial spraying is still the most effective and they can what do they do? They do have Pat when you say aerial spraying What Are They Spraying barium salts, Alumina oxide, radioactive isotopes. Besides bringing them in the air why they're doing that alone was because because it does a bunch of things are testing a bunch of stuff. They're manipulating things. Listen our Pentagon,

Unknown Speaker  1:35:09
why do you have evidence that they're doing this and spraying aluminum and barium, whatever, go

Alex Jones  1:35:13
online and read the Department of Energy. It's all public. Just like he just said, go

Unknown Speaker  1:35:17
online and watch a Chinese Dude get jacked by a tiger though I agree. That's how

Alex Jones  1:35:21
the Department of energy.gov right and you can watch CFR CIA director at the time Brennan admitting all this. This is all public. Yeah. He talked about

Unknown Speaker  1:35:31
No, I saw it. I saw the video. We can play the video and go over it if you want. But he's talking about various options for controlling global warming. They're laying out the future. Look, if global warming is a guy Hold on a second, hold on a second. If global warming is real, we know it is right. Don't you think they would have you don't believe global warming is real. And so they keep measuring these temperatures and scientists keep saying okay, females? Well, let's find out. Let's find out what his real was Joey was real. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:35:58
I believe that it was high, it goes cold. There's always micro temperature. Change this shift is the only thing that ever happened. That's carbon taxes to Al Gore won't fix it.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:08
Okay, I think we all shift. But what I'm saying is there absolutely is global warming, right? Yeah. What is the

Alex Jones  1:36:19
house when my dad was a kid in the 1950s For three or four months out of the year, it was below zero or freezing. You had to chop wood. He'd freeze your ass off and all houses had even in the South had you had all sorts of chimneys and them for fireplaces, because it was freezing cold right? And now there has been a warming period. But that's part of a normal global cycle based on the sun. All these astrophysicist are sure. The whole thing about claiming it's the carbon we put out the earth is carbon star, there's a carbon cycle. That's the big story. I want to get to the globalist want to tax if they can tax oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, sunlight, they have total control over the whole lifecycle of the planet.

Unknown Speaker  1:36:58
Let's play the video let's play the video this this CIA guy talking about it because what I inferred from it with some sort of solutions if global warming becomes a giant

Alex Jones  1:37:08
Brennan is a frickin known. Well, hobbyist watch. Oh,

Unknown Speaker  1:37:13
what is the CIA?

Unknown Speaker  1:37:14
Watch the video for global warming? It's a good question. What do they have to do? I don't know what the CIA does. Do you

Unknown Speaker  1:37:22
ever built to stop the spread of

Unknown Speaker  1:37:24
communism? Right. But it's an intelligence agency. They're part of the environment. Okay. They're a part of the intelligence community. And if they got hired, I would imagine this is just me guessing right off the top of my head if they got hired to assess a threat. And the threat being from global warming, like what what do we have to worry about? Are we really going to lose cities? Do we really have an issue?

Jordan  1:37:43
He was that was Alex Jones. Just totally gone. Keep it under control. Keep it under control.

Dan  1:37:50
Yeah, there's a there's a there's a like whenever Alex's facts get sort of questioned, he really doesn't know what to do.

Jordan  1:38:01
That was that was three dudes having a completely dump completely different conversations. Yeah, none of them. Were having the same conversation with each other. That happens a lot. Yeah, that was difficult to discuss. That was pure chaos.

Dan  1:38:15
It's not even over

Jordan  1:38:16
yet. No, like any Kenny Bravo. No, I'm gonna go with Kenny. Ah, come

Dan  1:38:21
on, man. Don't call him out.

Jordan  1:38:23
All right. All right. Eddie. Bravo. Is one. A lovable dope? Yeah, I am fully on his side and we hug him. He's such a silly little goofball. Yeah, I feel like he's the most innocuous person.

Dan  1:38:37
He knows a lot of things that he's read. But he's one of these guys who just watches like YouTube videos and thinks they're educated. Yeah. You know, like, and maybe his read a couple documents, but doesn't really understand what they say.

Jordan  1:38:50
Well, just just like his what is the CIA have to do with global warming? You're like, they, they don't know. But they don't have anything to do with Cold War. But

Dan  1:39:02
if they did, Joe has a good response to that, in that if there are threats that are posed by global warming, the intelligence community should be up on that. Yeah, they should be but they're it's a hypothetical good answer to a hypothetical question. But be that as it may wait for this. All right. All right. entire conversation takes a turn when Alex pulls up a what he thinks is a trump card out of his pocket. All right, and we'll get to why it's not.

Alex Jones  1:39:33
goes down. Give George Soros to the UN total power for a 100 trillion per decade global tax to micromanage and surveil everything humans do let's see as a carbons toxic they've got to surveil it thus they have a jurisdiction to control our lives.

Unknown Speaker  1:39:47
Okay, hold on. Why does it say debunk CIA director admits chemtrails, geoengineering Stratospheric Aerosol injections. So it says the claim guys hold on hold on at the counsel admits geoengineering in the form of stratospheric aerosol injections sai is taking place ie chemtrails taking place at chemtrails, and the rebuttal is nowhere in his speech, is there an admission that an sai program has already taken place? The part where Brennan mentions geoengineering is just one example out of several not often mentioned issues, the CIA monitors for potential elements of instability in the world, a s AI program, if ever implemented could penetrate conflicts and security threats if misused. The CIA's job is to consider all types of concepts, concepts for potential future problems and threats, including the science oriented concepts that's totally botched. Let me break down the right. But isn't that possible? But what that guy just said, is that possible? No. That's basically what Brennan said. What he's saying is that there are potential threats. Mentally it's an issue. Right. So he's not admitting that he had there's an sai far. Let me let me tell you. Go ahead. Tell me.

Alex Jones  1:41:00
Everybody debates, how many programs there are all the specifics, a lot of that's classified. You can Google China launches, major weather control operations. 10 years, right. Or Qatar, does it or Saudi Arabia or UK? For sure people have studied none of that, right? Yeah, there's they call it study. There's a giant in 2005, the Department of Energy Program for aerosol testing was $5 million a year. So under US Code, title 50, Chapter 32, subsection 1005 and 28. Paragraph B is a true you nailed that, right? Yes, yes. We from Mars under US Code.

Unknown Speaker  1:41:32
You live on that obelisk? That

Unknown Speaker  1:41:34
was fucking insane. Let me just tell you remember the time last time I cheated?

Alex Jones  1:41:43
Under US Code Title finish number 32,520. A paragraph B. That's

Dan  1:41:48
so he brings out this this statute, and he uses it as a as proof that his argument is that these people call things studies and they use that to attack us. Yes, that makes sense. I have pulled up this subsection, it's title 50. So chapter 32, subsection 128, paragraph B, you can Google it. And I have found it.

Jordan  1:42:16
The weight. So when he said You can Google it. You can Google you can Google it. I found it. And I'm assuming that he quoted it perfectly and agrees with everything that he's saying, right?

Dan  1:42:26
No, oh, restrictions on use of human subjects for testing of chemical and biological agents. prohibited activities. The Secretary of Defense may not conduct directly or by contract any test or experiment involving the use of a chemical agent, or biological agent on the civilian population, or any other testing of a chemical agent or biological agent on human subjects.

Jordan  1:42:49
Now, I believe this was probably enacted shortly after they did all of that stuff in, let's say, the Tuskegee experiments. Let's go through all of the different times that the government has actually done that right.

Dan  1:43:05
The I don't know this. I don't I don't have a date on this. But let's just

Jordan  1:43:09
go with if it if it wasn't, it should have been and it wasn't like, Yeah, but here this is this is crazy, because this has happened before. The government has absolutely tested chemical agents on unsuspecting people. Yes.

Dan  1:43:23
Now here's, here's where Alex's argument comes into play. So paragraph B is the exceptions. So the exceptions are subject to subsections, C, D, and E. The prohibition on subsection A which I just read the prohibited activities does not apply to a test or experiment carried out for any of the following purposes. One, any peaceful purpose that is related to a medical, therapeutic pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, or research activity, to any purpose that is directly related to protection against toxic chemicals or biological weapons and agents? Three, any law enforcement purpose, including any purpose related to riot control? Now that paragraph

Jordan  1:44:05
that is a dis disconcerting? Oh, yeah, last part. I don't like I don't like that. Number three at all. No, three is very scary is weird. Let's not, let's pretend that three was not allowed. That's scary as fuck now. So basically, what that means is that as long as you're testing it out on riot control, you can do whatever the fuck you want,

Dan  1:44:26
or if it's related to medical, therapeutic pharmaceutical agriculture, yeah,

Jordan  1:44:30
no, those ones are fine, because those ones are beneficial, right? CTRL one is very scary. It doesn't

Dan  1:44:35
really matter, though, because how subsection paragraph B starts is subject to subsection C, D and E. So B is subject to what comes after it right. Let me read you see, informed consent required. The Secretary of Defense may conduct a test or experiment described in subsection B Only if informed consent to the testing was obtained from each human subject in advance on that subject, gotcha. You're using this to rationalize chemtrails. Yeah, you'd have to have informed consent from entire populations. Yeah. Which is bullshit. Now clearly impossible now. Hey, Oh,

Jordan  1:45:19
hold on one second. How many times have you clicked agree on the iTunes?

Dan  1:45:26
You might have just in terms of services, ah, Section maybe

Jordan  1:45:30
it's in there maybe in the iTunes Apple rehab sure, like, hey, chemtrails, you go with those and you're like, Yeah, I'm not gonna read this whole thing of neocon triggers conspiracy ever chemtrails is Apple just solved it.

Dan  1:45:46
So the subsection D is about notifying Congress. And E is just to really put into definition, what Abeille illogical agent is by definition, right? So those two like the ones that SeaRay use to kill all its people, sure, those two are just sort of definitions. But paragraph C is super important. If you're if you're using this statute, this title 50, Chapter 32, sub section 128, paragraph B, if you're using this, you have to mention paragraph C, because if you don't, it's not the

Jordan  1:46:24
full name seems really important to mention the informed consent, Barbara, how scared you

Dan  1:46:29
were when they when I mentioned riot control. I was super scary. It's scary. It's scary. But if they're beholden to paragraph C, you can't test riot control stuff out without informed consent. That's

Jordan  1:46:41
a really good point. Yeah, that's actually a very well written statute, then it is. Here's my favorite part of that. It's misused

Dan  1:46:47
in a fucking propaganda stick way. Yeah, by Alex. And when do they bring it up on that? Because Joe pulls up the statute and they read it. They don't read everything. Yeah. So it looks like Alex is right. And first point, Alex is drunk, and he gets this smug smiley look on his face. And at this point, Joe becomes his ally.

Jordan  1:47:08
This is when your righteous fury unleashes itself. Oh, it

Dan  1:47:12
gets way worse. This episode is going to be two and a half hours long. But like it at that point, it's like, oh, everything Alex says is true. He pulled out this subsection, paragraph blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And oh, my God, he's right. He must know everything. No, he doesn't. The actual text of the thing he was citing does not agree with what he was saying. It's insane. It we talked about this on the last episode. Yeah, he's winning the battle of Step B. And it's fucking insane. And so dangerous. Because if no one looks into what you're saying, Yeah. Then you just get to say whatever you want. i This is why he's not a journalist.

Jordan  1:47:53
I am one in love with your passion.

Dan  1:47:56
I'm so mad.

Jordan  1:48:01
Just discussing our roles earlier, prior to the show is like, we were talking about it and I'm like, hey, my job is to try and make this as silly and as fun as possible. I find facts and you're like, I will then what's my job? And then you went on this righteous fury rant. It's like, that's your fucking job. That's right. And ours. That is your fucking job right there. Your job is to be filled with Samuel Jackson esque Righteous Fury.

Dan  1:48:30
Well, it's my job is finding specifics that he says, and then being like, Oh, this is actually

Jordan  1:48:36
some evil shit. Like, that's

Dan  1:48:37
what that is. It's not evil. And now, it's banking on people being dumb.

Jordan  1:48:42
But here's the thing about that. Just like the the thing that I immediately thought of was all of the executive orders that Trump has pulled out. And the past couple of weeks Yeah, have been blatantly and clearly either unconstitutional. Or illegal.

Dan  1:48:58
Or or, or, or take a step back. Weird. Weird, just weird.

Jordan  1:49:03
Ya know, they've all been they've all been that they don't seem to suit actual purpose. And the amazing part about that was while you were reading that whole like subsections this this this this, I'm going this is unbelievably fucking boring. Yeah. How could anybody possibly pay attention to this? And then you realize, oh, that's why they're all unconstitutional because he doesn't read those subsections that were built in there. Yeah, he just goes this is a thing now that I like that like that's what happens

Dan  1:49:35
it's legislating by order as like yeah, not order like social order. But order like I order this Yeah.

Jordan  1:49:41
And that's not how things work. It shouldn't be no well, but but not even that. It's like there's all these little rules in their

Dan  1:49:48
government should work essentially by negotiation of people who disagree. There should be people on the left and on the right, because conservatives, some of them have decent points anymore. Well, no, but that's not named That's not conserved.

Jordan  1:50:00
That's yeah, no, there? No, it's all. They've all lost their mind, the political philosophy

Dan  1:50:05
of small government and states rights, those sorts of things have a lot of validity. And I think I think that there's a conversation that should be had and has been had in the past that has to do with that

Jordan  1:50:17
there's a conversation we are anymore that could have been had, right? Where are we not where we are? Right, right.

Dan  1:50:22
I'm expressing that my political philosophy is that a government, especially a federal government, is best served by disagreeing voices, having an argument negotiating with each other, and compromising

Jordan  1:50:36
but that's why we're losing. You and I both have this idea of effective governance. And the GOP has lost their mind and gone like, Hey, how about instead of that, we burn it to the ground. But

Dan  1:50:52
if we look at this, this, this code about restriction of use of human subjects for testing of biological and chemical agents, it seems to be really well written. But if you also look at it, it probably was the result of negotiations, I would assume. So probably parts of this didn't exist. In the original version. People are like, hey, we need informed consent.

Jordan  1:51:10
People who really gave a fuck in those very small details were like, No, we have to put this tiny little detail in there. Yeah. And if they hadn't done that, then somehow all of this shit could have gone out of control. And

Dan  1:51:24
if I hadn't put that detail in there, Alex would be right.

Jordan  1:51:27
Exactly. Exactly. If somebody didn't give a fuck to that my new level. It would be chaos. Yeah. And that is where we live now is the people who run things do not give a fuck to that minute level

Dan  1:51:41
where a propagandist like Alex Jones can go on Joe Rogan show exact and effectively convince him of something that's not true.

Jordan  1:51:48
I'm starting to think this Alex Jones character isn't, uh, isn't on the up and up. He's bad news. I think he might be a bad guy bad.

Dan  1:51:57
So Jordan, this next clip is pretty fun. And I'm excited to transition out of me yelling about sub statute with your

Unknown Speaker  1:52:05
future. So I need to know, I need to know what do you know about aliens? And how are aliens rear?

Alex Jones  1:52:15
This is really big.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:16
Okay. For another shot of that immediate

Alex Jones  1:52:20
question is What does Donald Trump know about? Oh, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  1:52:25
it was you know, now, right? Because he's in the office. I don't know. It's that would be the first thing

Alex Jones  1:52:30
I think the Joe Rogan experience deserves.

Unknown Speaker  1:52:32
The first thing I did, I would run to the office, and I'd go who's got the documents? Who's got the aliens documents? Who's got him? Who's got him? That would be the first thing I would have.

Dan  1:52:42
Also, did you hear Alex

Jordan  1:52:44
Ronk off his ass. He

Dan  1:52:46
yelled the document. Yeah, that's 30 of them sets. Yeah,

Jordan  1:52:50
he's fucking wasted. He's

Dan  1:52:52
starting to lose it a little let's let's follow this rabbit hole. Also, this clip ends with him deflecting and one of the saddest ways I've ever seen.

Jordan  1:53:01
I just want to see him drunk. I just want to see him drunk. Show me. Cheer sir.

Unknown Speaker  1:53:06
About boring shit. Well.

Alex Jones  1:53:10
You're a robot. You never have to piss. Art. Let me give you my best please. deep research approximation once what do you

Unknown Speaker  1:53:17
think is going but wrong to still hold out? Hope that aliens are real? Because I'll tell you one. The two guilty pleasures that I still cling to? Is Bigfoot and aliens. Those are too big, but not so much. I wish it was real, but I just don't. Are you ready? Yes, they put through. No, come on.

Alex Jones  1:53:35
Are you ready? I'm gonna use the big enchilada, Joe. For real. Yeah, you're not of this world, bro. Me. You're the alien. Oh, yeah,

Dan  1:53:46
that's his big enchilada. They're

Jordan  1:53:49
a

Dan  1:53:52
dick. Well, I mean, it's fuck you. It's just like yeah, it's just another instance that Oh,

Jordan  1:53:57
shit. Oh, what a tiny little weak bullshit. Fuck you.

Dan  1:54:03
Yeah, so you're the alien live fuck off. keeps doing that. Like I'm gonna tell you the truth. Now hold on. We gotta get to this. Or

Jordan  1:54:12
yeah, he a couple times you ready for this beast? big secret?

Dan  1:54:15
I gotta pay you a couple times also deflects with jokes about him being Hicks, Bill Hicks. And how he like why why do people actually think Bill Hicks and Joe's like, people don't it's a joke. But Alex

Jordan  1:54:31
Hughes, I ask people why why do they think I'm Johnny Appleseed. And it's crazy. They

Dan  1:54:36
don't. It's crazy. They just don't. You've not gone all over this land. It's weird. I

Jordan  1:54:40
haven't. But why do people think that? I don't know. Well,

Dan  1:54:43
it's a joke.

Jordan  1:54:44
It's a joke. I can't believe that.

Dan  1:54:46
So Alex uses that to deflect away from stuff, but he can't deflect any like something Bill Hicks would say he gets to a point where he's drunk, and he's sort of pressed to the wall and he asked to answer questions about what he believes about the elites. I'm going to let this play out. Please don't interrupt this. I'm not going to because it's it's a synthesis of a belief. And I have some thoughts after that I need to explain to you okay, but now,

Jordan  1:55:12
all right, enjoy. I will allow this

Dan  1:55:15
enjoy to happen.

Alex Jones  1:55:17
It's we're fighting a pedophile conspiracy. But beyond that it's a vampire conspiracy, and that they are inter dimensionally sucking the essence of our youth. Right. And they believe they're possessed by an offworld entity. They do. Yeah, Joe, I've been on air 22 years. I don't get into aliens, metaphysical religion. Any of that? i

Jordan  1:55:36
Yes, he does. Yes, he does.

Dan  1:55:37
He plays on air.

Jordan  1:55:40
He prays on air. He just said he didn't do he does.

Dan  1:55:44
He does. He does Yeah, I'm sorry. I I told you not to interrupt it. Well, just that I don't get into religion thing was so fucking wack. No, no, no. So anyway. Anyway, the rest of this is wacky,

Alex Jones  1:55:58
studied the elite. And I've also communicate with a lot of the top people and if you want to know, I will actually break down right now. The best knowledge right now what's happening on the planet? What's happening? Let me give you a basic just stole,

Unknown Speaker  1:56:12
okay. Love when you can use that word with full confidence. I've never said that. Let me give you a basic Gestalt. Don't be like, Oh my God, such a fraud. No, you're not you know, but that's what I'd think if I use that

Alex Jones  1:56:22
word. Now you'll get all this you already have no status. You're a bookworm, or research worm. In a good way. The elite are all about transcendence and living forever, and the secrets of the universe. And they want to know all this. Some are good, some are bad. Some are a mix. But the good ones don't ever want to organize the bad ones and want to organize because they lust for power. Powerful, consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people, they want to empower them. So they don't tend to get together until things are really late in the game, then they come together evils always defeated, because good is so much stronger. And we're on this planet. And Einstein's physics show that Max Planck says shut it off. There's at least 12 dimensions. And now that's all the top scientists and billionaires are coming up saying it's a false hologram it is artificial, the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's artificially projected. And gravity's bleeding in to this universe. That's what they call dark matter. We're like a thought or a dream. That's a wisp in some computer program, some Gods mind, whatever, they're proving it all, it's all coming out. Now there's like this sub transmission zone below the third dimension, that's just turned over the most horrible things is what it resonates to. And it's trying to get up into the third dimension. That's just a basic level consciousness to launch into the next levels. And our species is already way up in the fifth sixth dimension consciously our best people, but there's this big war trying to like basically destroy humanity, because humanity has freewill. And there's a decision to which level we want to go to, we have free will. So evils allowed to come and contend and not just good. And the elites themselves, believe their racing will using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of breakaway civilization, where they're going to merge with machines transcend, and break away from the failed species of his man, which is kind of like a false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad. projecting it onto themselves instead of believing. No, it's a human test about building us up. And so Google was set up at 19 years ago, this was I knew about this before it was declassified.

Jordan  1:58:28
That is the longest stream of uninterrupted insanity I've heard since I got off the train

Dan  1:58:37
earlier. Well, it goes on a lot longer. But also it's it's

Jordan  1:58:41
I know I can see the length of this clip that you've queued up I can see how we've still got 11 and a half million more minutes to go no, there's

Dan  1:58:50
like three

Jordan  1:58:51
this that was fucking I stopped taking notes uh, halfway through that because it's clearly that is just not all one dimensions don't work like how he thinks dimensions work. No, but it does. He saw Dr. Strange and he was like oh, that's what dimensions are that's what happened there. He is fucking 12 dimensions nobody does not what No, Einstein no plank, definitely not plank. Definitely not. Definitely not plank. What does anybody know about playing if he has a godson if there's anything that you can say about plank it is that plank never said there were 12 dimensions that's the most I

Dan  1:59:32
Google it. I mean, just like Info Wars.

Jordan  1:59:36
Okay. Okay. Sub transmissions. Yeah, below the third dimension. Yeah, trying to get up into the third dimensions, demons and human beings are already on the fifth or sixth dimension. I feel like he's confusing. Einstein, with space time with Lord of the Rings with Dante's Inferno in that What's going on? Right?

Dan  2:00:01
Let's see, he's talking about a different plank, Max Plank.

Jordan  2:00:05
No, he's talking about Max, there's only one plank other than the plank challenge, which is on YouTube just

Dan  2:00:11
struck, he just sort of discussed the length of things. Like his his constant. It has to do with length. Yeah. Yeah. Like was it in a vacuum and stuff like that?

Jordan  2:00:23
Yeah, no, that's all regular stuff. 00 mention of the 12th dimension.

Dan  2:00:29
So Jordan, what I what you need to know about this is a lot of the stuff that he's spouting comes from an anonymous post, though was put on Reddit, or I don't know if it was exactly read it. Years and years ago, I read all of this, like, eight years ago or so. And like, quite honestly, him spouting this stuff on Joe's show. Wow, he's really drunk and being like, this is the big thing. That was fucking bananas. It's actually disappointing to me. It is bananas. It's worse than what we've been talking about for the rest of these episodes where it's like the globalists. Yeah, yeah, it's worse than that.

Jordan  2:01:09
No, that's, yeah, that's pure fantasy. That's a That's a fucking dragons song novel by an McAfee. And it's he it's important

Dan  2:01:20
to point that out. Because when he says he has sources, it's very suspicious, which

Jordan  2:01:27
he always has sources. And they are very high up. They're always very high up. His sources are so varied. Yeah. And expert. It is hard to imagine that he is not infiltrated every single level of government. Yeah, every single level of technology government in everybody's possible severe, like, the only place he doesn't know a lot about is Guatemala because he thinks there's a fucking wall there.

Dan  2:01:57
I'm not sure that I actually have this clip. But on the episode of Rogan's podcast, he's like, I was talking to a head of state.

Jordan  2:02:04
Oh, which which name we need to name a head of state? Donald Trump, Donald Trump, would it be? Oh, God, we're all gonna fuck we've got

Dan  2:02:14
such great sources. I was talking to a head of state head of state. Well, it was. Yeah, but be that as it may,

Jordan  2:02:20
I'm assuming he was Icelands PMA Jordan. Yes. Yes. Righteous, anger, fury,

Dan  2:02:27
this clip isn't done. Need to listen to the rest of this clip. Okay. And I need to be clear when I'm talking about all like this clear troll post. Yes. That had some interesting ideas that I read eight years ago or so. Okay. He's taking from that. But saying he doesn't believe it. It's what the elites believe. But what you have to believe what you have to take away from that is that he believes that the elites believe that. That's important. The fact that he says I don't believe it is kind of a Dodge, because he believes that the elites believe it. And there's some power in it when it's a fantasy narrative. Yeah. So anyway, the rest of the script is going to play. He talks about this in a later clip, which we'll get back to at the end of the show, where he kind of invalidates a lot of the things he said, Let's, corsi. Let's enjoy the ladies and

Jordan  2:03:20
gentlemen, let's get on this. Enjoy the Willy Wonka esque boat into madness.

Dan  2:03:27
Enjoy the ride word Joe calls him out on this a little bit, but not nearly enough.

Alex Jones  2:03:31
Shake up the choices that they wanted to build a giant artificial system at Google believes that the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based on the neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired into the internet of things. And so all of our thoughts go into it. And we're actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time. That's also psychically connected to us that are organic creatures, so that they will have current prediction powers, future prediction powers a true crystal ball. But the big secret is, once you have a crystal ball and know the future, you can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future. And so then it's the end of consciousness and freewill for individuals as we know, and a true 2.0 in a very bad way. hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into everyone knowing our hopes and dreams, delivering it to us not in some PKD wire head system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited pleasure. But because we were already wired and absorbed before we knew it by giving over our consciousness to this system, our daily decisions that it was able to manipulate and control into a larger system. There's now a human Counter Strike taking place to shut this off before it gets fully into place and to block these systems and to try to have an actual debate about where humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles and psychic vampires that are control of this AI system before humanity's destroyed

Unknown Speaker  2:05:00
admission control the AI, I think it had the pedophiles getting controlling

Alex Jones  2:05:04
the pedophiles at whatever level the devil whatever you want to call it, this interdimensional thing that gives them advanced offworld technology, the Fallen One that's out of this world is giving them advanced systems what has been used before on other populations? Why that Satan?

Unknown Speaker  2:05:20
But what are you talking about? Let's say but explain that you just use

Alex Jones  2:05:24
something because something that you know, the stupid preacher tells you about who's totally controlled or something you read about on, you know, in the news or TV, right. This is an interdimensional force that wants to influence us to build something that absorbs us and kills us, rather than the divine freewill we're given to build something much better than empowers the species. So the species is now making a decision on its entire future. That's what it is. But were you getting it I know from from looking at all the data, researching and studying and watching the enemy. That's the big decision that humanity has now got before us.

Dan  2:06:00
That's not an answer. But also, I will say this, I didn't keep this part of the clip, because that was way too long. But at after this, Joe, Joe does bring up the idea of futurists just sort of understanding where technology is going to go and sort of predicting like you were yelling about Asimov,

Jordan  2:06:17
that was that was pure that was the robots of Dawn timeline, I paint just described, literally from iRobot. To forward the foundation in Isaac Asimov nozzles. I think that's what he read. Well, one of that's what he described every single step of the way. That's what he thought was going to happen.

Dan  2:06:39
Well, one of the pieces that I think we're gonna have to deal with and I think that this document actually takes Alex into a different category in my mind, like, I really think it's unfortunate. He went on

Jordan  2:06:50
believing that the devil is an interdimensional being

Dan  2:06:53
now I always thought he thought that, okay, no, but I, I think that this experience of listening to him and hearing him say,

Jordan  2:07:05
These things, these batshit crazy things,

Dan  2:07:08
I have to deal with him on two levels, because he is a propagandist,

Jordan  2:07:12
which these mentions are those levels on the third, the third dimension, and then with the other level,

Dan  2:07:18
there aren't any there. But like, Okay, I believe that he is a propagandist. Yes. But I also have to wrestle with the fact that I don't think he knows the difference between fiction and reality. No, he absolutely does not. He constantly brings up plots of movies. It's already been like three so far. Yeah, we've got

Jordan  2:07:39
we've got Red Dawn is a huge part of his Sure. All right. We're gonna go with now we've added now we've added Isaac Asimov. Elysium.

Dan  2:07:49
Seems to be really in his Zeitgeist. Absolutely. We're gonna

Jordan  2:07:52
go with the matrix is definitely important. And probably isn't they live is super important. Yeah. But like,

Dan  2:08:00
I really think that I'm not saying that he's a schizophrenic or anything like that. I think that there is a part of his brain that is unable to grasp what is real and what is art. Like, I really don't know if he can tell that because when I read that huge, long post,

Jordan  2:08:19
that was clearly you sacrificed yourself so the rest of us I

Dan  2:08:23
enjoyed it. I read it because I enjoyed it. I

Jordan  2:08:25
was curious. Yeah. Well, I

Dan  2:08:26
read it tell like, this is someone just fucking around? Right? Then I enjoyed it for what it was an expression of, of a new medium record troll people online in a sensible, interesting way. That wasn't abusive. Okay, I that long posed to me seemed to be like, this is someone fucking around, but doing it really well. With John Teeter, John teeter is another great example. Yes, if you guys are listening, aren't aware of it. This guy claimed to be a time traveler, and gave a bunch of very wrong predictions about what's gonna happen in the future. But it was really, really interesting. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah. And

Jordan  2:09:03
like, like all of those, like all the times where you see that picture that it's like, someone on a cell phone. No, yeah. Oh, somebody on the cell phone in the old timey picture, or John Travolta, looking 100, who looks severely like Nicolas Cage. Yeah. And then you're like, well, that must be you know, that whole thing. It's fun. Yeah. But also, you're not an idiot. Don't stop believing that if you're unable

Dan  2:09:27
to realize the variables that exist within a population of billions, that there are going to be people who will look exactly the same. Yeah. I mean, that's insane. We live

Jordan  2:09:36
in a world where statistically anything that could happen happen.

Dan  2:09:40
Let's get to this. This is Alex realizing that he's got you gradually

Jordan  2:09:44
running out of righteous anger. No. Okay,

Dan  2:09:50
so this is Alex realizing that he's got to put on a show. All right,

Alex Jones  2:09:54
globalist are anti him and they think we're a bunch of dumb animals where the aliens they're carrying on shot they believe Aliens.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:02
Does that have to do with the Luciferian Freemasonry type shit. I love skull and bone breakdown. Thank

Jordan  2:10:08
God because

Unknown Speaker  2:10:10
Albert Pike wrote the Freemason Bible, he's talking about Luciferian shit. So if you're a Freemason

Unknown Speaker  2:10:16
and my hand says, Okay, go for it. Go for it.

Unknown Speaker  2:10:23
Tell me about Albert Albert

Alex Jones  2:10:24
Pike. And I want to give I mean, Joe, here's the thing Joe, you brought in right? This was your point about a willingness it'll lead to your point because you brought up an issue this first one, please. You brought up the whole point about

Unknown Speaker  2:10:35
no more weed Alex. No more. Taking quotes from Buzz Aldrin

Unknown Speaker  2:10:42
when you went too deep. When

Unknown Speaker  2:10:46
the smoke you're talking to him take

Dan  2:10:49
the difference. I'm just to give some context of smoke weed earlier but also the thing. They were talking about how Buzz Aldrin in interviews has talked about how there's a like,

Jordan  2:11:02
yeah, Buzz Aldrin, certifiably saying nonsense. Now, he said that there was or that or he's right about a lot of shit that we're all scared about. Yeah,

Dan  2:11:11
there's a formation on Jupiter's moon or Venus, his moon Phobos or whatever. There's like a or D most Yeah. And so earlier in the show, Alex was talking about how Buzz Aldrin came on his show, and told him a bunch of truths. Yeah. And then so they Googled it. And they pulled up a C span video of him saying those things and I was like, he's had it on my

Jordan  2:11:32
show first. Yeah, of course. But the course

Dan  2:11:36
here's where I'll give Eddie Bravo. Some really nice props the whole time. He was like, He's fucking lying to you, Alex. He's like, he's fine with you.

Jordan  2:11:46
I love I love Eddie Bravo's. Like the narrative of this episode. So far has been Eddie Bravo going from sycophant to Hey, Alex, stay on topic. Well, but he's hurt he wants you to know. Yeah. Eddie Bravo has a curiosity that is heartening.

Dan  2:12:04
I think Eddie realizes they fall in love with Eddie Bravo. But that's his charm. And he is a charming little dope.

Jordan  2:12:10
I love it. It

Dan  2:12:11
kind of makes me sad that two hours ago I said he's an idiot. Yeah, no, he's a sweetheart. You shouldn't believe that vaccines are terrible and no, so chemtrails are stupid.

Jordan  2:12:20
He's one of those he's one of those guys who is curious and gullible. Yeah, and that makes him so susceptible to that kind of con man thing, but like if he Yeah, he means so well. He wants the world to be a better place. Yeah, that's why he's angry about chemtrails at the same not because he thinks people are screwing people over it's because he believes that his fellow man should not have to live underneath the tyranny that is imaginary trails of chemicals you're

Dan  2:12:48
so right i mean like i don't have this clip but it at some point in the episode he's talking about one of his interests in conspiracy you being I have a kid I don't want my kid to live in a world that I could have stopped Yeah, and so you aren't you're right that's where it's motivated. He seems

Jordan  2:13:04
like a such a good hearted. Like he

Dan  2:13:08
if he were walked back me calling him an idiot.

Jordan  2:13:11
Yeah, no, you you put him in like his life has this one very simple like fork in the road where it's like, you give him one set of information at one point in his life. Yeah, this is a guy who is now a fucking public defender could be a scholar just giving up everything to defend the poor and the helpless. Instead, you give him this one angle, and now he's asking Alex Jones whether or not chemtrails are real, but I always like that is a pure hearted man. Like I want to

Dan  2:13:41
also say take all of that shit away. He's apparently one of the best martial arts instructors in the world. Oh, well, good on him. I don't know anything about that. But apparently he is.

Jordan  2:13:49
Well, Joe is super credible. If Joe Rogan knows him, Joe Rogan's a UFC guy, right? And he's really trained some of Yeah, so I'm assuming that yeah, Joe Rogan knows him because people have been murdered on his account. So yeah,

Dan  2:14:02
anyway, here's the let's get back to the clip. I'm trying

Alex Jones  2:14:05
to dominate this.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:09
Nice seriously,

Alex Jones  2:14:09
I want to be nice. You're a great guy. Look, I

Unknown Speaker  2:14:12
love you man. I'm happy to see you. But I'm

Alex Jones  2:14:15
telling you this is that the globalist admit a lot of this it's in a lot of their white papers all the reports that actually give it to you I will they say they believe they're going to become gods. The rest of us are profane and

Unknown Speaker  2:14:26
all that shit about interdimensional beings given them all the data when he says all that,

Alex Jones  2:14:31
you know, where the theory of, of the species and where all the Darwin stuff came from. He had an elucidation and believe he was given all this stuff from like demons. And I'm not saying this.

Unknown Speaker  2:14:45
You confusing Darwin Descartes. No, no, that's didn't Descartes have it. Isn't he the one that came up with the idea of science, science from a dream. So Darwin's idea came from Darwin was like, really into watch handling and stuff. Yeah, yeah. And the guy acts like he doesn't Okay, whatever. What was the guy? The guy that yeah, a lot of those guys, they get the technology

Alex Jones  2:15:03
they believe from a frickin other dimension. You know people know all about this as much as I do or more Joe and you sit there and act like you don't know. I'm afraid to give your audience all the information.

Unknown Speaker  2:15:17
Yeah, but I'm a chalet Joe No.

Dan  2:15:23
So that was Alex realizing he had to show up. You know, he's drunk and he's like, Oh, I gotta be out. That was

Jordan  2:15:29
Alex from our Alex doing stand up episode. That's what that was.

Dan  2:15:33
I mean, that's Alex from going to break. Oh, that's a good boy. You know, Lucky that's, that's the fuck, I've got to shift into my own mode.

Jordan  2:15:41
Let's start with scientists. Yeah, no, yeah.

Dan  2:15:46
Well, you're gonna

Jordan  2:15:47
have you're gonna you're gonna pull scientists. You're never one scientist is gonna be Isaac Newton because he was an alchemist. He believed all that nonsense. Be the cart. No, thank you. I also

Dan  2:15:57
want to give credit I don't have the rest of the clip because it rambled a whole bunch. I guess they ended up getting into the apparently the guy who? Newton or not knowing the guy who Darwin was working with was into a bunch of weird shit. Yeah. And so that's what the MISC

Jordan  2:16:17
Well, I mean, Darwin is Darwin who was into a bunch of weird shit in that he was part of a club. That was all about eating as many different types of animals that you could possibly eat. Let doesn't seem that weird to me. No, right? You would want to eat a look? Have you eaten an ostrich? Never would. But you kind of want to write the ideas. Live. You only got one life to live. Why not eat an ostrich? Right?

Dan  2:16:40
I imagine I won't die and think like fluoxetine. And I imagine I won't I don't know. But I am.

Jordan  2:16:47
But But imagine that, you know, there's no point in it. Now, the thing is they there are plenty of insane scientists like they're mentioning of Tesla. Tesla was not somebody who believed in the occult, and then became smart. Tesla was somebody who was so unbelievably ridiculously capable of holding purely physiological images inside of his head that we can't really like. I can't even comprehend the idea of holding an entire machine schematics inside of my brain. Sure. Like he couldn't even write it down. He was he was a fucking genius. Like, he figured out wireless power. And we're still working on it. I'm quoting 100 years later, than I am to him. Exactly. Right. Now, if you were that guy living in a world full of the rest of us, why wouldn't you believe crazy nonsense, right, Billy? Now Descartes, on the other hand, Descartes was a mathematician, not a logician. Well, a philosopher. Yeah, well, yeah. But even then, it was because of his affinity to math. All of all of his, all of his syllogisms were purely if A then B kind of situations. Sure, it was all opponents. Exactly. Now, Isaac Newton, on the other hand, was a pure Alpha Alchemist. Where's like, if I figure this shit out, you know, gold, God, the whole shebang, that kind of thing.

Dan  2:18:15
So what's your point? As it relates to Alex

Jordan  2:18:18
My point being as it relates to the nonsense that Alex just said, is that at no time does he engage with what they did? Yeah, well, but he's it was all about tertiary nonsense and at no point does he engage with he's here's why these things are indisputable. He's

Dan  2:18:38
interested in the fact that they get this information from another dimension. They get it from trans dimensional beings that tell them what to do.

Jordan  2:18:47
But that's the end of that question right there.

Dan  2:18:51
That's dumb. But But anyway, here's here is a fun clip. It's not fun, necessarily, but it's short.

Alex Jones  2:19:02
Let me give you the good news. I'm not here to kiss the ass the establishment. Patriots in the government who have always criticized ended up being the people that hurt me bitching and you bitching do something? They've done something and they're really trying to reverse this whole thing right now. And there is a full out war inside the government of guys that like eat steaks, drink beer and have women versus a bunch of pot bellied pedophiles. Whoa,

Dan  2:19:25
yep, that's the war. That's the war. That's the war man steaks, cigars and Plessy versus potbelly pedophiles? There was a great point.

Jordan  2:19:36
I didn't know I would call that an oversimplification. Yet somehow that is not a strong enough word for it.

Dan  2:19:44
I didn't isolate this because what surrounded it wasn't interesting enough. But there was a point where Alex probably like two hours into the episode is like, Trump likes full grown women. Oh, of course. Oh, cool. ours Joe is like, I get it, you can just stop saying that. You're trying to say you're it's almost like him being like a very polite version of the lady doth protest too much. Yeah.

Jordan  2:20:16
So we have a company we gave you just enough rope, please don't hang yourself too much. We

Dan  2:20:20
have a couple of clips left. One of them will get back to the dumb, weirdo Illuminati narrative from earlier. But this one is Alex too drunk to fucking make a coherent argument. Okay, when the discussion of Obama's birth certificate comes up, and it's so fucking bizarre.

Jordan  2:20:45
Real quick. I genuinely think we should start to save all of my notes pages. Oh, no, me too, because I had the thought. If we put this up. If we put this up at fucking MoMA, this looks like the ramblings of this is like, the notebooks in the movie Seven is what this looks like.

Dan  2:21:08
I legitimately thought like, let's do it like a Patreon giveaway. Notebook.

Jordan  2:21:15
Yeah, the rage filled notebook pages of Jordan Do

Dan  2:21:19
you might need a whole new sheet here because this one is fun.

Jordan  2:21:23
Excellent. Bring the file here conversation

Alex Jones  2:21:25
on my store about a conversation. Myself and Donald Trump.

Unknown Speaker  2:21:28
Yes, sure. You allowed to do this. Wait a minute before you do it. Who cares me in trouble he's drunk and high

Alex Jones  2:21:36
on marijuana that okay? This is frickin all this is. Let's go. No, Trump. All right. You basically said we're going to clean it up Alex we know all about it, Alex, we're going to stop them. And um, we're gonna do it. But he also said Obama's from Kenya. Well, that was when that's a huge intelligence op. You want to write that down? You want to about Reagan? It was it'll talk about Mercer to me.

Jordan  2:21:58
Yes, please. Please.

Dan  2:22:00
Also just a warning. Yes, play. This clip is kinda long. I want to let it play just so we can hear. Like, I don't want to interrupt and get rid of the context because it doesn't make any sense.

Jordan  2:22:11
I'm gonna fill up a Notes Pages ladies and gentlemen, donate to the Patreon and you will be able to receive Jordan writing angrily about nonzero

Dan  2:22:20
patreon.com/freezing point also you can get Super Male Vitality. Okay, I want to smoke a cigarette. We'll get back at the end of this clip.

Alex Jones  2:22:29
Exactly. I now can tell you the full scoop on that.

Unknown Speaker  2:22:32
Right. What do you think happened there? I know exactly what they told him that Obama was from Kenya. They fucked with them. Anyway right now. Yes.

Alex Jones  2:22:40
Okay, I was gonna tell a Trump story but I'll do that. Trumps story

Unknown Speaker  2:22:46
Thank you, Eddie. Store.

Unknown Speaker  2:22:49
Jamie, you better add extra juice to that time series.

Alex Jones  2:22:55
Apple juice. What? Apple juice? Maybe not. Alex, come on. Okay, secret. One more.

Joe Rogan  2:22:59
That's Christ. If you get bored if you probably I'm going to fuck. In another dimension,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:07
how many years? Seven years. So we'll be able to you just about to say

Alex Jones  2:23:11
what was the what was the issue?

Unknown Speaker  2:23:12
Jesus Christ. Do you remember what the question was? Jamie?

Unknown Speaker  2:23:15
What Donald Trump told you

Alex Jones  2:23:16
now that wasn't it? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  2:23:18
no, you're about the same with Donald Trump told

Alex Jones  2:23:19
you knows that about wanting to know about something else? What the fuck is it about but let's

Unknown Speaker  2:23:23
leave fuck But

Unknown Speaker  2:23:24
hold on a second we fucking with my memory. What was it you were just you were just getting up? I'm not the only one I

Alex Jones  2:23:29
just have a good memory.

Unknown Speaker  2:23:30
Remember? We're too high this good. The Trump's

Unknown Speaker  2:23:34
weak Trump Jamie's gonna figure it out? Jamie's gonna figure it out. What does it tell me this? Yeah, someone's gonna tell him on Twitter and we'll figure this out Jesus Christ. Amen. All right, this a problem with being too high and talking over each other who's about to tell us

Unknown Speaker  2:23:50
Trump calls eight times a week on average

Alex Jones  2:23:53
nothing for a long time on our show. No no, this should be your longest podcast

Unknown Speaker  2:23:57
we will definitely peter out before then. No no. Look go forever what is no one knows what the fuck we were just talking about

Dan  2:24:05
a minute gap

Unknown Speaker  2:24:08
we all forget your question because we're blasted you better you better call your dispensary and get some answers. So

Unknown Speaker  2:24:14
you were talking about the Vatican? We were talking about pedophiles in the Catholic Church certificate. Oh, that's right.

Alex Jones  2:24:23
The false twin Yeah, so tell me what this is the place where I'm not ashamed of this because I got conned when I when I've been conned which happens you know every every once in a while you know I admit it later we learned from it. Okay, what happened? Was all medical only told you a funny. Kenya. Kenya. What? Okay, Kenya. Okay, everything. I'm gonna say your listeners can write this down. They can search engine everything. I'm gonna say

Jordan  2:24:50
I am writing this down.

Dan  2:24:52
I'm sorry to interrupt. I did Google all this

Alex Jones  2:24:55
and learn to see this for themselves because Okay, the journey with Infowars is it's not that I'm not saying RT, I'm just like you, I'm having this journey. And I'm going to show you so this is what happened, okay?

Dan  2:25:06
Also that is not at all how he presents it on his own show at all, at all.

Jordan  2:25:11
Generally speaking, he presents it as being 99.9%. Correct with him and all his sources if

Dan  2:25:18
you're an idiot and a globalist if you don't agree, disagree. You are a

Jordan  2:25:21
globalist.

Alex Jones  2:25:23
Obama's running for office and Hillary's people because I follow the news every day Hillary's campaign. This letter came out, puts out these morning Kenyan oh my gosh,

Dan  2:25:33
that was thoroughly debunked over and over and over again, how many times at least 25 million

Jordan  2:25:39
would you say over and over again, over and over and over and over? How many overs again,

Jordan  2:25:44
so many over so many overs? Okay,

Alex Jones  2:25:46
prove her. I was quietly and I'm really ashamed of this. But I told listeners this. I'll just say it. I was. I was an early on Obama supporter, in that I wanted to try to unify people. I didn't like John McCain. So I said, yeah, he's bad. The Democrats are bad, but I hated what had happened. So we

Joe Rogan  2:26:02
were fooled by Obama too. Well, I

Alex Jones  2:26:04
was hoping let's get let him talk. I mean, it was an Obama supporter. I just didn't attack him. You liked it better than the alternative. Yeah. Pushing for office. I was just like, hoping that all his BS was real. Okay. So I started hearing these leaks, and it was from Hillary, and you can Google the city, Hillary first pro generated the whole the whole deal. So I'm sitting there hearing dead, that he's born in Kenya. So I think I don't care. That's a bunch of BS. And then the article start coming out as the right wing picks it up, who does the research? And it's his wife in like, 2006. And seven in speech is going my husband born in Kenya, knows about the immigrants experience. It's video, you can pull up Michelle Obama. Oh, yeah. Pull it up. And then, and then Harvard Law Review, which he headed up for at least three years. He was the editor. And he says I was born in Kenya a little bit. He borrowed by his pitch. Oh, yeah. Said he's more but he wasn't more in Kenya, we plug into this. Oh, so that was some just like, Pizzagate Oh, it's not I finally learned how that no double cross. It's not not in pedophilia. I

Joe Rogan  2:27:06
mean, hold on, let's hear, say,

Michelle Obama  2:27:09
testing, which is still plaguing so many of our communities, which you all know, a lot of that is due to homophobia. Barak has led by example, when we took our trip to Africa and visited his home country in kenya. We took a public HIV test. For the very point of showing folks in Kenya.

Joe Rogan  2:27:31
That doesn't mean that he was

Alex Jones  2:27:33
like, a club. He just found that fast. But there's another where she said there's the Harvard Law Review, which he edited where he says I was born in Kenya.

Unknown Speaker  2:27:40
Okay, well, that should right there. What she's saying is his homeland, like if you're from Ireland, like they want to go back to Italy or Ireland or Yeah, it's they call it the homeland.

Alex Jones  2:27:51
But let's it let's just going on to what we're recovering.

Unknown Speaker  2:27:54
Can you Trump certificate,

Alex Jones  2:27:57
so yeah, Trump got involved in all that. So an old Bircher will go ahead. No,

Unknown Speaker  2:28:00
no. So how did he What did someone like leaked that information to him to try to make him look foolish because he chased after it?

Alex Jones  2:28:06
Yes. So we're just researching it by timing by foolish

Unknown Speaker  2:28:11
so do you think they just maybe made an incorrect judgment we found out all about this is stunning

Alex Jones  2:28:15
information.

Dan  2:28:16
So

Alex Jones  2:28:20
ladies and gentlemen, they then look at him in the Harvard Law Review saying he's warning Kenny they look at clips. They look at the fact he won't release his birth certificate. He had a name name. He did very Sitara and Indonesia he had all these word cut out names. All he had like five aliases. Wow. Why did he wrote that? He wrote dream look it up because he wrote he wrote dreams of my real father, right? Dreams. My father's father's the documentaries of my real father. And he talks about Frank Marshall Davis, the communist famous pornographer that he spent summers when he looked side by sides, the same guy. So they were worried that it was gonna be Frank Marshall Davis, but it actually been his mom in like a scam making money off. She was CIA, bringing back people to us and sham marriages to have them emigrate. It was basically a cover up for the fact that his real father was Frank Marshall Davis, the communist. And so that's who Obama's real dad was. And dreams. My real father breaks it all down. It's online. It's pretty powerful info.

Dan  2:29:20
I mean, that's a rambley goddamn answer, if there ever was one. So let's take

Jordan  2:29:30
a whole

Dan  2:29:32
Do we have an answer to what matters there? Um, why the what? Okay,

Jordan  2:29:38
so the question is the birth certificate. Yeah. All right. Trump got conned? Sure. So did Alex.

Dan  2:29:48
By whom? Frank Marshall Davis he's dead. The

Jordan  2:29:53
CIA maybe, isn't it? Did he just say that Obama's mom was a CIA operative?

Dan  2:29:59
Yes. I was groomed by the CIA from birth. All right now one apple juice. You keep saying that? That's fucking cute.

Jordan  2:30:08
I feel like he's not just drinking apple juice. No and,

Dan  2:30:11
and I watched the entire video you can see he's drinking it like water. Oh yeah, there's a couple incidents.

Jordan  2:30:18
It looks like he's it sounds like he's drinking like

Dan  2:30:21
water. There's a couple of incidences of him just pouring shots and you can see like Joe's face being like, like there's a couple that don't play on audio. So,

Jordan  2:30:30
right. Okay, so Trump got involved because he got conned. That's the that's the story that you are interested in figuring it out. Yeah, the whole thing is Trump is innocuous. In this situation.

Dan  2:30:44
It all came from Hillary's people. It all came it was pre generated, which again, please look into that. That is not not

Jordan  2:30:51
bullshit. Straight bullshit. All righty. So yet again, somehow, one. alcoholics are mad at him for drinking too much.

Dan  2:31:03
That came up in that clip. Yeah,

Jordan  2:31:05
yeah. Well, Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo are clearly

Dan  2:31:09
alcoholics. Drink look, I he's a weed guy.

Jordan  2:31:13
Yeah, but I mean, I I'm an alcoholic. I'm not killing myself. But I'm I'm still

Dan  2:31:19
out but don't pay Joe and or Eddie in that way. But yeah, that Eddie Eddie is

Jordan  2:31:25
our lovable hero in this in this whole thing.

Dan  2:31:27
There's a difference between an alcoholic and a functional drinker. You know, like those that those two things are very different. Okay? His Alex's behavior is indicative of an alcoholic Alex isn't Oh, I can drink and not really be like, but again,

Jordan  2:31:42
you and I are professional alcoholics as opposed

Dan  2:31:45
to might be part of our comedian lifestyle.

Jordan  2:31:48
Exactly, exactly. It's not that you know, for normal people. This is that good point. Irrelevant point. You're right. You're right. All right. One I like that. Alex Jones said that he was ashamed. Sure. Because I don't know if that's a thing that's possible for him. Well, my

Dan  2:32:05
therapist likes to tell me that shame means I'm bad guilt means I did something bad. So if when you're ashamed, that means that you're indicating that you are bad. Your behavior was actually bad. It wasn't just an action it was something about yourself

Jordan  2:32:19
so what you're saying is on our next podcast, your therapist is going to be a guest right?

Dan  2:32:23
I wish that's a very interesting lady.

Jordan  2:32:26
Oh god there's so much there's always another clip that was the thing that I listened thinking every single time and if you watch every single time that he gets any challenge it's because you didn't watch the right clip and if you didn't watch the right thing if you watch

Dan  2:32:44
the clip yeah is like this

Jordan  2:32:46
is it Yeah, it

Dan  2:32:47
changes to none at all.

Jordan  2:32:48
Ya know and there's a day you didn't see the right clip there's all there's always a different clip I should support whatever I say

Dan  2:32:56
from about the our point when he starts drinking throughout this episode. Okay, the his face is this mug. And I'm not saying smug like I'm mad at him or anything like that, but it is like a he's like preening, kind of like this. Hey, whenever whenever he pulled out that title 50 Chapter 32 subs, I have it written down. That's why I can

Jordan  2:33:19
Yeah, I know. You remember,

Dan  2:33:20
you've got some great notes. pulled that out. There was a look on his face like I've done it. I've convinced them

Jordan  2:33:29
I have been to the mountaintop. Yeah,

Dan  2:33:33
there wasn't an interaction. It didn't look like friends interacting. It did from Joe's end. But from Alex's end it really looked like someone who's like fuck I made it through this trial. Oh yeah, like Oh, everything is okay. I don't look like an idiot. And unfortunately to anyone who isn't drinking the Kool Aid so to speak. Yes. You look like a total idiot he looks

Jordan  2:33:55
a well but yeah, because that's his default position. Explain to me there's so every The amazing thing about that long list of nonsense was that it seemed like every single thing he said lead into the next thing. Sure. And yet they are completely and utterly unrelated to each other and I should

Dan  2:34:21
say it does go on longer it I'm sure it does more stuff about like Frank Marshall Davis and what have you like it that?

Jordan  2:34:28
It just so his real father is supposed to be Frank Marshall

Dan  2:34:31
Dave was a communist and a pornographer. Yes, right. Yeah. Why? Well also what's fun about that is that they they put up a shot a picture on screen of Frank Marshall Davis Obama's alleged dad and Obama is like look at just look at it looks exactly like him. Do they look like? I don't know. But what's great is Joe is like, I don't really think he looks like his dad more than he looks. And there's no response.

Jordan  2:35:00
Do you do you mean because of course, yeah. Would you say because of course

Dan  2:35:04
I withhold judgment. I don't care, but also this Barry Soetoro nonsense.

Jordan  2:35:09
Yeah. Where did that name come from?

Dan  2:35:12
It comes from who is that?

Jordan  2:35:14
I'm sure you've done research. My job is to say to you who looked into

Dan  2:35:19
this, and I don't, I can't fully explain it. But I do know that a lot of sources I've been able to find site like a fake college ID.

Jordan  2:35:30
All right, that has that name. That's all I ever needed to hear.

Dan  2:35:34
The aliases seem to be photoshopped identification of him. It goes back to this idea of like, there was this whole narrative that like he, no one that went to college with him remembers him, except for all the people who went to college. Right. But But except for those people. Don't worry about that. Yeah, no one remembers him because his actual name was Barry Soetoro. I don't I don't know. I'm not interested in this narrative. Because I tipped I dipped my toe. Yeah, but that seemed crazy. I dipped my toe into the pool. And I was like,

Jordan  2:36:08
yeah, let the let that. Just let that one go.

Dan  2:36:09
Yeah. Okay. It didn't pass the smell test.

Jordan  2:36:13
All right. So. So I've written down all of the like little angles here. Sure. And I have yet to see one that's related to Kenya other the other ones. Yeah, Kenya. So the the whole purported idea behind this question and answer situation was

Dan  2:36:32
that Trump got set up. Yes. Yeah. Okay.

Jordan  2:36:36
Was there any, like, evidence of that? So all the stuff I wrote what's

Dan  2:36:44
evidence, all the stuff I wrote? Like, what is evidence all the stuff

Jordan  2:36:47
that I wrote is is constantly like one the first thing I wrote is Bravo's is high as fuck, he's real high. That's what I that's the only thing that in all of my notes, I can confirm. 100% He's good at he's a delight. He's by far my favorite

Dan  2:37:03
character so far. He's like, a lot of our friends who get high all the time. They're great at being high

Jordan  2:37:08
in all of our episodes. BrahMos is our hero at this

Dan  2:37:11
point. Just Bravo. Bravo is like it's Game of Thrones. No, I'm

Jordan  2:37:15
gonna go with Game of Thrones here. He's a water dancer. That's what I know. For sure. Your fucking point. Don't Don't keep me from saying his name is Kenny Bravo, or Eddie Bravo's

Dan  2:37:28
go. We have three more clips.

Jordan  2:37:31
All right. Okay, here's my ultimate point. I have no idea what the fuck he is trying to say

Dan  2:37:39
neither do I. I ever listened to the entire thing three times. Okay. Anyway, we get back to the elites and what their plan is? Yes. And Alex brings out an example of one of the evil members of the elite cabal interdimensional and then I want to give props. Joe kind of asked him some questions that can't really be answered. Gotcha. Which is fun.

Alex Jones  2:38:04
Let's let me give you the big picture. Please. The Elite admit that they are studying humanity like they're a breakaway civilization. They believe they're taking the best ideas of humanity and building a breakaway civilization of technocracy show they can transcend us and I want the public to know the decision has been made to dumb you down balkanize you turn you against yourselves, have regional wars, play people off against each other, and then basically released bio weapons that wipe out most of the population. Okay, all the transcendent, you know,

Unknown Speaker  2:38:34
pause this right here. Who are the elite? Like when you say the elite? Who are these people? And how do they get together? Hold on a second, how do they all agree? Who votes to it? How do they decide what type a super billionaire characters to like run and shit? So how do they get together and all agree on the same thing?

Alex Jones  2:38:52
They decide on agendas that will empower their individual agendas and they're pretty much let into those power structures early on side of the news. They are okay the Brooke group is as the Bilderberg Group of Rome Bilderberg Group, the Club of Rome de voce Club of Rome is a population reduction group. I mean, if you go to infowars.com Right now, there's an article and a video I cut about Oprah Winfrey, I'm not saying is a bad person, or she's part of a secret eugenics group.

Unknown Speaker  2:39:17
Hold on a second stop right there. You said I'm not saying she's a bad person, but she's part of a secret eugenics like killing white people, I'm just trying to thin the hair and I'm a really good person though.

Alex Jones  2:39:32
Yeah, that's hilarious. Like, absolutely. So you can go there it's the truth about Oprah Winfrey. Okay. And it just deals with its new Choi Oprah Winfrey and secretly a

Unknown Speaker  2:39:43
face he looks so Sarah the toilet you think she's in secret meetings with like the Bilderberg

Alex Jones  2:39:47
Group? She admits that okay to report that they had met on the news to reduce population right, because we looked at first

Unknown Speaker  2:39:54
but when you know when some variance DACA Hold please, when some Unlike her says something about reducing the amount of illegitimate babies born or the amount of babies that are born because there's no birth control. A lot of times those kind of statements get construed into population control. She's in the media and people start saying she's in the population control. And that means she wants she'll

Alex Jones  2:40:17
have a secret meetings, and she's pushing it and she's taxing.

Unknown Speaker  2:40:21
I'm not in those secret meetings. Are you in no secret meetings? We like to have you ever been in one of those secret meetings? Do you hear what they said? Yes. Did they say they're gonna kill half the people? No.

Jordan  2:40:35
That's that was they just pulled our our timing on that, didn't they? They just pulled our fake news time ago that

Dan  2:40:42
that ending is amazing. Are you there? I want it. Where

Jordan  2:40:46
are you? Did they say what you said? So you missed it. Did you say what they wanted? Yeah. What do you say what they said? Again, okay.

Unknown Speaker  2:40:53
It construed into population control. She's in the end, people start saying she's into population control. And that means she wants

Alex Jones  2:41:01
she'll have a secret meetings, and she's pushing it and she's taxing.

Unknown Speaker  2:41:04
I'm not in those secret meetings. Are you in those secret meetings? You go to those things that we like to have you ever been in one of those secret meetings? Do you hear what they said? Yes. Did they say they want to kill half the people? No.

Dan  2:41:15
He's too drunk.

Jordan  2:41:17
That was honest answers. Yeah, no, that was that was like when did what did he just say he sunk is to one. Oh, he's not going to hear me and grow. It sounded like he's sunk into one.

Dan  2:41:29
He talks after this clip. A little bit slurry. How he snuck into Bohemian Grove. He's like there's some good people there. Sure. Sure. He did. Yeah. And I recommend everybody look into the real story about that.

Jordan  2:41:42
It's insane. I yeah, now

Dan  2:41:45
that worked in the front door. No one cared. Look when you

Jordan  2:41:51
if you go after Oprah show what's wrong with you?

Dan  2:41:55
And the best not miss

Jordan  2:41:56
you best. If you come at the king you best not miss. Yeah, yeah. What are you doing going after Oprah? Why Oprah?

Dan  2:42:04
Right. It's because she has that she's becoming a 60 minutes contributor or whatever. He's mad at her about this fucking

Jordan  2:42:09
Oprah. There's there is zero. Of all the people I can't think of like maybe Ellen DeGeneres is the lesser of like, okay,

Dan  2:42:21
do you notice a trend though, that people who he attacks are pretty much never white and male. It's not a coincidence. I've

Jordan  2:42:29
never noticed that trend. Everybody, I find it incredibly offensive that you would say that about our race blind. Alex Jones, who has never talked about race on his show. How could he Why would somebody label him as a bigot?

Dan  2:42:47
There's a whole episode we never covered where he just screamed about Don Lemon the entire show. I don't think we should cover it because I don't like Don Lemon either.

Jordan  2:42:55
Yeah, I look that's that's one thing where that we have up to bat for Look, I don't I don't want to I don't want to get into that argument there. I don't want to find that gray area where we find ourselves in the Venn diagram together.

Dan  2:43:07
So Jordan, this next clip is the it has no substance to it. Okay, but listen for it. Joe says something that he has said a couple times I just isolated one of them. It's the greatest

Unknown Speaker  2:43:21
nail it Junior here he was killed.

Unknown Speaker  2:43:23
That can make you think totally differently. For sure when your kid dies you're like fuck this I'm going with Eddie.

Dan  2:43:31
Eddie is talking about I hypothetical situation where JFK is kid died before he started going after the mob. Anyway. Sure.

Unknown Speaker  2:43:41
Oh, my soul, right? Yeah, you're like fuck this. What could be worse what my son already died? What's coming after you?

Dan  2:43:57
Isolated that clip just because it's like a key. Like there's a couple times where he tells him let's not do more whiskey. Just keeps bringing the whiskey out.

Jordan  2:44:07
Once again, Eddie Bravo is our conscience as he Bravo is our guide. Yeah, I guess I agree with Eddie Bravo and every aspect of what he say. He is saying. If your kid dies Sure, basically Eddie Bravo is giving you license to believe that taken is real.

Dan  2:44:25
Yeah, he's trying to let you know that humanity is we got to get through these last couple of clips. Let's do it. We're gonna we're pushing through. Yeah, let's do it. We were always going to hold you this next clip is where Alex kind of gives up the ghost a little bit and shows his cards.

Alex Jones  2:44:42
Let's just play it. Globalism is like Neo colonialism but it's corporate colonialism over humans individuals government states old world new world. Its worldwide colonialism. Rothschild, Rockefeller national its monopoly capitalism rock other populations and create centralized systems of monopolies and control is the innovation. It wants to end up with mobility. Why was it globalism is corporate world government?

Unknown Speaker  2:45:11
Why did they want to stop innovation?

Alex Jones  2:45:15
Because they see it was burping. They see it as what they call disruptive technology and humanity so powerful. You've already got a monopoly. So

Unknown Speaker  2:45:23
is this a reason consideration after the internet has been marketed?

Alex Jones  2:45:26
Now global is bigger than that. But yes, okay. You're part of that's true. Since they've already got control. They want competition to end they're in control. They don't want challengers they've seized control the human psyche, human development to the stars, they've got it all they think they're getting rid of humanity to becoming gods, whatever dimension they're tuned into, told him that. So they want debates to end. Right. And they want authoritarianism they want

Unknown Speaker  2:45:49
what would happen there.

Unknown Speaker  2:45:51
And how is how is Donald Trump going to stop this?

Unknown Speaker  2:45:54
A bolt came off the you're going to see it as making bolts to the

Unknown Speaker  2:45:58
rescue. Alex, how are you hoping? What does have to do with blocking

Alex Jones  2:46:04
chances are energy siphons or vampiric action course. So if he actually cuts taxes, the poor people middle class and gets rid of tax incentives for really rich, he's like coming after the rich, but from a conservative perspective, the Republicans are cheering

Unknown Speaker  2:46:16
him. So is that what he wants to do? He wants to cut taxes for everybody.

Unknown Speaker  2:46:20
Except the rich, he's gonna increase them. Really? Oh, yeah. That seems like the opposite of what a rich guy would do. Right?

Alex Jones  2:46:26
But he understands like Henry Ford did. You got to sell a car where people have it can afford to buy it. You got to pay your employees where they can buy it. He wants real prosperity. He doesn't this is Trump now get off in his in his limousine rather than buy burnout old towns.

Unknown Speaker  2:46:41
does is it's been announced this tax plan. Yeah. No,

Dan  2:46:46
it has it's on his website. And you know, there's a lot of nonsense on there. I see based on

Jordan  2:46:53
everything he's done so far. No, we basically answer is the exact opposite.

Dan  2:46:58
He basically presents it as like, there's going to be lower taxes for poor people, and there's going to be higher taxes for the super rich did not do any of that. And some economists have broken it down. And it is true under his tax plan, people who make very little would have to pay no taxes, which is true now,

Jordan  2:47:20
if that at all comes to pass, which it will not

Dan  2:47:23
but it's also true now. Yeah, people who make very little are exempt from taxes. That's called a progressive tax system, which exists now for a good reason. So there was some exist way better. There's a bunch of analysis that's been done on Trump's proposed tax plan. And what everyone has found is the top earners would see bigger tax cuts under Trump's plan. Who would have guessed? The lowest income group would see a point 6% cut on their taxes? Yeah, so and point 6% of whatever bullshit they're making is almost nothing.

Jordan  2:48:06
I mean, when you make very little point, 6% is more important. It might matter. Yeah, she does matter. Sure. But when you make a lot, the middle day, their next guy, which would be what are we let's say, okay, the sub 1% This is how 1% in token down, okay?

Dan  2:48:26
The analysis is broken to quintile. Okay, it's broken. Let's go in groups.

Jordan  2:48:29
Let's talk with the top five. Let me take a guess as to what their tax cut would be

Dan  2:48:34
percentage wise, top five, okay. Are you going lowest? No, I'm going with the ultimate top, okay? The top quintile?

Jordan  2:48:43
Let's go with 22%?

Dan  2:48:48
No, they're their current rate. The top is 31.1.

Jordan  2:48:53
Right? So they're gonna lower it to an extreme extent, right?

Dan  2:48:57
27.9. It's a 3.2% drop in their taxes.

Jordan  2:49:01
You know what, that's not as bad as I thought

Dan  2:49:03
in the top quintile. That's the top group. Now, if you break it down even further, the top 1% drops 6.5%, of course, and the top one or point 1% drops. 7.3%. Wonderful. So he's

Jordan  2:49:22
glad that they get to keep more of their money. He was really concerned that they had too much money,

Dan  2:49:27
his tax proposals, do lower taxes for poor people, but unless you count some ways,

Jordan  2:49:34
unless you count the fact that he got rid of the mortgage income tax for it. I'm like, yeah, no, no, he's he's fucked. Everybody who voted for him. And our renters are now poisoned. Yeah. And our rivers are now on fire. Yes, exactly. We're gonna go back to the old days of Cleveland. I'm excited for our rivers to be made of fire instead of water.

Dan  2:49:54
It'll be delightful. Yeah, but the idea that there is like this This this, this tax thing that he's super progressive about is is bullshit. It's complete bullshit. He it's an absolute lie. That sounds good, like the way that Trump presents. It does sound good, but upon further analysis, it's decent. For people who aren't making any money. No, you're paying less, you're paying slightly less not but there's huge

Jordan  2:50:25
you're paying, you're paying slightly less. Yes. But you're gonna wind up getting way fewer benefits.

Dan  2:50:32
We have one more clip.

Jordan  2:50:33
One more. Oh, shit, we're at the ultimate clip, right? We're coming to

Dan  2:50:37
it. And this is where Alex weaves back to his weird Illuminati beliefs, spells out some bullshit. Excellent and betrays his own point about what he believes, oh, this clip is just labeled bullshit.

Alex Jones  2:51:00
The big issues of the world is he never asked me about Ronald Reagan. I want to know about

Unknown Speaker  2:51:03
aliens. We're still on a line. But I keep coming back to that. Because I want to know, what do they know about aliens? What do you what are the real? What do you believe?

Alex Jones  2:51:16
And what I say is not political. And it's not from my particular perspective. Okay. It's from the no knowledge in the universe. Okay. All right. We live in a third dimensional plane, we can see the planets, the galaxies, the suns, hundreds of billions of galaxies, photograph universes. We live in an amazing space time continuum. Yeah. The elites believe that it's not in the third dimension, that we're mainly receiving transmissions that doesn't make sense, ships don't arrive from Aldous and Turing's or the uni prime for wherever they're coming from, or below, G's be hooked. They come here through interdimensional gates that are much closer through fold space. And so as the guys we have to discuss the different influences there in the universe, and the fact that we have freewill. And we decided we want I don't believe in any of this. I'm simply telling you what the elites believe.

Unknown Speaker  2:52:12
So they believe that there's another dimension and these beings are abundant.

Unknown Speaker  2:52:17
Imagine they need baby blood, right? They need babies

Alex Jones  2:52:24
were released powerful, were made the image of our Creator, our brain is able to tune into the lowest dimension, the highest dimension, humans are basically really powerful creatures that can live right close to suns, they're highly radioactive, nothing else can live, it's close. They're very short lives. Because we're like a hive organism that actually lives second to second, in the space time continuum is like 100 years, it's a second. And we transmit our data up to be able to live next to like the Stargate jump gates that are that are sons. So because we live so close to the suns, we only have like milliseconds to be alive. So we're actually a hive organism that keeps transmitting up to the next species in our in our in our hierarchical system, and then down below us. So we're alive right now in this continuum. And we're trying to progress and make things better. And the elites are trying to make sure that we don't dial into that incredible knowledge we've got as a species and basically die as a species so that we're not competitors on the next level, as the Bible says, of their dimensional plane,

Unknown Speaker  2:53:30
but But you don't believe that you're just saying that's what they believe?

Alex Jones  2:53:35
Oh, yes, exactly.

Unknown Speaker  2:53:37
What do you believe?

Alex Jones  2:53:38
I mean, I believe in research

Unknown Speaker  2:53:39
do you think that I believe in research too? Do you think that there is something from other dimensions that can access us?

Alex Jones  2:53:46
This this we are other dimensions? The 13 Sasha is only one limited plane in a larger spectrum I

Unknown Speaker  2:53:53
do believe so. We're a part of that spectrum.

Alex Jones  2:53:55
Well, let's just say we're not in Kansas anymore.

Dan  2:53:58
Oops. Oops. His whole thing about like not believing this is what the elites believe he just admitted that he does believe it. And what he believes is

Jordan  2:54:13
all the word nonsense all of those words all of those words, did you hear all those words? I did. Those words are not connected to other words in all of those words, no, not money. I've heard a lot of those words before but never in the order that those words were said I have on Reddit troll posts. Those were the craziest words I've said in the same words know the word such

Dan  2:54:34
but it all does make total sense if you No, no, it makes total sense. If you have access to like a lot of this weirdo internet culture, like it's part of the video. It goes by it goes back to it goes back to him having sources that aren't real goes back to this thing where he believes his callers that call in the tell him like hey, you know Memphis D O T is out The roads

Jordan  2:55:01
that ship he believes he becomes the Department of Transportation comes out on the reread

Dan  2:55:06
something on some blog or some message board and it becomes reality to him. It's the same thing it happens over and over and over again. This is happening now in the conspiracy world. See,

Jordan  2:55:16
this is the thing about this episode that makes me question a lot of the things that I've said on other episodes is this is him with his guard down. Yeah, like this is not him performing. This is him letting what he believes in reality, like through

Dan  2:55:32
when he Yeah, like Joe a little bit earlier that yeah, kind of performative. But yes, if it is just

Jordan  2:55:37
Well, no, not even like me speaking from the heart. He's drunk. He's fucking high. He's letting it fly. Doesn't sound like I apologize for rhyming. No, you're fine. I know. I will never forgive myself. No, he's he's revealing all of those deep seated beliefs. He has. Yeah. Which is batshit insanity. Like, he's like the the the simple idea that dimensions exist. The way that he's described him is so insane. But to like fair, but And that's that fine with that. That's the least Exactly. That's the least of the insane things that he said. Like he's just him saying like, Oh, we're on the third dimension. You're like, well, that's the least crazy thing. You've said we exist in three dimensions. Like

Dan  2:56:26
I meditate a lot and like I have had experience with like lucid dreams, right. And I feel like there have been things that I've tapped into that. Really just my brain. Yeah, maybe accessing something from outside myself. Yeah. And so like that idea of like, tiered existence maybe there's something to it you know what though? I'm not going to base my worldview

Jordan  2:56:49
and that is exactly where we become friends.

Dan  2:56:54
I'm not gonna base my fear of the government.

Jordan  2:56:57
The the alt how is it that interdimensional beings is the least of what we're talking about? I don't know the fact that he even believes in interdimensional beings from beetle googlies. Yeah, from like, Oh, you must announce things were? No, no, no, that man is drunk. That means high. Fuck off is very drunk. I'm not going to.

Dan  2:57:23
I've listened to a lot of episodes on this podcast ever heard him cut someone off? batshit? Like, I've never heard him be like a bartender and be like you've had enough. That's insane. He Okay, I think there was there was a few that like if he likes more, he's gone. Let's

Jordan  2:57:43
let's get into our final like, this is the final part of this podcast. We

Dan  2:57:47
are done with the clips. All right. I will say that the show does go on a little bit past this. Yeah. And then

Jordan  2:57:55
we've got to what we needed to get. I didn't want to play like some

Dan  2:57:57
of the embarrassing drunk clips.

Jordan  2:58:00
If you listen to the Elliott hated himself bad about himself,

Dan  2:58:03
it's really embarrassing years apart, where he tries to get ready to punch him in the shoulder. And it's just like, it's, it's like an idiot who you don't want at a party who's too drunk. Like trying to get attention, right. And it's it actually made me feel very dirty. And it's part of the empathy part. Oh, yeah. But I feel like I feel bad for him. Yeah. And I don't say that in a judgmental way. I just say it in like a man, I've been there.

Jordan  2:58:31
It's it's hard to be an empathetic human being without looking at Alex Jones.

Dan  2:58:37
There's an episode. Okay. So my friends. All right. Some friends of mine did a radio show in Columbia, Missouri. Okay, that went from two to five in the morning.

Jordan  2:58:46
That's the wrong time to have a radio show.

Dan  2:58:48
It was local access, of course. And so people would show up there and get drunk at the studio. On my birthday, one year, I went and I was fucking wasted acts. And I just started, like, just talking about how great national treasure was. I ramble. But I talk. I'm, I don't even I'm embarrassed to listen back to it. Okay, I keep getting kicked off the air because I keep coughing. And then they keep bringing me back into the studio. And then because you're great. And then the cycle, right, right. I did that on my birthday one year. And then like a year later, I found out that my brother had made a DVD or a CD of the audio of it. Okay, I've been giving it to people. Because he thought it was

Jordan  2:59:36
hilarious. It's probably hilarious.

Dan  2:59:38
I can't I can't muster the courage to listen to it. But it probably describes her. Yeah, dude, real talk for sure. I will put that out for them. But like, I get the idea of being too drunk to be on a broadcast. Yeah, like that sort of thing. I empathize with that. I get that. Yeah. When I was on that broadcast, I wasn't trying to explain truth about the globalists. Well, but but that's just talking shit.

Jordan  3:00:08
That's the that's the conversation for us to have right now. At what point are we going to get into the hole in vino veritas thing? Like literal vino exactly like, okay, Is he drunk and high enough to tell the truth? Well when I'm too drunk and too high to make any sense,

Dan  3:00:30
here's where I would draw the line when I was on that show on my birthday at two in the morning, right? I didn't say anything that I don't agree with. I just talked about how great Nicolas Cage was about he is great. I might have said some hacky jokes. I might have repeated some things that I'd heard other places. Right as conversation. Yeah, those, but I

Jordan  3:00:52
didn't say anything. laughs as a funny, unpredictable. Poor. Yeah.

Dan  3:00:56
I believe that. I don't think that when you're drunk. You're your truest form. Right. But I don't think when you're wasted, you're capable of coming up with something that isn't really you.

Jordan  3:01:09
Okay. That's an interesting, that's an interesting idea.

Dan  3:01:12
I think that it's a middle ground

Jordan  3:01:15
as as a mentally ill person of the bipolar faith.

Dan  3:01:22
We get it. Yeah.

Jordan  3:01:25
Are you gonna just ride on that for the rest of your life?

Dan  3:01:28
Jordan get a fucking personality.

Jordan  3:01:34
How about develop your own identity? No. So. So as far as as my experience with that, right? So when I'm manic, it is not that I am accessing some sort of inner self that is not allowed to come out whenever I'm under control. So much as it is a like constant aspect of creation. Like, every single moment is me creating some new moment. So whenever Listen, yeah, aggressively. Yeah. To the point where the moment that I've just created is the only moment that has ever existed in history that there needs to be another one. Exactly. The next one is going to be way better than the one that I just said, Yeah. Now, that is, however, not what I would describe being drunk as, like, to me being drunk is just loosening all of those, those guards you have. So to me listening to him talk when he is shit faced. I imagine that he wakes up the next day saying, Oh, I was drunk, and I shouldn't have said that. Not. I was drunk, and I made all that shit up.

Dan  3:02:51
Well, he did do a show the next day. Okay, and he didn't. He only had the only thing he said about it was that Joe Rogan's podcast is one of the most downloaded in the world record

Jordan  3:03:04
gars and I'm sure they did, they did. And of course they did. He's

Dan  3:03:09
not lying in terms of that. I don't like for me, I drink and maybe it's just my physiology or whatever, but like, I get hung over and I'm sorry, you're so ashamed of everything. Even when I just say truth, right? I'm ashamed.

Jordan  3:03:22
Right. But I genuinely think that what wound up happening was he got caught in a couple of different spiral he didn't get caught. No, I mean, I'm not in like he got caught gotcha wise, but like, in in his like physical brain chemistry. He got caught in two ways. One he got caught into this spiral of saying the the underpinnings of what all of his beliefs are which are that if you if you genuinely think they're interdimensional beings, that's Yeah, exactly. That justifies every single conspiracy theory that he's got it it is the underpinning of it right that's

Dan  3:04:06
who's doesn't? That's who's propping up George Soros. Yeah, exactly. Doesn't matter who's no demon. No,

Jordan  3:04:13
he's not racist. He's not anti semitic. He's not anything interesting. Again, interdimensional beings. Yeah. And even if you tried to understand it, you couldn't. They're interdimensional beings.

Dan  3:04:25
And when you call him a racist, or an anti Semite, you just

Jordan  3:04:29
don't get it. Exactly. You don't get it. You don't get it because you are living on this second dimension nine bird whereas he's on the fourth dimension. Well, human beings are on the trip. They're staggered. Yeah. Now there's that part. And then there's also the part that is the exaggeration part, where

Dan  3:04:51
all my sources are amazing. Yeah,

Jordan  3:04:52
exactly. Where he goes into all of that, like, oh, there's 12 dimensions. He doesn't really believe that 12 dimensional nonsense. what he believes is that there's six dimensions and he's just going overboard. Like that kind of thing. Like, I interesting, I genuinely think let's use car dealer that all of the stuff that he said is exactly what he believes. But just he exaggerates it to be cool. Like he wants Joe Rogan to think he's cool so bad that they're like, there's the he wants Joe Rogan to like him. Yeah, no doubt so bad. No doubt. It is. It is pathetic. Well, but

Dan  3:05:33
it goes against his whole narrative of being like, I'm not impressed by stars and stuff. Oh, he for him. He would have been friends for years.

Jordan  3:05:42
But that's, that's not necessarily a like, that's not an argument against Yeah, like, I have plenty of friends who I want to think I'm cool. And all of their names are reason.

Dan  3:05:57
Beat you to the gym.

Jordan  3:05:59
How dare you. We got to

Dan  3:06:00
go. Here's my assessment on that. Here's, here's my like, bow that I would put on it. All right.

Jordan  3:06:07
We're at the end of the show. So yeah, now's the time for the bow. I rhymed. Again, I'm so sorry.

Dan  3:06:13
This is two strikes. I'm gonna fire you up. There we are getting there anyways, there are there's a bunch of shit he's saying. And I think it goes back to what I was saying in the middle of the show. There's two narratives that how many years ago was that

Jordan  3:06:28
there's metal, the show was that

Dan  3:06:30
1944 73 There are two threads that he's weaving and he's trying to do them in his own brain. And he's, he's not doing a great job. But one of them is that narrative about Trump being great and the taxes and that he doesn't hate immigrants. And it's that's the propaganda thread. And then the other thread is kind of what deep down he actually believes. That is that the globalists are a bunch of pedophiles, and they believe in transdimensional beings. And he believes in that too. And he has to fight against that. The passion doesn't come from the Trump wants to lower your taxes. Right. Passion comes from the bullshit side. Yeah, the passion comes from the fantasy world. Make them ups. Yeah. And he can't you figure out how to make those threads intertwine right on his actual show, all he can talk about is the taxes and all that stuff. But he has the passion of the other shit out. He knows. Because he's not that dumb. He knows that if he brings up all this other transdimensional bullshit on his Infowars show. It's game over II. He brings it up on Rogan where it's like, no one who hates him is gonna listen and call it out. Right and anyone who does listen to that guy was drunk he was and and if

Jordan  3:08:01
you're a Joe Rogan listener, you're just gonna be like that was talking how Larry

Dan  3:08:05
are hilarious, or that guy gets it the tour.

Jordan  3:08:08
I can't stop listening to Kenny Bravo's. That's what

Dan  3:08:13
it feels like he's in Safe Harbor. And he lets out a little bit of that. And from my perspective, I really think that everyone needs to do a much better job of understanding the Internet communities waves.

Jordan  3:08:27
It's crazy how that guy that insane person that we just listened to talk about 12 dimensional beings has more influence over our government right now than CNN.

Dan  3:08:42
Not necessarily. You thinks he does. I

Jordan  3:08:48
if he's if he's in with Steve Bannon was does before this gets dark. I think we're already too dark.

Dan  3:08:55
I think we're gonna be okay.

Jordan  3:08:57
