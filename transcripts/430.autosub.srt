00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,608
Think about it a tug and everytime I smile

Jumped off air to take care of other business sounds like

Let's check in on the 7th

32
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
Something untoward

33
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:58,080
It's not a horrible reference to something

34
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Thank you so much and I apologize walk

00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712

40
00:04:53,887 --> 00:05:00,031
Yes we would appreciate but apologies we are

41
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:09,503
We're trying to find the best ways to get closer to current but it is a hassle

42
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,111
I don't want to sit here to press that button over.

43
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:19,231
Redo in the near future

44
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
How we doing

45
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:30,239
Strongly

46
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:36,639
Alright

47
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
I'll tell you

48
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,831
I'll tell you something

49
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,927
And that is the things are going well until the dog days of summer

50
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Okay

51
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:56,095
Yeah that might be the case but that's why I'm keeping things like polar at 11

52
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:58,655
Keeping the Faith

53
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,519
As an option for later as those dog days of summer

54
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
So we're ahead of pace and I got to say this is going to piss off the purest

55
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,967
Alright

56
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:16,575
But I will save it something I'm excited about is

57
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,623
The candidates this week

58
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:20,927
Pedal

59
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
Okay not pedal

60
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,047
No pedal

61
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,887
Apparel yes yes

62
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,679
No petal

63
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
So each of the ones

64
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Flowers

65
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Mostly water flavor in it even if

66
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
Disagree

67
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
Another one

68
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,607
Where the light Euro's flavor pretty good

69
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:07,007
6900 lemongrass

70
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
Interesting plants with strawberry in it

71
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
73

72
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
Flower flavors

73
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,367
Very like

74
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,719
There's an aromatic qualities

75
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
Yeah I appreciate something that is a bit different it's not

76
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
Great

77
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,143
Cross 75

78
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,423
705 is huge

79
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
A couple more flavors in the fridge

80
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,407
Who that I'm holding off on

81
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,199
Like just completely nuts

82
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,271
And I will see you respect the hustle

83
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,063
Pretty good

84
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,927
Jordan Reed or going to start here on May 5th

85
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:00,255
Cinco de Mayo

86
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,839
There's no mention of

87
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:08,191
It's akeila

88
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,031
It's just

89
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,567
To speak of that little bit of Spanish

90
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,943
No probably not

91
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
So we start time with Alex

92
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Vaccines

93
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,879
And he has a good source on this

94
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,415
Savage

95
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,487
Came out and

96
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,327
And then said he will not be taking the covid-19 vaccine in that is very very dangerous

97
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
Do Michael Savage does have a PhD degree so he's not just one of these cats we run into so constantly you just calls himself a doctor

98
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,871
Superfund

99
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,919
However Savage is not a medical doctor

100
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
So no one should be listening to what he said about vaccines

101
00:08:55,551 --> 00:09:01,695
Biology master's degree

102
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,719
Ethnomedicine

103
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:09,375
His dissertation was on the Botanical and Nutritional Health practices in Fiji

104
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:13,983
The medicinal applications of 188 plant species found in Fiji

105
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:19,103
It's a cool area of study and I'm sure Savage had a lot of fun researching it probably getting to go

106
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,895
CD back in the 70s

107
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
Still he is not a medical doctor

108
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,623
Dr. Azar

109
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,159
Needles

110
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,951
Under his real name

111
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,743
Michael Alan weiner

112
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,815
Savage has published a ton of books about non medicine

113
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,399
Weirdly a 1984 called getting off cocaine

114
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,191
These books were published

115
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,335
I don't know I don't know cuz he did

116
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
You did like to hang out with the a lot of beatniks

117
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,855
Electric Kool-Aid Acid bus

118
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,231
I don't think you are because

119
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
Specifically he didn't do drugs

120
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Who's the straight edge guide

121
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Kara people

122
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
I get desensitized

123
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,639
So maybe the book wasn't him getting off cocaine so much is like eating plan to help you get off cocaine

124
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,319
Between 1972 and 1995 but also from 1991

125
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Is Michael Savage alias

126
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:40,255
Starting with 1991's the death of the white male a case against affirmative action

127
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:47,935
We are the first few years there he was writing polemics

128
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,263
Healing children naturally and that he

129
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,567
Michael Savage's strange

130
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
Michael Savage is not a medical doctor Coronavirus

131
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,415
Completely meaningless

132
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
Alex Alex

133
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
Meant that he's been making

134
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:25,823
And that is the whole all deaths are being counted as covid

135
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
Some piece of his narrative

136
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Talk about a little bit here

137
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Almost all the dads to covid-19

138
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,295
Daily death rate

139
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,367
In each of these countries with her

140
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
We now know it is an ultra massive

141
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:43,999
Number of levels

142
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
First

143
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:51,679
Misrepresenting something Dr birx

144
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
A while back

145
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,103
But leaving that aside his claim that there is a normal number of deaths is demonstrable not true

146
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,175
Explaining that very fact

147
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,063
Couple of articles in the financial times where they analyze all-cause death statistics

148
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
In 14 countries they could get data from

149
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
They found that the number of deaths in almost all of them

150
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:16,767
Hugely I'll pay somebody long-term averages for the same time.

151
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,839
Italy saw a 90% increase

152
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:25,983
Spain 72% the UK 61 Belgium 60%

153
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Amvets

154
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,087
New York City reflected a 386% increase in average

155
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,159
Which was still behind the Providence in Italy

156
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,975
96% increase

157
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
These numbers require further study are the same as they always are

158
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,423
Is a complete lie

159
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
There's no way around if he's telling his audience something that's the opposite of reality

160
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
That's just soap

161
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,151
Everything's pluck

162
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,711
This is fun

163
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
Something

164
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
Time the opposite

165
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
Trusted expert

166
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,471
So we get into this nice club sets up something

167
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Pay off later

168
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
We're going to have

169
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,791
Royal Society Overland

170
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Complete

171
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,679
Because they're lying

172
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
On

173
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
In a systematic way

174
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,567
Rent control

175
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
Possible

176
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Insulation

177
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:17,087
It's all fun and games

178
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,159
Avoid the worst-case scenarios that are depicted in those graphs and prediction

179
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,999
Grass and predictions

180
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,327
It's all fun and games for him because nothing means anything on this show

181
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
Also if he's grasping projections that were being put out

182
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:39,103
What does Alex think about Mike Adams self-made projection which Alex reported on on his show

183
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:43,967
Mike's model showed two million people dead by July if nothing was done of course

184
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,551
It's reported that is an official model

185
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
How many has to be corrected by bike that this was a model to represent

186
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,463
What would happen if the viruses spread

187
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,303
When Alex cover this model biking made who's back in early March

188
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,935
When the editorial is going to kill everyone

189
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:10,335
So even like numbers being 2 million

190
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,127
Possibly could be

191
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Worse

192
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:15,967
Millions and millions died

193
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
There's a new

194
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
Computer model out

195
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Bye

196
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
July

197
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
These are just models

198
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,983
Says it's 15%

199
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,031
2 million / July grass

200
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Amen

201
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:46,943
Explicitly says underestimation

202
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Because

203
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,463
I don't know why it's being intentionally bought

204
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Bring it up from

205
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
When it explodes

206
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
This this is their neck

207
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
The CDC is

208
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Try to take out Trump

209
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,567
Wow well

210
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
Help for the word has

211
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
For the worst

212
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,343
March 6th

213
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:28,415
Because everything was very different

214
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
Was that part of this elaborate

215
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,399
Because it seems like a worse even more Sensational version

216
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,935
They're coming out around that time

217
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:46,591
Was this Alex on the health Ranger

218
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Salesmanship

219
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Because his narrative has completely changed

220
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,527
I guess the latter

221
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Access

222
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Datapoint

223
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,695
Higher

224
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
Then what

225
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Rebecca Mendes

226
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
And being really mad about a grass

227
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,375
Stop it

228
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Spell exciting

229
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
So

230
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
We used to run the baby harvesting program in Virginia

231
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
That's why I went on TV and said

232
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
We'd only law enforcement

233
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Doctors in the mother

234
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
Germination

235
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:39,071
May's wife

236
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,119
We keep

237
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,823
Gender baby it's gone now

238
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
It's an award that went to the order some of the organs

239
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,175
Comfortable

240
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Canopy

241
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
This all sounds shocking

242
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
Dallas Texas

243
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,303
Chicago Illinois New York City

244
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Los Angeles

245
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
California

246
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
All the 60 minutes

247
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Patience

248
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
Talking

249
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,151
He was healthy and I have to have somebody

250
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
One of that liver

251
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,415
Indy's millionaire nurses nurses

252
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:43,071
Notoriously overpaid I looked up the average salary for neonatal nurses at 6 p.m.

253
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:47,935
Brutal

254
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:54,335
So pretty much all that stuff

255
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
I'm just going to ignore that s***

256
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,991
Focus on here is Alex's claims that there were a ton of organ harvesting scandals in the 90s

257
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:06,367
Witches eat what he's using to lend credibility to the outlandish claims make a organ harvesting

258
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,671
Those under the guise of abortion

259
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:15,583
I've looked into the bed and from what I can tell this is Alex misrepresenting something that I suspect he never actually understood in the first place

260
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Which is organ donor

261
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,887
Nation standards

262
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,031
Be home don't sign an organ donor card because if you do the let you die in the ER to take your organs thing

263
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,823
What's a super old urban legend

264
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,383
It's honestly probably the actual basis for Alex

265
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
The Narrative here

266
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,783
He said his dad told him that hospitals that do that another point on the board

267
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
We're like weird things he believes just cuz

268
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,695
It's like you're a dentist

269
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:45,791
I don't think he was actually going to

270
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:52,191
I imagine Alex's dad being like s*** this guy needs a root canal

271
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,007
I need a liver

272
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:59,615
Make a necklace from Dad

273
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,711
Just harvesting

274
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:07,295
What would you

275
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
Toby on the urban legend aspect I was able to find a New York Times article from 1997 that deals with some of the controversy

276
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:19,583
Remembering

277
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Maybe both

278
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,031
Traditionally the standard that have been used to determine when a person has given to others in need

279
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,687
After their hearts stop beating

280
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
And it didn't resume

281
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,759
That was a long while back

282
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
Okay I cuz I thought it started at sprained ankle

283
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:41,855
And then

284
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:42,879
All bets are off

285
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
Traditionally the point

286
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Declared brain-dead

287
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:03,103
That's not you know that is a term that gets thrown around

288
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
Who's there

289
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:11,039
Then in the 1990s became more prevalent for doctors to discuss donation options with families of dying patient

290
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,343
Already decided to take them off lights

291
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
Right right right

292
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:21,024
So this isn't entirely a decision to take the person off life-support is not influenced by

293
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,352
Anyone suggested Uso to provide organs for donation

294
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,192
And this shift is actually led to a grape increase number of donations

295
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,616
Were you laughing about

296
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,432
And they just

297
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
Hit them in the head

298
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,440
Image

299
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
Which is more fantasy than reality

300
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,144
This 1997 New York Times article discusses the Cleveland Clinic which engage did that for your donation

301
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:06,336
Whose family decided to take him off life support

302
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,360
They're beginning

303
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,688
Drugs to prevent blood clotting and white blood vessels

304
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,992
We could help preserve there for donation

305
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,624
The controversy with surrounding whether or not one of those medications

306
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,672
And would that be considered euthanasia

307
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,536
Who doesn't matter that this article clearly shows is not a question that doesn't have a consensus answer

308
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:31,936
It would make your death more quick and therefore the doctors are

309
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
Making them die sooner

310
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
That's me that's the issue

311
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:43,200
I think it's a relevant question is only because of like the Avenues it opens up

312
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,248
For like well

313
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Is it

314
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Where is the

315
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,464
That is a rat irrelevant medical ethical question

316
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
They're being decent arguments on both sides

317
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,560
I also understand why you're not tickled

318
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,840
Hey just

319
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:03,936
I'm Pro euthanasia like even when I'm fine and I start look

320
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
I want Terrell

321
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
I'm pro-youth

322
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,872
Travel back to 1997 and taken up with New York Times

323
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,968
I don't care

324
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,832
Because

325
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:24,160
D7 article also mentions of Doctor Who

326
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,256
She cannot comment in detail because she'd signed an exclusive

327
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
Agreement

328
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,072
CBS News 60 minutes

329
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
Broadcast tonight

330
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,240
Pretty sure this is the news program Alex's vaguely remember seeing

331
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Has no idea what it was actually about

332
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,384
I was just telling his audience a story about doctors killing patients are at

333
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,224
Maliciously letting them die to steal on the black market

334
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
Stories very very different

335
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,576
Can't find

336
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:56,928
Examples any modern American Hospital System of people engaging in that sort of practice

337
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Just have to jump over in order to pull off something

338
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
Ridiculous

339
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
If you

340
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
We're sound

341
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
Been negligent

342
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:15,360
In care that leads to someone.

343
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
You can be

344
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:26,112
Absolutely

345
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
It's just that

346
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,464
60 Minutes Bank 1997 that he does not understand

347
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
What do you shoot

348
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,632
Mixed with his dad telling these urban legends

349
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,704
Complete

350
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,776
Fundamental inability to understand people

351
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,688
A person would look at the amount of s*** you have to do

352
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,456
And be like

353
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,808
This is way better than getting a job like it just doesn't make

354
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:59,648
You know and it also is staggeringly

355
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
Respect

356
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,976
For what people in the medical field

357
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,560
To helping

358
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:10,656
Is is its foundational to the job

359
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,192
Episode

360
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,056
450 bucks

361
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,640
Half-a-million is so offensive

362
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:27,296
They are almost always underpaid working on

363
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,136
Operation Familia

364
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
Great so I told you

365
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
David Knight came around

366
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
And

367
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
Will show

368
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,936
Diction

369
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,216
And they already said

370
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,496
Before anything opened up here

371
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Cases for example

372
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:50,848
AB people open up twenty-five 50%

373
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,736
What they're telling everybody what they're preparing everybody

374
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,784
The new narrative

375
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
Is going to be

376
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,648
Everybody's dying so we got

377
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Narrative

378
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:10,048
Be likely outcome of trying to force a reopening

379
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:16,448
It's very likely that

380
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
This is we'll go upstate three open everything before it's safe to do so

381
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:30,272
This is a pre-emptive rationalization

382
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,064
Infectious diseases spread

383
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:37,440
Inevitably when you see the number of cases go up after these states reopen

384
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
The conspiracy is supposed to be exact

385
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
Expect

386
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:42,816
To happen

387
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
That's just so f***** up

388
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,496
Don't worry when people die

389
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,056
Don't worry about it it's not it's their fault

390
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:58,176
It's a doll Ally pretend everything is fake

391
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,968
Establishing

392
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,320
Multiple times this year

393
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:10,720
On March 23rd CNN reported on how he had done a really good job of containing the virus

394
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,744
150 cases

395
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,656
Now however long is providing a different object lesson

396
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
What happens when

397
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:24,800
The number of confirmed cases has almost doubled in the past week

398
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,640
Is there containment measures infection

399
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Considerably

400
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,296
They have the situation under control measures

401
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
Draconian

402
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:40,672
Controls put in place

403
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Must undergo a strict

404
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
Stay home quarantine

405
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,560
Answer face criminal prosecution if they're found in breach of it

406
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
Over the weekend police could

407
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
District looking for those

408
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
The wristbands off in order to go out

409
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,456
Good work guys because

410
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,784
You have to even stricter measures than you

411
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,600
Would have done in the first place

412
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:10,368
Suggest

413
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,392
Putting them in the room

414
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:14,208
Putting a sheet of metal over the door

415
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,744
Because you don't know if

416
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Easiest

417
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,072
Consideration

418
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,656
David Knight doesn't know

419
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:27,008
University warning about this phenomenon and how it's

420
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:32,128
Prettymuchit

421
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Explode

422
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:39,296
According to an article in the Denver Post

423
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,648
Illnesses and inspection

424
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,928
Which we do not have

425
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:51,584
And even if we did even restrictions in that scenario is only advisable if there's also a robust testing system in place

426
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
To be able to catch new album

427
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,168
Brakes before they become big new outbreaks

428
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
We don't have either of those basic components

429
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,544
After doing the Safeway understand

430
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
This is not a

431
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Criminal

432
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,248
This is a crime it might be this is like this is Nuremberg trials

433
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,576
Like when we get through this this is time to be like hey guys

434
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
You

435
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
I knew this was going to happen

436
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,440
This is premeditated

437
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:18,464
Those

438
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,256
Those people's deaths

439
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
Are on you

440
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
Personal

441
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,984
Maybe Nuremberg Trial conciliation

442
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,872
The pattern of Hong Kong playing out in our states

443
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,016
Cases have continued to rise.

444
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:47,904
This stuff is pretty clear experts have warned us about what the most likely result of premature opening as

445
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,280
And all you see Alex and David

446
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:56,352
He's going to end up killing people but it's not really because

447
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Conspiracy or something

448
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,728
Yep and I'm sure that they will be held accountable for their rack

449
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,848
Probably not maybe

450
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Great that'll work

451
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,784
So Alex over the course of the last few weeks about people

452
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,856
What stores telling him to wear a mask and yells at them

453
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Continues here on the 5th

454
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,352
You understand that it's incredibly

455
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
They're ignorant they love it

456
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,984
They love getting into it even though their whole future

457
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,288
Destroyed by evil

458
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,784
Stories about people who asked

459
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
Funny glimpses into how much of an impotent man child he is Raging because it's

460
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
Resume slightly

461
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,864
I meant last Friday

462
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,448
Flint Michigan Family Dollar

463
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:08,544
In retaliation for the store without a mask

464
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,128
He was a father and it's an absolute tragedy

465
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:18,528
I'm pretty much the exact pattern of all the stories outbreak

466
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Pet stores

467
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Much further

468
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:27,488
I'm not saying this woman to return to the store with her husband and son who then murdered

469
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:32,864
No reason to suspect that there is even a concrete connection nowhere that she was a listener or anything like that

470
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
The reason I bring up the story at all is because the underlying behavior of fighting and arguing with security guards are enforcing

471
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,128
And you've been very very clear about that

472
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
I'm sure you wouldn't Advocate someone go so far is it

473
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,040
Normalizing what are the steps.

474
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:56,160
He celebrates lashing out

475
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:02,560
As a positive thing

476
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:03,584
Even

477
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,680
This is a story that I haven't heard if he ever does

478
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:13,824
I'm just not sure there's a way he can cover the story about kind of supporting which I'm sure he'd rather not do

479
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
Falls apart

480
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:22,528
Cuz he got David night in there he's boring

481
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,856
And then Robert Barnes shows up

482
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,720
Three-way is not good

483
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Yeah it's

484
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
It's

485
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,096
Almost done listenable I would not subject

486
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Our listeners to that

487
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:43,008
With varying degrees of a lack of Education

488
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
Bitching about

489
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:50,432
David Knight & Barnes probably pretty well educated there just

490
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
Opportunity

491
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:58,368
That one of the things that I think is really interesting is I don't

492
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,928
At the job

493
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
Cuban

494
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,584
I think that he's given up on being a lawyer

495
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Or something

496
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,912
Angels descended fully into this like

497
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
Yeah I think maybe he wasn't getting enough donations for the free America Law Center

498
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,104
Or whatever the f*** you was trying to do

499
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,968
This seemed to be the only type of barns

500
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
It seems like he's reading a f****** script

501
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
About like hay hay barn

502
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
You're smart

503
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Back me up on me boy

504
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
General Flynn

505
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:46,752
That's being uncovered

506
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
Vulnerable

507
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
He like this

508
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
Indoor plants

509
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,088
Doesn't happen

510
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,768
Represented some of those other white hat

511
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
Invoice is an Institutional narrative

512
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,080
CertainTeed

513
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Demon gate

514
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
For political harassment

515
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,160
False news stories

516
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Trunews

517
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,208
Shoe storage

518
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Discontinued campaign because Infowars

519
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,024
Keeps managing to jump

520
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Institution

521
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
To personify

522
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,872
Complaining we chose this

523
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,088
YouTube targeting

524
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,648
Station within the Free Press

525
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Preston American

526
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,288
Martin Luther King

527
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Absolutely

528
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,432
Independent

529
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
Because they're afraid

530
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
Raises the question

531
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:51,424
Civil rights cases

532
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,520
Civil rights lawyer

533
00:35:55,776 --> 00:36:00,640
Assholes want to own black people so much they're trying to own their stories

534
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,944
How to pronounce disgusting

535
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,832
Toomey sounds

536
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,648
Different

537
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,232
Used a bit of Independence to him

538
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,816
Sounds like the tools and Robert Barnes kit

539
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,608
Being used as an Infowars

540
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:24,704
Employee

541
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,568
About this 100

542
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:36,736
Because Alex

543
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,808
So

544
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,856
Conversation

545
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
Because who gives a

546
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,928
Alex

547
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
So he gets a social distance

548
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,048
I bet he has great thoughts

549
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
6 ft

550
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:55,168
That's how many feet your underground we just

551
00:36:55,424 --> 00:37:01,568
Maybe maybe you think of the Sneaker Pimps song 6 Underground

552
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:05,920
Regular height for folks to be right

553
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:06,688
No

554
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Comes from

555
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
Social distancing

556
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,720
And it just so happens to be a foot

557
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Is

558
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,608
Wow

559
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,400
F****** while

560
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
That is a trip

561
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,984
Yeah

562
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,896
Oh my God number is Kevin Bacon

563
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
All of this

564
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
Tragic

565
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,600
Call Ben

566
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:49,184
Is 5 + 550

567
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,984
Whenever you and stuff it's always very suspicious

568
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,080
VSCO

569
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
Suspicious circumstances of that

570
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,688
Close to me

571
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Lesbian couples come in

572
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
Hospitals were people of the time

573
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
Hawaii

574
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,232
Symbol of a ritual

575
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
Yeah

576
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
Yeah

577
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,384
What kind of f****** world do you have to be living in if you hear that

578
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
Or like

579
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,552
Show me the ball did this ever happen

580
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,624
What in Houston one time never any time

581
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,928
I highly doubt it

582
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,256
Is always real

583
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,864
Oblivion

584
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
Putting brains in

585
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Computer like it

586
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:08,032
He loves the idea that all of these sci-fi things about brains and computers are real

587
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,384
Naked men

588
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,152
The.is

589
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:18,528
Screenshot on my phone

590
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
The producers

591
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,624
This weekend of a new movie out

592
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
What a guy

593
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
As is

594
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:29,024
Auditions for the new a computer that it's wonderful once he does it

595
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,584
This is all just absolutely sexy

596
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,632
Your Consciousness you're going to be

597
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:37,216
How you talk

598
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:37,984
Your boyfriend

599
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
What you doing

600
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
Computer

601
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,360
Is there

602
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
Relationship

603
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:47,456
You and your family and it's just the next level of fraud

604
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:49,248
Here it is

605
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,136
So he's sick he's dying but it's

606
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,184
Okay because

607
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
You have to

608
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:00,000
Die

609
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
When they do the upload

610
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:03,840
Just like

611
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:11,776
When is bodies transfer another whole life into transferring all the thoughts without a soul there

612
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,336
Then why couldn't you just transfer then once the up

613
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,688
Whatever you want

614
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
Globalist

615
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
Movies

616
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
Also in Avatar character Sully doesn't have to die to control the avatar

617
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:45,312
I need to find out of those tanks

618
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:51,712
The bad guys

619
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:56,576
Fight alongside them

620
00:40:56,832 --> 00:41:02,464
After that he's beloved by the navi and they do some magic to make him in his Avatar into one

621
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,864
Honestly I have no idea

622
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,144
Breathe on Pandora

623
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:16,544
Either way the ending is totally about

624
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,616
I assume they donated

625
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
Mostly about specialist

626
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
Really hate

627
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,416
I don't think I was got the point of it

628
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,232
So it turns out the reason

629
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:41,632
There's so many people Coronavirus

630
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Decade

631
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
You're in a test positive

632
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
Remember most

633
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,080
Have you

634
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
It's a

635
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,919
Positive Coronavirus

636
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Or so

637
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,759
You will show anybody

638
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,551
It's the same family that make sense

639
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
Coronavirus

640
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,135
So that's dumb

641
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:08,255
In the United States million covid-19 tests at this point

642
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:14,399
Alex

643
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:20,543
Haven't had a cold in the past decade which is pretty f****** absurd

644
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
Underneath tested we have particularly for antibodies

645
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,503
A great level of accuracy yet

646
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,599
Alex's pretending but they're not sure shots

647
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
May 4th article in discover magazine available between 83 and 90

648
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
6%

649
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
In terms of specificity

650
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,887
Meaning there between 4 to 17%

651
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Audi positive results

652
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:56,895
These are not the result of the Coronavirus

653
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,711
Develop a more accurate test

654
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:07,135
The task is to Coronavirus

655
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
That's absurd

656
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Nothing to say

657
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:15,071
Elementary questions of people coming up with a tattoo

658
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,655
If you create a test that always just returns positive result

659
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,983
You can easily see how no one would consider that a worthwhile task

660
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:26,335
This is a childish over-simplification

661
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
A particular antibody

662
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:33,247
If that's true coronavirus covid-19 antibodies always turn out positive

663
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
People who previously had a cold

664
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:39,391
Everyone test positive for SARS and MERS

665
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:42,975
Is it possible because scientists understand that the test

666
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,095
Maybe I don't know Dan

667
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
Didn't graduate

668
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
College

669
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:54,239
So I'm going to assume scientist about

670
00:43:54,495 --> 00:44:00,639
Virology and I got to tell you I exclusively

671
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:10,879
My follow-up questions I was talking to

672
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,951
Clearly I got you really

673
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:18,559
Of course everybody can't test positive so they only used

674
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
The tests

675
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,631
Sometimes in the other ones are fake

676
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:26,239
And they only use the test test positive

677
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,127
Some people you can't have conversations wedding Wings because

678
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,943
Reasonable

679
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,527
So am I supposed to call

680
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,319
Listcawler

681
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,647
This person seems to remember that Alex said he was going

682
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,695
Tell everyone

683
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
And this guy

684
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
You're welcome

685
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
Run

686

You need to get

Unlike

Chewing on the real military

694

Believe that

703
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,631
This guy does

704
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
To say that I didn't

00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
Call up Cubberley.

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
Problem

707
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,463
But

708
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
People don't want to believe the truth

709
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,679

756
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:26,527
Calling for that

757
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,319
I am

758
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
The people that run

759
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,159
Where were dropped into a black hole

760
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,695
Okay

761
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,351
Don't they run

762
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,375
Confirm this without

763
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
I am

764
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,191
What you say a certain areas

765
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
Alex doesn't know where Harvard is

766
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,967
What

767
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Hockey

768
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,575
She lives in Harvard

769
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:07,999
Go fuc yourself or confirm the G's daughter goes to Harvard

770
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
He's using the present tense

771
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,447
On a number of occasions when Francis Boyle has been on he's complaining to Alex G's daughter currently

772
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:22,591
Realities use daughter did study at Harvard between 2010 and 2014

773
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Under an assumed

774
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Name

775
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:30,527
This makes total sense to grantura certain amount of anonymity because otherwise would be impossible

776
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,623
Bachelors of Arts degree in psychology and English

777
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:41,023
So I don't really know what the nefarious conspiracy is here but

778
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,911
Man I do not know what you're doing is somebody whose English in literature

779
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,191
That s*** is all

780
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
I was recruited into a Chinese Communist Party

781
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,455
You start reading

782
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,527
What's a you start reading A Farewell to Arms

783
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:07,391
Pages in place

784
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,631
Manchurian Candidate where's Manchuria

785
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:25,055
So you can find Business Insider articles about G's daughter from 2012 from 2015

786
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,359
None of this is anything close to new information

787
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,895
Here's the thing

788
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,967
She wasn't even the president of China until 2013

789
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,551
What time you was at she was almost done with her degree

790
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:41,183
What I'm getting at here is it none of this matters

791
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,999
China and higher education simultaneously

792
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:47,071
Is basically catnip

793
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,935
Incoming

794
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,775
Us and UK intelligence Warren China's trying to hack

795
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
Biolabs work

796
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,639
So they can put out false

797
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,199
Until now

798
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,319
Behind the whole damn thing

799
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,367
Hysteria in the media

800
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,415
I know she is

801
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
Behind the

802
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,279
Decoding the hospitals by the NIH

803
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
Play Joe control

804
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,703
That's a lotta editorializing

805
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,567
So Alex is making

806
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,127
What is the possibility of Chinese state-backed

807
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,943
Attempting to gain access to sensitive areas

808
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,551
Morning early this week primary

809
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,879
Obtain Intelligence on National and International

810
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:46,207
Acquire sensitive data on covid-19 related research

811
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:51,071
Accessibility fabricating the part about China's motive for the hacking being put out in

812
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:57,471
Weighted covid numbers that's just his imagination real story which ultimately makes this story

813
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
Who's really good example

814
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:06,943
What do you will do real story then make up a fictional telling of that story to report

815
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:13,855
This is actually a fantastic strategy for him because he knows that his listeners are not big readers information

816
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:15,391
They make you read up

817
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
24

818
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,975
Pages that's so much

819
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:25,375
So in this case is one of his listeners things to check into the storyville Google it was a joint usuk

820
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:31,519
3 put out about coronavirus

821
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
But Alex is just a

822
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,431
Also if you read the actual advisory these hackers are from China

823
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,991
Just that they're advanced persistent threat groups

824
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:47,903
Apt groups are not unique to China and it is possible

825
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,463
Kaiser

826
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:55,071
Like North Korea Russia it's not necessarily

827
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:02,239
So to be clear it very well may be the case of the Chinese government is somehow involved information

828
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:05,055
Alex could be operating also

829
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,103
If you would like reporting that is death

830
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,199
Is a little bit premature but it doesn't matter

831
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
2

832
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:20,927
I'm going to I don't know details about that so I'm not going to say this in reality

833
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
Based on the United States

834
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,839
Specifically acting in regards to not sharing information

835
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,143
I'm kinda on the side of

836
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
People

837
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:34,495
Maybe life-saving information

838
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,519
That is

839
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:41,663
Is the kettle not sure about this

840
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:48,063
If we're talking about right

841
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,463
Pharmacy is going to charge everybody

842
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,279
For this is just not going to release

843
00:54:57,535 --> 00:55:00,863
Information information sharing

844
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,727
Yeah I think that's an imaginary version of eggs

845
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
And I love it

846
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,383
Your fantasy of

847
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,943
Finding a cure that's what I believe

848
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
White hat

849
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,063
I'd like you to write the screenplay but I don't think

850
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:23,903
Advisory I don't think about

851
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
I think they're trying to

852
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:31,071
Things for probably

853
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,655
Stuff like that

854
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,983
Alex talks about more

855
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,031
Stop about China that

856
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,823
I don't know if this is fair

857
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:45,663
I mean like there are a lot of very fair complaints you can make about China

858
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,527
Do stuff like this it just shows what you're about

859
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,855
Video Senator cotton says China's provide evidence

860
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
The government knows

861
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
Get it

862
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
Because Obama

863
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Has the receipts

864
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,511
Okay

865
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,119
So you can always tell when someone is a dishonest actor when they demanded someone prove a negative

866
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,775
To be impossible for China to satisfactorily prove that the virus did not leak from the lab so demanding

867
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:20,735
In theory the way you would demonstrate that the virus didn't leak from the lab would be the show evidence supporting the natural progression

868
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,551
From bad to intermediate animal-to-human

869
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:27,647
Even if you did do this it totally wouldn't satisfy someone like Tom Cotton

870
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,719
You still say even if

871
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,511
Trajectory they still haven't proven

872
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:36,863
Also come from the lab results

873
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,263
This is basically what elementary school kids do on the playground

874
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Those are some s***

875
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:50,431
Three chapters levels of communication and it's coming from a member of Congress towards another country

876
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,247
Which is

877
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,271
Unaccept

878
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,831
Scapegoating racism

879
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,367
To Tryon

880
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,303
That they absolutely deserve as well as their followers

881
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
Listen to trying to win elections

882
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
Is going to get us all killed

883
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,959
That's how I f****** racist they are they would rather

884
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:19,359
We go to a World War than accept responsibility for being shity at what they do and trying to kill ourselves

885
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,175
So it is next clip

886
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:26,015
From the May 6th episode Alex

887
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,831
Bill Gates

Planet Earth

Dictator

The planet

891
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
Major leaders

White

893
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
White people

894
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Jack Sprat

895
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
Midwife

896
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,367
Fell between the two they licked the platter clean

897
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
You want us divided again

898
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Each other

899
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,719
He wants us

900
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Chandler

901
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
The future

902
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:13,375
Rhyme Jack Sprat

903
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:18,495
Different

904
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:25,151
I guess something is actually a satire about Charles the first

905
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,967
Parliament 1629

906
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:32,063
Opinion

907
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
Estranged

908
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:44,863
The planetary Decatur

909
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,655
Facing

910
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Death

911
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
Will continue because

912
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
So brave

913
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,663
Let's go ahead and go over the facts

914
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:04,063
Major insurance companies in South Africa

915
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:07,135
Have openly come out instead

916
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,975
Death battle

917
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Lockdown

918
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
Warfit

919
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:15,839
Massively

920
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:19,167
29 times more distraught

921
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,727
Then the covid-19 deaths

922
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:31,199
So it would be Financial Telegraph is not a major or even real publication

923
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,087
If you go to their website it's clearly just a front for cryptocurrency promotion and Future

924
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
Followers

925
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:44,767
That's probably not the financial Telegraph Alex's talking about though

926
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:48,351
Team followers 2012

927
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,959
Listening I think you got to leave

928
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,007
Very confused you got this

929
00:59:55,263 --> 01:00:00,383
Call Joseph

930
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:07,295
Didn't you say the story from the financial mail mail Telegraph safe

931
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Right

932
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:14,719
In this article use models to claim that the lockdown in South Africa

933
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
Based on the outbreak it seeks to stop

934
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,559
I knew there's another reason to hate Tyra Banks

935
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:20,607
To consider here

936
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,263
The first is that even if you accept this conclusion that's not a figure that's in anyway applicable to other countries in South Africa

937
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:32,895
This is an analysis specifically

938
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
Second

939
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,319
Easy elements built into it that represents a massive asteroid

940
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,879
Probably Financial malar

941
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:46,719
South Africa's covid-19 data is so sparse

942
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:53,119
Researchers use New York's public

943
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,935
South Africa's population

944
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:59,519
Isn't this kind of data

945
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,847
Create a representative glimpse of the actual situation in South

946
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,687
Population densities and distributions are different city patterns

947
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,991
Different levels of access to healthcare.

948
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,527
Responses to the virus

949
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Have been different

950
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:16,415
This may not be a holy bankrupt way to gather some data for the sake of conversation

951
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
As far as I can tell that's a pretty big hole in the bottle which mysteriously doesn't come up

952
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
Really odd

953
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
So what does model

954
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,959
Data

955
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:35,359
And they assumed average because because the older patients with covid-19

956
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,687
Each coronavirus death represented a loss of life

957
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
4 years

958
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:45,855
Assume that because of the projected loss of between

959
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:51,743
Percent of South Africans will become and as a result lose a few months of their lives

960
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:58,399
I was just trying to pretend that this model shows 2019 times the death coming from the lockdown as opposed to the virus

961
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:06,079
And the reason that he doesn't do that

962
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:09,663
Paul Joseph Watson article covering the financial

963
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,199
Doesn't paint the full picture

964
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:12,991
Natural information

965
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,831
Two filters for delivery

966
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:22,719
A major point is that according to this model the losses months of people's lies would they do to poverty

967
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:28,351
Which of the conditions do significant work to remedy

968
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,727
Directly addressing those issues is a policy decision

969
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:38,847
If you want to use this model to strike up a conversation about battling poverty

970
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:43,199
Even before any of the virus concerns around more than half of South African

971
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,735
Live below the poverty line

972
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,295
So presumably their lives are being shortened

973
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,575
Before this ever happened

974
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,391
Because he knows he can use this

975
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,023
Tell bo3 his arguments that everyone in the United States

976
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,327
You don't care about the actual details

977
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,119
Disgusting

978
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:05,727
Also considering

979
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
Institution of statistical modeling

980
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,079
Where the virus models are in fraud

981
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:14,687
He's willing to accept another bottle of Everly digging into the methodology of it

982
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,223
Bottles that agree with me

983
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:23,647
The operating

984
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Function

985
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:31,839
Any of that information from that article

986
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,191
Didn't know the publication's name that was sighted in

987
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:42,591
Message across so you can see like it's just a really bad source of information

988
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:48,479
Is that Alex keeps saying something that should also give everyone pause

989
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,807
Of course there's always going to be a new path

990
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,623
Glad he runs and funds

991
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:56,671
Pathogen isn't a word

992
01:03:57,439 --> 01:04:02,303
He always says pathogen instead of pathogen is he like mixing up

993
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:07,167
Parthenogenesis

994
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,263
Just because I just think it's kind of

995
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:15,103
Consistent

996
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:23,039
If he's going to s*** talk every he's still got that f****** video

997
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:28,927
People do seem like Miss speaking tell me one of them

998
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:33,279
Steer away from

999
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,423
From the 6

1000
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
Name is the end of civilization

1001
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,007
Being held

1002
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,895
I wasn't sure

1003
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,991
Ted 2 weeks I said it's never it's not

1004
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
200 years

1005
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,391
Not the economy

1006
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,487
You know the people producing this is going to say

1007
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,255
Bill Maher

1008
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327

Something was happening

1013

He's going

1014
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,471
Really start the way I expected

This year the world

1023
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:12,863
The leading the show talking about

1024
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:19,263
Okay that's where I expected to go somewhere

1025
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:23,871
And Dad

1026
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,943
Watching review article pointless celebrities

Call for world not to return to normal

New World Order

How to make a really important

1031
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,399
Alex is reporting on a Paul Joseph Watson article about how stupid these celebrities are and how pointless their statement is

1032
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:53,055
I had no idea these celebrities did this until I heard Alex complaining about it

1033
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:59,455
Only people who actually really seems to care about the symbolic statement

1034
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,991
Episode

And of course

1040

Iggy Pop

1041
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Anyway there

1042
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:31,199
Nothing can ever be good again or we got to shut down forever who's Morgan optimistic statement

1043
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:34,271
Is an opportunity to recognize the parts of our

1044
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:36,063
They were destructive and unnecessary

1045
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:41,183
Let's not just check out for no reason

1046
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,743
It's basically just saying we can do better

1047
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:48,863
Juju stop by celebrities

1048
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:51,167
The same cannot be said for Alex

1049
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:57,823
You love getting mad at famous people I only have one response to that is that now I Wanna Be Your Dog

1050
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,103
That's what I want

1051
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
Iggy Pop

1052
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Sorry

1053
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,735
I have a cat

1054
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,551
Come on

1055
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:13,439
We know one thing about Alex Jones

1056
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,231
And that is that

1057
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:16,767
I mean

1058
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,535
He's a racist

1059
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,351
We know two things about Alaska

1060
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,423
He's a racist and he's really good

1061
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,007
Whip quotes

1062
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,407
Didn't really say let them eat cake

1063
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,687
They use that too

1064
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
What did she say

1065
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,375
That's the same thing

1066
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,543
Giant Asian hornet

1067
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383

1068
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
I need to hear about the

1069
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,551
Sir Alex's story is nice but it's also probably not true

1070
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:16,159
The story of an obviously oblivious Queen

1071
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
Responding to news people starve

1072
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,791
Marie Antoinette

1073
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:27,167
The first time the specific phrase like

1074
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:29,471
Yo ends up being less

1075
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:35,871
The first time that specific phrases used as it's derived from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's confessions book

1076
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
6

1077
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,711
The instance of it doesn't say that Marie Antoinette said it

1078
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,271
That was attributed to a quote great princess

1079
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:47,391
Child in 1767

1080
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159

As Alex's Berry brother being picked up and used against marie-antoinette Encyclopedia Britannica

1082
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:02,495
Those writings inspired the revolutionaries supposed

1083
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:07,359
X-rated is propaganda

1084
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,127
Monarchy

1085
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:09,151
However

1086
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,967
Contemporary researchers are skeptical of such claims

1087
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:17,087
Newspapers pamphlets or other materials published by the revolution

1088
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:23,487
It sounds like something they would

1089
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,767
Just no evidence

1090
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,839
Because it sounds good it's true

1091
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
Operate

1092
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,191
It's because he's very dumb and he doesn't even basic

1093
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:36,031
Looking into the ideas that he has

1094
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,359
The Encyclopedia Britannica

1095
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:41,151
The first instance of this quote being a

1096
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:44,223
Attached to Marie Antoinette comes from 1843

1097
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:49,087
It's a guy debunking some rumors that she said that with recirculating at that time

1098
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:52,159
50 years after her death

1099
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:58,815
Also Alex subject supper

1100
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:05,471
It's been documented first case of coronavirus in the United States

1101
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:11,871
At least six times

1102
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,199
Easy enough for one of his listeners to accidentally

1103
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,479
You probably should have

1104
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Yeah that's a good idea

1105
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,207
No

1106
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,839

1108
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655

1109
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
No

1110
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,287
You're going to get hurt real

1111
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,295
Have all the weird trendy's that are in.

1112
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831

1113
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,647
That's a big training thing right now and

1114
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
Totally

1115
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,439
Worried

1116
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
I'm gone

1117
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,863
Even my pants.

1118
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,423
Yara sterilizers

1119
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,407

1120
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,199
This is

1121
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:23,039
Complained about it

1122
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:28,671
Apparently according to Infowars website this is very serious.

1123
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,743
I guess my take on this would be a solid who gives a s***

1124
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,815
This is just one of them

1125
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:41,215
It's kind of embarrassing to be a 46 year-old due to takes time on his supposedly very important radio show to shake your fist at

1126
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,007
Teens f****** around on Tik-Tok

1127
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,175
He's the tip of the spear

1128
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:53,247
Yeah protecting everyone in the info

1129
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:57,343
Is a long history of the sort of trivial performative outrage

1130
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:03,743
Like you can easily imagine Rush Limbaugh being terrified the kids are posting videos of them doing stuff inspired by jackass

1131
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:07,327
Evidence of the generations complete collapse

1132
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
I guess the generation before that would be like people doing prank phone calls

1133
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,479
From now

1134
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:30,879
Asking me if my refrigerator is running and they are not asking for the

1135
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,023
Allure Alex by Tik-Tok

1136
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,423
It's just trouble

1137
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
Not exactly

1138
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:52,127
So I started on the 7th

1139
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:55,455
Putting in the conspiracy world

1140
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,991
I found surprising

1141
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:03,647
And that is of course the plandemic documentary that was going around the circle

1142
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
CVS

1143
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:07,487
It's also doctors in Black

1144
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:17,983
Call the VIPs

1145
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:24,383
You're right. Dressed in black

1146
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,223
Your dog but this is all your f****** rain might know all the lyrics

1147
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:37,183
I definitely will Smith soundtrack

1148
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,767
Why why why

1149
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,375
I don't know karaoke

1150
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,935
Numbers as I think it's pretty funny

1151
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,495
I think what it was I was fascinated when I was like

1152
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,895
22 or so with this phenomenon of Will Smith just like songs that were the entire plot

1153
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,991
There's something really fun

1154
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,039
It is kind of nice

1155
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
Short synopsis

1156
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:08,927
Just like little mini movies with music

1157
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:15,327
Came out like right when I was watching tons of music videos

1158
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:17,119
What you going to do and

1159
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:19,679
Also go to bed

1160
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,727
Wiki wiki Wild

1161
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Quick Wok

1162
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,455
Mechanic

1163
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,735
To like

1164
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,039
Two generations further down like

1165
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,599
Will Smith used to be a rapper

1166
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,623
Infinite

1167
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
You tried

1168
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,279
I think that even like some people our age mites

1169
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:51,423
Soy documentary

1170
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,823
On this episode

1171
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,639
The same thing seems to just want to be off air

1172
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:04,223
And it's playing a bunch of this documentary gives him the ability to do that

1173
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,551
I want to take your calls there's also a

1174
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Documentary

1175
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,207
Is it called Banda Mac

1176
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,255
Doctors in Black

1177
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,839
Play part of it

1178
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,887
Today reposted

1179
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
Video

1180
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,263
A woman at work rate closely toward winning

1181
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Without

1182
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,847
Exposing his

1183
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,455
Destroyer

1184
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:39,295
The food chain

1185
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:45,695
Doctors in black is part of the name of the plandemic documentary

1186
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
From stuff to

1187
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,911
It's a garbage coronavirus conspiracy theory content

1188
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,983
Just covers the same kind of grounded Alex does regularly

1189
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:04,383
I have not watched

1190
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
Imagine

1191
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
9 / my time

1192
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:13,343
Every

1193
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
Could have caught five

1194
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,255
Leonard maltin

1195
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:24,095
Yeah yes

1196
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,727
Pointed out there

1197
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:35,359
Talking about

1198
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,175
For speaking the truth

1199
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,223
Because of course

1200
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
This is Julie McCullough

1201
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,623
And talk s*** about fauci

1202
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:53,279
Weirdly she has a new book coming out about how bad it's probably but I'm sure that's not a part of this at all

1203
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:59,679
It's amazing hurt I'm sure she's been working on that book for a couple months

1204
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,471
Basic stories

1205
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:07,871
2009 virus called

1206
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:10,175
Fatigue syndrome

1207
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:16,063
This is published in the journal science but as people tried to recreate her experiment and reproduce a result

1208
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:21,183
Coronavirus did not appear to have any connection with their chronic

1209
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,279
The same day she had her paper

1210
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:32,191
This led to a partial retraction from the December 2011

1211
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
Attract

1212
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:43,455
Virus-related virus

1213
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
In chronic fatigue syndrome page

1214
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,551
In addition there is evidence of

1215
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:48,319
Poor quality

1216
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,623
Control a specific experiment

1217
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,391
In the report

1218
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:58,815
That time because it's was a research director at Institute for neuro immune disease

1219
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:02,399
Which is a private business not a part of the pouches operation or any

1220
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:08,287
In the Fallout of science retracting the paper she was one of the authors that strongly defended her conclusion

1221
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:12,639
Even after some question popped up about misused figures which is a very serious

1222
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:19,039
This thing in terms of a published research

1223
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
The Institute

1224
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,087
Very shortly after

1225
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:24,671
Because they claim

1226
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:29,791
Excel computer answer proprietary data

1227
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:33,631
She was eventually arrested because she was a fugitive from this suit

1228
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,215
Because she was releasing any damaging info or anything like that

1229
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:41,823
Chicago became a careerist in the anti-vax world

1230
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:47,711
Tying her discredited work at regarding xmrv to all sorts of things like autism

1231
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,503
Vaccines and what have you

1232
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:56,159
Can the actual field anymore

1233
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,183
Only place they can

1234
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
Nescience denialism Market

1235
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,887
She doesn't seem too interesting to me in that sense in the only thing people keep bringing up a batteries out of and tried to arrest her cuz she was

1236
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
Putting out this

1237
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
Whistleblowing shittin that's nonsense

1238
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:15,104
There's no cover-up of any discussions about any other research

1239
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,432
Results

1240
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:22,784
Cool allegedly stole from her employer

1241
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,624
I don't care about this at all

1242
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,464
Conspiracy world this week so it's only a matter of time for Alex drive to

1243
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,000
Somehow cashew nut

1244
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,304
I just wrote a book

1245
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,584
Since you started

1246
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,912
Talking about her called

1247
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,472
And I publish immediately after

1248
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,288
Interested

1249
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:48,384
Is this what you this is okay

1250
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,152
Interesting

1251
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,504
So he doesn't playing a bit of it but

1252
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,344
Jumping in interrupted

1253
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
You said something

1254
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,416
That I honestly think

1255
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
In the right

1256
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,512
Circumstances could lead to a lawsuit

1257
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
2 days

1258
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,352
Hospital

1259
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
New York

1260
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,704
Pennsylvania

1261
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,640
Line body bag

1262
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,272
No one ever goes in

1263
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:27,808
Because they were

1264
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:34,464
So Alex would be very very careful about calling people involved in high-profile tragedies actors

1265
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,864
Is Jordan Beau

1266
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:47,520
Speaking specifically

1267
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,872
Figure out what hospital

1268
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:54,176
You might be able to force a retraction out of Alex

1269
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:59,808
Trying to search for that was difficult because there's also

1270
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:05,184
If you search for Tyler Dixon Hospital very unhelpful results

1271
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:11,584
I tried to find the video I can't figure out where it is at a hospital

1272
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:13,632
Either

1273
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,656
Tyler Texas

1274
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:16,960
Fun fact

1275
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:23,360
In 2011 also had his license to practice law suspended after

1276
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,664
See tabs do plastic bags

1277
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,944
For sale

1278
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,272
In his possession

1279
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,064
Charged with drug trafficking

1280
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,904
Misdemeanor drug charges and

1281
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,976
You did not Escape his license intact

1282
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,512
Let's do 60 days in jail

1283
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:44,864
He's probably generally song

1284
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:51,264
I just think it's funny that Alex's friend did Rodger Stone supposed attorney was Moonlighting as a drug dealer

1285
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,408
Entrepreneur

1286
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:00,992
Just imagine for a second

1287
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:05,344
Zit like Rachel Maddow

1288
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:11,744
Imagine that

1289
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,424
Lady doctor makova

1290
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:23,008
This is just an imagination you just making this up

1291
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:26,848
That is woman is who she says one of the top scientist

1292
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
Neurologist in the world

1293
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:30,688
Really

1294
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,736
You're putting him

1295
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,760
Enterovirus

1296
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:36,576
Call Gina

1297
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
We're getting so unhealthy

1298
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,096
None of that stuff is at all related to what ended up being her fall from grace

1299
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:54,496
Even the stuff like her anti-vax stuff later in her career has nothing to do

1300
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:58,336
Ended up

1301
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
Pretty much

1302
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,640
Torpedo in her career

1303
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,432
It's all a late addition

1304
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,736
Into the story

1305
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,040
You change your muscle

1306
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,344
I met because he wants to he's fallen

1307
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,904
14 in the downfall of the human races

1308
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,208
Probably just going to be the fact that

1309
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,256
People want to believe stuff

1310
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:21,888
And they will do anything or anything that's a pretty negative

1311
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,448
Alex

1312
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
I would say

1313
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
Pretty basic

1314
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,288
Problem with some jazz ideas

1315
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:34,688
And that is Cyrus covid-19 stuff is all

1316
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,296
How did these globalist plan this out

1317
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,088
Seems like it would be hard

1318
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,136
You know you'd leave a trail

1319
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:49,792
Grills grills and everything Worthen planning Secret

1320
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:53,376
Get caught for whenever they laundry that's really smart

1321
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:57,216
And then there's a moment

1322
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,520
This that like

1323
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,312
It broke my

1324
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,104
My heart listening to this clip

1325
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:09,504
It was like when you see a jugular drop a ball

1326
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,600
But if you study these big events

1327
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,648
But you at has a drill

1328
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,184
John Hopkins

1329
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,208
Has a drill

1330
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Goodwill

1331
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:34,848
20 sixty-five million people die from a coronavirus escapes a while

1332
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,648
Gates Foundation

1333
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,672
Mobile model

1334
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,232
With the Rockefeller Foundation

1335
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
Before

1336
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,376
Before

1337
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
They call it event

1338
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
1

1339
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,688
Looking up and ran into water department

1340
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
You are so selfish a

1341
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,808
But God chapter

1342
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
U.s. code

1343
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:29,120
Legalize lethal biological chemical

1344
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Nothing on you

1345
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,960
Research or law enforcement

1346
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,080
Coof

1347
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Detention

1348
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
Today

1349
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
Is it

1350
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:57,536
Remember how to Rattle off his favorites

1351
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,840
To be more reliably

1352
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:06,240
He does like a party trick to impress

1353
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,520
Yeller clip

1354
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,592
It's one of the saddest things I've ever heard

1355
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:15,200
That's like really late-night drunk things like

1356
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:29,024
Then time passes they're impressed by the crowd

1357
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
People just over it

1358
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:34,656
All the sadness that came really

1359
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:38,496
Something impressive even is executed perfectly

1360
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,288
The portrait in tragedy

1361
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:45,920
Dolar a pesos begin to lambat line

1362
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:50,016
That's not good that's from 95 to 81

1363
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:56,416
He doesn't know what to do about it

1364
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:01,280
It's just words

1365
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:06,912
Also the words of 200

1366
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:13,312
It's just something Alex is making up because as he was ripping.

1367
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:19,712
And how many inches are in the number 200 stamp

1368
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:25,856
We talked about memorandum 200

1369
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
Bring it down again

1370
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,488
To show his 200

1371
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:35,072
And because the moment of him trying and failing to say his favorite subsection

1372
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,352
Is a real sad

1373
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
Sad moment

1374
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:43,264
Freud

1375
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,288
So enjoy

1376
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,616
Your questions about the drill thing

1377
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,176
Is that clip didn't spell it all out

1378
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
He's got you cover

1379
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:53,760
How they do this

1380
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
Of course you did

1381
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,704
It's a drill he's running that's kind of a metaphor of the joke

1382
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:15,008
Now this is not a drill this is not a game

1383
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
Assimilation

1384
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,592
That's a metaphor

1385
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
What don't you get

1386
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,944
Maybe clear metaphor

1387
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Satire

1388
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,784
Maybe

1389
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,112
I don't know I don't even think that would be

1390
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,392
Allegory

1391
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:33,440
Not a metaphor of a joke

1392
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,768
So is Ender's Game

1393
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:40,608
It's like it's telling me how to do this.

1394
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,376
I love that

1395
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:47,776
Love that book when I was 15 some feelings of Alexandra

1396
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,272
Watches that movie nose

1397
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,344
Alien planet

1398
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,416
After movie

1399
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,984
They blow up

1400
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,056
They're called xxxx

1401
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,480
We destroy you we rebuild you

1402
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,528
More this Illuminati crap

1403
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:31,296
Thank you

1404
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:47,168
The rescue of the thing is him atoning for his math

1405
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:53,568
Massive mistakes

1406
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:59,200
She's daughter

1407
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,480
So

1408
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,808
You know the episode is not so great

1409
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:15,072
I do not care over it it's really terrible

1410
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:18,400
Adidas Google if you want

1411
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,984
That is all taken care of already local library

1412
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:28,384
So are we equipped here and it's this story about beat there's a salon owner

1413
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:33,504
The situation

1414
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,064
She wanted to open up her salon and

1415
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:42,464
So she got arrested right

1416
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,768
The governor of Texas

1417
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:46,816
She should be let out

1418
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:51,936
You just said that they didn't actually do anything

1419
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:52,960
Which they could have died

1420
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:56,544
They could have been they didn't they just

1421
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:03,712
Superman the state supreme court

1422
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:07,040
And so she's got she has been released by the timer recording this

1423
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,904
She should be in prison for that

1424
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:14,464
Extraction

1425
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,232
Should be in prison

1426
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:19,072
Especially non-violence

1427
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,864
Fine or something I don't know

1428
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,912
I don't know what the right answer is

1429
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:27,008
Pretend situation

1430
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:31,104
He commuted her sentence

1431
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,128
The judge

1432
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,176
Said no I don't care how mad

1433
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:39,552
Please he's trying to say that she was acting in some kind of a way it was

1434
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
Roach

1435
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:46,976
Just being like hey

1436
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,048
Official motion

1437
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:52,608
This is the narrative

1438
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:54,912
Is presenting that story which is fraudulent

1439
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:58,752
But it does lead to him saying this which I think is

1440
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,288
Way revealing

1441
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,872
The governor tells him to let loose

1442
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,152
Do it

1443
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:08,224
Well

1444
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Hotworx

1445
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,416
So

1446
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:23,328
Alex believes is above a million

1447
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,608
Alex is pecans

1448
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:29,472
Alex

1449
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:35,872
I keep pocket Constitution with me

1450
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,688
And I can tell you right now.

1451
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,224
The Constitution says

1452
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,248
Trump is the king

1453
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:44,832
There are three not separate

1454
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:52,512
I will say least consistent about this

1455
01:33:59,168 --> 01:33:59,680
Read with a cord

1456
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:03,264
Alex is more powerful

1457
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,032
The courts

1458
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:08,384
Just don't understand people who say they read the Constitution

1459
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:11,200
Because I speak.

1460
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Crazy

1461
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:28,096
That's just crazy

1462
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,888
Just say you want to f***

1463
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:33,984
Because you think you're better than everybody else

1464
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,616
Episode it's

1465
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,152
Not

1466
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:46,016
Most interesting stretch of time

1467
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,576
Coronavirus tafen

1468
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Trying to

1469
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:50,880
Drift

1470
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:52,672
Along

1471
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:57,280
Last time it was David Ikes

1472
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,072
Episode

1473
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,864
The plandemic documentary

1474
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:07,264
He's just trying to get whatever you can and I guess it's kind of working but who cares I really care

1475
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
He's very.

1476
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
Distracted

1477
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:11,360
I don't know what he would be distracted

1478
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:14,944
It rhymes

1479
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:22,368
Troubles mounting all around

1480
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:24,160
What happens in the near future

1481
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,184
He's such a dick

1482
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,720
I just I don't

1483
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:29,536
Get why it is so hard

1484
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,560
For people that

1485
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:31,328
Just not

1486
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
People are

1487
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,888
Getting killed people are dying

1488
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,168
People are dying

1489
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:37,472
All the time I'm going to get up to 3000

1490
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,800
Do their own bugging projections

1491
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,336
