1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,176
Yeah

3
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,440
I feel like if a DMZ is Court like

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,840
It's really frustrating

5
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,632
So that was like dealing with this

6
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
Yeah

7
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,520
When I was 19 I got a DUI

8
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,080
Really

9
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:49,408
I was driving home from the party

10
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
Pretty bad about this book

11
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,760
I was driving home

12
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,808
And I've left my coat at the party

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,368
And you know it Central Missouri

14
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Everybody drives drunk

15
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:05,536
It's you don't need a pre-emptive lead Avenger

16
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,656
That's sort of Worlds that I was listening

17
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
Everyone

18
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,448
Survive

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
For the most part we don't all have been eligible for

20
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
Party I left my coat there it

21
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,248
It was really cold outside

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
I was driving home

23
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
That's pretty far away from anything

24
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,416
Like any businesses or any

25
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
Black ice

26
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,584
My car slid off the road into a ditch

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,864
Yeah and I tried to

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,912
To get the car out of the ditch

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,448
Like reverse and all that

30
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
I didn't have my coat

31
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
Forever had a cell phone

32
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,288
And so I'm like

33
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
S***

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,592
I need to get

35
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,640
Out of here what do I do

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,456
Supercooled I looked around there was nowhere I could walk

37
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
F*** it

38
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
I'm just got to bite the bullet on this

39
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
So I put my flashers on

40
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
I've had a few drinks

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
You are not good at preemptive defense if that's your opening line

42
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,496
Might turn combatives like I might

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
I wasn't afraid of the cop or anything like that

44
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
Going through this I just told him I have some drinks let's let's

45
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Take care of this

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,064
They took me down to the station

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
I got

48
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,904
Then I got in trouble stayed there a couple hours

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Can pick me up

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
Top

51
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,192
But I swag down the coffee

52
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,568
It also has a couple Missouri so he's like well everybody maybe a little bit of

53
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,872
But

54
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Written the judge I might be

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,944
It ended up becoming stiff

56
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,992
It wasn't even amidst

57
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,368
Because of the Court

58
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
A bunch of money

59
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Take a DUI class

60
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,720
And what have you

61
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
It was horrible wake up call

62
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
Never got behind the wheel of a car

63
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,400
With any alcohol

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
Really I have not ever done that my car slid off the road

65
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,336
Cuz I hit this

66
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
But it was so terrifying

67
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
That moment of feeling like completely out of

68
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Control

69
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,528
Like viscerally imprinted on me

70
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
Because

71
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
When I hit that the ice was the problem

72
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,672
But also I knew I'm too drunk

73
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,024
Putting in terrifying

74
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Fun

75
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:47,584
Story

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,376
The cop who ended up

77
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:58,336
Ended up being the security guard at the theater that I real

78
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:02,176
A couple years

79
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
Later

80
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,696
Security guard

81
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,791
And we said hello.

82
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,559
Diagnose

83
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,655
It was really

84
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,727
Alright super cool

85
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,847
I was actually in

86
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:36,991
Some some small-town it was only 25 minutes away from where I grew up

87
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,527
Middle of nowhere

88
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
Comedian drunk

89
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Like 130

90
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
And I'm driving home

91
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,471
Drunker than normal human being should be but it doesn't affect me as much

92
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
Driving home

93
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Get drunk

94
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
I ran out of

95
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,735
And I am driving home on the highway

96
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,503
Get off

97
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,807
At the stop on my hometown

98
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,367
And

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,463
I'm like looking around it's 2 in the morning

100
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,535
No cars for a million miles so I'm just like

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,863
F*** this red light and I just take a left and start going

102
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
And turns out

103
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:30,751
Directly behind me was a cop he pulls me over a man

104
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
Pablo Ramirez like what are you doing

105
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
Now this is where being white

106
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
Was

107
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,455
I would also like to say that I recognized

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,319
Oh yeah how lucky I am

109
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,623
Oh yeah

110
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Here's what happened

111
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,999
I watched you just do that was like

112
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
You do know there's a cop

113
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,583
What's going on here

114
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,215
You know it's like 2 a.m. there's nobody driving and I really gotta pee

115
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
Any bike well don't do that anymore

116
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,615
I'd like to go immediately like that was it

117
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
You're wondering why

00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
Lil B tiny bit

119
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,487

Handle the prospect

160
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,287
Listening

161
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
Alex Jones

162
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:45,823

I know I could I could tell you what he saying

164
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,151
I'm sure

165
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
50 women who are accusing Kavanaugh or Liars it's deep State operatives there is some b******* like that

166
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
How could we not top

167
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:04,511
Hot

168
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
That unique of a point of view on this particular

169
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
I don't foresee anything that he's not coming back

170
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,471
To some sort of dumbass

171
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,543
Deep State b*******

172
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
Or something or it's just a conspiracy that the clintons are putting together

173
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,039
Impossible

174
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
I don't want to go into any

175
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,975
Don't feel like it's fertile territory I don't think what he's going to bring to the table

176
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,767
He's going to be in any way interesting

177
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,607
I meant we already know that is modus operandi now is

178
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Being a multi-level

179
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
Marketing guy who's

180
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
Possible self-destruction

181
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
Field ugly to look at it

182
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
I don't

183
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
I don't think that

184
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
Even though we're being critical

185
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
I still don't think that it's

186
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,175
Good to look at

187
00:09:54,431 --> 00:10:00,319
Get that

188
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487

189
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
Children in

00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:15,679

00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Do we know how bad

193
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
2008-2009 time

194
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:26,431
Are we involved

195
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,527
The crash the dollar oh here's Bob Chapman to help me sell rabbits

196
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
Unemployed

197
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:42,815
Working for the man the globalist want to destroy the middle class

198
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,631
Is your ticket to the middle class

199
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:52,031
Which is which is why almost

200
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
I wouldn't come to it

201
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,783
I did not expect for Ozzy mandamus to overtake

202
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,623
In terms of the audience

203
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
Response but

204
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Review

205
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Really hit a lot of people

206
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,351
Close to home

207
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,167
Apparently graphic novel fans in Oradea

208
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Can't imagine why

209
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,983
Clyde did not kill

210
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:27,103
On March 10th

211
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
2009

212
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
Day after

213
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,247
Endorses B Tony Alamo sex cult

214
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,343
Weather Marion kids

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
I'll be honest with you when I started this episode ice fully expected him to come on Aaron be like

216
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,071
I didn't know about the Tony Alamo situation

217
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:48,351
I am so sorry

218
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Without the information

219
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
But I will say this

220
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
He does make one retraction on this episode

221
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:02,431
But I will not tell you whether it has to do with Tony Lama or not

222
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,647
1

223
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:18,303
No

224
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,351
Rapist is bad

225
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
Egregious

226
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Linguistically

227
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:28,799
So here we go where to start where Alex starts

228
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,847
Episode is going to be talking about

229
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
You know the Tea Party

230
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
Is it going to be talking about

231
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
Beef Louisiana

232
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Flu stuff

233
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:37,759
He's building up to

234
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,319
Is it the Tenth Amendment what is it going to be

235
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:49,791
Powerful

236
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,863
Litchfield is going out

237
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:59,007
We trust in God we know it's going to make it out we know it's going to get it on

238
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
7:40 broadcast

239
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,199
So far all he's been doing is promoting the Obama.

240
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
Is that which filmatography

241
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,623
Can you redo

242
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
Directions

243
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,231
Towards Alex

244
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
We're going to

245
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,287
Because this sucker is going to blast the New World Order

246
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,079
Big time

247
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
Is it going to put them on blast

248
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:44,063
I want you to get it and I want you to put it on every MySpace account every Facebook account

249
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,879
I want every email list over and over again

250
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:53,279
Posting every message board inform out there

251
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,423
Liquor store hours

252
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
I want you to tell him

253
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,751
This is the red pill

254
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,031
The Matrix

255
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Nothing more

256
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,431
Bush and Obama

257
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
Do you truly want to fix things

258
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Here's the red pill

259
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:23,999
Countdown

260
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Countdown

261
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,655
We're launching early

262
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
Fabric

263
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:49,599
It's just so much is going on so much has happened in the enemy is moving so quick I want to drop now

264
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
Lycamobile

265
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
Can we release it now

266
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Or should we wait

267
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,911
Building up the momentum

268
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,567
Building up the big dynamos the servos

269
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:19,295
Fire

270
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
Has to have to tape

271
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,303
Deception to their face while he says exactly that

272
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,399
Scottsdale

273
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
Gross

274
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
You spent

275
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
19

276
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:44,383
20 minutes of beginning of show documentaries

277
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:49,759
Mi maybe not

278
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
I don't know what I'm alright

279
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:01,279
Not really discussing any per se in the beginning

280
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
This is 20 minutes of

281
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:06,655
Before our show I know that that's that's a whole lotta

282
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,055
My DVD is coming out in DVD is coming out

283
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,175
Not only

284
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,223
It better go megavirus

285
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Mega Megabus scenes absolutely

286
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,159
So this

287
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
This clip is one of the end

288
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Episode

289
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,023
It made me realize that I

290
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,815
Like a lot of songs that I didn't

291
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Realize I like

292
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,911
And it might just be because the juxtaposition with Alex is like

293
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
Do you suck so much

294
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,215
That I actually

295
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,239
Kind of like the poem

296
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,407
What do you mean you kind of like the police

297
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,807
Shore Bank

298
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:24,223
Fight back against the bank

299
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
What day is it

300
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,999
Friday

301
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:43,423
We're all over the map in terms of 12 things going to come out

302
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,959
If your best way to fight

303
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
The bankers

304
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Criminal

305
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,823
Also I'd like to point out to the audience

306
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,151
The Jordan in the middle of that clip wrote down on his notes

307
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,503
What's an!

308
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,855
I think they're f****** Revolution

309
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
That's fine

310
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
Walking on the moon

311
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,631
Soft music

312
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,239
Then I realize or care to know

313
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
Compartmentalize them in real easy listening soft rock, category

314
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,479
I'm genuinely serious like

315
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:31,039
Anytime I listen to the police I'm always listening

316
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
Fair enough

317
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
OnPoint

318
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:47,935
Turn on.

319
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
Immediately

320
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
Attack

321
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
That he's got to get this out cuz

322
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
The deathblow to the globalist

323
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Yeah

324
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,207
That all is the first like going on in the world

325
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,303
The first like 40 minutes

326
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Interminable

327
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,911
He's talking about The Obama Deception

328
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
And having seen The Obama Deception

329
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
A little irony

330
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,615
Now Alex

331
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Two-story

332
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,199
It's out of the degree

333
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Canada

334
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Okay

335
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
Alex Alex

336
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,343
Number of really

337
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
Equally problematic

338
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:39,903
Errors

339
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
Reporting the story

340
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,231
And this is going to be

341
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:48,607
Flu all over again without 911 blogger call

342
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:53,727
Prison

343
00:19:56,287 --> 00:20:02,431
Neverland

344
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:18,047
Duties would include Mass internment of citizens

345
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,607
After terrorist attack mirroring

346
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:23,679
Militarization of law enforcement in u.s.

347
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,567
The Canadian military is reorganizing a post

348
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,359
911 world

349
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:37,503
By creating reservist units for each area the country that would be tasked with providing domestic security

350
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:43,903
That's a quote involve such roles as the mass internment of citizens in the event of a terrorist attack

351
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
We get is a very aggressively worded measure if

352
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
True we've got

353
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
You know in another instance of Alex

354
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
Just reading about Joseph Watson article

355
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
Right

356
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Planet

357
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
Problems with this

358
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
The first of all

359
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Is just

360
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
Foundational problem with this line of thought

361
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
The reason that American troops

362
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
In the military

363
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Serfdom

364
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Plastic operations

365
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
Except for at the whim of the

366
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
The governor of the state

367
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,072
Is because of the Posse

368
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,632
Which is American law

369
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Knox

370
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
Now 8

371
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:32,544
CID CID

372
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,592
Is another hurdle that we're going to have to

373
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
Just get over from the jump ever heard of Rome

374
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,968
Cuz they're pretending that we do have the same

375
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
And that that's a problem for their

376
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,952
Also there

377
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,024
A 1920

378
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,352
Defense Act which lays out the rules under which their military could operate

379
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:59,936
According to section 6 of the

380
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
A little bit too recent for Alex to know

381
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:09,152
Well I don't know I mean such a super like a really interesting history in terms of when they

382
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:12,736
They broke away from the UK

383
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,624
To like tournaments are you

384
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,976
19/22

385
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Confections

386
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,816
Centex and I quote

387
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,144
The Canadian Forces are other elements

388
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,216
Any officer or non-commissioned material

389
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,752
Called-out

390
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
Super Service in Aid of the Civil power in any case

391
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
In which a riot or disturbance of

392
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,384
He's beyond the powers of

393
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
The Civil Authorities

394
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,736
They're pretty clear that the Civil powers can utilize

395
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,504
The commission person

396
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,320
Four things that they filled that they can't handle on their own

397
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
Section 6 even goes further to say the following

398
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,672
Nothing in these parts will be

399
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Impose liability

400
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
Deserve

401
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
On an officer or

402
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,376
Member of the reserve Force

403
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
What is enrollment

404
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
Liable to perform Duty on

405
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Active service

406
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,264
People who are opposed to being used to assist

407
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,800
Request the Civil Authorities

408
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:11,104
Have the right to refuse to take part if they want to

409
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
There is nothing like helping out after a flood or something like that they can just say

410
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,296
And I don't feel that appropriate

411
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:25,952
And they're not required to do that and they're like

412
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,072
To do that under the national.

413
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Basic

414
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,848
Foundation document of the Canadian military

415
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
Can be called out

416
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
If there's Civil Authorities.

417
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
Situation beyond their control

418
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,600
Actual article that Paul Joseph Watson Road

419
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,672
I was just reading this post by Paul Joseph Watson

420
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:57,952
Sensationalizing

421
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,768
Existing story or Alex

422
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
In this case is a story about some reorganization

423
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
Missions going on in

424
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,632
Canadian military

425
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
The story comes out of the National Post

426
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,240
The conservative-leaning paper out of Toronto

427
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
If you pay close attention

428
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:12,544
Find a very

429
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Paul Joseph Watson

430
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,640
Intentionally blurs truth and lies in order to

431
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,432
His angle super

432
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
The first is in his opening paragraph

433
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,320
The Canadian military

434
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
Is reorganizing

435
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,464
Priorities to sue the post 9/11 World of the country

436
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,256
That would be tasked with providing to mess

437
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,024
Security

438
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
And involves rolls such as the messenger

439
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Spermatocele

440
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
The event of a terror

441
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
That is what Alex just read

442
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,424
On the air

443
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
And it is the

444
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
First paragraph

445
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Apple Joseph W

446
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,288
Times articles

447
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
You wouldn't write it down

448
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
It'd be tough

449
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:55,552
To do that I mean anybody

450
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
Is usually the sign of a dictatorship

451
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
Fascist

452
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,976
If you know where in the article he's performing to cover Disney

453
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
Canadian military discuss Mass

454
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Civilian

455
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,632
This is just Paul Joseph Watson Zone assertion being passed off as reporting

456
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,472
The closest the article comes to supporting that idea at all is quote

457
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,776
The units will include perimeter security

458
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,616
Prepare to cordon off an area if there was an atomic detonation

459
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
Nuclear accident

460
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,688
Or similar source of wide contamination

461
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
And arts

462
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
Response

463
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:26,784
Operate

464
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
In the far north

465
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
There's a big

466
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,856
Big difference

467
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,952
Between a unit train to cordon off a dangerous area to

468
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488
Fallout or an outbreak

469
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Specialized

470
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
People in the places

471
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
In case something

472
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,472
Something like that were to happen

473
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
Post 9/11 World

474
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Paul Joseph Watson

475
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Referenced in

476
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,152
Is open

477
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,944
There's a guy who's

478
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,784
Yeah and after that after 9/11 we all sort of realized

479
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,552
That we need to

480
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Kmart in

481
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,344
Into domestics

482
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,696
I don't think that's

483
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:06,464
I think that's

484
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Second happened

485
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,912
Do you think that it's a good idea for the military to be involved

486
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Were there to be some sort of

487
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:23,616
Nuclear attack that resulted in the genetic mutations

488
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
The area

489
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,664
Make sure that everybody

490
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,552
It's still just like

491
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
DIY wooden

492
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:33,856
Cordoned off an area

493
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
Mental picture of a bunch of mounties with like police do not cross into Atomic crater

494
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,096
Route there

495
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:49,728
Cordoned off an area Snidely Whiplash

496
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,776
Terrible

497
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,592
Deals with this problem that the text itself.

498
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,384
Mass incarceration

499
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
Talk about cordoning off an area

500
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Were there to be a disaster

501
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
The way you do by filling his articles

502
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,880
Isn't based on anything other than his own

503
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,208
Paul Joseph Watson

504
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Do not have a good internal compass

505
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,512
He's a psychic

506
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
From his article quotes

507
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
Of course the necessity of

508
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,864
The changes dressed up

509
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
By using the notion of

510
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:18,912
Helping

511
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
People in the event of earthquake

512
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,472
Slugs in nuclear

513
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
But we also learned

514
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
He's at the reservists

515
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:25,568
Undertaker

516
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:28,128
Would be nice intermittent civilians

517
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,432
Or quarantine zones after a biologic

518
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:31,200
Terror attack

519
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
That is

520
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
Completely of his own design

521
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,064
Interpretation

522
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,344
He's making that up

523
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
Right that is not in the article

524
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Extrapolate

525
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
From

526
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,024
The article but the mass intern me

527
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Camp

528
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
First Citizens

529
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,352
Fleet liaison

530
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,704
Last time with the avian flu

531
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,520
He was lying based on lies of 911 blog

532
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
Just taking an article

533
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
And then Alex's

534
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:01,920
Bring It On Air

535
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
But I mean like

536
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
Looks like what is it

537
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,344
What if you do

538
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,280
Reidsville

539
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,864
And then just sits around being like

540
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,216
Well how can I write 500 words about this

541
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Fairly innocuous

542
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
100-percent

543
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
He gets up

544
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
He gets up

545
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
News probably try to find a

546
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,992
A few things that fit in with Alex's package

547
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,064
Planet

548
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,880
Alex Alex

549
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:45,184
Can men take the prison planet article and read it

550
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,352
Where is the valence had to read this article out of the National Post

551
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632
You have a much more GIF

552
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,400
Difficult

553
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:55,936
Because there are exclamation

554
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:59,264
For the things that they're trying to lie about it

555
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Does he work for

556
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,360
Pjw

557
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:12,832
In present-day cuz I will be a smarter move

558
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,880
We talked about this

559
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
Unless Alex Own Prison

560
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:22,304
Alex had prisonplanet going apologist Watson was

561
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
The editor-in-chief of it

562
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,704
I believe Alex

563
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
If you

564
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,008
You know what else is very dumb

565
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:36,384
Not the biggest idiot in the world you would have retained right

566
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:46,368
So doves goes on to use a quote from the article to jump to an unrelated

567
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,208
So this is from

568
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,232
Is his art

569
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,352
Actual article and follows it up

570
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,120
With someone else

571
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:59,168
Quote the Ramada

572
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Heavy under analysis

573
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,336
The remodeling of the reserves will see the development of specialist units in

574
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
Informed the military's Regional division

575
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,664
Quebec

576
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200

Navigate

578
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:18,880
This is an open announcement the Canada has been subdivided into military units and will be policed by

579
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
Military reservist

580
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:25,024
This is not an open announcement of anything of the sort

581
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
If you pay close attention

582
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:28,096
Quotes

583
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
This is development specialist units

584
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,984
Unit in four of the military's Regional division

585
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
These Regional disease

586
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,336
This is Justin implementation

587
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:41,408
Specifically trained in dealing with catastrophe

588
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
It did not seem likely before

589
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
But have entered people's minds

590
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
2009

591
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,672
Hey so you know these guys who are trained to go do this one thing right well there's this new thing maybe we should train specific guys

592
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Used to doing one thing

593
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,656
Don't just do that one thing to the people suffering from the new

594
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:08,032
Most of what's wrong with this

595
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:10,592
Prisonplanet article and Alex Jones

596
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,152
Take on it is fear mongering

597
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,504
But he's not done Alex isn't done talking about

598
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,296
But now you know that

599
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:24,672
Jean Colin

600
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:27,232
Do you like everybody

601
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Horse Club

602
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:54,368
I don't want to be a casualty when they're dealing with the Canadian people

603
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,648
So that

604
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:59,744
Isn't the original article but it's not really

605
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Context in the original article

606
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
Yeah but if I were to read that

607
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,912
Is Brigadier General is

608
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:11,520
Do I see a situation when we

609
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,544
Possibly

610
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,592
I would respond

611
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
So do I

612
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,200
So do I

613
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
Bright and instead of just letting people run

614
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Accident

615
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:35,072
Contagion

616
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Situation

617
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:41,472
Themselves get the smallpox

618
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,480
It's basically just the idea of

619
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,504
Containment

620
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,832
See any way around this

621
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,112
I don't trust

622
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,952
The powers-that-be in the world or anything like that but you need better than this

623
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,864
You need better than this if you're going to make these arguments about disproving prison in

624
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Internment camp

625
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Some s*** like that

626
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,704
I need more from you

627
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,032
That would that would never be allowed in our constitution

628
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,848
Anyway in the city

629
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,992
I'm going to get back to what he really wants to be doing

630
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:25,760
On the show which

631
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,320
Which is lazily promoting The Obama Deception

632
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:41,632
FEMA camps

633
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,728
Overtaken by the private banking

634
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:59,808
This weekend you got bored in the middle of your own story

635
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:05,952
2533 139

636
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,024
253 3139

637
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
I want you to get the DVD

638
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,656
I think Rob dude just hit him with a blow dart with some

639
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:23,360
Call it

640
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:28,480
Obama zombies come to your door from oettinger Northwestern

641
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Launching

642
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,160
Obama Deception

643
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Ladder

644
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,424
Hellboy

645
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,752
Like when you starting to yell there about rope and bondage

646
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:57,152
His arm is gone Noms and punches

647
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
His own arm

648
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:03,040
To try and get the feeling

649
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:06,624
He's yelling to try and excites himself

650
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
Wow

651
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:16,352
Irwin Alex is propaganda

652
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,728
How weak is b*******

653
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
He's like

654
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,032
I mean

655
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
I guess what

656
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
The Obama Deception is coming out not even in

657
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
Hour into the episode

658
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Alex's episode

659
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,344
And you now have the second time

660
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,168
And I'm out

661
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
It's not bad but I think it's

662
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,288
2

663
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
It's not specific enough I wouldn't I wouldn't hear that and then be like

664
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,736
Still not good

665
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,784
You need this V in there for zombies

666
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Obvious

667
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:11,136
That doesn't make me think of zombies

668
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,464
Kind of

669
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,072
What's interesting about this

670
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:26,496
Oh

671
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:28,032
Sex-bomb Tom Jones

672
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,872
That's why I asked

673
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:34,176
Alright

674
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
I'm sorry

675
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,600
Now go crazy

676
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,000
And that's because of

677
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,560
Couple days earlier Paul Joseph Watson

678
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:53,120
Another story about the military in Canada

679
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
Any references

680
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:55,424
In

681
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,216
Is Mew article the one that Alex was

682
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:57,984
Just going over

683
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,568
So Alex brings that by virtue of covering

684
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
And that one's actually even more

685
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
Finishing up with historical

686
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,344
Considering using trips

687
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,616
No

688
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,896
This is really interesting

689
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
Because

690
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
Glaring reporting errors

691
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Paul Joseph Watson

692
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
Boxes that reference

693
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
6 days prior

694
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
Please

695
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,976
He is 100% wrong

696
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,840
What Alex's Alex's woefully misunderstanding historian

697
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,704
Diversion he's telling us that these troops from a nearby army base or being used

698
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,056
Because the drinking spots in that town or out of control the military

699
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,336
Come in and Felicia

700
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:10,944
In reality if you review The Toronto Star article to Paul Joseph Watson

701
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,712
Disposed on

702
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Stories very

703
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,784
According to the star quote

704
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
City police on Camp Borden officers are

705
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Using joints

706
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
Street patrols to help keep the peace

707
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:21,952
Peace and berries busy Entertainment District on

708
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,560
The military police would deal only with their own personnel and not

709
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:27,584
Civilians in Barrie

710
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Fairy police chief

711
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,632
Waiting for

712
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:36,032
Soldiers would be less inclined to cause trouble if they knew would come up with their bosses on Monday morning

713
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:45,248
It's like an Army in some country

714
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,088
And instead of being allowed to I don't know

715
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:56,512
Rape and pillage to their hearts content they were supervised by some sort of light help

716
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:01,632
Since in many many many many historical situation

717
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,472
Really interested in is deacon

718
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,776
Instructing how Paul Joseph Watson is

719
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,568
Back in 2019

720
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
Interesting how he misuses

721
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:18,272
Like what we found with the avian flu thing 2911 blogger

722
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
It's really a

723
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,624
Interesting to see how like there's no way

724
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:27,488
Intentionally absolutely no chance

725
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,512
Realize that

726
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,560
Is it he does take a quote

727
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
From this Toronto

728
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,144
Star article

729
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,240
Just call yourself to Picayune

730
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,824
Everything fun

731
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
He uses beef

732
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,272
First half of a quote

733
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,040
And doesn't use

734
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
The 2nd

735
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,600
Which invalidates

736
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,952
Oh God Paul Joseph Watson doesn't

737
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,304
In addition Joshua Abel a berry bartender

738
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
Did he not heard any reports

739
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,888
Military personnel starting trouble

740
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,912
However

741
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,192
The part that Paul Joseph

742
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,216
Watson

743
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
Include is the end of April,

744
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,104
On the other hand if they are in civilian clothes

745
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,688
How would you know whether or not they're in the military

746
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,784
How do you leave that phone out cuz you're trying to make the other point

747
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:26,112
You're trying to trick people

748
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
Part of the quote

749
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
I wouldn't know they were military to begin with

750
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Present bi

751
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,280
Idea that there is no military

752
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
Rowdiness problem

753
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
Police could help keep an eye on

754
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,168
It's all just about

755
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:41,728
The fascists

756
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,336
I am FEMA in Canada

757
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,456
Federal emergency

758
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,320
L2

759
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,368
PJ dubs

760
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
Not have

761
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
Some sort of paranoid

762
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,024
You might also

763
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,376
It could be a dozen

764
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
You're not wrong

765
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,216
You can have a latent paranoid that

766
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,496
You choose

767
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:15,520
To use

768
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
You know how a lot of

769
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,360
Stand-up comics are supermental

770
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,128
Unhealthy

771
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
And they use that

772
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,760
I think there might be something

773
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:30,880
Something like cuz I think at this point after so many years

774
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,208
Is Paul Joseph Watson

775
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,232
Slightly crazy

776
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:37,280
Yeah I think you would recognize like

777
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,328
I got to stop there

778
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
Or something like that

779
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,752
But that might just be me painting him with a little more Humanity

780
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:52,640
G8 Self Storage

781
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,431
And completely lying

782
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,991
Is on point

783
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
Further reading

784
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,879
That's fine under Canadian law

785
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:05,439
If they like the police in Barrie

786
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,535
Decides it like we could use some help from these troops

787
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,351
Well within the law for them to just do that

788
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
That's not a problem

789
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,215
So all of this is a hot load of nothing but

790
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
The reason that Alex

791
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
Is kind of like

792
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,615
And a little bit of ignorance

793
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,455
Yeah it's because he

794
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:31,807
Kind of thinks that Mexico Canada and America are already the North American Union

795
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,903
And also kind of things we all are subject

796
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Back to the Queen of England

797
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,255
I do not know that

798
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
I believe he does think that

799
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,327
Based on this next clip

800
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,215
We are under control Obama

801
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
President

802
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:56,383
Republic

803
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
Left the Bush Administration

804
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,623
Dictatorship

805
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
We are in trouble

806
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:15,327
Quick Charge

807
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,679
I mean you might have President Bush

808
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:23,007
Using a Saudi Prince hands and

809
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,847
I would guess another president

810
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Before the queen bee

811
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
I don't know that to be true

812
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
I also don't care if they do

813
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,319
So this whole Queen character

814
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,135
She controls everything everything

815
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
She controls everything

816
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
Oh so I have bad news

817
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,023
Bush People

818
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,559
Referring to wear British citizen

819
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,351
Technically Day Camp

820
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:55,007
Talking about the people from Australia

821
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,271
I think if you're not a bruise

822
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:14,207
I don't know how that works I don't know how that works either f*** that part

823
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:22,399
But if you're not a British citizen you can just get an honorary title which allows you to put the suffix

824
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
After your name

825
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
But you are knighted

826
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:26,751
Do not call you

827
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:27,519
Seltzer

828
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,615
In 2009-10

829
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:35,455
The latter has a bush guy

830
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
Calling Ted Kennedy

831
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:37,503
Is pretty much a

832
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,271
Big Stretch

833
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,063
Before that it was five years

834
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,087
American Impala

835
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Ben that was Robert Brewster

836
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,231
In 2002

837
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,143
Birdy of course short for Robert in 2002 Alan Greenspan and Rudy Giuliani

838
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Got the owners

839
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,191
Being named

840
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,359
America's Best

841
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:09,759
Honorary titles is not

842
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Not always gone great

843
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,135
People in 1923 Benito Mussolini

844
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
1940

845
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:25,375
One-time Nicolae ceausescu

846
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:32,031
1989

847
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:54,303
Kbe title they know that one

848
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
2008

849
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,399
Do push players have been awarded

850
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,679
These titles

851
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
Present

852
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,495
Even Obama administration

853
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,847
We got Bono

854
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
We got Angelina Jolie

855
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:13,503
We got Steven Spielberg

856
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,743
That's the cool thing about these titles if you aren't British citizen

857
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,559
Become a British citizen

858
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,095
You're automatically

859
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:33,983
If you become a citizen later a bunch of people have done it

860
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:36,287
Goddamn

861
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,871
You got to go

862
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:49,087
Around and try that they would probably annul it

863
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:55,743
Yeah I know Kevin Spacey

864
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,047
15

865
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,191
I assume it's just a wig

866
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:10,847
Missingno is like

867
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,383
Some sort of a relationship

868
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
Britain

869
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,247
I'm sure with Kevin Spacey

870
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Some sort of action

871
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
Do you have

872
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,559
And of course be willing to wear sunglasses

873
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
Flowers

874
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:42,079
They've misfired a number of times to say the least

875
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,895
The British Monarchy you bet

876
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,927
Murderers Row little Murderers Row

877
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:03,327
Each of them had a moment when it didn't look like they were going to be as bad as they were

878
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,519
History before they break terribly

879
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,335
There's a glimmer of hope

880
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,639
And that looks like this might work out

881
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:20,223
Maybe if we give somebody the Peace Prize they won't commit genocide

882
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
And that's just not been the case

883
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
I just not been the case

884
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
So

885
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,647
Now we get to about the hour

886
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
Michelle I only know that because

887
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,231
Alex comes back

888
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,023
Break right in about an hour

889
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
He's got to the doctor

890
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
Ron Paul

891
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,935
Real romper

892
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:42,751
Are you surprised

893
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Okay fair enough

894
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:54,271
It's been a long time who gives a s***

895
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,295
Cuz it's just in Spain

896
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,367
A lot of the time when he's on

897
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
He does

898
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
Sort of

899
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
Pieczenik roll

900
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,559
Steve pieczenik not back on the

901
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
2012

902
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,167
Already playing

903
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,263
At this point

904
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,311
Alex got narratives that he wants

905
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
Enforce

906
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,895
External Authority

907
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:22,175
Credibility

908
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,199
To get his back

909
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:28,575
What about this

910
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,951
Okay

911
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
Basically

912
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:39,071
Hey dude pretty race

913
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:51,103
Interesting you should bring that up an interesting take on Bernie Sanders in 2000

914
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:56,991
Like so many of our issues we bring different factions together liberal

915
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:59,807
And conservative under the Constitution

916
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,623
Because if you're a good honest liberal the like

917
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,927
Bernie Sanders

918
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:09,279
He's an honest person

919
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,327
So Alex even is like

920
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,119
He's an honest person

921
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,167
He's very liberal

922
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,263
As if those two things are shocking to have

923
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,103
According to Alex

924
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,919
John Birch Society none dare call it

925
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:26,943
Conspiracy root

926
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,991
Socialism

927
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
Get you into communism

928
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
Authoritarian

929
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:35,135
Is Ron Paul

930
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
He's great you know he's a good

931
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,951
Kind of liberal

932
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:43,071
Socialist but that is a good idea that socialism

933
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:49,471
It was a tricky when the communism on auditing the Fed

934
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:53,311
Authoritarianism know

935
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:58,431
The enemy of my enemy is still

936
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:03,039
Alex is on the same page

937
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,855
He's very Pro Bernie Sanders in 2009

938
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
Because he's

939
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
Working for

940
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,463
In the aftermath

941
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,743
2000

942
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,399
Really strong propaganda effort to get you to not be on board

943
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
Like his messages

944
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,519
Really kind of universal unless you're a billionaire

945
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:28,127
Like there's no there's no if you're just like a regular person there's no like

946
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:39,391
The rich pay more taxes than me

947
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
He's the kind of guy

948
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
There's a lot of possibilities

949
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
Misinterpret

950
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,303
That's why the propagate

951
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:48,095
The right

952
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,631
Israeli effect

953
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Politician

954
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:01,151
I want to take the piss out of Ron Paul

955
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,687
Probably involved in taking over

956
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
Dominica

957
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:10,111
Problem

958
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
Writing of his race

959
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:14,719
The staff newsletter for years who knows

960
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
F****** dumb ideas about the economy

961
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
Good morning

962
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:19,839
Intervent

963
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,375
Great

964
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Goodwill Akron

965
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
But

966
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,007
You're a dick hole comes on Alex Jones Show basically wants

967
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:29,567
To spread fear about how the dollar is going to collapse

968
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
That's pretty much

969
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
Standard operating

970
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,431
Procedure for most of his

971
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,455
Back in 2009

972
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:36,735
Let's see if

973
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:38,783
Dr. Ron Paul's any different

974
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:45,439
We all have to be prepared I think we should prepare our families and I think financially.

975
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:51,327
Either going to destroy the dollar I don't see anything wrong with people believing in the constitution in

976
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,727
Bowling with a talk should be legal tender and only a few gold coins a few silver coins and on how to defend themselves

977
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,287
That's what the founders talked about

978
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,383
With a focused founders

979
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,687
If I understand correctly the founders mission

980
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:12,831
Was like yourself no big deal that's

981
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,367
Write it up

982
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,183
Alright good work founders

983
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:21,535
7 year old man

984
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Is VX

985
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
Zaxby's

986
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
Coming

987
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
Spinning out

988
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,447
Some of the very similar

989
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,055
Bureau God-fearing America

990
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,415
And Alex

991
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,231
Promoting

992
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,375
He is still excited with the idea of giving out these DVDs when Obama zombies come to your door

993
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,911
But he takes

994
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,679
Further

995
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,727
The stinks of desperation

996
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
Is every time they come to your door

997
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,639
He needs

998
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,991
Go out

999
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:15,295
Sounds like

1000
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:22,207
Yobama

1001
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Do better

1002
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,911
Alright

1003
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:36,799
From the

1004
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
Stan you earn

1005
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:44,223
India

1006
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:48,831
Every small town

1007
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:52,159
This is like the early Nazi party

1008
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,791
You need to rush out to them

1009
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Alex

1010
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
Completely imagine

1011
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
For people to go edge

1012
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,495
Places with

1013
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:41,567
His DVDs get video of it

1014
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,687
Understood the value of that sort of

1015
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,759
Sensational

1016
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
It's kind of impressive

1017
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,303
I'm making prank videos back then

1018
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
Harnessing that is

1019
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,935
The marketing Alex

1020
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
Is very

1021
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,895
He's telling them to go out and bait people into yelling at you

1022
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:19,199
Which he convened use for Market

1023
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,319
Innocuous DVD

1024
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,183
The Obama Deception

1025
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
Deception you shouldn't be allowed

1026
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,279
Anyone ever bought one

1027
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,863
What I'm saying is that every Library should have like a metal

1028
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,935
To text copies of the Obamas

1029
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
Deception

1030
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,983
You have one you have to leave it

1031
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,799
At the door, Colton never would buy

1032
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
Best deal

1033
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:48,895
Just on YouTube like for free

1034
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:57,855
Did Obama take office

1035
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,695
Prisonplanet.com

1036
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,999
Soccer

1037
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:08,351
You got a bookstore or a church

1038
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Forest School

1039
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,911
Orb

1040
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:22,175
Credible

1041
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:27,807
That's another imagine

1042
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
Interaction

1043
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,135
Anything Obama sells

1044
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:35,999
Please buy my s*** in bulk you'll be able to move you everyone's going to want to buy

1045
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,023
A bunch

1046
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:43,423
We all know how those DVD racks are full of quality program

1047
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:51,103
All the times that we got it done roadshows ended up at like some f****** gas station with a shower in it

1048
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,223
Killing a little bit of time of that truck stop.

1049
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
What's this fake Iron Man movie

1050
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:03,647
All good

1051
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,207
I told you up top

1052
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
The beginning of this episode

1053
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
That

1054
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
Yes

1055
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,655
I know I f****** hoped it would be about Tony Alamo

1056
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:15,423
Because that was pretty

1057
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,495
Disgraceful at the end of the last episode

1058
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,967
It's a retraction and zeinab Issa

1059
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,855
And Then followed by a beefed-up

1060
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:40,511
Classic

1061
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:50,751
You good you take a bath

1062
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,335
Is really actually right

1063
00:58:54,591 --> 00:59:00,735
Recipe for

1064
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:07,135
Who wrote the Watchmen comic book reader

1065
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:13,535
I just got the book Sunday

1066
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:19,935
Incorporation State and Terror attacks

1067
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:25,823
Appointment

1068
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,175
Manhattan was not a god

1069
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Is that developed

1070
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:37,087
Like one character

1071
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:44,255
Even the character in South was like

1072
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,239
And neither can I

1073
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
Regardless

1074
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,799
Alright whatever

1075
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:34,687
Neil Gaiman write

1076
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:41,087
No no this retraction is like he didn't really but there's some crossover

1077
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
Graphic novel

1078
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,767
Spiritual connection

1079
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
In between Alan Moore's work

1080
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:54,655
But there's also a spiritual connection between Allenmore is working

1081
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Lovecraft

1082
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:04,127
I think I remember Rorschach showing up in good Omens

1083
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,663
Who this is

1084
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,431
Interesting

1085
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,711
Impotence of like

1086
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
Alex

1087
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,295
Misinterpreted the hell out of Watchmen

1088
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,343
Kept saying Ozzy man Davis

1089
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,391
And then said that

1090
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,439
Allenmore did Sandman

1091
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:20,255
Wichita retracted one of these

1092
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,815
Most

1093
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,375
Actually

1094
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,679
Enterprise pronunciation

1095
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,215
It's so interesting

1096
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:31,007
Need to do that

1097
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:37,663
There's no reason to do that this crazy somebody who works there

1098
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:43,807
Probably there was just like

1099
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,087
Look

1100
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
Everything was cool

1101
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
It's awesome

1102
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
But I'm not going to fight you on

1103
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
But seriously

1104
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
Sandman is maybe the greatest

1105
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,887
It's not a graphic novel ever written if you're not going to respect that it was Neil Gaiman

1106
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,167
I got I'm going to quit

1107
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,263
This is a resignation level offense Alex

1108
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
You won't notice

1109
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
She's not listening to all of this

1110
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,151
Alex

1111
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
At all

1112
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,223
It doesn't

1113
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
Like there's no indication

1114
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Vicky's

1115
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,063
Realize he was wrong

1116
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
But also he doesn't say it

1117
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:20,671
Of it

1118
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:25,791
It's most likely he know

1119
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
That is a retraction

1120
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,911
Are you interested

1121
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,495
This is a mic down

1122
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:38,591
This is this is a mic down to Joe Asian.

1123
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,175
Jason bermas is about to come in with some Allenmore wisdom

1124
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,479
That is so crazy

1125
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,527
And goes all over the place

1126
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
You have to hear all of it

1127
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,111
So

1128
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
Preemptive

1129
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
Is it

1130
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,719
Wisdom about Alamo

1131
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,767
Alan Moore's wisdom

1132
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,327
Or is it wisdom with an allomorph

1133
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,679
Supposed about Alan Moore

1134
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,983
That actually below

1135
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,007
Betrays

1136
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,615
And a pretty misogynistic

1137
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:16,223
Services

1138
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:30,559
Real quick I just want to stop there because if you

1139
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,423
What is a practicing

1140
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,215
Geico

1141
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:38,751
Yeah probably

1142
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
A bunch of dumb

1143
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,383
So even in his like insinuation of like

1144
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:51,551
I mean admittedly you said that was all bulshit that he was making up to make people like me

1145
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
Like

1146
01:03:55,135 --> 01:04:00,511
Yes it is

1147
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,839
Synonymous with art

1148
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,551
Supernatural Realm

1149
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:28,671
The fact that more can get laid is evidence of the supernatural

1150
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:40,191
He believes that magic is the ability to use words to make changes in the physical world

1151
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:42,751
Magic magic is essentially art

1152
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:45,823
Believe

1153
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
Oh my God that's a philosophical

1154
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
Clefairy

1155
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
Perspective

1156
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,759
And I create something that I

1157
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Evocative

1158
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,111
Thing I want to express and people

1159
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Read it

1160
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:01,439
Changed isn't that somehow magical

1161
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:04,511
I think it's a very interesting perspective to have on the

1162
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,583
Art Exhibit The Act of Creation

1163
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,863
And the axe

1164
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,263
Taking in a creation

1165
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,287
Which is again

1166
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:20,639
Highly recommend

1167
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,991
That's not the most high-level like

1168
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,271
Thesis version

1169
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,855
Like understanding how art effect

1170
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:32,927
But like they're stupid about

1171
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,279
It just falls on deaf ears

1172
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
And then the part about like

1173
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,607
You look at how this guy looks

1174
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,679
He's married or as or has a girlfriend

1175
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,263
He's getting f***** you know there's magic involved

1176
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
It's just like I don't know if

1177
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,079
Joke

1178
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,615
Like I really don't

1179
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,407
Because they don't laugh afterwards

1180
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
I don't know

1181
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:01,855
Supposed to be a burn ever heard of Alan Parsons because they have no idea what's actually in store for them

1182
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
I think about that

1183
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
He comes in with the Alan Parsons

1184
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,255
Alan Parsons

1185
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,815
RCI

1186
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
He doesn't

1187
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,935
Demonic made

1188
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,959
Oh God

1189
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,775
I'm so Georgia

1190
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,431
The only way more gets f*****

1191
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:32,831
Is if magic is real

1192
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,647
So now we get into

1193
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,463
A portion of a child

1194
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,743
At from like a

1195
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:40,767
English 101

1196
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:42,559
Has a freshman would be like

1197
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,095
Hey you know

1198
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,655
There's only one criminal said

1199
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,679
And that's using

1200
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,727
He paints a picture with

1201
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,775
With words

1202
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
The other thing is

1203
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,127
Whatever the f*** you just said

1204
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
Go away

1205
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,711
Forever is using more than

1206
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,247
!

1207
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
WhatsApp

1208
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,879
Exclamation

1209
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:09,183
Is portion of

1210
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,999
The show that is probably want I think one of the most

1211
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
The longtime on Alex

1212
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,351
She has to fill time

1213
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
He's got a couple guest coming up towards the end

1214
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,727
Call

1215
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,543
And he gets some f****** really bad calls

1216
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
Yeah

1217
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:27,103
Super Inn

1218
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,639
Interesting to me that Alex

1219
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,663
Handles those calls

1220
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
Very well

1221
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,503
This is a mark of our show

1222
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:38,623
Is

1223
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:41,183
He has a couple callers who are like

1224
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
The depth

1225
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:46,815
Of how stupid does not handle them

1226
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:51,935
I will admit that when he does do something good it is evidence that magic is

1227
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
Absolutely

1228
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,263
This first one

1229
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
Is a poet

1230
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:05,247

I do not support the troops in Iraq

1236
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,167
I like the iPad 30 minutes home

1237

I am going to lie making a song out of it is called

1238
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:30,079
If you

01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:35,455
American with a gun in Iraq I hope you come back in a body sac

1240
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:41,343
If you are American with a gun in the Middle East I hope you get the gardai the Beast

1241
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:47,487
If you're an American with a gun in Pakistan I hope you die when your stand

1242
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:51,327
Listen I have to have family

1243
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,399

I hope the troops don't die in Combat League American

1246
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:12,063
I understand you're angry and upset

1247
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:29,471
You know what I appreciate your call

1248
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:34,847
Like particles we know we know about Alex

1249
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,151
Like everything else that is

1250
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
Professional handling of call

1251
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:46,623
No great if you have the ability to just hit the mute button so

1252
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
To that guy

1253
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:54,047
Yeah I don't think at the moment I would be able to do that well with that guy

1254
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,839
I'll probably be like what's the next day

1255
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,167
Pretty cool

1256
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:02,239
I mean yeah that I would like to know what the

1257
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:08,127
Also that last one was a slant rhyme and I don't appreciate

1258
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:11,199
Perversion of poetry

1259
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
Impute

1260
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,695

Jordan

1263
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:27,583
His next call

1264
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:30,143
Alex receives is worse

1265
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,191
Very much worse

1266
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
Yeah but also

1267
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
I got to give Alex a

1268
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
How we handle

1269
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,151
Terribly so would you say that

1270
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431

We're blown to Smithereens by controlled demolition Incorporated

1281
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,759
You don't know where this is going

1282
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:23,903
I beg you to I know we just had a mic down clip recently

1283
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:30,303
I'm just afraid you're going to yell over this experience

1284
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:35,423
This is a contrast

1285
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,495
Call me to come very fast

1286
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,775
And you'll get whiplash

1287
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,567
All right talk about 9/11

1288
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:46,431
I know people who blow up over a dozen loved ones that fateful day

1289
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
I just like The View

1290
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,271
What are a few grievances briefly in it

1291
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,807
G-rated Nana

1292
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
I'm extremely peed off

1293
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,975
I wish you'd put up a Fred sobon gonna link to the book

1294
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,303
Did 6 million really die

1295
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:07,167
And talk about the persecution a single question

1296
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:10,495
See how quickly you get arrested when you enter Canada

1297
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
Inguinal Germany

1298
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,687
I know that you sometimes hang up quickly or not thinking the people who lived in Italy criticize you and then spend five or 10

1299
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:23,807
The more minutes

1300
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,367
Drive responded to a screaming guy the Holocaust

1301
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:33,023
Promote Alex to promote other hotels tonight for 3 p.m.

1302
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:38,655
People he knows believe that the Holocaust was a hoax

1303
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,935
Yes the holla hoax

1304
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:46,591
So all of this is to say that this guy we're getting a nice cross-section of Alex's listeners

1305
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,383
Is this guy's been promoting

1306
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
Come out and say that the Holocaust was a b*******.

1307
01:12:56,575 --> 01:13:00,415
And then immediately fall

1308
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:07,071
That holla hoax is not already in Alex Jones documentary right

1309
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,095
Touched

1310
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
He knows better

1311
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:12,191
You got time but like

1312
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:16,543
I think you can appreciate what I was saying came out of nowhere

1313
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,127
So now we get to keep stalking for a little bit

1314
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,711
9 not real

1315
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:29,087
There should be a middle

1316
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:33,951
Fynx on fire so I don't think Alex is responsive

1317
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,719
Perfect

1318
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,255
But it's pretty good

1319
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,559
Okay after you just connected them

1320
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,655
Seems you found a lucrative career in the

1321
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:47,775
Patriot business making poor people went around facing at 10 wealthy no real

1322
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:52,895
Sitting on the radio every day.

1323
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,223
Removing try to get the States to declare sovereignty

1324
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:02,367
We are moving to have the bankers arrested that a congressman on saying it 30 minutes ago

1325
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,415
Real quick it's not great

1326
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
First initial reaction

1327
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,999
To rebut is

1328
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,791
Is the idea that he doesn't offer solution

1329
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,327
Cuz that's what he's doing

1330
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
Are you saying

1331
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,911
He's responding to the guy you don't offer Solutions

1332
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:19,519
Sounds like we have all these 10th Amendment resolution guys on

1333
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,103
Ron Paul is on talking about arresting the bankers

1334
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,431
Deal with the most pressing issue

1335
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,199
Ufirst

1336
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,759
But I understand you got to spend your wheels a little bit

1337
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:30,527
Get your bearings

1338
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,343
35 minutes

1339
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:39,487
We are moving to

1340
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:45,887
Say no to martial law you come on here

1341
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,191
Insult

1342
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,727
Acme

1343
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
Say all these terrible things

1344
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:59,711
I make a film is cost me probably $80,000 or more to me

1345
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:05,343
And release it for free

1346
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,927
You calling me Sam evil

1347
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:13,023
You know I don't like the things Israel does and I criticize Israel

1348
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:15,839
Associated

1349
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:22,239
Megastar live to Simply hate Jews and everybody else

1350
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:32,223
Very very simple I hope you realize that

1351
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,503
I respect that

1352
01:15:34,271 --> 01:15:38,111
That's not have someone who's coming on your

1353
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:42,719
Is far as actually promote

1354
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:44,255
These people who are Holocaust deniers

1355
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,095
Call

1356
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:50,655
Put on another level because Alex

1357
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Ethos of

1358
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,727
I'm not going to screen my calls you guys can

1359
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:56,287
Cummins like on the last episode he's talking about

1360
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,055
Used to sell tracks

1361
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,639
For sale

1362
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,431
I kind of respect that in terms

1363
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,991
Letting people speak their piece

1364
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,575
We are such a stark contrast

1365
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,111
2009 in the prison

1366
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,159
When he was in that drunk Hotel interview

1367
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,743
And he refused to engage with the idea that Nazis

1368
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,839
People who are not really into him

1369
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:26,239
Here we have an instance where a Nazi was really into him is calling into the show in 2009 talk about the Holocaust

1370
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
Real and Alex

1371
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
Go so far as to say

1372
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,615
I don't care for this real doing

1373
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:35,199
But you people who are anti-semitic I don't want to be associated with you

1374
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:39,807
I don't like Israel and I don't like you see that's what I want

1375
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:42,111
That's my favorite part was

1376
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,183
Which is a line that I think I'm going to start using from now on

1377
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,487
Anytime somebody makes me mad I'm just

1378
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,255
Listen

1379
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,327
I don't like what Israel's doing and I don't like you either

1380
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
I like that

1381
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,727
He's lying about

1382
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:59,263
The Canadian military

1383
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:02,079
Desperately trying to sell his stupid documentary

1384
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,919
I can't say that I don't respect you know I do think

1385
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,943
Good response

1386
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:10,271
There was it there's another way you could have answered that

1387
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,063
Call and I think he would have answered it differ

1388
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,831
Now

1389
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,647
I'll tip my cap

1390
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,671
To Alex for the

1391
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
Ya Coulda done way worse

1392
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
We come back to the show

1393
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
He's gotten through these calls

1394
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,167
Gas to supposed to call

1395
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,471
I've kind of spinning his wheels a little

1396
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,567
Spell The Obama Deception a little bit more

1397
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
In

1398
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
20

1399
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
Where we are now

1400
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,479
Do you still take calls

1401
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:46,111
Can call in

1402
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:53,791
People end up saying we're going to start rambling about bulshit

1403
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,583
He'll take one call

1404
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,607
And then

1405
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
I'm out of time

1406
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:59,167
So people do

1407
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,447
It's like there are still call

1408
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:07,103
I'm just I'm just interested to know if I would say that in the episodes

1409
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,151
Best real radio and podcast

1410
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:12,223
It's hard to imagine the people would know exactly when he

1411
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,807
Broadcast live

1412
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,599
Chinese on Airport

1413
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,903
Say we're going to take calls on every

1414
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,975
Yeah many times

1415
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,023
So

1416
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,303
It's a crap

1417
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,863
Much less part of the shows

1418
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,215
He still pretends that is apart of

1419
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,263
Yeah that's

1420
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:39,615
So in the next clip Alex gets back to selling The Obama Deception

1421
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,431
Things take a turn

1422
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:49,343
I Was a Highwayman

1423
01:18:55,999 --> 01:19:02,143
Behind the scenes right now here

1424
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,319
Surreal

1425
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,207
You only live once

1426
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:30,559
Are you leaving aminos the sleeping giant is Liberty freedom is rising

1427
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:32,607
They know you have power

1428
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,543
Everybody right now The Obama Deception is going to drop

1429
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:47,455
Probably dropping a running prisonplanet.tv Emmy for

1430
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:58,463
Operation launch site launched at lunch right now just made that decision

1431
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,535
Operation right now

1432
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,640
Cherry Brushy you're on the air

1433
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:18,944
What just happened

1434
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,504
What is going on right now

1435
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,528
Yes

1436
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
Okay

1437
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,464
Watch the operation

1438
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
Hit that big button

1439
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:40,960
Deploy the operation

1440
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:43,264
Is Jim Cramer's

1441
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,848
Crazy big box

1442
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:50,432
The release the documentary but

1443
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:56,064
So whenever you had the Walker Texas Ranger

1444
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,672
Houston I've made the decision put it out on all platforms

1445
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:02,720
And then the long pauses

1446
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,768
Terry Bradshaw on the air

1447
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:09,888
So I should tell you the website USA

1448
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,448
And he's all about how

1449
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,008
Checkpoints around the country

1450
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,872
Immigration checkpoints or sobriety checkpoint

1451
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,408
You don't have to talk to those

1452
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,968
You can just go and say like

1453
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:30,368
Have you just keep saying it's all eventually let you go I remember those videos that people used to put up on YouTube

1454
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:37,536
Fourth Amendment is one of the biggest YouTube guys

1455
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:42,144
Neverhood

1456
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:46,496
He was actually even interviewed on episode of This American Life

1457
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:49,056
About his actions

1458
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:05,952
I don't want to get too into his appearance on Alex's

1459
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
To show because

1460
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,768
Like you said I'm not super into

1461
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,096
Checkpoints whatever I think

1462
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,936
Too much whatever

1463
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:18,496
But they're deployed

1464
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
Yeah yeah

1465
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,104
And also

1466
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,640
Here's that he's a sovereign citizen

1467
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,456
But I can't really prove it I can just

1468
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,736
Get some of it

1469
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,528
Gold from his word

1470
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:33,344
Like you guys talked about how were free to travel

1471
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,184
Which is a really big

1472
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,512
He keeps using like really sovereign

1473
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:46,144
Admiralty law

1474
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,448
Dead to rights do that's what you're about

1475
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,264
But it's pretty clear that he's tired of it

1476
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,544
In that in that world

1477
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:57,408
He gets done with his Terry Bressi interview

1478
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,688
Alex

1479
01:22:58,944 --> 01:22:59,456
Going through some

1480
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Okay

1481
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,600
Okay

1482
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:09,440
Continue on here

1483
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
I'm here right now

1484
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
Panda

1485
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,496
Just so sick of the New World Order I'm sick of all the crap

1486
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,080
They are we know what they are we know what has to be done

1487
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:32,224
I just wish people valued how serious and how will this information

1488
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,088
Constantly

1489
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:48,352
It's fun to fight in the feet

1490
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:52,960
Not fun

1491
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
Kind of sounds like how I feel about his presence

1492
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,200
Michelle

1493
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,736
Ouch

1494
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,808
Describing a moment

1495
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
Am I the bad guy here

1496
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,672
No I don't think so

1497
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:14,976
But

1498
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Much like

1499
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:18,560
F******

1500
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:25,216
WCW viewer 1998 New World Order

1501
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:31,616
My dear might be off

1502
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:34,688
Today when they weren't and that is the day we are

1503
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,504
Get it together out

1504
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,784
You're not being threatened

1505
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,392
What do you think

1506
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,184
Maybe some

1507
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,952
Trolling

1508
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,512
I think that makes him like

1509
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
Distribution issues where is

1510
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:54,912
His lawyer is

1511
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,192
Cleared some of the stuff

1512
01:24:56,448 --> 01:25:02,592
I know you have cleared news

1513
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,616
Music orgasm

1514
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:05,920
Got all the signatures

1515
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:09,248
For the interviews or right

1516
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,272
They haven't figured out

1517
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,112
Is this immediately after

1518
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:25,120
But he's kind of

1519
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:32,032
Two trailers coming out

1520
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:36,640
It needs to do that but

1521
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
Establishment

1522
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,648
The FBI is one of dirty tricks in the under the Patriot Act

1523
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:56,864
What's going on

1524
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
What

1525
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:10,688
Which by the way there are congressional

1526
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,712
Hearings

1527
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,904
Architects & Engineers for 9/11 truth next Al-Qaeda training videos

1528
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:25,024
Cyber-security takeovers of the entire web

1529
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,632
Security

1530
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:35,008
They admit northcom in the Pentagon and everything else is for the American people

1531
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,544
So

1532
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:41,152
You know you got this you got this we're the most repressed group

1533
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,688
F*** The Blacklist

1534
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
This is David.

1535
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,016
The Patriots or the one who

1536
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
Sneak-and-peek

1537
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,136
The FBI's up in my s***

1538
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:57,536
But you know what this is this is part of

1539
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,560
Has definitely been a

1540
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,912
In that very clip what you see is

1541
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
The truth and the false.

1542
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,984
About his

1543
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:08,032
Campaign

1544
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,312
Display sort of advertising

1545
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
At the beginning

1546
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,712
Is exactly why he's not

1547
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,528
Launching it as he just screamed on a

1548
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,600
It's because there's a bunch of trailers that he put out

1549
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:26,720
In order to get public-interest right in order for the release to actually work the way he wanted to

1550
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:30,048
Why is the idea that there's enemies

1551
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:34,144
And the FBI with the Patriot Act

1552
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,984
Heather they don't want you to put the information out that I'm about to put out

1553
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:38,752
Right

1554
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,056
No he sounds like a petulant child

1555
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,360
That's the reason

1556
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,688
No I I hear Siri

1557
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:50,528
Pretty well done

1558
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,832
I was like oh it's his dad is because

1559
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,416
There's very much dislike

1560
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,952
I meant America

1561
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,536
Daddy

1562
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:09,472
Developer

1563
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:10,240
Advertising

1564
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,520
Bright

1565
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:18,432
Buckley is giving him some my calm down advice

1566
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:21,504
Probably true

1567
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,296
Psychological but I don't

1568
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,320
For a second that I like

1569
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,368
Is any point during

1570
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
Michelle

1571
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:28,672
Part of the

1572
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Dissipation game

1573
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,000
It also creates

1574
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,560
Dissolution of immediacy

1575
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,120
He's really trying to develop about the movie

1576
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
Like on this episode this might as well be

1577
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,984
Entirely a

1578
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,520
Sort of infomercial

1579
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
For the Obama

1580
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:47,104
Yeah there's a couple of narrative pieces

1581
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
In a couple of interviews

1582
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,688
Call her

1583
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,968
But

1584
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,736
Most

1585
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,040
Easy

1586
01:28:55,552 --> 01:29:00,416
Like going on this Arc of should I release it should I not f*** it I'm going to do it

1587
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
And then

1588
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,976
With never walking it back

1589
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,512
Coming back from break and being like

1590
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,792
It's coming out later

1591
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,096
I need to put some ads out in order to make it

1592
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:10,656
Doing this back-and-forth thing

1593
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:12,448
Highway 2

1594
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,216
Create

1595
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,752
Image that it's a heart

1596
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,544
What it's mean

1597
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,104
He just needs people to think

1598
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:25,248
Because then they'll assume that the globalists are trying to threaten and behind-the-scenes which will bolster

1599
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:31,648
The actual release that makes sense but I also

1600
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:32,928
Fuckingawesome

1601
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
Pretty good

1602
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:40,864
I think he drinks a lot of people so I think that I think

1603
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,192
Pretty clear they because the transparent

1604
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,472
Varices

1605
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
Through

1606
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:55,200
It has ups and downs

1607
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,736
There's just

1608
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,272
He's trying to

1609
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,808
To get the listeners

1610
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,576
Excitement

1611
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,856
And make them

1612
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:02,624
Feel like

1613
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,232
And when I say that I think

1614
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,256
Well done

1615
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,536
I think

1616
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,816
At the moment

1617
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,584
It's well done

1618
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
Yeah even Chuy

1619
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,400
Weeks later this stink

1620
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:15,424
You know like

1621
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,240
Two weeks later if you went back and listen to this

1622
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:24,896
He was clearly f****** around and you already liked

1623
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:27,968
He actually does

1624
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:37,184
I believe so

1625
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
Godwin

1626
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,976
I'm actually confer

1627
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
Alright

1628
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,072
Wild Ann goes back in fur

1629
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,448
Going to an in-depth

1630
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:51,520
Discussion of Final Fantasy

1631
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
T7

1632
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,312
And how it relates to

1633
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:59,456
If you recall president shin

1634
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:00,736
Ufirst disc

1635
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,528
Is of course murder

1636
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,600
Whether or not

1637
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,624
Sephiroth

1638
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,648
Time however

1639
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
Ghost

1640
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:11,232
Is never really address

1641
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,024
Actually died

1642
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,048
Years before this

1643
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:15,072
Question

1644
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
So how is it

1645
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
Saffron

1646
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,424
Essentially forced projector

1647
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,728
Angel place where you can kill somebody

1648
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,544
With a physical Katana that is roughly

1649
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,080
What what is it like

1650
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,616
12 ft long damn

1651
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,664
It's a 12 ft long katana

1652
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,504
You're not answering me

1653
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:34,784
5

1654
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Okay so

1655
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:39,392
We have that and then we have President Rufus who takes over

1656
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:43,232
Now why would the son of the current president

1657
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
Then become president

1658
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,328
Unless we were living in some sort of weird

1659
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,864
Dystopian

1660
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:50,144
Technocratic future

1661
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:56,032
The release date 2009 on pretty much any stores I can find no idea

1662
01:31:57,056 --> 01:32:01,664
It would be exactly the intended to from the gym probably that's

1663
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Yeah

1664
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,320
This is so wild

1665
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,088
Parents

1666
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,880
Clearly showing

1667
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,648
Of

1668
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,208
I'm there's a

1669
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,488
Attacks against me but

1670
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:20,608
He said something

1671
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,656
That if I were Alex Jone

1672
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,704
I would talk about for the next

1673
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,800
Okay fortune favors the Bold

1674
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:36,992
Sick and tired

1675
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:42,368
This was serious

1676
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,696
And all the throngs of soulless minions

1677
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:55,168
My wife

1678
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:04,128
Snooping around trying to shut down doing here

1679
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:14,112
The truth

1680
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,464
Our information is going super

1681
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:28,704
You picked the wrong side of the New World Order

1682
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,008
Justice through courts of law

1683
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,576
I mean yeah

1684
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,344
Sure

1685
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:57,632
The Obama Deception

1686
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,424
You need to see it

1687
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,008
You need to have it you need to get it out to everyone remember

1688
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,544
The enemy is scared of

1689
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,616
Remember the Tony Alamo

1690
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:11,456
Better believe I'm on

1691
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:20,672
And most of all

1692
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,440
I like

1693
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:23,744
Stormy times

1694
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:27,584
If I were someone who had the mentality of Alex Jones

1695
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,632
I would hear the end of that he's like

1696
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,448
He just called himself the ministry of truthettes

1697
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,728
To 1984

1698
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:36,032
He's clearly making it allusion to

1699
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,432
The propaganda Outlet the ministry of propaganda the ministry of truth from 1984

1700
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:48,832
Feelings a method to get to represent

1701
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:52,160
The reference

1702
01:34:55,232 --> 01:35:01,376
He told his audience to the ministry of truth that's externalization of the meth

1703
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,936
You can't blame him for that

1704
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
Scandal

1705
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,472
Right

1706
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:09,056
That's so f****** stupid because when he complains about like

1707
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,152
George h.w. Bush saying New World Order when he's discussing

1708
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,688
Anu

1709
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,480
SeaWorld hours

1710
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,296
New Arrangements in the world

1711
01:35:20,064 --> 01:35:25,184
He just said Infowars of the ministry of Truth

1712
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:29,024
Very specific language

1713
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,608
It's not Irish

1714
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,168
I'm not cuz I understand

1715
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:38,496
Understand

1716
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:41,568
His operation is

1717
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:47,968
Process 888's Leica it's like an animal farm

1718
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,760
Is operation of Dance

1719
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,552
There's no band conversations

1720
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:54,624
In terms of Jason bermas two-leg

1721
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,952
Big bad El say that

1722
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:03,328
So I don't I just I like that because

1723
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
Again

1724
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,680
You can very easily see how like this what you doing is

1725
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,704
Just trying to

1726
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,984
Sell your truck

1727
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,032
Movie doing

1728
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,568
You're doing a play

1729
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,360
Nrt radio

1730
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,128
Peter kind of

1731
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:22,784
Orson Welles would be so proud he would shoot himself and then murdered

1732
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,624
Like I know that recliner.

1733
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,928
You never let anybody else

1734
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:34,048
Is Obama

1735
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:37,376
The ministry of Tourism

1736
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
So

1737
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,616
This is just

1738
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,384
Demonstrate

1739
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
You're f****** stupid

1740
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,808
I meant robot

1741
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:58,368
Stupid it's not like there's any

1742
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,696
There's no further nefarious game other than his

1743
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:05,792
Fleet inability to understand

1744
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,144
Interview with someone who

1745
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:10,912
Took me

1746
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,192
F******

1747
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:12,960
Hours

1748
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,240
To find out

1749
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:16,544
Because his name is Chaz

1750
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:20,384
Chad can't spell that

1751
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:22,688
That's a good

1752
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,992
You spell it

1753
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,784
The French word for house

1754
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,832
Which I also do

1755
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:33,696
Is the beginning of most restaurants

1756
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
The house of blank

1757
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:46,240
Look

1758
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:53,152
People who secretly controlling the world

1759
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,248
Is on the show

1760
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,624
He's on there because he sells an AM transmitter

1761
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,672
I am so Alex

1762
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,280

01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:15,936
You selling

1765
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:18,496
Because the what I was able to find on the way back

1766
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,776
From his website

1767
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,592
Right

1768
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,896
I couldn't find the actual text

1769
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,432
So I don't know which

1770
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
Models

1771
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,736
He was selling

1772
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,528
But like really good

1773
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:33,344
Transmitters are going to run you in the thousands

1774
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,648
14 about

1775
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
$80

1776
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
Used

1777
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,512
Version of it

1778
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,792
108

1779
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,864
So the am transmitter if I

1780
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,680
Are we talkin about like an actual

1781
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,960
Radio transmitter

1782
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,264
Pirate Radio

1783
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,800
That's what I was better.

1784
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:56,128
Yoga just wanted to be sure there

1785
01:38:56,384 --> 01:39:02,272
Which was truth a.m.

1786
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:06,624
Alright I love it

1787
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,440
Alex is trying to get all of his listeners

1788
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,488
To create a Pirate Radio Station

1789
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,096
Play he has evidence of

1790
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:22,496
Most people aren't knocking down your door just indicate your ship

1791
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:28,384
No absolutely not

1792
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,920
It's an interesting thing

1793
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,968
Because if you go to this guy's website

1794
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:33,248
It was

1795
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,784
Truth am.com

1796
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:36,064
It's no longer on the air

1797
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,088
Find on the way back

1798
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,368
What are the things

1799
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
You find is

1800
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,928
Is that like even on his website

1801
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
You got to get this transmitter

1802
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:50,144
You still need to set up if you want to broadcast

1803
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,240
Plug

1804
01:39:56,544 --> 01:40:01,664
Show you could easily play it through but if you wanted to like actually through your own show

1805
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,200
Require

1806
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,480
Bunch of other equipment

1807
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,528
So that

1808
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,552
Whole bunch more

1809
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,832
But it's so fun that you

1810
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,160
You get a glimpse

1811
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,184
To like

1812
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,952
Alright

1813
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:18,560
Alright rocks not knocking down your door to put your radio show on

1814
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,864
I'm going to guess a lot of FM stations are there

1815
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:26,240
AM stations are already playing Rush blind bag

1816
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,480
If your

1817
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,248
Buckingham

1818
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,296
If you're Glenn Beck

1819
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,576
You don't

1820
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:43,904
Half hour of your show talking to a guy who sells a.m.

1821
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:44,928
Transmitters

1822
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
In order for people

1823
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:47,232
Play cure show in

1824
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,072
You have 500 f****** station

1825
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,888
Play in your show in major markets

1826
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,912
So Alec

1827
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:59,520
I think it's pathetic he's not doing well

1828
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:04,384
I do respect the hell out of it I like the hospital

1829
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:05,152
I think

1830
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,176
If he was like

1831
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,480
He was like

1832
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,272
We're not doing great

1833
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,296
The globalist

1834
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:12,832
Don't walk me on station

1835
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
That's the way we're going

1836
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
I respect that

1837
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,512
Presenting it as like

1838
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
Atossa side

1839
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,400
Right audience

1840
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:28,960
Be the radio station for him

1841
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:29,728
Yeah

1842
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:35,104
You're so f******

1843
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,152
You know any time

1844
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:40,736
Could all go away

1845
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,808
Chess

1846
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,160
Chess

1847
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,696
Very long

1848
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:50,976
It's

1849
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:52,000
PSG

1850
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,048
10

1851
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
I think it is

1852
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,632
You could throw a z on their butt

1853
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,656
I think Chaz

1854
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:03,264
What's the one word the couch but it's also a

1855
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,800
Are you sure it's not a shady

1856
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:05,824
Games

1857
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:06,848
I don't know

1858
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:11,200
I've got nothing more to say

1859
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:12,736
So

1860
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:14,784
5th next to this court

1861
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:15,808
Is the beginning

1862
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,624
Chaz

1863
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:27,072
Wavy

1864
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:28,864
Interview

1865
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:29,888
Helen

1866
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:48,832
It sure has been a thanks for having me on there like the other side of the lake from you of there in Dallas

1867
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,904
It's not a paid interview

1868
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,696
The reason for that

1869
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:56,256
Sing to me is because why would you bring it up

1870
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
If your other interview

1871
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,888
I'm not sure what this means I have no idea

1872
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,704
Guyon

1873
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,568
It does lead me to believe that a lot of

1874
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,384
Force

1875
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
Conversion

1876
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:13,920
Informaron

1877
01:43:14,176 --> 01:43:14,944
I'm not entirely sure

1878
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,040
This isn't my only complaint with Chaz

1879
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:20,832
Kane the other one is

1880
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:28,512
That red Beckman interview you had a while back it got me to get his book the walls are mines and tell the difference between

1881
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:32,096
Politicians and Statesmen I decided you know I want to be a Spaceman

1882
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,656
And that's why I did this so

1883
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:39,776
The information from that in your Waco video most people Bobby

1884
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,312
Haven't seen that one

1885
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:44,128
But it does show at one man can do and it

1886
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,920
Taught me that we

1887
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:48,736
I was involved in the neocon side I was

1888
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,528
That happened

1889
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,904
And I finally woke up to and I said if anything's possible

1890
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,280
I was actually going to Trump University

1891
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,840
All I thought was a vacant do Waco they can

1892
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
Do anything

1893
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,912
Reach for the Stars

1894
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:09,472
If they can do we can do anything

1895
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:17,152
The other problem that I have there is that red Beckman is the one who woke him up

1896
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,432
Text protesters we talked

1897
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:21,760
What about you

1898
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:27,136
Because the Jews worship

1899
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:31,488
Look we've had a holocaust denier we've had a holocaust

1900
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
Apologist

1901
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,608
Thank you understand

1902
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:39,936
Makes this so difficult

1903
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,752
Who is recommending Holocaust

1904
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:45,312
Denier people be promoted on his phone

1905
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,336
Being

1906
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,104
Good is

1907
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Jarring

1908
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,152
To some extent

1909
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:52,736
And then you get a little bit later in the show in this chair and is saying

1910
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:57,344
I got woken up by your interview with red Beckman someone who believes that the Holocaust was

1911
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,672
Deserve cuz Jews are upset like that

1912
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:07,328
Deny the Holocaust was one of our greatest achievements that's f****** hard to Russell

1913
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:11,680
Content

1914
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,704
People read Beckman

1915
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:14,752
He loves me

1916
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,872
He doesn't deal with it

1917
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,688
Cool let's just pretend

1918
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,736
I miss guy reads

1919
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:26,016
Books to get to work

1920
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,088
That's not in some of those other books weight

1921
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,392
Wasn't a denier

1922
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,440
He was a supporter

1923
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,376
Against

1924
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:45,216
Denier and love the guy who the Holocaust

1925
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,264
Answer at the end

1926
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:50,592
Guy was saying

1927
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,944
Alex is responsible

1928
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
I don't want

1929
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,248
Beloved

1930
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:58,784
Dick's like you

1931
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,552
I'm against

1932
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,344
Israel but I hate people who hate

1933
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Hate Jews

1934
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,904
So even his response

1935
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,928
Should be like

1936
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,208
Hey man

1937
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,744
What about red Beckham

1938
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:08,768
Now.

1939
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
You start to see this

1940
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:12,096
Difference

1941
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,144
Like

1942
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,936
Who is to toxic

1943
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:18,496
Red Beckman is somehow like

1944
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,288
Plausibly like

1945
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,824
Is really just a

1946
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:28,480
He's concerned about the legality of taxes

1947
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:38,976
Or something like that how it's going like he can sort of hide because he was working

1948
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:43,840
Quirky is hell

1949
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,400
Is it okay

1950
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:49,216
For number years he was there

1951
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:52,032
Because it wasn't a scape Escape

1952
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
Varied if

1953
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:57,920
Distinction

1954
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:58,688
Alex Rashid

1955
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,224
And this is

1956
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:02,272
Part of why in present day

1957
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
He refused

1958
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,392
Turtles of adhere

1959
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
But it's

1960
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:12,768
This bringing up of red Beckman never gets into

1961
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,048
He is

1962
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
I don't know it's just

1963
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Wildside

1964
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:25,824
Yeah

1965
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Yeah

1966
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:30,688
Alex Telles

1967
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:45,792
Grace of God

1968
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:52,192
We have told the truth the whole truth and nothing but that truth

1969
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:58,592
The brother luck

1970
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,928
I smell victory

1971
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:15,744
Just release

1972
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
The f****** thing

1973
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,048
If that's all

1974
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,096
Victory

1975
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,376
Just do it

1976
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:25,728
He already said earlier we need to

1977
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,520
Come out in order to get interest

1978
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,800
Bubbling yeah

1979
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,920
Please self contradictory ideas

1980
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,712
To say that releasing this

1981
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:40,832
Will be the death blow to the New World Order

1982
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:42,368
To hold on to it

1983
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:43,392
Buzz

1984
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,672
Like that

1985
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:52,864
Apparently

1986
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:59,264
Impossible to reconcile the bugs

1987
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:03,104
Second war might be a part of

1988
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:05,920
You know you lie

1989
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,480
So now.

1990
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:10,528
Chuck

1991
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,088
Hurt Alex

1992
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,624
A lot on the show

1993
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:15,904
Do karaoke

1994
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:19,744
We've heard him sing

1995
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,072
Talk right

1996
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:27,168
Is range

1997
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,192
Is eBay

1998
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:30,496
Better like I don't even really know

1999
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,776
Is perfect pitch

2000
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,568
Little higher than you'd expect

2001
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,176
Now we've heard him sing along with song

2002
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:46,368
No we've heard him

2003
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:56,096
Move bit get out the way the Ludacris song

2004
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:02,496
Oh s*** I remember how great that was

2005
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,288
Here is Alex

2006
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,360
The hottest 16 bars

2007
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,384
On the street

2008
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:21,952
Over there

2009
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:27,072
Control

2010
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:33,472
Hot 16 bars just him just him sings dumb

2011
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:34,496
Instead of Summer

2012
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:35,264
Infuriates

2013
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:36,544
Somehow

2014
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:52,416
Like that song

2015
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:56,256
Just saying things that are about

2016
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:59,584
To be sad about

2017
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:00,864
Slightly off

2018
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:04,960
That run that song

2019
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,240
So much more races

2020
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,288
It's so weird

2021
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,640
Content

2022
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:14,176
Perhaps

2023
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,480
You dropped this

2024
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:19,296
He's talkin to Webster

2025
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,256
Who cares this interview isn't that crazy mostly wants

2026
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,536
Talk about how like there

2027
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:30,560
Obama's ill

2028
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:33,120
Popping up like Hoovervilles

2029
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:37,984
Right

2030
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,008
But these aren't

2031
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,336
Zorbing

2032
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,040
But then also Obama in office for Zion a month

2033
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,064
At this point

2034
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,904
Going to do that dance

2035
01:51:56,160 --> 01:52:02,304
You remember how Hoovervilles popped up immediately went to Hoover became president

2036
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,072
That was already

2037
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,888
Demolished

2038
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,448
Webster actually

2039
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,008
So I don't want a clown on him

2040
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,568
Hear it

2041
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:14,848
Terrible poem

2042
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:18,176
Tarp

2043
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:21,248
Are you sure he's not a character in a children's

2044
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,040
Detective novel I'm positive about

2045
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:32,768
Obama's approval rating

2046
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:39,424
The first couple hundred days

2047
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,192
Patient

2048
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:42,752
A couple hundred days were still in March

2049
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:44,800
March 10th

2050
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,568
Right now

2051
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,640
Videos

2052
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,408
The election

2053
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:53,760
Inauguration

2054
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,040
President

2055
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,088
Yeah somehow I feel like that

2056
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:05,280
Months and the two weeks of the week so Alex is it Obama's approval rating

2057
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,328
50

2058
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:11,680
According to Gallup cuz they keep track of all this

2059
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:13,728
Google it

2060
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:17,312
This is only true if you only factor in Republican

2061
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,616
41% of Republicans

2062
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,408
Approve of Obama on inauguration

2063
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:22,688
Supposed to

2064
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,968
6% on March

2065
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,504
1009

2066
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,784
So that took drop off

2067
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,576
15%

2068
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,624
Do 41% of

2069
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,464
15%

2070
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
Hiding

2071
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,840
The fact that they don't like that it's

2072
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608
Black

2073
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:45,984
For that day or maybe so that they will feel better about themselves for not being

2074
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:47,264
Voting for a

2075
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:49,312
I mean who knows what the reason is

2076
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,360
50% of

2077
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,128
Publican

2078
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:52,896
The drop

2079
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,920
Inauguration

2080
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:56,992
10-day overall approval rate

2081
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:59,552
It's not really all that important because now it doesn't matter

2082
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:01,600
Talkin about the time frame of the

2083
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,368
This drop

2084
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
He's imagine

2085
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:06,208
Obama's

2086
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:08,000
Numbers are down 15

2087
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:08,768
20%

2088
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,792
20%

2089
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:10,560
15

2090
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
To look at it

2091
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
Just embellished

2092
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,376
That part

2093
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:15,680
You wouldn't think that the

2094
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:16,448
Time frame

2095
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,240
He's talking about it

2096
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,264
Unless

2097
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:22,592
But that is the only

2098
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:23,616
Metric

2099
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,896
That actually matches the

2100
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,944
It comes from

2101
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:27,968
Inauguration

2102
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,648
Look at approval rating

2103
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:36,672
Democrats

2104
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,232
Inauguration day was 88

2105
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,072
Among Democrat

2106
01:54:44,096 --> 01:54:46,144
Fungus among independents

2107
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,448
Gross lower number

2108
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,800
So all of it

2109
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,848
No matter what if Democrat

2110
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,432
Republicans went down

2111
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,224
And Independence

2112
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,296
You're the only have a drop of like

2113
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,576
In the gross

2114
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,136
Yes

2115
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:07,904
Yeah that's

2116
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,208
Whitlock

2117
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:10,976
Really

2118
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,000
Is

2119
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,280
Because I

2120
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:15,840
Cow Trump

2121
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:17,376
And he's rambling Prescott

2122
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,680
Dude I don't even want to

2123
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,984
He repeat what a f****** was going to say

2124
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,264
2% of the females

2125
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,080
Figure he's just a

2126
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,360
White women

2127
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:28,384
That he got

2128
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:34,528
How did women of non-white persuasion

2129
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,344
I don't think this warped uses

2130
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,112
Fisticuffs

2131
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,904
People like

2132
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:41,696
Do not think

2133
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,464
Is there

2134
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,256
They just don't

2135
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,280
Consider the people on

2136
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,048
Unlike themselves

2137
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:49,120
Okay

2138
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:49,888
Percent of the

2139
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,912
Females vote

2140
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,448
He's using the

2141
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,728
Statistic of white women

2142
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,520
Because that's all he cares about

2143
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,824
Yeah

2144
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,872
Obama's numbers went down

2145
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:00,896
Percent

2146
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,664
He's pretty

2147
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,432
Pretending it's

2148
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:03,968
Among everybody

2149
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,344
Right

2150
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:12,672
He doesn't even think the rest of the world is relevant to the conversation

2151
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,232
Consciously or unconsciously

2152
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
Exactly

2153
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,888
Do you make an absolutely perfect point

2154
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:24,960
Regardless of whether or not they're thinking about it that way

2155
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,496
That's exactly what they're

2156
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:29,056
F****** cute

2157
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:29,824
Problem

2158
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,128
Jordan

2159
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:33,152
We

2160
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,432
What are the

2161
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,200
Been trying to look at

2162
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:37,760
He's primarily

2163
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
Alex Jones

2164
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,552
Journey

2165
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:40,832
George Soros

2166
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:44,160
And so far the only thing that we found

2167
01:56:44,672 --> 01:56:46,464
Is Alec doesn't know

2168
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,232
Cirrhosis

2169
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,000
A very long time

2170
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:50,816
Then he's brought up by bobcat

2171
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
Equipped

2172
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:53,888
From Davos

2173
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:55,680
Talking about

2174
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,472
Ramification

2175
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,008
Price of oil

2176
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:01,568
Believe this

2177
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:02,592
For no reason

2178
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,664
George Soros

2179
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,688
Bidding

2180
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:10,272
Oil in order to attack Russia

2181
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:11,296
Swayla

2182
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
The Daleks

2183
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,672
But also that wasn't anything.

2184
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,976
In Radcliff

2185
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:19,744
Been over that

2186
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,768
So now

2187
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,304
Howard Springs

2188
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:23,328
That backup

2189
01:57:23,584 --> 01:57:24,096
With Webster

2190
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,680
Not going to get over his

2191
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,984
I understand

2192
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,824
Based on the fact

2193
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:35,616
These episodes

2194
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:36,896
The only thing I

2195
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:37,920
Everest

2196
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Really about

2197
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
Is in reference

2198
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,808
Again he brings Soros

2199
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:52,000
George Soros

2200
01:57:57,120 --> 01:57:58,144
The world depression

2201
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:02,240
I'm sure that that he would he would say that

2202
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:04,800
That's not

2203
01:58:05,824 --> 01:58:06,336
This is

2204
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,872
I don't want to

2205
01:58:08,128 --> 01:58:09,152
Goger ballsagna

2206
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,456
But this is the Big Lot

2207
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:12,736
This is the

2208
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:14,528
Strategy of the Big Lot

2209
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:17,344
He's played the clip on the show before

2210
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,112
And we've heard it

2211
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,136
If you understand

2212
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:22,720
Soros's not anyways

2213
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,536
We did this

2214
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,400
He's only staying here or there is

2215
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
The effect

2216
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,448
Summer

2217
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
About the fact

2218
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:36,544
Right that the price of oil has lower

2219
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,824
Brett Alex

2220
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,360
Constantly repeating

2221
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:41,152
Soros admits

2222
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,688
But you lower the price of gas

2223
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,480
Russia

2224
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:45,760
Venezuela

2225
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:50,112
That is the strategy of the big lie

2226
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136
Because eventually

2227
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,464
He didn't play the clip on this show

2228
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,000
He hasn't played it since

2229
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,024
The last time we

2230
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,328
He's going to let that

2231
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:01,632
Of the clip

2232
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:02,400
I think he's going

2233
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:03,168
Bill.

2234
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:03,936
That later

2235
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:05,472
In the same way that he

2236
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:06,752
He does in 28

2237
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:07,520
With

2238
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,288
He's a Nazi

2239
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,336
Yeah that's

2240
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,360
His big lie in the

2241
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,408
This is a small

2242
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,992
If you repeat it long enough

2243
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:18,016
And loud enough

2244
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,296
People believe

2245
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:23,648
Webster Tarpley

2246
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:26,208
He says I believe he would say

2247
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:34,144
The day of letting go

2248
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:37,984
All Webster Tarpley knows about his words and

2249
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:39,264
Protecting yourself against rain

2250
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
That's all he knows

2251
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:42,080
Spider

2252
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:55,648
How do you feel about that do you want to give yourself a might as well for that one

2253
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,440
Feel like it's like

2254
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:02,304
Alright we'll call it a push that.

2255
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:07,936
Next one

2256
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,960
Alex going to train

2257
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:17,920
I wouldn't tell everybody out there listening that we may launch The Obama Deception early today or tomorrow

2258
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:23,040
Prisonplanet.tv

2259
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:25,856
Youth keeps changing the goalposts

2260
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
AR

2261
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:30,208
I mean we're over this week talks about there's a f****** hungry

2262
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:32,256
Timezone this episode already

2263
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,608
Heath

2264
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:38,912
Maybe Friday

2265
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:41,472
So when is it

2266
02:00:43,776 --> 02:00:44,288
Like this

2267
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,360
You know that's being tired

2268
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,176
I believe that

2269
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:53,760
Man I don't know he's so

2270
02:00:54,016 --> 02:01:00,160
Especially during this time. There's a part of me that is willing to be convinced by

2271
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:03,232
Absolute commitment

2272
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:05,792
You know what I mean yeah I understand

2273
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:09,632
Especially with this kind of situation is that

2274
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:12,960
There's no transparent b******* because it does

2275
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:17,312
Seem like there's an actual internal struggle going on between him

2276
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:20,128
I'd like anyssa taste like good and evil like

2277
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:22,432
Want to release it now

2278
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:24,992
Money

2279
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,272
I'll release

2280
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:27,808
Later and I'll sell it like that

2281
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:29,088
But I'm a good

2282
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,136
Cats

2283
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:33,184
New World Order

2284
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:36,000
That and I like that kind of

2285
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,816
Angle I hadn't

2286
02:01:39,328 --> 02:01:39,840
Considered

2287
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,632
Mostly because

2288
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:43,424
Probably

2289
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:45,984
Yaya

2290
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,520
You would make the movie

2291
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:49,824
If you had some sort of like good angel

2292
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:53,664
Only the possibility of

2293
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:54,688
To Demons on his

2294
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:56,992
And shoulders

2295
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:04,928
Self-sabotaging self-interested

2296
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:09,024
You have principles I want money

2297
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,120
That dichotomy is

2298
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:14,912
Ludacris

2299
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:19,264
Could be like

2300
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,312
You make money more by waiting

2301
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:23,872
You make more money by jumping on people

2302
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:26,432
Iraq

2303
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:30,784
Strategies

2304
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:37,440
I believe that that's possible

2305
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:40,768
Mortgage

2306
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:45,632
Now but one day it'll be an hour

2307
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:47,680
Uno's

2308
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:50,496
So you like to make fun of Webster Tarpley

2309
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:55,616
And I understand why

2310
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,408
Funny name

2311
02:02:59,456 --> 02:02:59,968
Weird

2312
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,040
Someone who helps

2313
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:05,088
And stay dry

2314
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,648
Tarpley

2315
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:10,208
Carries the characteristics of a tarp

2316
02:03:10,464 --> 02:03:12,000
What reflective tarp

2317
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,584
I think that most of his

2318
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,120
Interviews pretty terrible

2319
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,936
Is wack as hell

2320
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,960
But

2321
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,776
About

2322
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:24,800
The

2323
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,080
Financial crisis

2324
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,360
Is on America

2325
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:28,896
Webster has

2326
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,736
They are anathema

2327
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,272
To Alex's world

2328
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:35,552
Alex

2329
02:03:35,808 --> 02:03:36,832
Not push back on

2330
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:37,856
Either of them

2331
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,392
And I kind of

2332
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,672
Agree with Webster talk

2333
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:48,352
I got a lot of people are looking at apocalyptic scenarios right that it's going to come to some kind of civil strife

2334
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:51,680
I don't think we're there yet I think it's time to try politics

2335
02:03:55,264 --> 02:03:58,080
You got to have your own program to get out of the depression

2336
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:00,384
I have one light White.

2337
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:03,200
Thesis and issue 0 credit production

2338
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:09,600
Credit for production have emergency Federal Leaf relief and set up a new world monetary system full points

2339
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:12,160
You get out of the depression that's the big prize

2340
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,232
He said at the end

2341
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:18,560
Set up a new world monetary system

2342
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:24,960
How can Alex let someone say that on his f****** show

2343
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,240
No it's

2344
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:30,592
He's talkin about government regulation

2345
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:31,872
William

2346
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:34,944
He's not the way to get out of a depression

2347
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:37,760
Who does that

2348
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:44,160
Federal government

2349
02:04:45,952 --> 02:04:48,256
Zero interest money

2350
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,280
Got to come from

2351
02:04:49,536 --> 02:04:50,048
Somewhere.

2352
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:56,704
Push towards the people

2353
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:58,240
Alex would f****** hate

2354
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,568
Anu

2355
02:05:01,824 --> 02:05:02,336
World

2356
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,616
Cancel order

2357
02:05:05,152 --> 02:05:05,920
April system

2358
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
Monetary

2359
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:07,712
Monetary

2360
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:10,016
Webster

2361
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
To be saying things

2362
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:12,832
Did Alex

2363
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,600
Nada

2364
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,648
Because he

2365
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,928
He's already built him up

2366
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:17,696
As like

2367
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,720
A credible source

2368
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:21,280
He can't push back on him legit

2369
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,048
New world

2370
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,584
Monetary system

2371
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,144
That's crazy

2372
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,680
That's crazy

2373
02:05:27,936 --> 02:05:30,240
Elizabeth is next

2374
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:31,264
Get put in your ear

2375
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:33,568
But you you don't get out of

2376
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:39,968
The depression unless you make these changes there is no automatic exit from the depression there is no business

2377
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:46,368
Michael it's going to lick you out of the depression and I'm also afraid there is no free market solution to the depression

2378
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,952
If you call for the free market under these circumstances basically

2379
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:52,512
Making everything that much worse

2380
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:56,608
I think about food stamps right there 3 million people in Texas

2381
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:57,888
Living thanks

2382
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:03,264
The food stamp benefits a free-market take that away well

2383
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:06,848
I think that the question is how long will it take for people

2384
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:13,248
To throw off the chains of ideologies and all the Illusions and all the claptrap of the past 40 years

2385
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,368
Against All Odds

2386
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:20,416
Don't make it.

2387
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:22,976
Dunks a basketball card

2388
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:26,816
I mean they Webster Tarpley should not be allowed to dunk a basketball

2389
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,096
I don't know

2390
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:30,912
I don't know enough Manning play basketball

2391
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:34,496
I've heard a number of like appearances by

2392
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:44,736
I don't believe your sources I don't care about what you're talking about this is interesting Larry Nichols

2393
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:46,016
Or something

2394
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:49,344
I swear it's like

2395
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,136
The idea

2396
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,416
You have someone on

2397
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:53,184
Who's

2398
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:53,952
Expert

2399
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
Who's playing

2400
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:56,512
First of all

2401
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,048
New world

2402
02:06:58,816 --> 02:06:59,840
Siri Siri

2403
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,400
Advocating

2404
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,168
For social

2405
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:03,936
Benefit

2406
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:10,080
A government intervention is no

2407
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:10,848
Free market

2408
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:15,456
To the financial crisis resolved

2409
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:16,736
And staying

2410
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:18,528
Earlier

2411
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,112
Regulation

2412
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:25,952
Got to get rid of these derivatives

2413
02:07:26,208 --> 02:07:29,792
How the market can operate for big

2414
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,864
Monetary system

2415
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,632
Global

2416
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:36,704
Government

2417
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
Here's what

2418
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:40,544
The most amazing social safety

2419
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,080
What's most amazing

2420
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:45,408
Alex doesn't fight back at all

2421
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:47,200
What Webster Tarpley

2422
02:07:47,456 --> 02:07:48,480
Just

2423
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:54,880
I can't believe I'm saying that name and it serious

2424
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:57,952
The ACT

2425
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,488
Actual stimulus package

2426
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:00,768
F****** dip

2427
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:03,840
Yeah far to the left of the f****** bailout

2428
02:08:04,096 --> 02:08:06,400
What he is saying is literally

2429
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:08,704
We need to keep the bags

2430
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:15,104
From being allowed to operate the way that they are as opposed to giving them a loud

2431
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:25,600
Far to the left of the liberal President we ostensibly I apologize

2432
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:30,720
Tyrannical Overlord we ostensibly elected in 2008

2433
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,816
Josie Joe

2434
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,608
Events

2435

Jordans

2436
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:01,184
Webster Tarpley Auto Show

2437
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:02,720
It's almost like

2438
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:03,744
We said it three times

2439
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:09,888
Did Bewitched

2440
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:12,448
We have one more clip

2441
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:13,984
What do you know

2442
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
Kind of salad

2443
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:23,200
You're the worst

2444
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:45,472
That that

2445
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,240
5:30

2446
02:09:47,008 --> 02:09:48,544
Adjust articulated

2447
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:49,312
Exactly

2448
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:56,224
It's coming hell or high water is coming eventually they are also I fucken want to get those

2449
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:00,576
