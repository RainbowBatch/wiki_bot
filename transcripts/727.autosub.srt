1
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by now I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

3
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
Acknowledge

4
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,792
Sit around worship at the altar of sleep a little bit of

5
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,376
What's Alex

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,168
Jordan

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,192
What's up

8
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,520
Jordan

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:21,664
I will I will tell you my bright spot then

10
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,992
My bright spot is there's this TV show

11
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,088
Amazon company that I despise

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368
Spent

13
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
More money than is ever been necessary to make this show about the Lord of the Ring Spud

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,816
I'll be goddamned if it's not f****** great

15
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:44,704
I would prefer they'd spent some of that money elsewhere but guess what it's a great show I love elves

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
My lover

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
I've seen a lot of

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,568
I've seen a lot of mixed

19
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Opinions about

20
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,640
You know it's weird

21
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
About what's happening it's like when you know what's going on in the original trilogy movies you know you're like okay that's a nerd

22
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
Things to know when you're like looking at your wife going like all these are the men of numenor all right you don't even know

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
What can I come next after about

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,048
2000 year like okay maybe I do that

25
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:15,424
I need to stop I'm not going to I'm reciting the silmarillion to her every night whenever we watch

26
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Terrible but it

27
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:19,008
It's great show

28
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,384
How about you buddy

29
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,712
I don't trying to think

30
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,528
Probably doing these days back-to-back

31
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,880
Yeah I guess I'm playing a fun game

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
I've

33
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
Valkyria Chronicles

34
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Nothing

35
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
Esquire

36
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
Scratch the itch

37
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
Of three houses

38
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
That was just

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
It's like right in the pocket

40
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,480
Spot I like to enjoy a little bit of this turn-based game

41
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
I think I think that Vibe is

42
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
Something I never played growing up here obviously

43
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Most of my game

44
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
Video game stuff that I played

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,464
Growing upward Nintendo

46
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
And non-violent

47
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
At all

48
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Those were

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
Verboten

50
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,704
And the only way we got video games was that my grandma like

51
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Nintendo's

52
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
Answer whenever a new system would come out

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
Did you give us her old one

54
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
Nice and so we would play like Nintendo but late

55
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Grandma gamer is a

56
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,992
Great I didn't have one of those grown-ups

57
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,784
Interesting I was pretty pretty cool

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
Play Mario playlist

59
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,136
Peacock country

60
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,928
My model

61
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:45,280
There were

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Turn-based games

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,072
And stuff

64
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,376
Never really was in my my view

65
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
I think we're older now we like those games that don't have as much action

66
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,056
On with your

67
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Writing this right noceros

68
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,128

71
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Next time I'm not

72
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
Not doing it geometric fashion at my pace

73
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
It's fine

74
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
I'm enjoying it

75
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Jordan do we have fun enjoy as well

76
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
Sebastian Murdoch

77
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,103
Huffington Post

78
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,663

He was for the home

80
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
I was also there in Austin

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
It was just nice to have a chat about the

82
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,439
The differences between the two trials and just go to the

83
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,463
Experience so

84
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
Fantastic time we were going to have them on when we were in Austin and I believe I rambled about that

85
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,031
It's great to finally have them on I'm I'm glad that we got to make sure

86
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:05,919
So we'll get tonight here in a minute but first I wanted to bestow a raptor Princess ship

87
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Somebody

88
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
And that is the

89
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
To put out the email for the butt

90
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Last over the email address

91
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
I'm so people didn't know if it was

92
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:21,535
Plural or not okay

93
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,375
Did they email address that was the non plural version

94
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,471
Real danger people sending emails to this with their addresses

95
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,287
5

96
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,359
Got that email address to protect people

97
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,479
From sending her address to somewhere else

98
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
Cool and appreciate it so much

I feel

147
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
So self-conscious about that introduction

148
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,007
I'm saying that there was quite a bit of fanfare

149
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:46,687
Come from the school of beat like stand-up introductions

150
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967

170
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,159
Watching

Out of them

00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:39,423
Cathartic on some level or absolutely it's really the only two good things though the rest of it is a slug

00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Bulshit

Yeah so much

212
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:57,503
I find that myself even like as we do a Podcast Addict ate it to him like there's still time zones

213
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
I'm going to punch on this

214
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,183
It's kind of a self-care thing to you know weeds

215
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,535
Sure I mean unfortunately both of you got really good at a job nobody else wants to

216
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
To do so

217
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
Then he's like well hey guess what

218
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,631
You guys did it

Cursive like may you get what you want.

220
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
Make yourself indispensable

221
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
Smart move

222
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
But I do I do want to stress

223
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,431
I do like your

224
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
It's not like

225
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,063
You only write stories about Alex I was looking over like your bylines

226
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
You're all over the place writing about all time

227
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
Stop

228
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:40,255
I'm primarily a breaking news reporter so yeah I cover

229
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Politics

230
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Mass shootings that we have and

231
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,215
Yeah yeah dude Nene cobra

232
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,359
But yeah sometimes investigative stuff too but the Alex Jones saying I've been

233
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,175
In in one way or another reporting on

234
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,223
Definition lawsuits

235
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
28

236
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,807
$40 bill

237
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
And now I'm

238
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
I was actually talking

239
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,903
Attorney Mark Bang

240
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,463
Do I know all the walks out they're very familiar with

241
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:13,023
They're concerned

242
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
But you know it

243
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
It's

244
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Interesting

245
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,215
Need to finally

246
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:21,983
Jeffy

247
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
4 years of of not

248
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Reporting but of this

249
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,639
Process and now we're finally in not even at the

250
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
The first

251
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
Trial now and then there's going to be a third on the way and a

252
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
It sort of feels like

253
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
I don't know if I

254
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
I call it the payoff but

255
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,111
It's all sort of color

256
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Into

257
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
We're getting toward the client

258
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Max here it does feel like

259
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
Things are speeding up

260
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,327
Toure what's that first trial hit now it's starting to feel like always

261
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
It's the next one's right around the corner

262
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,423
This one's going to be you know it's safe

263
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:55,263
The function of like the delay in garelick it's

264
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,287
Just the ball is Ben

265
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,823
Kick down the road so far they like

266
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,431
Like a lot of this would be the kind of pace things would have gone if I'd been stalling

267
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Involved exactly

268
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
What's it been like

269
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,903
Being in the like when we were in the Austin Courthouse you know there's a lot that you see and kind kind

270
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
I have noticed that you don't

271
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,207
Don't just by looking through the

272
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Mystery Mike

273
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
You've been in the courthouse be the entire time right

274
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,839
Yeah that's right

275
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,119
I I think

276
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,959
What's what's very different about this trial

277
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
Is that

278
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,495
In some ways

279
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Somehow even more so

280
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,799
Sabrina.

281
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:31,103
Listen to say that the Austin Trail wasn't but

282
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,639
Here we are in

283
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
Connecticut

284
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
The state where it happened

285
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
And there are

286
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,247
You know so many

287
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
So many plaintiff so

288
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
The family members are there

289
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
And that bad I think it's been

290
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,999
You know incredibly impactful and

291
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Can you use two

292
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:53,119
Just sort of highlight you know because for all the sort of laugh

293
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:56,447
That we all do it Alex and of course you guys know this like

294
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,471
This is

295
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
About what

296
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
He did

297
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Didn't need parents and soda

298
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
To have them there you know

299
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
It's a humbling

300
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Experience and it's also a

301
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Incredibly

302
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
In a lot of ways

303
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,015
I found that to be

304
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Incredibly palpable

305
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,599
It is not in Austin

306
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
There was a moment I'm just watching the Stream

307
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Of this

308
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Sky Connecticut

309
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
CaseNet

310
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
I thought

311
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,351
That for sure there's no way I could have handled being there for it

312
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
And that was when Norm

313
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Not patties

314
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,191
Was giving his

315
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,471
Is opening

316
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
State map

317
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
And

318
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
Yee

319
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Sort of did a

320
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
An act out

321
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
Of Alex

322
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
By being like

323
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Alright I killed the kids

324
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,479
I killed all the kids

325
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,247
Antioch

326
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,807
The recognition that these parents worth

327
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
They are and that Norm would bring himself to do that

328
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,159
Like I do

329
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
Not that I would freak out and jump him or something

330
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,535
But like I don't know how I could emotionally handle

331
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
Being

332
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
It was

333
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Or even on just a stream

334
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
Yeah I mean it's sad

335
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
It's a level of of

336
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:04,799
Respect right honey we also see it by the fact that Alex

337
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,823
Can't even show up

338
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
For these opening statement

339
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,151
He's going to show up when it when he has to test

340
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Dubai

341
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
But it's

342
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
You know and and

343
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,807
Jordan you what you had talked about this a lot when we are in Austin but

344
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
The idea that

345
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,111
Yeah there

346
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Have been a lot of news media that were

347
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
Reporting eyeball Alex Jones says

348
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,487
He's sorry he regrets

349
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
And we know that

350
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,535
That's bulshit

351
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
Because again he's not showing up

352
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
To the trial at all

353
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,911
He's on Infowars talkin about

354
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
Kangaroo court and then like you're saying Daniel

355
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
It's up there and he starts

356
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
Doing that that mimicry in front of the parent

357
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,895
Whose kids were killed

358
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:47,807
Yeah and I also know I'm saying that their argument is that they're exaggerating their trauma

359
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:52,415
Yeah well well Norm also fell asleep in the courtroom so he was also

360
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Nodding off

361
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:57,279
Yeah heat that's what you were saying that like something

362
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,351
What's different about this from the Austin

363
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
I have to imagine that just

364
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,191
The existence of norm pattis

365
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,727
Makes this

366
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Feel entirely different

367
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
Yeah you know what

368
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,615
What kind of surreal though is

369
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
I still can't see

370
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,175
Figure out who the worst lawyer is

371
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,479
If it's going to be bad if

372
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,551
We've we had some disagreement over this ourselves

373
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:24,159
Genuinely think that Norm for what he's doing is doing about as good as he

374
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:24,927
We could possibly do

375
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:31,583
I mean falling asleep in the trial.

376
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,983
Power nap

377
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,823
I made that point on the Infowars even he was saying

378
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,895
This is how you deal with a rogue judge or whatever

379
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
Been like that is obviously not the

380
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
The case then.

381
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,271
Situation but what Norm is doing is

382
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
The only thing they can do which is throw bombs

383
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Basically

384
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,415
Yeah exactly swing bud and hope that

385
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
You know Daddy Alex

386
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Backing off

387
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Yeah where is reynald seems like

388
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,399
Maybe I can win this thing and then what happened

389
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
I do find it interesting

390
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Because

391
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,359
It does feel a little bit like Norm saw the first trial and rain all went with his life

392
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:16,639
Halfway up

393
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,223
Using halfway trying to slimeball evil into places

394
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,527
And then he was like well that lost

395
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:27,647
So f*** it I'm just going to try and swing as much s*** as I can and maybe it'll lower the judge

396
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
Oobi like I guess they are exaggerating iyl

397
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,047
Or maybe maybe you can make such

398
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
A problem that

399
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
The jury trial

400
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
We're looking at 4 I guess

401
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
3 weeks

402
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:49,151
At this point now so it's going to be a long trial.

403
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Only two

404
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,735
Plenty of time

405
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
To do something

406
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,367
I feel like I heard them

407
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
Some say that they had agreed that it might be a shorter

408
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
Her trial then

409
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Okay well I

410
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
I bet everyone would love that if

411
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Ends up being the case

412
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
I feel like that was something that I might have heard whispered in a sidebar

413
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:16,287
But I'm not entirely sure if you listen to the

414
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
Pause

415
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,383
Just watching her constantly be like

416
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:26,271
Now I'm pretty sure we've never heard of Google Analytics

417
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
Take me to the head of Google about Google Analytics

418
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,647
Pretty sure we never heard of it like

419
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,743
You have 3 days of Brittany pozzi I don't know I don't remember

420
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
That was going to be there Stratus

421
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,607
Intuit

422
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:46,751
Here is proof that the business uses excuse still argue the business doesn't use x

423
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:51,359
The trial should be sure

424
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,687
Yeah less of that beat

425
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
You don't like

426
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,551
You beat her if you beat her over the head with how she's obviously lying

427
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,575
Often up the

428
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,343
The first try

429
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,207
Then you can use that as a shorthand does the court goes on your like oh well I don't have to

430
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,999
To prove this to you remember pause

431
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
This is that

432
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Situation again

433
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:16,703
Pizza it seems like Alex is going to be there we recording this on Monday but it seems like he's going to

434
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
To be there

435
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
Tomorrow

436
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,359
So we're putting this episode out on Wednesday so by the time this comes out he may have already

437
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,175
Been there and you might have already gotten

438
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Experience

439
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,527
Are you are you headed back

440
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,879
Yeah so I actually I came back

441
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
Friday

442
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,327
Brookland my wife and I actually had a little wedding party we got married earlier this year but now we're doing looking to your quiet

443
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
Congratulations

444
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
That's my bright spot

445
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,239
Of the day

446
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
I think what

447
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,615
Or just being cute belly

448
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
I think what I'm going to try to do is

449
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
Go back

450
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
At least the last

451
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
The trial

452
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,319
To be there for that but yeah I am I was

453
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:05,855
Disappointed to be there and not

454
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Not have

455
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,903
Like show up.

456
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
It wasn't

457
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Huge

458
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,719
Shocker

459
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
That you don't want to go

460
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,607
Yeah I remember we were standing next to each other in in Austin when Alex

461
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
First entered the courtroom on the on the

462
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
The first day we were both

463
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Quite shocked

464
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,775
He would be there when you didn't have to

465
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,383
The whole Court was a murmur as it will he won't he kind of

466
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,151
Welcome

467
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,199
But yet it's like he

468
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
He was in office

469
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,759
That's his home turf

470
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,527
You know

471
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
So I think I think Connecticut

472
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Go to be alive

473
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
Yeah and he doesn't really have that much of a bench

474
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
Bakhit Infowars I can't take

475
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
The months to go to

476
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Connecticut

477
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
And and expect there to be enough people to fill in

478
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Alex Stein

479
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,423
Filling in for him

480
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:54,495
Beside really

481
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:58,591
That's the kind of talent

482
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Deadpool

483
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,407
Alex Stein harass

484
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
What am I

485
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,967
One of my recorder colleagues

486
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
She worked at Vici anyway he's

487
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,831
Advice

488
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,743
It seems like that's kind of Stein guys ammo

489
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
Is a horizon

490
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,839
Pokey

491
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,423
Yep yep I mean I got a job

492
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Yelling at people at the protest

493
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Yeah yeah

494
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:33,663
It's an unusual form of audition but it is an effective one in certain areas

495
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
If you're auditioning for a troll fact

496
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
Control

497
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,575
So when we were in Austin

498
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
We we got lunch

499
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,231
Fairly near the courthouse I'm on the way famously

500
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
On the ground we saw and Infowars bumper

501
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Sticker

502
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
Used as Alex's prop

503
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
Put over a very bumper sticker that wants touch

504
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
What's the lips

505
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,639
Satan himself we found this discarded Relic

506
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
Julie

507
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,783
In the in the community about whether or not I had taken

508
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
And the answer was no

509
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
He belongs in a museum

510
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,672
But in

511
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,464
Connecticut you

512
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,744
This is this is

513
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,632
Huge got a lot of affection yeah you found a bumper sticker

514
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
In the wild

515
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,728
And this this caused a little bit of drama

516
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,776
Yeah so it was

517
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
On my way to the

518
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,336
The court in the last

519
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
And the first few days there were

520
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Play Van fine

521
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Right outside

522
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
The courthouse

523
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
Which was an intentional

524
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
1000

525
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,416
Directly out of the courthouse this was that you know me block

526
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,720
Toxaway go into a restaurant or something this was

527
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Right in front of the courthouse

528
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,072
Which is a by so many Infowars

529
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:00,192
Sticker is it why put them up right outside

530
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,984
Infowars.com

531
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
Store

532
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,176
Put I finally I finally the last I was there I

Take a photo of it

00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:13,760
It is not

The most courageous thing in the world that I've ever done you know I just I just raped office sticker

537
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,184
I understand

538
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,048
The other part of it though is that

539
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Again

540
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,120
These families are walking into the courthouse

541
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,656
And they have to see that

542
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
And that to me is just that goes back to

543
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
The disrespect

544
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,008
Just shown

545
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
To these families across the board

546
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Continues

547
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,616
To be shown to them

548
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Yam

549
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,408
So yeah II

550
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Rip it off and on

551
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Ben

552
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
Tweeted about it and then and then Owen

553
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Destroyer guide

554
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,320
Real mad about it

555
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:51,136
No see now this is interesting because

556
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,184
Shroyer is

557
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
You kicked off Twitter

558
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
Yeah it is all I do is Owen

559
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,816
Campbell

560
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,936
Oh no is that is really

561
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
I never have to look at it at

562
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
We could probably have gotten that

563
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Destroy three but that really doesn't sound

564
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,248
What's good

565
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,528
Has found this tweet

566
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
And shown it to Owen

567
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,624
Or he has some kind of a band of Asian account

568
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
Which is probably the case

569
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
Furious

570
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Cheese

571
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
Duck Destroyer

572
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Cannot handle

573
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
I rattle them I rattle them

574
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
He's been destroyed

575
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:36,192
I got I got a

576
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,752
What a comment from Infowars people so yeah

577
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:39,776
The video edits

578
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
5 minutes

579
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
Love him of him whining about me

580
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:43,872
Take it off

581
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,200
It's thicker and because I said f*** Infowars which

582
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Which

583
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,064
I did do that

584
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:58,720
Airport Atlanta course as a journalist we try to like maintain objectivity but info

585
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,256
Or if it's it's pretty black

586
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:04,352
You know there's no there's no moral gray area here

587
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,656
Ejective opinion to say f*** Infowars

588
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,776
We can't say that that's cuz they're f******

589
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,056
Crazy man

590
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
So he

591
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:16,896
He gets on

592
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,712
He gets on Infowars and he offers

593
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
He has an offer he

594
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,528
He begs me to come on

595
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Intubate him

596
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:30,208
And then feather fight about what

597
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay

598
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
Set up

599
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
I'm not going to do it

600
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
I'm so sorry

601
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
And you know that is

602
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,848
Bad is the traffic

603
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,408
You want the lady bear is

604
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Come on a debate me

605
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,224
Yeah no s*** I will

606
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
Why would I lend

607
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Legitimacy to you

608
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,344
And also you're going to profit that video ends

609
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
With an adverb

610
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,136
He played Grace

611
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
And he said if I had

612
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,816
If I defeat him in the debate that whole retire who's going to judicate

613
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,864
Defeated

614
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,264
I mean that I feel like you guys are all missing are you the greatest opportunity to

615
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Like

616
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
It's say it has

617
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
To be a video interview debate

618
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
8 thing

619
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,688
And then you just move them

620
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,576
It's nuts

621
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Exactly what plaster to my mine

622
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,328
Yeah that retire

623
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:44,704
Let me get away with a lot but I don't know

624
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,264
Boundaries

625
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,872
I am fascinated by the idea of challenging you to debate

626
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Because

627
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:54,688
It's so open-ended

628
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,760
It's a bizarre request

629
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,832
Yeah that's fine

630
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,624
That really fun

631
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,184
So he challenges you to a

632
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,232
And if you win this

633
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
Debate

634
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
He will retire

635
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:15,680
It wasn't like specifically were to debate

636
00:26:15,936 --> 00:26:16,704
About whether or not

637
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,264
Stickers should be removed or like

638
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
Just said yeah just the most open-ended again just goes back

639
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,664
Please come on my show

640
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,040
Play it please give me attention and then the headline of it will be Owen Shroyer destroys huffing

641
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Wheaton post

642
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,392
Globalist reporter at it again

643
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,976
Feel like facial hair facial hair debate you've got

644
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,256
Okay cuz his

645
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Is garbage

646
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,560
I think he's covering up a

647
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
That's what I thought

648
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Well yeah

649
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,960
He also has I'm not sure if it's

650
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Super consist

651
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,288
But he often has the beard with no mustache

652
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
The most disgusting

653
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,736
Well that's a sensitive to my myheritage

654
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
My Mennonite heritage

655
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,832
You look great

656
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,416
But I have the.

657
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:11,488
James it grows back in 5

658
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,144
Resign myself to essentially looking like a hobo

659
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,448
So I'm just I've made peace

660
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Where is home

661
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Still track it

662
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
That's right

663
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
Man it's so fun I wish there is like

664
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,920
I don't know I am a little jealous honestly like

665
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
I think I respond exactly the same way that you

666
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Have

667
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,272
In terms of like

668
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,576
No I'm not doing this this is ridiculous

669
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:41,184
But I I wish you know what it is I want other than Harrison would have ever

670
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,208
Set our our name

671
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
But I think I think

672
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,304
Here you guys are way more of a threat

673
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,072
To him

674
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
Then I am

675
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,400
I really think that's true you guys are just like

676
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
Add it for

677
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
For so long

678
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
You are so knowledgeable

679
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
You know that

680
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:57,312
That I think they they know who you are

681
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:01,152
Right they are actively ignoring you

682
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Tatoosh Channel aspect that you have of the Hub

683
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,504
Huffington Post

684
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,272
That is like

685
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Announce

686
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,112
Irresistible thing for them to to

687
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,136
Try and grab on

688
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:17,536
After you for the huffing post for two reasons one it's a legitimate Outlet

689
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,352
Right so people have like a this is a news thing

690
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
You have a boss

691
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
Who says you can't do stuff

692
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,776
Come after us

693
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:34,176
We don't really have much legitimacy Beyond being everybody knows we're the only people who know what no one can tell you to do

694
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
Turn in your gun and badge

695
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
And if I said I will debate you and then showed him my ass on-screen there's no negative

696
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Consequences for me

697
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,256
But we'd get over it I would

698
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:53,888
Give me a singer wife

699
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
Disappointed

700
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,384
So they don't want to fight somebody who doesn't have rules

701
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,152
The same way

702
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,272
You forgot the third reason but they would be out to get him as a husband

703
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,368
The post reporter 13 years ago

704
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:17,696
Very nice

705
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Just gold

706
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,816
You want it back

707
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
So what time

708
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,240
Some of this stuff

709
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
Would you identify as like being the difference

710
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,568
Exes that you feel

711
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:36,128
Between the Austin and the Connecticut

712
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
Is there a real

713
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Vibe that's different

714
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:42,272
Yeah I think and I hate you know I don't want to

715
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,808
Inflated ego too much but

716
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
Nothing

717
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,600
That that Mark

718
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,672
Did so well and end out whole team quite frankly

719
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,696
But they brought

720
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
A level of of

721
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:52,256
Charisma

722
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
Sort of like

723
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,304
Dick swinging

724
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
Bad

725
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
B trial doesn't have

726
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,448
At the Jazz.

727
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,472
That

728
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,496
Yeah the point

729
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,264
Deployers

730
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
The Connecticut case

731
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,336
Doing a great job

732
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,616
I think it's also

733
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,408
Much longer trial

734
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
So that's going to be

735
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:10,944
Part of it

736
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:16,832
At what I've noticed and in the Connecticut trial you know this first week we've only we had Brittany

737
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,648
Pause on the sand for 3 days

738
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,696
Tiring

739
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,488
But through that we have.

740
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
I think a lot of

741
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
Good new info

742
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Formation

743
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
Of the

744
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
Internal

745
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632

You know we have the

752
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,104
The proof that they were using

753
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,128
Google Analytics

754
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,408

00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,248
Minutes before the trial even began

758
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,272
Yeah

759
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,552
So I think

760
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:48,832
Italy

761
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
In terms of that I

762
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
I think it's it's

763
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,440
Creating a pretty powerful argument

764
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,488
We saw

765
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
I I want to run this one

766
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,792
This number offer

767
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
Real quick because

768
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Really did

769
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Shock Me

770
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,680
September 24th 2014 Infowars store

771
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,216
It's $48,000

772
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,496
The following day

773
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
Baby

774
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
Push the story at the Isis

775
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,848
Nobody killed at Sandy Hook massacre

776
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,408
It increases to 200

777
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
32000

778
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
Sand dollars

779
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,480
Yammy that is it

780
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,784
Insane

781
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
Is proofs that

782
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
When they push the life their profits

783
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:24,416
What up yeah yeah there is

784
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:29,280
The other thing to visit they have them snapshots of the Google Analytics

785
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,560
Express on those emails

786
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,096
And you see that

787
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,656
Neatly tracks also to a giant

788
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,680
Spike in traffic

789
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,472
Yeah it's at the website and it's

790
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:41,056
It's pretty difficult to look at all those numbers and Nazi like

791
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
Well I don't know you'd have to find some way to

792
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:48,736
Connect their sales pitch to the stories that they're actually doing on the show

793
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:52,832
And I just think there's no way to possibly do all the weight know yet

794
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,560
Really notable to about this is that like I've seen some

795
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,632
Sales data that they've had

796
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,168
Iqc increases

797
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,496
In in the cells I believe like a

798
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
At the end of the author

799
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Trial

800
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,104
Mark presented some of the tech

801
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,664
Which improves a that showed

802
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,224
That's some of the they were like

803
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,528
800,000 in a day

804
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,064
Distract

805
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
And like

806
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
That

807
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:31,488
He's definitely notable but what's missing from that context was that was like when they were doing the marathon

808
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,024
Like that was

809
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,120
But they were doing a 24 or 48 hour marathon

810
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
And obviously they're like

811
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
Pushing the sales

812
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,448
It's going to rain stuff

813
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,728
That Spike

814
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,520
In the 2014

815
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:48,128
I am now they were doing the nobody the FBI says nobody was murdered

816
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
That is just organic

817
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,712
From the traffic

818
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,248
It's driven from the

819
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,296
Yeah

820
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
Really get around that way

821
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:58,112
Yeah there's there isn't like

822
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Weird X

823
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:05,280
External contact so damning about that number though is that even if you wanted

824
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
2

825
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:12,448
It would be on the jury in somebody's arguing that now we don't really pay attention to that kind

826
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,984
The numbers I'm mad just

827
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,288
Because that's so bad at business

828
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,080
That urine set you don't like

829
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,200
If the people on the jury or think are all well I saw my business going to pull I'm going to do that again

830
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,016
Like I ate is too ridiculous to think

831
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:32,416
That they would not notice a massive Spike like that while you're absolutely right

832
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,512
Especially because that is they don't have morals they there one desire

833
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,280
Is to get money

834
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,560
So that's

835
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,584
Bishop that they're going to pay it

836
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,936
Yeah and it strains credulity to imagine that like

837
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
They run

838
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,264
A warehouse and shipping business

839
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
And all these like

840
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,312
The pills in all this

841
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,592
And and then

842
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
They don't do any kind of analysis

843
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
Of the TV show

844
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:59,808
Is that Britney pause as the corporate representative

845
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:01,856
Can't be certain who works there

846
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
That be

847
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:07,232
The s*** out of credulity and leaves it out back behind a f******.

848
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:12,864
Speaking a company I don't know who has a show

849
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:15,680
Harrison Smith that's not a compliment

850
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,704
Cuz he was deaf

851
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,496
We forgot about

852
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,360
Have you been to other than Owens

853
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Challenge

854
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
Look a bit monitoring the content at all of you been

855
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,016
Fencing any of the year the coverage

856
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,832
Through Infowars

857
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,600
Yeah yeah

858
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,672
Yeah I've seen some of the I watch the video on the

859
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,696
Kangaroo court

860
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,280
Yellow b******* bring it up

861
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Brought up

862
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
At the trial as an example of Alex

863
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,400
Seriously

864
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,960
Which is just I've loved every time

865
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:49,984
And now we're on

866
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,544
This is the second time it's happened now where they judge houses

867
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,336
I hope that in

868
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,384
That's created yeah

869
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
Yeah

870
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:01,504
And you could argue that he's taking it more seriously cuz he didn't

871
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Say that you connected

872
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,296
Is the pedophilia

873
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,344
Wild trout not done yet

874
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
True

875
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,720
That is a bar that most people would not think that you could cross

876
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,024
But yeah I got me now that I think about it

877
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,328
That is a certain level of restraint

878
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,632
There is that is it

879
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:21,728
Tangible level of restraint that we can see

880
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,824
I would almost accept that argument

881
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,128
See I'm doing better I really well I think that

882
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:32,224
Physically I guess that's true look I'm saying you're full of s*** I'm not trying to get you hurt

883
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
Try

884
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:33,760
Exactly

885
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Outlander

886
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:42,208
So you you said you started covering some of this stuff

887
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,000
It's like at the beginning of the trial

888
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,560
Is that is that like where your

889
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
Newsly

890
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
But that's not the right word

891
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:52,960
For the news purposes covering Alex

892
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Start in 2018

893
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,032
Yeah yes

894
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,360
Before 2018 I didn't really think

895
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
Kind of way

896
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
What ended up happening

897
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:02,944
Because I had gone

898
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,480
To Parkland

899
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,016
To cover.

900
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
That's what shooting would it happen

901
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,320
And then

902
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
And I was approached

903
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Spy

904
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,160
By Mark Banks

905
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Because

906
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,976
Marcel Fontaine

907
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
Was

908
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Misidentified

909
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,304
Is the Parkland shooter by

910
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
Towards

911
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
And I'd brought a lawsuit against them

912
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Giselle

913
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
And I believe

914
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,496
His attorney is saw

915
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Parkland

916
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,824
Brought that story to me

917
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,360
And then from there

918
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
You know that

919
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,688
Half-witted Lewis case

920
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,712
Came in

921
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:39,040
Back so I guess I kept covering those cases

922
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
And I didn't realize you

923
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
Just how

924
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
The rabbit hole 5

925
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,160
I was going to have to get with this

926
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,744
I was glad to have done it

927
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:51,840
Alex that's how all of us wound up here we all were like

928
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
Well we just looked over and there was Alex Jones and then it's five years later and I don't have as much hair as I used to

929
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
Scholarship

930
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:05,152
We all jumped into the abyss and now we're more tired than ever

931
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
But it feels good

932
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:12,832
Always falling it's like you're not falling at all right

933
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,856
What's the weather think about it

934
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,648
You didn't have like a

935
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
Like a

936
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
Babe

937
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
Long

938
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
Standing like interested in

939
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,304
It's like right-wing misinformation

940
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,072
Not

941
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:23,840
Maybe not.

942
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Secretly misinformation

943
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
But definitely have done a lot of Co

944
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448

There was

953
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
The time we

954
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440

Predator Harpo's actually sounds like a good Illinois that's nice

963
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,296
Not the right word to use actually

964
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,832
It was pretty fun

965
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,112
Okay

966
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,184

Right-wing extremist

969
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,048
Andy Campbell

970
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
Christmas ideas were in Charlottesville

971
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Yet I wouldn't with a deal.

972
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Please March

973
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
I went to

974
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
Charleston South Carolina

975
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,240
Dylann roof

976
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
Yeah

977
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Detergent

978
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,056
So

979
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Yeah we could have run into Jakari Jackson when he was down there

980
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,408
Possibly

981
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,504
Yeah

982
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,320
But yeah so

983
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
Sort of

984
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,880
You know Alex Jones

985
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,160
Just would have seemed like the next logical

986
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
I mean he is

987
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:55,744
Very much

988
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Within that realm and and

989
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,048
Stirring the pot

990
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
As much as as much

991
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Yeah

992
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,680
It's it's interesting that

993
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Like how do you how do you deal with that

994
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
That like

995
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:08,288
Can you do this coverage

996
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
Are these extremists within organization

997
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,664
You know the bowl Patrol

998
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,688
Created their own by

999
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,224
Innovations

1000
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
And you do coverage of it matter

1001
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,040
That's important

1002
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
It's newsworthy people should

1003
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
You know about these

1004
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Things

1005
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,184
But then the consequence of it

1006
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,208
Comes with this

1007
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Attention B

1008
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
You turned back on you and

1009
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,120
Threats and the thief the personal information

1010
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Lakeview

1011
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
You find yourself needing to

1012
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
Havlik's

1013
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,008
Security measure

1014
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
Pictures that you

1015
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:42,592
We do have a good

1016
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,616
Security team

1017
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,664
When we get to heaven

1018
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
The dogs in a while

1019
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,480
Bucket knock on with you guys

1020
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
But

1021
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,552
Yeah our team does a good job of like

1022
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,344
Getting our information off a

1023
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
I'd like another

1024
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
They're definitely measures that you

1025
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,928
Even taken

1026
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
For Everyman

1027
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
And then another time

1028
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
My my parents Act

1029
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:06,400
She got dogs

1030
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,448
But their bag of Republicans

1031
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:09,728
Jokes on them

1032
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,544
They got dachshund people descend

1033
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:19,456
Yeah exactly the liberal booking report and they're like yeah I know

1034
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:25,088
Like I always think about like

1035
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,368
If you have

1036
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
Personal information like your you're

1037
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
Address

1038
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
In the hands of these

1039
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
Nefarious

1040
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,536
Dangerous weirdos

1041
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Do you move

1042
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:35,840
Like

1043
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,888
I mean it kind of tastes like I would move

1044
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,680
Right now I don't know

1045
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,752
It depends on the level of harassment and I actually

1046
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:43,776
Whatever I'm done

1047
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
30 really tails and

1048
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
Comparison to a lot of other

1049
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,640
Journalist particularly if you're if you're a

1050
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,992
Female journalism

1051
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:58,368
Far is it harassment goes

1052
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,904
Any friends or whatever I can

1053
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
Ignore it or you know not

1054
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:04,512
Not worried about it as much but I think

1055
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,536
If you're a female in that

1056
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,328
Really got back cigars

1057
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
Is it those are the journal at 2

1058
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,168
Who I

1059
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
Worry about it

1060
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
My heart goes out to

1061
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,008
Yeah

1062
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,312
I guess I'm just sort of thinking about this like

1063
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Because I haven't

1064
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
Really thought about it too much like

1065
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,664
It's always been like the Expo

1066
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
Fixation that like something is around the corner

1067
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,784
Of some kind of angry info Warrior thing

1068
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,880
Doesn't happen no no we never we never get any of it

1069
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,440
Yeah we've we've barely been contacted

1070
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:36,000
Twice three times maybe and

1071
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:42,400
It's so disappointed when he says that

1072
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:48,800
Leaving about the trial you got a bit of people

1073
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,128
We're not on social media really be but I mean that's a big party

1074
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:57,503
Seasoning is people when I was on Twitter people didn't come after me they went after people who were like

1075
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,295
Tertiary

1076
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,367
You know they were people who are around and so

1077
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,207
If they said something similar to me then they would go after somebody with like

1078
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
30 followers is up there but nobody spoke to

1079
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
To me at all

1080
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Disconcert

1081
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,983
Scary scary dude Jordan distorted just a f****** have the median devil

1082
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend

1083
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:27,455
Good idea I'm just surprised nobody just gave it a shot CU unpredictable you yell a lot

1084
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,063
You're too good at it probably in Austin with your pit

1085
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
Yeah like his heart must be going

1086
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,047
Nu-Way Jordan you also did you get admonish by like a bailiff

1087
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
Something when we're not sure I got a couple but that wasn't really for anything just cuz you were about to yell at

1088
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:53,567
To be a I was about to be a problem

1089
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,967
That's good cuz I got to go back to the trial if I had gotten away with it also taught us an important

1090
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:05,855
Is that you respect Bayless more than me

1091
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:18,143
So do you plan to go to the the Posner case as well to you

1092
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:20,959
Absolutely because that'll be I mean that's really the

1093
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,775
The end chapter on this in a lot of ways

1094
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
Is that I'd like to say that

1095
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:26,591
Yeah things are done but

1096
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
And you know

1097
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,407
Muddy Paws R & N

1098
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Very nice

1099
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
There are the ones who really

1100
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,575
They were at they were the ones who really started going after Alex first

1101
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:39,391
Whispered for the lies that he was Fred let Lenny God

1102
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
You know Alex's videos

1103
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,951
Taken down off YouTube

1104
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,303
And so that is going to be it's going to be really

1105
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,327
Things to see and I think

1106
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,095
Is going to be

1107
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:53,215
That. Trial itself even though it'll be the last one I think there's going to be so much

1108
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
So many news

1109
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,543
Story is a narrative and

1110
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
In fact that come out in that

1111
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
Blackheads

1112
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,383
It's going to be really worth hanging

1113
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:02,175
Yeah for sure

1114
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,271
That's that is something I'd like to go back to sari 22

1115
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:11,391
Take the conversation to step back but to go back to something you said earlier about how the in the text

1116
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,159
Australian Omar

1117
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,695
Can Company brought a certain

1118
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,487
Big Swingin Dick Energy to

1119
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:20,095
Yeah the proceedings you know you'd be threatening Gummy Bears or gummy world of Oregon

1120
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,447
Was Bill a lot of bills got that car

1121
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
But

1122
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,519
In in this trial I felt like

1123
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,871
There's much more of a almost nerdy granular elements

1124
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:37,759
You know so when were when you compared the the lawyers I do think that the Connecticut lawyers are doing a really good job

1125
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,039
Getting into the

1126
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,111
Mary minor kind of detail stuff

1127
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
Have you noticed

1128
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,975
That kind of fellows

1129
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,279
Sleep song

1130
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:55,679
Nevermind question retractable I will say I might tear it to your point Jordan I will say that

1131
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,215
And I keep saying this but like

1132
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:00,543
There is a lot to come and there's going to be more testimony

1133
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:04,639
Be a testimony of Bill Altenburg the FBI agent

1134
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:06,431
I mean that was that was

1135
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,967
Really difficult

1136
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,271
Jawatan

1137
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,879
Yeah he's essentially hyperventilating on the sand because he

1138
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:16,159
He is

1139
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,951
Not only did he have to

1140
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
To relive

1141
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,023
The horror of what he saw that day

1142
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
But

1143
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
He had

1144
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Let you

1145
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,887
Say it in front of the family member

1146
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,471
I think that's what was breaking his heart even more

1147
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,519
Yeah he said that at one point he said

1148
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:35,871
Achoo that he pointed to the family and I'm say he said I'm so sorry that I that I have to

1149
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
To do that that I have

1150
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Talk about this

1151
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,687
Yeah

1152
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,735
My my heart breaks and I think

1153
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,063
Those again or the sobering reminders of like

1154
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,599
But the impact

1155
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:49,439
You know they aren't on these people and the trauma that

1156
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,719
He continues to exist

1157
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,999
And the fact that Alex

1158
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
An ant

1159
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,815
Still won't let up

1160
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
You know and

1161
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Still want to make a mockery of this

1162
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Just shows that they don't

1163
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,959
They don't care they don't care at all

1164
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
And I can't

1165
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
I can't wrap my mind around that

1166
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
You know I'm

1167
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
I'm a journalism

1168
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,591
Human Bean first

1169
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,615
The end and there is

1170
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:09,407
A real Line in the Sand

1171
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
When your

1172
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
Attacking the parents of dead kids

1173
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,807
You know you're either on the right side of this or you're f****** dead wrong

1174
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:17,343
Yes but not much

1175
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,623
Not much gray there

1176
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:21,951
It speaks to it speaks to the

1177
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
Mitsubishi

1178
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,999
Extensive what

1179
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
Kind of s*** we're dealing with is like

1180
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:31,423
You know any in your line of work especially you you know you've rattled off a list of atrocities

1181
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,703
And you were there

1182
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:34,495
And it's it easy to go

1183
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,031
Get desensitized to

1184
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,079
To a lot of that but at the end of the day

1185
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:44,479
This is so f****** bad you cannot get desensitized to and yet

1186
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
You know that

1187
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
Weather tonight

1188
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
It's

1189
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:50,879
I think it's because

1190
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,463
To become desensitized you have to have a starting point where you can

1191
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Ryan

1192
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
Do you have to have a baseline event

1193
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,119
State that exists

1194
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
For that I think I think

1195
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
From my experiences

1196
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,239
Watching the show and

1197
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
And looking

1198
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
This

1199
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,311
World for so long it's

1200
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,383
It's a cynicism and it's a it's a

1201
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
Baseline

1202
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
I was like

1203
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
Whatever works

1204
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:17,759
Yeah it does

1205
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,039
Completely disconnect

1206
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Did Trump

1207
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
What you need to get

1208
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
To become decent

1209
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,207
And that cynicism goes back to Owen Shroyer trying to get me onto.

1210
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,231
Because at the end of

1211
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
The day it's still away.

1212
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,047
But he gets a profit off

1213
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
This trial right right

1214
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:37,983
How are you how are you handling the you know like we as we've just kind of talked about that kind of disconnect

1215
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,263
Where

1216
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,799
You know you see

1217
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:45,151
Bill Altenburg on the stand you see the families there and then at the same time

1218
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,735
Minutes apart uce Norm badass making

1219
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,807
What amounts to the legal version of dropping his pants

1220
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:53,087
Saying the n-word of the dark

1221
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
Yeah

1222
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,415
You know that's a duck such a good point Jordan

1223
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,951
Because I think and I know you guys

1224
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,975
I can relate to this like

1225
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,791
You have to be able to do both right I mean

1226
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,631
Can you take it seriously in and let it be somber when it is but

1227
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,655
We're also allowed

1228
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,935
The point and laugh at the

1229
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,215
The clown on stage

1230
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
Right

1231
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
So are you. I think both

1232
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Can kind of work in tandem but it is it is sort of emotional whiplash

1233
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
You know

1234
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
Fabian of the day I'm still

1235
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,271
So going back to have a beer to just sort of like

1236
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Process

1237
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
What the hell did I just watch

1238
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,879
It's natural

1239
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:27,647
Go to like

1240
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Like record

1241
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,463
Big knives the clown arsonist

1242
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
But like

1243
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
It's still

1244
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:34,303
It's so weird to have

1245
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,095
But I guess it's kind of what we

1246
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,887
We swimming all the time

1247
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
This is funny

1248
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:43,007
It also exists as a

1249
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,543
It's painful and it sucks

1250
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
It's not dark humor

1251
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
That's not what it is

1252
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:55,807
No it's it's like we're where we live at the

1253
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:02,207
Demarcation point where reality and surreality are crashing together and it's your birthday

1254
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,791
That's a reality is trying to come into the real world

1255
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:10,399
Like like it is it they're trying to bring it through this fictional doorway and we're like

1256
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
That's a wall

1257
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,055
But

1258
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:23,711
Kool-Aid man oh yeah exactly

1259
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,063
Kool-Aid Man

1260
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,623
Something that I thought

1261
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,439
When you're talking about the bill Alden

1262
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,463
Testimony

1263
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,999
To go back to that for a second

1264
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,791
What events I thought was really

1265
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:41,887
Kind of horrifying about that that I didn't even really think of

1266
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
Was the part of

1267
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,239
His experience with

1268
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
The entire

1269
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,567
Aftermath

1270
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
Is it

1271
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
He was accused of being an actor

1272
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,199
It was also one of the

1273
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
The parent

1274
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Parent David wheeler

1275
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Yeah and so like

1276
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
His experience

1277
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Of the

1278
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Denial of his

1279
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:03,391
Experience

1280
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Also was

1281
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
They can

1282
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,279
An element of it for him was

1283
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,815
Mister wheeler

1284
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Yeah like

1285
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
I don't like an almost

1286
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:20,543
Appendage to an already

1287
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
I feel like

1288
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,615
You are a part of what was being done

1289
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
To this other person

1290
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
I felt like that was something he was talking

1291
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,711
Sing about

1292
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
That was

1293
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,247
Horrify

1294
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
Exactly.

1295
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
To me I think

1296
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,879
Was was the most heartbreaking as a one-point

1297
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,183
He said something to the effect of

1298
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,231
I wish I had done

1299
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:41,791
Differently he said he said that he took

1300
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,607
Could some responsibility

1301
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,911
Uniform

1302
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:48,959
There's nothing

1303
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:53,055
Think you could have done there's nothing differently he could have done that would have stopped

1304
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,079
These days

1305
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
People from

1306
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:56,383
From still

1307
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:58,175
Filmmaking trying to make this

1308
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
Disconnection in Philly

1309
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,991
Throwing his life and everyone else

1310
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:02,015
Ulta flight into Indy

1311
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
The chaos and turmoil

1312
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,087
There's nothing he could have done it and yet

1313
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,111
He still has

1314
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
Clear guilt about it

1315
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,231
That's that I think

1316
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:13,791
It's got to be rooted in that to that overactive a

1317
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
Nothing to like

1318
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Right he just walked

1319
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:16,607
2

1320
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,911
Think of some way there

1321
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
You could have helped

1322
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
You know but the cynicism is too great

1323
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,335
On the other side you know.

1324
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
It doesn't matter

1325
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,175
Yeah it is it is weird

1326
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Because

1327
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,991
It is it is a little bit like

1328
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:39,903
Hearing some people describing like what they could have done better to stop a hurricane

1329
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
Yeah hurricane was coming

1330
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:45,535
Yeah you were just in the way

1331
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,935
More sandbank or might have had the water get in somewhere else

1332
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Damage was going to be done

1333
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Exactly right

1334
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,031
It sucks

1335
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,823
This is a force of nature

1336
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
In our mine

1337
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,199
Well I mean

1338
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:07,551
But now I don't know if it's that the line bulshit artist are the force

1339
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,599
Nature so much of it as it is like

1340
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
These types of

1341
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,391
Panax r4c

1342
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,279
You know like how many people got caught up in the satanic panic and all the sudden their lives are f****** destroyed

1343
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,071
/ imaginary bulge

1344
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,887
This is an arm of

1345
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,215
I'm social undulation that so f****** weird

1346
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:27,007
But it is kind of a force of nature

1347
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,799
It all at the hope the hope is

1348
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,567
Is that you know

1349
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
With these trials battle

1350
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,127
That'll help the

1351
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
The koala the storm

1352
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Get Outlets

1353
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,455
Get up from a hurricane to a drizzle

1354
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:40,063
Right which is so which is so fascinating in terms of

1355
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,439
The trial because Norm keeps bringing up that that thing that Maddie said the opening state

1356
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
You know

1357
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
We should we need to shut

1358
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
We need to shut up

1359
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
You know that kind of thing

1360
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,887
And if the defense lawyer says that

1361
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:57,471
You do feel like oh there's something prejudicial about

1362
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Right

1363
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,287
But that's just being honest about what

1364
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:03,103
Needs to be done to handle this cuz we can't you know

1365
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,919
If it was a criminal trial with a put him in jail forever

1366
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,247
Enter into that point to its like

1367
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,039
But they're saying that

1368
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
We have to shut them down to end this

1369
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
Because the proof is at

1370
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:21,279
They're still trying to profit off of it you know there's it's about the trial in the kangaroo cordon bleu

1371
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Autobahn so

1372
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
Yeah

1373
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,119
I mean the only way they're going to learn is if you take

1374
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Their money away

1375
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,703
Yep yeah the ultimate lesson I think is

1376
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:29,471
So much

1377
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,775
It's just

1378
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:32,543
They won't learn

1379
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,335
They had learned they don't want to

1380
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,175
An argument

1381
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
Pretty easy to make the

1382
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
A fitting punishment

1383
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:42,527
It just has to be like

1384
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:44,575
You can do a podcast

1385
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Honestly

1386
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,975
It's almost like listen

1387
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,303
I don't want any punishment other than that you just

1388
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,911
Can't talk on the air anymore you can do whatever you want with the rest of your life

1389
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,703
You just can't bother people

1390
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:05,311
Like it is it is a little bit like you didn't you just can't be that guy anymore

1391
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,615
Yeah I can I can think of some other punishment

1392
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,735
But I'll keep it to myself well listen hey you know me I'm a

1393
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:20,159
I found it interesting that Norm in his introduction

1394
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,183
Who's kind of like

1395
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:22,463
Conceding the fact that

1396
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:25,023
Take it they're going to prove that Alex is a liar

1397
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
And like

1398
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:29,119
Take that one of the things you would

1399
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Think of a second

1400
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,679
An appropriate punishment is like

1401
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215
Really

1402
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:36,543
Recognizing that this person is full of s***

1403
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
In a very public

1404
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,335
Space

1405
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,407
But I ain't then I realize like no they'll concede that

1406
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Yeah matter

1407
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:44,735
Yeah

1408
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Sucks

1409
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,087
Norm Norm also so a couple you know somehow

1410
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
Colorful

1411
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
The trial is Norm had a sidekick

1412
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,439
Cake with an

1413
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,231
Who liked another lawyer

1414
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:00,351
You helping next to him who had a slightly shorter ponytail

1415
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:11,103
When you get fired at to Paddy's Loft

1416
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,663
They cut that off

1417
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,527
They're legal Knowledge Tree

1418
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:24,671
What Betty chops Patterson half with a lightsaber things are gonna get real into

1419
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
It was a it was a stretch

1420
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:32,863
What time the pet his head like a weird like quarantine beard going to I was wondering who's going to show up with

1421
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Just like

1422
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:36,191
Giant beard I'm glad

1423
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
Glad you didn't

1424
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:40,543
Hanakai sucks what a weirdo

1425
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,359
What an adverb every time he walks around

1426
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,919
I mean it's just everything about him is wrong

1427
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,943
I don't like

1428
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:50,271
Necessarily but I figured maybe is inevitable

1429
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,087
So much of the conversation about the trial

1430
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,367
Like whether it's with

1431
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:56,927
With you here or even on our show when we just talked about it

1432
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,463
Focus is around Norm

1433
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
Like I just

1434
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,119
It's hard not for it not to be like he's such a

1435
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,911
Yeah he and he's with a picture and Alex

1436
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,471
This world for a long time now so

1437
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,543
Yeah he was there when Alex put out a bounty

1438
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,823
On Chris Mattie

1439
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,663
It was instant right well I was drunkenly screaming about that

1440
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:24,063
Yeah his Antics like he's he's a dancing monkey in the courtroom and every now and again you just Arts

1441
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,623
Banging symbols together and you can't not look at the

1442
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,903
Monkey banging it

1443
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:30,463
Together what are you doing Monkey

1444
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:37,119
How did you learn this is your master

1445
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,679
He'll be there tomorrow I'm fascinated

1446
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
To imagine how

1447
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,239
Cross-examination

1448
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,263
Going to go or just

1449
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Norm

1450
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Galaxy Quest

1451
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
Can't imagine

1452
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,151
MS

1453
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
Exhausting

1454
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
I've already started my objects

1455
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:56,063
I'm just going to say objection for now

1456
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,367
Season

1457
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,159
I can't imagine him

1458
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Being Alexa

1459
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,999
Kit Medi more than two or three questions through to Alex

1460
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,279
Before their like we're just shutting

1461
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:08,095
Norm's going to have a tough time as a week

1462
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,143
He's already

1463
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:13,727
Nodded off in the courtroom and he

1464
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
There is a

1465
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,543
Recess and so he was like

1466
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,311
Tweeting

1467
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,639
Just like other s*** you know Mike cernovich

1468
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Yeah

1469
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,759
About the migrants being sent to Martha's Vineyard

1470
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,319
Heaven the game Norm

1471
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:33,183
You're busy right now Coram

1472
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:37,279
Okay little bit of nonchalance goes a long way

1473
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:41,119
I kind of suggesting that you got your you got a tight hand on this ship

1474
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,959
You know I actually did that you're mad at that way

1475
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
You might have a point

1476
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,287
He's trying to nag

1477
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:55,455
Falling asleep in preschool

1478
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:00,063
If you hold approval and then it will come to you

1479
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:03,903
I don't want to load Judgment at all I'm so cool right Cheryl

1480
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,047
Judgment

1481
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,119
The first trial the strategy was redpill the jury

1482
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:16,191
Second strategy for using the game

1483
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:17,471
Amazing

1484
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,567
Probably wrap this up before too long we're coming in

1485
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:25,919
Close to an hour here's that I'm figure before we do those there

1486
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:28,223
What is there anything else on your mind

1487
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
Do you think is like

1488
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
Important

1489
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,039
From your experience

1490
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:31,807
Like maybe

1491
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,623
Yeah every trial that you want to bring two

1492
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,391
Bring the Forefront

1493
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,951
Yeah I mean I think just

1494
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
Set up before but I think

1495
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,303
Worth always repeating that like this is

1496
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
Is about

1497
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
The Sandy Hooks

1498
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
This is about

1499
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,167
Piano.

1500
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,959
The parents who lost their children this

1501
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:51,007
This is about the the mothers in

1502
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,055
Consigned to lost their parents

1503
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
Listen

1504
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:55,103
About the teachers who

1505
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,127
Gave their lives

1506
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Is protecting the

1507
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,663
These kids

1508
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:58,431
And

1509
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,711
And it

1510
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,479
It-it's

1511
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:04,063
It f****** sucks and I think all that we can do is

1512
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
Is 2

1513
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:08,159
Things a little bit harder for

1514
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
People like Alex Jones

1515
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:11,231
Wall also

1516
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
You know

1517
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
Doing our best

1518
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
To beat also

1519
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Walk with Kyle

1520
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,631
You know what I mean like

1521
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:18,911
There's one thing that this

1522
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,959
Taught me it's it's

1523
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
Yeah

1524
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,519
Meb

1525
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
The parents are just so courageous

1526
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
They're there in courtroom every day

1527
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,103
Alex is hiding

1528
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
Texas

1529
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,151
And they're they're not even

1530
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,175
Are they they're not test

1531
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,199
Pathfinder showed up to the

1532
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
The courtroom

1533
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:35,551
And that is just like that that level of Courage is something that I

1534
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,599
We'll never know I hope

1535
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
To never have to know

1536
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,207
And so I decided all the Lovin

1537
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,487
And all the respect in the world

1538
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,255
For those people

1539
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
That's all I got to say

1540
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,607
That's definitely something that's even though we

1541
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,631
You know we bring a tent

1542
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Listen to that

1543
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:52,703
It can never be sad enough absolutely

1544
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:56,543
Exeter brings to my mind I wanted to bring this up

1545
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,103
Cuz I forgot to ask you about this

1546
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,407
But there was on our

1547
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Subreddit

1548
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:03,967
Are plants subreddit

1549
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Mark

1550
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:05,759
Did post

1551
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,039
A proof of life

1552
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,671
Were you around when there was a confrontation with the

1553
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,951
Yeah so yeah

1554
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,231
Why does

1555
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Jogged into my mind was

1556
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,303
Because you know you're talking about like

1557
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,583
The courage of showing up

1558
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,143
These families showing up everyday Court

1559
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,959
You know there is the emotional courage of

1560
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,495
Being there in this

1561
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Really difficult

1562
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Cold

1563
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:31,359
Horrific setting and then there is also just the real

1564
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,407
Like literal physical courage

1565
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:38,015
The risk of being accosted by somebody like

1566
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Yeah

1567
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:40,575
What happened

1568
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,415
So it was a it was related to

1569
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,463
To meet killing the cigarette

1570
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,487
30 people are idiots

1571
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,071
Been triggered by me on defacing your property

1572
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:56,703
So so I am not 100% sure but the running theory is that it was Corey

1573
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,983
Glencoe who is Wolfie

1574
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
King Hall Biggs driver

1575
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,543
Connecticut and that he might have just

1576
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Driven out there

1577
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
To see something

1578
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:05,919
Sticker download Mark is next to me I take a photo of it

1579
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
He is smoking a

1580
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
Cigarette and very aggressive

1581
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,503
The lady tells me

1582
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,271
Need to move on

1583
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,599
Oh so this was your fault

1584
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:19,231
I will yeah so it's so then so then as as we were walking

1585
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,511
Into the courthouse

1586
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,327
He the guy is walking in behind us

1587
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,607
End

1588
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,887
Start saying

1589
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:28,191
Tomorrow can I believe says tomorrow

1590
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:29,471

About poison ivy

1592
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,567
Sort of loudly

1593
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Sat in front of the

1594
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,383
Payless that I said you know

1595
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,407
Looks like somebody

1596
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,431
Probably this morning

1597
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
But then he just

1598
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Yeah they let

1599
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
Security no

1600
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,391
Ran away I guess but

1601
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:55,071
I like the pterodactyl lamp in The Flintstones in the city

1602
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:58,399
Somebody's girl

1603
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,263
Just try to keep it light you know

1604
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,799
Oh yeah my last words

1605
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
Before I get my ads

1606
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,127
Nobody's grumpy

1607
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
Might do

1608
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:15,551
I do appreciate Mark just has that way of bringing it out of people absolutely

1609
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
Really good other people scared and make them want to throw take a swig

1610
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:26,047
Was the sticker

1611
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,143
Who cares

1612
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,703
Betty's with the other way that we get through the abyss

1613
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:38,847
Yeah

1614
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,407
Same time you know if it is in fact

1615
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,199
The case that this was like

1616
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,247
This guy was Wolfgang halbig associate

1617
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:49,855
Threatened you know we're hearing on this and the Wolfgang is reaching out to

1618
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
These Infowars people in like

1619
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,951
Sexually harassing them now

1620
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,255
The trial is going on like

1621
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,303
There is a reality to this that

1622
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,583
It's like it's still

1623
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:00,863
You know

1624
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,679
I don't want to say luckily it was directed at you

1625
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
But like

1626
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,567
Yeah it was it was directed at Mark too and I think

1627
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:11,103
Between the two of us we went by

1628
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,431
Plural you

1629
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,783
I supposed to like a family members

1630
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,855
Is that this is a man who's lived most of his life believing that the

1631
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,647
The TV is talking to him

1632
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,695
Look at

1633
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
The TV on

1634
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,887
At Wolfgang if you're listening to me right now what

1635
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,959
That's a weird thing for Norm to have done

1636
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,311
I wonder I wonder if it does,

1637
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
Macross azbetter

1638
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:47,711
To be like I'm not going to directly communicate with him I'm just going to say this through the medium of

1639
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
The Stream

1640
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:54,111
You should take care of that so how just briefly

1641
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:56,159
That a Wolfgang after the author

1642
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,487
Central he's he's letting me a couple voicemails

1643
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
Which adjuster

1644
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
The rambling

1645
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
Ghetto sad boy

1646
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
I thought you were excited

1647
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,631
But

1648
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,959
What are the days of the trial I get an email

1649
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:12,543
Not to me directly Wolfgang just sends it to

1650
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,591
FBI agent everyday

1651
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
Everybody at yaddo imma I'm on his

01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:19,711
Newsletter you know his mailing list

1653
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735
And and

1654
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
The email

1655
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:27,135
Guy for that one well I'll keep an eye on it and I honestly use MailChimp

1656
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,159
Yeah

1657
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:32,767
That's a good segue into

1658
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:39,679
No but he is the email was about how the Connecticut Governor light

1659
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,983
To him about Sandy Hook he's still doing this

1660
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
You know he's still doing this even

1661
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,055
The day

1662
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,127
Of of testimony in the second defamation trial if

1663
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,431
Even after he has lost

1664
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
Arby's

1665
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
Bee suits

1666
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
You are like bright

1667
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:57,599
Well and and his family

1668
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:05,535
He does have the ultimate freedom of literally having nothing left to lose your pot committed

1669
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,327
But that's also that is

1670
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
Going back to what we're saying that is

1671
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,143
Danger right

1672
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:11,679
When you got nothing left to lose

1673
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
You know

1674
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
So

1675
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Well

1676
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,543
Fingers crossed

1677
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
Find something

1678
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
But he doesn't want to lose

1679
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:22,175
I got spell yeah not a great situation

1680
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:26,271
