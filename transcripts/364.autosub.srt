Long last

6
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Sort of push goals I guess on our our patreon that I would get a show tattoo

7
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
And it is done

8
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
It is I went this morning to shop here in

9
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,416
Chicago I've been trying to get it for a while and I'm sorry there's a bit of a

10
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
The delay but

11
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,488
I really wanted my brother to do

12
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,280
Design it and he's very busy guy

13
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
It's getting the actual designs

14
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Together

15
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
I took a little longer than expected

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,472
And then I don't you a couple places here in Chicago that I just did

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,104
Feel comfortable

18
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
But I just didn't

19
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
I got a feeling like

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
I rather feel totally comfortable when I go through with this

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:04,928
You had while you were in the tattoo parlor and you're the guy is making the stencil Inuit

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:05,696
Texted me just like

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
I don't know if I don't know if it's good

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
I don't know if I like this I don't think I don't think I trust this guy

25
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
That's not what it's supposed to look like he's freaky

26
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,912
Yeah it's

27
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448

Great grocer

71
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,551
I wanted to do is also a

72
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,855
I feel like in the spirit of tying up loose

73
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Very bad at taking care of business

74
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Outside of just

75
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,463
Doing this

76
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,023
So one of the things we're getting this tattoo

77
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Squared away get it taken care of

78
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
And something else I've been meaning to do and I have been

79
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Just terrible

80
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
As I promised that we would have a

81
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,287

85
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
The theme song

86
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,831
Rave reviews across the board from everybody and it's

87
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Shameful

88
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,903
Edit taken me this long but one

89
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,207

90
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,279

Thank you DJ

00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Of Leo Young

97
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,175

Prayers

102
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:57,375
Have ordered a Hitler uniform

103
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,191
The freeways were maybe four but

104
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
This is what they teach Integris

105
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,223
The official

106
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Leo Young

107
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,367
Incredible thank you very much

108
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:23,743
So Jordan today what we're doing is we're going back to the past 2013 we will be

109
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
Talking about April 21st

110
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,351
22nd 23rd

111
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:33,471
Okay this is of course in the aftermath of the Boston bombing

112
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
Kobe

113
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
Survive tracking the course

114
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,335
The valix is terrible

115
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Full coverage

116
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
The traumatic event

117
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,943
I think he's been doing okay so far

118
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
It's an interesting take

119
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,367
Directly counter to my position literally the worst job possible

120
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,719
I think if you asked me what could he be like what are

121
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,743
Ruin it further

122
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
Yeah what are you got opposite of like

123
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
What are

124
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
Where to go to the bright spot

125
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
I would look at you very

126
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
I don't know if there are any

127
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,895
So here we are Jordan Alex in 2013 he was coming down from behind he was writing

128
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
When there was a complete absence

129
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
The real information about the investigation into the Boston bombing

130
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,063
He was free to create his own narrative wholesale

131
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,135
After the Watertown shootout on the night of April 8th

132
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
The morning of April 9th

133
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,767
Which left tamerlan dead and his brother johar armed and on the loose

134
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
I want to show on the 19th was a

135
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Completely bizarre

136
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
Up to that point he been in

137
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,959
System that the globalist plan to blame a white Patsy

138
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
You discovered by looking at pictures that he found out 4chan

139
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
But because Alex released those photos

140
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
The globalist were forced to change their plan

141
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,223
Then after the FBI released the images of the Tsarnaev Brothers

142
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
Alex pivoted the narrative

143
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
Since all the stuff he's been yelling about 4 days with literally no relation

144
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
Anything happening in the real world

145
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:59,231
Now the globalist plan all along have been to blame the imaginary Navy

146
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Besitos

147
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
Alex also decided where they're at the

148
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,839
Where is not based on his analysis

149
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
Again

150
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,143
4chan

151
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,471
And sent Alex also somehow blue the up that

152
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,007
Plan of the globalist sad

153
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,127
They were putting Boston into a state of Martial law so they could go around and kill all the Patxi's

154
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:21,247
Who are the pictures that again Alex found on 4chan so they could get these people

155
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:23,807
They were cleaning up couldn't reveal that it was all the drill

156
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:26,367
Yes all of this has been confirmed is true

157
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
On the 19th

158
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
I'm magically just like that Alex has created a preemptive

159
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,815
Excuse for why no one has ever come out and confirm his dump

160
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
The globalist took them all out

161
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,239
As we've discussed already those men in the pictures that Alex found on 4chan that he thinks are seals

162
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,567
Are actually members of a couple of different states National Guard

163
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
Civil support

164
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,895
Goron seen it all large-scale public of

165
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:51,711
Events ranging from one of the largest marathons in the world

166
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
All the way down to just MLB

167
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,367
If you wanted to put the effort in the bottom of this list

168
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
I hope it's a smaller scale maybe than the Boston Marathon

169
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,767
Alright

170
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
If you want me to put the effort in you could almost certainly figure out who these

171
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
People are and find evidence

172
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,935
To them still being alive and working with their siesta

173
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,799
I'm not saying that I did that but I am saying if I did I would still respect their privacy you never

174
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
Augusta personal

175
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,151
Only show on the 19th Alex

176
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,527
Seems to have a keen awareness that is normal incitement Laden Behavior may be way too dangerous to engage

177
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,831
Why what city is in the middle of a large-scale map

178
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
That's not the time to call on citizens to rise up

179
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,231
Because it's the time when it's most likely to be taken

180
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
And seriously by the most unhinged of his list

181
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,423
Alex took a very strange approach and barely even talked about the Boston being in a shelter-in-place request

182
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,007
About how an MIT police officer had been murdered the night before

183
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
But how there been a shootout in a residential neighborhood

184
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
If you didn't know that these things are happening

185
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:54,431
You would not learn about that by listening to that days

186
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
Infowars episode

187
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,247
I can tell you that very

188
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
You learn about how Stewart Road there's a baby about permit

189
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
And how Larry Pratt hates most

190
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
That's about what you like

191
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:05,951
Better for everybody

192
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,743
So the 20th is a Saturday

193
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
So now Alex has no show on

194
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,351
Saturday or Sunday the 21st

195
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
By that point the situation is largely result

196
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,959
To get us up to speed on what's happened

197
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
Here we go

198
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,591
In the very early morning of the 19th Governor Deval Patrick put out a shelter in place

199
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
Request ask

200
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,175
The people to stay indoors to help police better carry out there man.

201
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
At no point is this Adam and

202
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,551
And it's not enforced by any coercion or any Force

203
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,135
Mass transit the temporary says temporarily suspended in the city

204
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,975
A Massachusetts National Guard is called into sis police

205
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,279
In carrying out door-to-door searches and targeted areas

206
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
As the day drags on though

207
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
The authorities

208
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,375
Keep coming up empty

209
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
At 2 p.m. that evening Red Sox game is

210
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
And by 4:30 p.m.

211
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
The command center is starting to wonder if there's any point in May

212
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Maintaining the shelter in

213
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Replace request

214
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:58,687
They've done their sweep and they haven't found johar and they're beginning

215
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Keep the perimeter

216
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
At 5:30 p.m. service resumes on mass transit

217
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
And at 6

218
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,159
45pm the shelter-in-place request is lifted

219
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,439
Then

220
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,719
17 minutes later

221
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,071
At 6:42 p.m. the police get a 911 call from someone who lived it

222
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
C7 Franklin

223
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:19,423
Tell him that there is a bleeding man hiding in his boat

224
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
We just parked out in his yard

225
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:21,727
Gotcha

226
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,263
He did not notice those boats

227
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,335
It seemed to have been tampered with previously because he'd stayed indoors

228
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,127
Honoring the shelter-in-place request

229
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,711
After the request has been lifted he went outside to get some air

230
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,247
I already noticed that things weren't right

231
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
He looked under the tarp

232
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:35,551
Install person

233
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,415
Police immediately jump into action and they form a new perimeter around this

234
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:44,511
At 6:54 p.m. police fire on the boat but they're

235
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Quickly told to

236
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
C-spire

237
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,631
The officer who shot at the boat did not have proper authorization

238
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
But you saw motion

239
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,983
And as the suspect was thought to be armed and don't be willing

240
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Fire at least the last time I encountered him

241
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,615
You made a very bad assumption that he was about to be fired on

242
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,919
And then there's that sort of phenomenon

243
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,199
Contagious virus

244
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Police

245
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,087
Hear someone shooting and one of the main points of the

246
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
After Action Report which is we need better weapons discipline

247
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
No it's it's a common

248
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Joking

249
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
So many things were so

250
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,863
Some guy will fire off his machine gun and then 30 guys go off in the Commanders

251
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,447
Jesus Christ what are you guys doing

252
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
Yeah there's a phenomenon

253
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Wasn't play

254
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:33,151
I almost an hour later the police place a flash bags but they're ineffective in getting suspect

255
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
About

256
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,223
Negotiators came in to try and convince him

257
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
Surrender and that strategies pretty ineffective as well really want I really want to caution everybody

258
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,463
Maybe we should start with negotiator and then go to flashback

259
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
You know the order of those should be reversed

260
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,095
That's its angle that I think you can take

261
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
And I would it like being

262
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
Instead if that was Alex's

263
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,191
Perspective but he doesn't

264
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
He doesn't seem to

265
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,567
Not positive even if you look at all of it that someone didn't

266
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:07,967
Like try and get him out of the boat before this was professional

267
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
What's bigger 2/3 to know is that it the rock paper

268
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Scissors game

269
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
Boat beats flashbang

270
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,671
That's not always not always

271
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,279
So ultimately johar does leave the boat at 8:41 p.m. answer

272
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
Surrenders to the pool

273
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
The nightmare of the city's been living in for about 4 days

274
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Come to an end

275
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:31,007
Four people are dead and wanted suffered injuries that will lead to his eventual death

276
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,031
And hundreds are in

277
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
Callous people's lives have been changed in ways they will be a

278
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
Impossible to quantify your numbers but at very least

279
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
The suspects are dead or in custody

280
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
And the people of Boston

281
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,527
Can can breathe easily

282
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
And begin the difficult process of rebuilding and

283
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,343
And healing

284
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
But that can also wait until the morning

285
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,463
That night people flooded the streets in Celebration

286
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,487
More less formal

287
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
Flash mob

288
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
Decompress and release their tent

289
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,375
College students got drunk and yelled USA in large groups

290
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,007
More adult bostonians gathered to applaud and thank the law enforcement officers were putting themselves on the line to catch

291
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Call Britt

292
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
Watching the footage now even six years later

293
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
Later the feeling of unity in that

294
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Catharsis

295
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:09,919
Palpable

296
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
By the time Alex gets on are the afternoon of April 21st

297
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,783
The chaos is over

298
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,831
The Manhunt is complete

299
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,415
The temporary deployment of the Massachusetts National Guard has come to an end

300
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,975
The city of Boston had already announced the memorial.

301
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,255
The victims and survivors

302
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
Plant to be placed in

303
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
In Copley Square

304
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
The suspects are no longer on the Run

305
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,143
And the details of the actual investigation

306
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,423
Took place over the preceding

307
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
6 days

308
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:32,959
Are starting

309
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
To become

310
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
The cement has dried but Alex has managed

311
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Make a hellacious

312
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
Anton the surface and

313
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,687
As we jump back in here we'll see Alex entering the neck

314
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,455
Next phase

315
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
It is conspiracy building operation

316
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,367
When there was no information available he knows that he needs to lay the groundwork for his narrative

317
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,695
He does this by immediately insisting the event as a false flag

318
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
Displaying a

319
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,999
Confident knee-jerk defiance

320
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,559
The draws people in nubes take that confidence

321
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
Does big basin

322
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,119
Some kind of a wisdom or rebellious

323
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,679
As any information is come out

324
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,239
He's worked integrated into his narrative

325
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
And that's important

326
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,335
In this stage that we've been looking at so far

327
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,383
He doesn't adapt his narrative to match

328
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
Reality

329
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,711
He distorts reality to conform to his narrow

330
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:21,087
That Family Guy episode was actually about a tea party guy who joins the Taliban

331
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,391
That shifting reality to match

332
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
His narrative

333
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,439
CNN announcer

334
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:28,767
50 arrested been made not because they got bad information

335
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,303
But because they were scared of Alex

336
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
His coverage of the

337
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Pictures

338
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
Downtown Fortune

339
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,191
The courthouse in Boston was evacuated not because of a bomb scare

340
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
But because Alex blew up their plan so they had to

341
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Switch out there Patsy

342
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
Everything that Alex has been doing

343
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:46,175
Serves to use his overarching explanation

344
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
That this was a false flag that the globalists are not right

345
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
A cover-up to make sense of everything that happens that mites

346
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
I'm confused

347
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Because of the absence of

348
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Information

349
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
It's their rhetorical equivalent

350
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
A miracle pill

351
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
The cures

352
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,511
That he's trying to sell

353
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
That one weird trick for proper

354
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,071
Right now

355
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,655
Now that the suspects are in custody or dead Alex has to change

356
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
The next stage

357
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Conspiracy building

358
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,055
We're just discrediting every piece of information that comes out about the official suspect

359
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
Send the story surrounding their crime and arrest

360
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,943
This is still somewhat aimed at distorting reality to fit his narrative

361
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
But it's also

362
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
Hasn't necessarily involves the opposite as well

363
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:26,111
There will be elements of reality that he just

364
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Can't pretend aren't real

365
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,487
So in order to keep this going he does have to fine-tune his narrative along the way

366
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
There's a little bit of this

367
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,791
The shift to saying

368
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
They plan to blame the

369
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,583
Lucille's

370
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
That's an attempt

371
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,655
To jettison the white Patsy narrative

372
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
As being relevant to the conversation

373
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
And it all because

374
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
It's not

375
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:45,567
That's him shifting his narrative in order to better suit

376
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,103
The fact that are coming out

377
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:50,175
Are there two elements with Alex

378
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:50,943
She's doing that I buy

379
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,711
Find more lyric

380
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
I'd like to

381
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
Just say up front

382
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
The first is that this what

383
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:00,159
What this is doing is specifically in-service of creating an alternative

384
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,695
Alternative reality

385
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,231
Did Alex that makes money

386
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,535
It's profoundly disrespected

387
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,559
Full to the victims in

388
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Survivors of the attack

389
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
As well as the larger community of Boston

390
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
He's taking their pain and anxiety and trying to turn

391
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
The Profit which is up

392
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Abhorrent

393
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
The other thing is that if Alex has his way

394
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:20,383
He's trying to get johar's rnav off the hook for the bombing

395
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Now in 29

396
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,271
It's very easy for me to say that I have literally zero doubt about johar's scale

397
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,343
It's been very well substantiated both by hard evidence

398
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Circumstantial evidence

399
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
And his uncoerced

400
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,671
Confession and apology

401
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
There's a concrete reality

402
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,559
And it's that johar and tamerlan Tsarnaev committed this bombing

403
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
Alex is working

404
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
As hard as you can

405
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Create a reality

406
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
We're either they didn't do it or they

407
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Because the government was you

408
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,567
Which serve to shift culpability more than a little bit

409
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,871
In a very concrete and realsense

410
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Alex Jones

411
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,455
Right now as we're looking at him in 2013

412
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,783
Is making money by doing damage control for terrorist

413
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
Sometimes it's easy to lose sight of that but

414
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,695
You say that with all this judgment

415
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
It's easy to lose sight of that sometime so I just wanted to start off this

416
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Episode by bringing

417
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,327
Sharp Focus

418
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
And in this first clip we start

419
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Toosii

420
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,239
Kitty is making a bunch more money off

421
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:25,151
Well ladies and gentlemen entire team

422
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
Has an incredible responsibility

423
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:39,231
Infowars.com

424
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Quite a responsibility

425
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,239
We'll see how that plays out.

426
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Greater

427
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:55,871
Careful this or attention to detail

428
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,151
Christy is going to

429
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
Increase his acting responsible responsibility comes great profits

430
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
I mean is traffic is up 10

431
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
On time so like

432
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,951
He's gotten to that point by

433
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,559
Sort of mirroring amplifying bulshit on the internet

434
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:18,399
And sensationalising and lying about an ongoing

435
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
So why not

436
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:20,959
That up

437
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Market tests

438
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:23,775
At work

439
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:24,543
It's

440
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
It's just that

441
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
It's that thing where it's at

442
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
See that

443
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,639
Humanity

444
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,175
What are we doing

445
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
The idea that

446
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:33,503
In the absence of real information

447
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
Alex Jones

448
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Makes 10

449
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:37,599
Great

450
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
Great Humanity we're doing good stuff just to be fair it's not

451
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:44,511
Concrete that it's 10 times as much money I would have definitely

452
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
Could be

453
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
So Alex

454
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,143
All of the

455
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Stop his happy

456
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
Pandora

457
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
So Alex

458
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
Nose

459
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,263
The main

460
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
Beats

461
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:59,615
Of the resolution of the Manhunt all of this

462
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,407
And so he gets to talkin

463
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
About

464
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,455
Johar getting

465
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,991
Taken in by the police

466
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
And him

467
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Coming out of the boat

468
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,279
Critical condition

469
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,367
So none of that ended up happening

470
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,671
So that's cool

471
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:49,791
Prescription privileges for amnesia pills for healthy on everyone

472
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,327
Doctor's kit that is ice

473
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,703
Is the special when I was James Bond license to kill every globalization license for halcyon

474
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,239
Alright fair enough

475
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,615
Every single time there's some high-profile event Alex immediately says the person who's arrested for Disney

476
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,407
Can be drugged-up usually on housing

477
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:06,943
It's a very important piece

478
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
Strategy because as long as he

479
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
Consistently argues that arrested terrorist

480
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Drugged up

481
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,599
It doesn't matter if they confess their crimes

482
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,696
No matter I know do piece of actual evidence that they're guilty can

483
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,464
Penetrate this can

484
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Conspiracy theory

485
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Anything the police say is just a cover-up of the false flag

486
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:27,936
Anything the perpetrator says is just a result of them being drugged by the globalist to cover up the false flag

487
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,080
It's basically an insurance policy for his narrative that you needs to invoke whenever a suspect is not killed during the arrest

488
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
Leave aside for a moment that when

489
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,712
Someone who's suffering from a mental illness is incarcerated

490
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
UB Pro

491
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,760
Soundly in human

492
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,552
To not give them appropriate care

493
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Including appropriate site

494
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Evaluations

495
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,160
Just needed and also if needed medication

496
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:52,512
Where Alex is brainwashing an evil drugging the reality is generally just

497
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,328
Getting psychotic people on anti-psychotic medication

498
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,376
So they can ethically be put on trial

499
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Yeah

500
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,704
Yeah it is it is just inhuman to watch

501
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,472
Somebody with a very

502
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
Serious

503
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Mental illness

504
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Spew their nonsense

505
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:05,824
Into the f******

506
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,360
Like if your

507
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:10,432
In his family are married to her

508
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
The same place

509
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,224
He does if you'd

510
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,576
If you keep a man from getting the medication that he needs to live a

511
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,600
Woolrich healthy

512
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Play life you know I think

513
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,208
It's very trouble

514
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,024
So this tracheotomy argument that Alex is making

515
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,048
He was all the rage in

516
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
Conspiracy communities in the days after this

517
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,448
Stressed I guess what it largely traces back to an article that Alex posted on Infowars

518
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,800
The basic gist of this conspiracy is that after johar had surrendered

519
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,616
The police gave him a throat injury so he couldn't speak

520
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
And that's not blow the whistle about how he was being set up

521
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,784
Of course this Theory doesn't take into account he was still perfectly able to write

522
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,112
As he did as he was being questioned immediately by law enforcement

523
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
He was at the hospital

524
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,720
In October 2018 court filings were made public

525
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
Included 79 page

526
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,096
The johar had made Ian written while he's being questioned by the police

527
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,144
On notebook paper he wrote

528
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Lawyer

529
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,936
And quote

530
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:08,032
Listen buddy I know my rights no one is at risk no bombs no one will die

531
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,360
Yes the police quote is my brother alive

532
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
A number of Thai

533
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
In a moment where he seems to be acknowledging his own guilt

534
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,480
He says quote

535
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
We're at War my

536
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,320
When he's discussing the US military presence

537
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
Iraq and Afghanistan

538
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
Even says quote America is at war is it not I did what is nessus

539
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,232
My people are dying

540
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:30,048
Other notes seem to be clearly indicating that he

541
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
He's telling the police that this was a conspiracy of two

542
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,656
Quote no one else was involved

543
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
Quote only

544
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
He knew

545
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,984
Quote my brother and I

546
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,520
Quote we told no one

547
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:44,128
He pleads for them not to arrest tamerlan's wife who swears had no idea what they were plan

548
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,688
Whatever would have been achieved by Alex

549
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
Conspiracy theory of the police injuring johar's neck would not have mattered at all

550
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,344
It's not like he was scheduled to do a press to a writer

551
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,136
After getting arrested and now couldn't be

552
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Because he couldn't talk

553
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,208
The ultimately might not have been able to speak

554
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
But he was perfectly able to communicate

555
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
A box

556
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Also

557
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
You was able to speak again by April 22nd

558
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,680
First preliminary hearing

559
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,984
Which isn't Stark opposition to Alex's narrative

560
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Which is that johar may never be able to speak again

561
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
It is trial in 2050

562
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
Joe Hart

563
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
The standings of the

564
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,408
The following

565
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,224
Quote immediately after the bombing which I am guilty

566
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,296
If there's any lingering doubt about that let there be no more

567
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
I did it

568
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
I did do it

569
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,136
Get a hard dude

570
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,696
Do-it-yourself

571
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:33,280
Most of his trial was about how

572
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Tamerlan was born

573
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
I did it along with my brother

574
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
I learned of some of the victim

575
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
I learned their names their faces their age

576
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,544
And throughout this trial more of those victims were given

577
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
More of those victims had faces

578
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
And they hit burden

579
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,128
Insoles

580
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
Who got up on eyewitness

581
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,712
And that Podium related to

582
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,248
To me I was listening

583
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,272
The suffering

584
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
That's how I was

585
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,832
And the hardship that still is

586
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,112
With strength with patient

587
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:58,880
With dignity

588
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:02,208
Now Allah says in the Quran that no soul is burdened

589
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
With more than it can bear

590
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,072
And you told us just how him unbearable it was how horrendous it was

591
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,096
Does this thing I put you

592
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,656
And I know that you kept that much

593
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,448
I know that there isn't enough

594
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:14,240
Time in the day for you to have related

595
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
I also wish for more people had a chain

596
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
To get up there but I took them

597
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,944
Now I'm sorry for the lives I've taken for the suffering that I've caused

598
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:24,480
For the damage that I've done

599
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,760
Irreparable damage

600
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
I ask Allah to have mercy upon

601
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,088
Me and my brother and my

602
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,160
I asked a lot of bestow his mercy upon those present

603
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:32,928
I'm here today

604
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
And Allah knows best with the

605
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,768
Best those deserving of his Mercy

606
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,632
He may have pled not guilty initially but his defense never really even tried to say that

607
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
Didn't do the bombing

608
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Anyway about that naked

609
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,032
When police apprehended johar he was pretty Bang

610
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:53,920
He been in a shootout with the police the night before and then was inside that boat when officers were shooting at it

611
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Not to mention the flashback

612
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,528
In the process of that he suffered some serious injuries

613
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,904
According to the trauma surgeon who attended to him when he arrived at the hospital Doctor Steven Ray Odom

614
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:10,048
Quote he has multiple gunshot wounds the most severe of which appears to have entered through the left side of his mouth

615
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
An exit at the left face

616
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,096
Lower face

617
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,680
This was initially thought to be a self-inflicted wound a botched

618
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:16,704
Suicide

619
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
But he didn't have a gun in the boat

620
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,544
So the more likely explanation is that it's

621
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,360
Stray shot happened and it was remarkable that he survived

622
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:27,200
Dr. Odom said that the injury cause damage to his pharynx

623
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:29,504
Which was treated in the hospital including

624
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
Help of a trach tube

625
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
That was done

626
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
At the hospital

627
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,112
Not on scene

628
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,232
No one would do that outside the boat it wasn't it wasn't like

629
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,376
Helpful doctor on a plane is like it'd be a pain and stab the guy with the throat

630
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,216
Alex's conspiracy hinges onto photos from the scene of the

631
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,312
One shows johar standing approaching the police surrender

632
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:57,664
The other shows Medics attending to him with his neck appearing to be wrapped in gauze

633
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
According to Alex

634
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
The first picture shows no wound

635
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
And the second picture is of them treating a wound

636
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,576
Therefore the police must have

637
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Closed wound to silence johar

638
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,232
In reality the first picture of Zohar standing is very poorly lit

639
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:13,280
The entire left side of his neck is

640
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
Completely and Shadow

641
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:18,656
Other photos from the same release of images show johar and much better lighting

642
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,472
And that side of his face is almost completely covered in blood

643
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,288
The one image where the left side of his face is

644
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,568
Obscured by shadow

645
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:26,592
Look pretty suspicious

646
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:30,688
But if you look at all available images that argument falls apart is very

647
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,296
I like the idea of a person who is willing to accept

648
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
2 images

649
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,160
Is as all the proof you need

650
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:45,536
Call it a day guys with a wrap it up I got two pictures that's all I need

651
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:51,936
Many conspiracy theorists use that second photo of a neck wrapped in gauze as proof that the police are putting a tube into

652
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,984
JoJo Hearts throat at the seeds

653
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,336
And that's absurd just shows police using an assisted breathing man

654
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
Which is non-invasive

655
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:04,992
Everything that's provided as being suspicious here is exactly what you would expect to see you please

656
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,528
Encountered The Suspect with a wound

657
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
That was potentially

658
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
A Gabrielle

659
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
They are performing first

660
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
Sade

661
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,720
None of this is real at all it's based on out of context

662
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,024
Android soon as manipulative photos

663
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
They point so strongly

664
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
To the one with his face in

665
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Shadows

666
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,680
I'd like you don't see any wound

667
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,288
So anyway if you if you dump

668
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,824
A bunch of photos

669
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,384
You don't get there should be a law that you don't get to

670
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,784
Somebody if somebody just uses to and drowsy

671
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
Conclusion it's like

672
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
Another fine

673
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Find

674
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,648
You got yet that's a good indication they might

675
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
So that's one of his big ways to attack these

676
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
Nah that's why they put a tube in

677
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:53,376
Silence of a mediately

678
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Part of the new

679
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Strategy

680
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
The new

681
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Manifestation of the

682
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
So now they've killed all of the Patxi's

683
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,104
Except for their final Patsy

684
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
Who they

685
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:10,272
We didn't succeed in killing but they wanted to kill him but Brett shelter-in-place order was rescinded

686
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,344
Media was able to see Sarah

687
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
Alex

688
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Right

689
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah.

690
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
So this is

691
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,096
This is fun

692
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,912
This part isn't this next clip is actually like

693
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:30,752
All a lot of these are just dumb

694
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
Stupid and probably

695
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,080
Dangerous lies

696
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
This one is kind of fun

697
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:42,272
So much for joining us

698
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:48,160
Where should I start I start with this article out of a Hollywood Reporter

699
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:55,584
Red Sox player

700
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,656
He spoke from the Heart video

701
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,832
Emotional

702
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,928
But

703
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Okay

704
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,120
But you cannot be so we're done anybody else

705
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,936
Program

706
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:36,544
As American As baseball and apple pie

707
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,664
Over at Grandma's house

708
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:52,416
If you're in the Gateway

709
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,184
Active enforcement

710
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:59,840
So in their first number one story out of Boston April 21st

711
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:04,960
Get the number one story out of the way and then we'll get to the H2 news whatever that may be

712
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,752
Hey this is how he like this

713
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,056
That's a good indication of him taking Like These Boots

714
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Kind of like

715
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,360
Trivial issues

716
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,432
I'm trying to make them super important went like hey

717
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,736
The Boston bombing is resolved

718
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:17,504
But hold on

719
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:23,392
David Ortiz gets to say f*** it I don't I got to bleep it or I spent five hundred bucks or whatever

720
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,720
What about Janet Jackson's nipple where are we on that Dan

721
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:32,096
So in their first game back at Fenway Park the Red Sox are set to play the Kansas City Royals on April 20th

722
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:35,936
Before the game it felt appropriate to address the crowd

723
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
Because they had to cancel the day days before in the

724
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
Said he was in the state

725
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:43,104
And as David Ortiz is something of an elder Statesman

726
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,896
He was asked to say a few words

727
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,504
He thanked the governor and the police then said quote this is our f****** City

728
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
Nobody is going to dictate our freedom

729
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
Stay strong

730
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:58,976
Q2 the crowd going

731
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,560
I have no civic pride but I would be there being like

732
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,168
You get you get that one

733
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
Big Papi didn't get in trouble for this

734
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
Even though his comments were broadcast on live t

735
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,592
In fact the head of the FCC

736
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,640
See Julius Janikowski

737
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,664
Beat It Out quote

738
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,248
David Ortiz spoke from the heart today at the Red Sox game

739
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,344
I stand with Big Papi in the people of Boston

740
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:30,720
God can you imagine if the FCC really turned

741
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:37,120
The entire United States at her that no matter how much you hate bad language they heard that without

742
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,400
And that's like by like

743
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,448
My position is who gives a s***

744
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Call Bob

745
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,008
So there's a very good reason

746
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:49,408
Beyond just be horrible Optics of like trying to find a more but they decided not to fine

747
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
One of them is at the game was being broadcast on cable

748
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,528
Which is outside the jurisdiction of the FCC

749
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
The game is also hearing on the radio

750
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,904
So they could have hit him with a fine for that but there's another Elam

751
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,672
Went to the story

752
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
If it's important

753
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,232
Previous to the bombing

754
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:06,048
Julius genachowski I put in his resignation

755
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
Can I be head of the fcr the doors

756
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,240
Phuc yea

757
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:19,872
Passionate expression of solidarity in the aftermath of the tragedy

758
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:27,552
I put in my two weeks whenever you f****** want

759
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:32,160
It's like okay so somebody take over the FCC in like a month or like you wanted

760
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
Go back

761
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:36,512
And do you have fun

762
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:41,120
So Bleacher Report did an oral history of the speech Ortiz gave

763
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,912
And here's what Janikowski said

764
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,288
I knew there would be people who saw that he'd use the F-word on the airwaves and would ask

765
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:52,640
Mio's that a violation of the FCC Rule and is the FCC getting punished at

766
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,688
That's an editorial tone of voice but

767
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,528
My first thought was no f****** way we're going to party stuff

768
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,208
In the same oral history David Ortiz says what he remembers the head of the FCC telling

769
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,232
Yeah

770
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
It was like

771
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,304
Look you said something that got this city moving

772
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,352
Forward it took the fear out of people

773
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
You have no idea what you just said

774
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
That's going to be in the history of New England forever

775
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
It was right when we needed

776
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
Don't worry we needed that at

777
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Yeah you know what he also said

778
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
My last Act is not going to be the guy who find David Ortiz wrestling f*** yeah after

779
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:33,088
We caught the Boston Bomber I'm going down in history

780
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:40,000
After days of being on edge a terrifying 24 hours of this uncertain Manhunt at the city was allowed to breathe

781
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
The collective sigh of relief

782
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:42,560
Relief is good

783
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,376
And what David Ortiz did is hit a pressure release button

784
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,168
Providing a rallying cry

785
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,984
And no one not even the sensory sfcc

786
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Couldn't see

787
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,032
At this moment was important

788
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
For so many people

789
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
Equal measures of rebellious and reassurance

790
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:56,896
It was

791
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,760
Big Papi would end up hitting a grand slam to tie game to the alc champions

792
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:07,392
Boston playoff playoff hopes alive that year ultimately leading them to win the World Series

793
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,208
Authorities taking home the owners of World Series MVP

794
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,000
It's really the stuff of Fairy Tail

795
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:15,072
And anyone who can appreciate the 2013 Red Sox

796
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,864
Is either a complete monster

797
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Or just a die-hard yang

798
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,520
Yeah whatever still salty about not winning the World Series in 2001 after 9/11

799
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,056
God that would be

800
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:30,176
That's the only thing you could have done one thing

801
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
That's the day after 9/11 come out and then lie

802
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:36,064
Like fuk you terrorist I would have been like well at least we got one on the board

803
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,856
Said it was s*** all at all

804
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
From start to finish

805
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:43,744
Well I mean you just imagine a scenario where like I don't know a month after 9/11

806
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,768
You got

807
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
A-Rod

808
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,608
What's on the Yankees

809
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:54,752
Jeter comes out

810
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,520
I don't think

811
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:00,384
You know I understand the idea of selective enforcement being bad

812
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,176
But you also got to understand

813
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Come on

814
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,480
Come on come on

815
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:07,040
Grow up

816
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Tell Alexandra is is pretty much

817
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,904
I'm not anti profanity but

818
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,376
Or I just get mad all the time

819
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
Whenever I get back

820
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Piss

821
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,544
Alex thinks that this selectively enforce

822
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,104
Signing Derek

823
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,640
David Ortiz

824
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:34,176
Is tyranny

825
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
Because any kind of selective

826
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Enforcement is here

827
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,136
This is the essence of things are selectively enforced

828
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:49,792
Drunk spitting

829
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,840
Driving on the wrong side of the road

830
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:12,320
I empathize with that Alex is saying about selective enforcement but I also think that there's room for understanding

831
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Extenuating

832
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,696
If you excuse was just David Ortiz was emotional like Alex is trying to preserve

833
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:22,048
You know is if you just hit a game-winning home run

834
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
Really think that excuses a little bit soft

835
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,144
Given that he was just asking

836
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,448
To speak before the first Red Sox game back after

837
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
The city was terrorized by bombers

838
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,568
I think it's probably okay to enforce obscenity laws a little selectively in that case

839
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
How to get my advice

840
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
Italics grow up

841
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,176
Yeah the only thing you don't get to say is

842
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:44,576
Man I wish that bomber was still free like you don't get to say that one after the other

843
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,856
The bigger rich

844
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Now about this Austin

845
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:47,904
District attorney

846
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,464
Alex is talking about a woman named Rosemary

847
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:56,608
Who was arrested for drunk driving on April 12th after her car veered into a bike lane then into oncoming traffic

848
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,632
Allegedly

849
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,472
The officer pulled her over so an opened vodka bottle in the passengers

850
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
So this was what you call and open it

851
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Chuck case

852
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:08,384
According to an article in the Austin Chronicle the officer wrote in his affidavit

853
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,664
Thought you was quick cooperative

854
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Impolite

855
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Which seems counter to Alex

856
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:12,736
Does characterization

857
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
The day after her arrest

858
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,880
She wrote letters to the county attorney and the court and said that you would plead guilty

859
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:20,160
Expected No Lie

860
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,072
According to a later Chronicle article she was sentenced to 45 days in jail and lost her license for 180 days

861
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,888
She also had to pay a $4,000 fine which is

862
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:32,192
The highest fine allowable for a DWI

863
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
She was charged with

864
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,520
That's a form of BWI

865
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,080
The strictness of the punishment is for

866
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,104
Piccalilli notables

867
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
First offense

868
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
I gets very harsh

869
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Spotify

870
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,784
Kind of uncommon if you don't

871
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,576
Kill somebody or hurt somebody

872
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
To get any jail time

873
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Time for a first of

874
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:53,696
DUI this was a this was like a statement

875
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
Nobody is above the

876
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,000
And she kind of asked

877
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Yeah because

878
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,864
Recognize they would send a bad message we have to make us all look at

879
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:03,168
Aboveboard we have to do the whole thing

880
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,264
Never said that you was above the law and neither did she

881
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,080
They just felt that a DWI

882
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:13,408
Something that you should get thrown out of office for particularly when you take

883
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,688
Responsibility for your actions

884
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,552
All the details Alex's rattling off particularly her spitting on people is not

885
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Substantiated

886
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,928
Video from Lambert's arrest has been released and I won't lie it's not a good look

887
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,792
But it's not too different from Hope just about anybody would be after getting arrested for a DWI

888
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,864
She's trying to talk her way out of it being a little bit rude to

889
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
The police but

890
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
That crazy

891
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,752
I would imagine a lot of people would look

892
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,520
Way worse

893
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,080
If you had video of them getting arrested

894
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
And still kind of drunk

895
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,456
Alex is using allegations that were put out against lumbered by her.

896
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,552
The enemies who were trying to user. I DWIs way to get her out of office

897
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
Then Governor Rick Perry which I use the DWI to try to get her

898
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,928
Step down threatening that if she

899
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Yeah he would be fun

900
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
Her office

901
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:05,888
She refused he funded her office and then Perry got indicted by a grand jury for trying to coerce a public official to resign

902
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,936
Wait are you saying that you can't do that

903
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,240
Sequence of events

904
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:16,640
Play something that is enshrined in our constitution should be able to dishonestly and in Bedford

905
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,664
Precious

906
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,456
Did doing what you want in a public office

907
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:25,600
Perry fought the indictment and after he ended up leaving office all charges against him weirdest

908
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,440
Anyway this whole thing is a big two-sided

909
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:36,096
On what side you had a dat who got caught drunk driving last out a little bit then apologized and submitted herself to the process

910
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,120
Is it making things right

911
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,936
It's always wrong to drive drunk but if you do

912
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:42,240
And learned your lesson it's the best possible outcome

913
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,776
Short of not doing

914
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
On the other hand you had a

915
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,640
A concerted effort to blow the DWI out of proportion

916
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
And use it as a political weapon

917
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,456
To get a Democrat out of office

918
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,248
We see which side Alex's

919
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,040
Is just Towing

920
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
The GOP line

921
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,856
Trying to get a Democrat

922
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,624
APA RV

923
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,464
You know it's not that I don't want to say that it's blowing the event its

924
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,488
Tell about a proportion

925
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,304
I think DUI DWI

926
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,424
Very very serious

927
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,008
Like I don't think they're blowing it out of proportion I think they're using it in

928
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
Disingenuous and

929
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,336
Dishonest

930
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,920
I think we're saying the same thing

931
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
I agree

932
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,968
Maybe your phrasing

933
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,760
Yeah I just don't like that like

934
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,416
Blowing Auto it's just a DUI you know that guy I know trying to minimize

935
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
She's cleaning

936
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Fair enough

937
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:38,304
So Forbes apparently has written an article

938
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,608
And he's not happy about it

939
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,680
They don't like us conspiracies

940
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,752
You have

941
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,080
Americans love

942
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,671
And you know what are police martial law

943
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,255
Lockdown

944
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,935
I don't get on your house I will shoot you

945
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
Important point

946
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
No point

947
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,895
Was there an understanding that if you come out of your house you'll be

948
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:26,175
That is absurd

949
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:29,759
That it isn't it was a voluntary shelter in place

950
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,855
Request because they believed like okay yeah

951
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:38,207
I understand like if you work some job you don't want to go into

952
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,231
Perfect excuse.

953
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Pigtails

954
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
Most people

955
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:50,495
It's okay was it like a year later they did the Poland reference our last episode those 83

956
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,055
Still supported they behaviors

957
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,847
A year after the fact

958
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,919
You know that's that's that's like a

959
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,711
Casualty

960
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
You don't offer

961
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Something about with Alex

962
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,039
He just can't

963
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:08,159
Be happy he can't be happy they caught the terrorist and you can't be happy

964
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Because even care

965
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:12,511
Catching it is proof that they're still more work for us to do

966
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,815
Are there still lying to us or all that

967
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Cancel

968
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,887
There is no wind

969
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:20,703
Except the imaginary win over imaginary and

970
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
They will never come

971
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,591
So if you said that last clip at this is martial law and he's

972
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Some more about that

973
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:32,479
Your house

974
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,439
Exercising flag on the Republic

975
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
Posse Comitatus

976
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,567
Okay

977
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,407
So what happened in April on April 19th in Boston has all the opt

978
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,479
Necessary for Alex to call it martial law

979
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
And some very important points.

980
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,295
But he does not care to recognize

981
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,135
The first is as I've mentioned all the law enforcement action

982
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
Door-to-door searching the Dragnet

983
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,207
The shelter-in-place request

984
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,767
We're done by the state government through appropriate

985
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,607
All of Alex's martial-law fears involve the Federal

986
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
It specifically

987
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
FEMA

988
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,215
The situation doesn't match any of his tyranny fantasy

989
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
Cease at all

990
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
The second important aspect of this was very 10

991
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Temporary thing

992
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,383
Alex always talks about martial law coming in and staying in

993
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:39,039
It's not just a couple hours when an armed guy who's already killed a cop and bombed the marathon is on the loose and unknown area

994
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,111
For the situation to match analysis paranoid fantasies

995
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:45,951
They would need to have not caught johar and kept the city and martial law in the state of

996
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,487
The fear that's not what happened

997
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Finally

998
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,327
Most basically and most important

999
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
This was not Marcia

1000
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,703
This is important to point out because the way Alex uses that term

1001
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,263
Losing any meaning

1002
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
But martial law is a real thing

1003
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,847
It has defining characteristic

1004
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,639
So let's discuss a few of

1005
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
The first

1006
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
Is suspension of civil rights

1007
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,551
This did not happen in Boston in the aftermath of the bombing

1008
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
No one's rights under the Constitution

1009
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
Duchenne of Bill of Rights

1010
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Suspended

1011
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
Habeas corpus was still in play

1012
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
They did resegregate the

1013
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,743
Schools during that lockdown

1014
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
That was a really weird and not

1015
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,815
Is a really weird day

1016
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,583
They

1017
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,399
Brought back probation and I got rid of it again

1018
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
And then brought back a second time

1019
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,751
The second characteristic is military coup

1020
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,031
Control of civilian

1021
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
This did not happen in Boston

1022
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
Massachusetts National Guard were allowed

1023
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:39,455
For taking policing activities at the order of the governor

1024
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Wheatley const

1025
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,831
I think we're not in charge of normally civilian governmental rolls

1026
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,647
The chain of command and governmental structure remains

1027
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
I done changed

1028
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
From how things were on April 4th

1029
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,231
Before the bombing

1030
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,023
The third feature

1031
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,095
Is civilian being tried in Military Tribunal

1032
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:58,143
This did not happen in Boss

1033
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,751
They're plenty of examples from history of actual martial law and what happened looks

1034
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,519
Nothing like the

1035
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
And here's the thing that Alex whenever address

1036
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
It's the most crucial thing

1037
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Like I said

1038
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
No one had to

1039
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
Stay inside their home

1040
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,735
Is merely request the governor made

1041
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,783
There's no punishment they would face they left their home

1042
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:20,671
There's a bunch of pictures you can find that other people have posted of that day highlighting the Eerie emptiness of the city

1043
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
But if you look at those pictures

1044
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:25,279
They all are almost all of them have people walking around

1045
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,143
There's the shelter-in-place was entirely voluntary most people felt

1046
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:30,911
Made sense

1047
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
To stay inside

1048
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
This is not

1049
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,591
You could have just said we're doing a Citywide Manhunt

1050
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Most of the city have been like

1051
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
Cool

1052
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,479
Hey there's some cartoons on

1053
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
Dislike

1054
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,831
Categorically what he what happened in Boston is nothing

1055
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:49,599
Close to Marshall

1056
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:55,743
And the way Alex uses that term cheapens the reality that martial law is a real thing and it's a f******

1057
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
Scary Prospect

1058
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,143
In 2019 there are literally people calling for things that are characteristics of martial law

1059
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
And they're all Trump's

1060
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,495
So I I just like

1061
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:09,567
The reason I think this is important to like look at some of the

1062
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
These defining characteristics

1063
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,431
Martial law is Alex's brand is mr. martial law

1064
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,711
And the way he uses that

1065
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
Term is so not

1066
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Correct

1067
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,599
Deserves it deserves a little bit of a foe

1068
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:23,391
I mean the the

1069
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,671
They

1070
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,231
Secretary of Defense did appoint lieutenant colonel

1071
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:27,999
Kincaid Topeka

1072
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:28,767
Comptroller

1073
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Boston

1074
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
So there is a little bit of a military

1075
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,471
Examples from American history like

1076
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
Chicago Fire

1077
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:42,591
Like that that that was actual martial law military took over

1078
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,383
That's crazy

1079
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Anton

1080
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Sure that

1081
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:48,991
Sometimes it's not done in a way that's to oppress

1082
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,063
The citizens B

1083
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:52,831
It looks

1084
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Without what what happened to God

1085
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Score cheap

1086
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,207
I did there

1087
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
There's no way that you

1088
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,303
It's one of those things where you can throw around

1089
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,351
This is martial law all you want but

1090
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
Listen through it is like

1091
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
Probably not

1092
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:12,543
So Alex has decided of course that there was a drill going on

1093
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
Marathon which he has failed to really establish

1094
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,175
One of the ways that

1095
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
He uses that to

1096
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:20,991
Approved

1097
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,015
Was a false flag

1098
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Because these other time

1099
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:25,087
Games in the past when there have been drills

1100
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
That was also false

1101
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,439
One of the ones that he brings other we haven't really disgusting

1102
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
Detail is the seven

1103
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,487
7 bomber

1104
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:32,767
And Alex

1105
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,559
Discusses house that was a drill in this

1106
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,631
Next clip and then I'm very excited to explain to you what he's

1107
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,167
He's actually talking about

1108
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:41,215
Okay how full of s*** this guy

1109
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:50,687
SWAT

1110
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
2000s

1111
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:07,071
I cannot stress this

1112
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,863
Alex thinks that everything

1113
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:13,471
Every major event in the world is orchestrated by the globalist to that take the

1114
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
These drills make

1115
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
Then go live in order to cause chaos and push their agenda

1116
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
Every single one

1117
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,663
In case the Boston bombing Alex has been making frequent references

1118
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,943
The 7/7 bombings

1119
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,223
London and how there was a

1120
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,247
The drill that same

1121
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,879
As a way to strengthen his argument that the Boston bombing was a false flag as proven by the drill they were having that day

1122
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:34,463
As we discussed on the April 15th episode there's no evidence

1123
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
There was any kind of a drill

1124
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
The marathon

1125
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,071
There's some indication that there was a crowd to see

1126
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,607
Cessation exercise happening

1127
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,631
Police dogs

1128
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:46,751
Alex has taken that turned it into their being a bombing drill going on with literally no evidence

1129
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:48,543
Except a couple pictures you found on 4chan

1130
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,639
I waited a while to discuss the 77 stuff because there were more pressing

1131
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,199
But now I feel like it's a real good time

1132
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Touch on this issue

1133
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,247
And how foolish it

1134
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,551
On July 7th

1135
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
2005

1136
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
4 terrorists

1137
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Detonated bombs

1138
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:04,159
Three of them in the underground train

1139
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,951
And a fourth on a double-decker bus

1140
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Killing 52

1141
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:09,023
It was a horrible attack

1142
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,047
The deeply traumatized

1143
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:13,119
That same day after the bombings

1144
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,399
A man named Peter power

1145
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,191
Who ran a company called visor

1146
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:21,311
Consultants went on BBC and said that he'd been working on a drill that involved simultaneous bombing

1147
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,359
At the same stations that the attacks

1148
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
I taken place

1149
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
From that

1150
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:28,735
Alex and Paul Joseph Watson began spinning a conspiracy

1151
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,295
It what happened is that these girls were being

1152
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:33,087
Carried out by this consulting firm

1153
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:33,855
And the global

1154
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:37,183
And in the middle of the event things went hot and the bombings

1155
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,743
They were the leaders

1156
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,047
Honest Theory and we're largely responsible for it

1157
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Dissemination

1158
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
And they did literally

1159
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
0 fact-checking research

1160
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,167
At all

1161
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:53,567
Oz article on the supposed drill says that they were quote running a 1000 person strong exercise which

1162
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,383
Drill D London Underground being bombed at the exact

1163
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
Locations

1164
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,431
The exact same time

1165
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
As happened in real life

1166
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:04,831
This is obviously meant to tell the reader that there were a thousand people involved in this drill to test

1167
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:05,599
The response to

1168
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Obama

1169
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
However this is a complete lie

1170
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:13,279
And they would have held that if they reached out to mr. power

1171
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,327
Or look into this anyway

1172
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Before deciding on a narrative

1173
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
Here's a power actually say

1174
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Quote

1175
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:25,567
And 9:30 this morning we were actually running an exercise for a company of about 1,000 people in London

1176
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,615
Based on simultaneous bombs going off

1177
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,407
Precisely at the railway station

1178
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
Where it happened this morning

1179
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,015
The Thousand person number was how many people worked at

1180
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
The company for whom he was doing

1181
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
The presentation

1182
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:40,415
And there was a very low likelihood that all of them were even in his session

1183
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
His lecture that he

1184
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,279
This was a corporate seminar the power was presented

1185
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,559
There were no people in

1186
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,631
Streets there were no there was nothing other than a sin

1187
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,679
Scenario in a PowerPoint presentation

1188
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,471
Coincidence

1189
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,543
People who have looked into Peter power of suggest

1190
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,567
He was doing a little bit

1191
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
Self-promotion

1192
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:02,687
And this BBC presentation

1193
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:04,223
Scenario did not

1194
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,295
The events of the 7/7 bombings but it's

1195
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
His business is best

1196
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,367
To make it appear that the corporate risk

1197
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Lectures

1198
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
But he gives all his clothes to

1199
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,207
Prophetic is possible

1200
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
That this is it

1201
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,791
This is the drill that Alex

1202
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,327
Approved the 7/7 bombings

1203
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
Was a false flag

1204
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,143
And attention-hungry corporate like

1205
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,727
So this dude is on a self-promotion grift

1206
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,567
And then he's used by right-wing propaganda grifters

1207
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,871
In order to f******

1208
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,663
Facilitate more terrorism

1209
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,247
Cool cool interact otter incomplete

1210
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,807
How cynical Alex and Paul Joseph Watson

1211
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,671
There's literally no way they can keep doing this and have no idea that they're complete fraud

1212
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
Can you imagine a Trane Macon

1213
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,327
Like Alex getting on Aaron trying to argue that the bombing was fake because the guy was given the risk

1214
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:54,399
Assessment seminar that its similarities to the bombing

1215
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,751
Can you imagine it being straight up with the audience about this alleged to grill not being anything

1216
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,775
Involved the police

1217
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Operatives or anyone on the

1218
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,127
The street and only existed as a PowerPoint presentation

1219
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
He never do it

1220
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,687
Because he's a liar

1221
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:11,295
All terrorist acts begin this PowerPoint presentation

1222
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,831
We all know this

1223
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,391
I've I've seen the Isis materials

1224
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,695
They don't use Keynote

1225
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,999
They try it at the very beginning but it just

1226
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,023
That you couldn't pay it

1227
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,047
Long enough so they

1228
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
The Powerpoints

1229
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,119
It's it's a very complicated

1230
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
They still used

1231
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
Sherp

1232
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:32,799
I can't find the article that I was referencing when he says that are experts as The Mastermind of the 7/7 bombings

1233
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:33,567
MI6

1234
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,895
I searched Infowars website and I found a blurb about the

1235
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
Relation to Guy on Fox

1236
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,759
Snooze saying that Haroon Rasheed a SWAT

1237
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:44,831
May have worked with British intelligence in the 90s

1238
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:45,599
In Bosnia

1239
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:50,719
That may be true but it doesn't prove that he was ever or is still in ma-6a cited 2000

1240
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,255
Five when the bombings happen

1241
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
It certainly doesn't prove the

1242
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,327
The bombings were false flag at all

1243
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,423
Also Haroon Rasheed a squad was not one of the 7/7 bombers

1244
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
Summer

1245
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,495
Suggested that he was The Mastermind

1246
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
But this absolutely

1247
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,055
Has not been proven

1248
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:08,639
Whether or not is what was the string puller of the 77 attack

1249
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,943
Whether or not he worked with British intelligence 15

1250
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,503
Plus years earlier in a regional conflict

1251
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
None of that matters to the larger Point Alex's Baker

1252
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:16,831
Those things

1253
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,879
Can be true and not be evidence

1254
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
But this was a false flag

1255
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
That's possible

1256
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:21,951
So I don't really care

1257
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
The Central Point that he's making

1258
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
About to disappear

1259
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
Drill and his version of that is

1260
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,935
Also I'll swap is not Saudi Arabian he was born in the United Kingdom

1261
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Prince family

1262
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,751
So goodbye

1263
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:41,407
But he's trying to leave in Saudi Arabia a little bit it's a little more hot in the Boston

1264
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
Common conspiracy world

1265
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:43,967
By the 21st

1266
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,015
Inez Brown so nobody's going to look into it

1267
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:46,783
I did

1268
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:52,415
So there's another piece of information that has come out that is that Russia

1269
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,695
The Russian intelligence

1270
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,719
Had warned

1271
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
The United States

1272
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,791
It's about tamerlan Tsarnaev

1273
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
Okay

1274
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,351
So now this is going

1275
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,375
Become a central piece

1276
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:02,911
Of Alex's rhetoric

1277
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,287
Years ago

1278
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,223
By the way

1279
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,807
5 years ago

1280
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,231
I'm just giving you the information

1281
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Sure don't

1282
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:37,215
Attaque 77

1283
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
Prove

1284
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Anyway

1285
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,919
Anyway

1286
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:47,967
It's more like

1287
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,503
You know

1288
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,831
Everybody that was around in the 80s and 90s

1289
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:57,183
They worked with the FBI the CIA and then they became terror is it there

1290
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:02,047
The 80s like the Iran-Contra and that whole thing was like The Velvet Underground for Terror

1291
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:08,191
Inspiration everybody but everybody who started their own terrorist

1292
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
You know what I'm saying

1293
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,055
Interesting interesting metaphor

1294
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:18,943
So on the question of whether or not Russia warned the United States about tamerlan Tsarnaev the answer is they definitely did

1295
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,991
The FSB told us in March

1296
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:25,599
2011 that tamerlan was associating with known terrorists extremists and we should keep an eye on him

1297
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,695
This triggered an investigation carried out by the Boston joint terrorism task force

1298
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,535
They interviewed tamerlan but they were unable to surveil him because they evidence

1299
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:34,815
They had didn't rise

1300
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
The legal standard

1301
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Kind of a measure

1302
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
The FBI's memo of their about their interview

1303
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
This is just like

1304
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,103
Come on you can stare at him anyways we do it what are you doing with your laws come on

1305
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:50,687
Write the FBI's memo about their interview with tamerlan has been really

1306
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,759
And the interview took place on April 23rd 2011

1307
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,807
The readout sounds like a pretty

1308
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,855
Clear-cut interview following up on a tip

1309
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Russian intelligence

1310
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,951
Was tamerlan discussing that he goes to mosque once a week

1311
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,023
Has no connections or interest in radical Islamic ideas and

1312
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,303
Respect people of all faiths

1313
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
Open note in the memo that he tells

1314
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:12,191
BFDI battle someone he knew was approached by four men who claim to be

1315
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
FBI

1316
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
Who wanted to talk to

1317
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:17,567
They left no ID or way of contacting

1318
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
And them and he hadn't heard from them since

1319
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,431
This is definitely weird but it definitely doesn't

1320
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:26,527
Necessarily follow that these people were actually FBI or even with the government

1321
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:32,927
Some strong indications of come out that johar was selling drugs so tamerlan could have had some second or first-hand contact

1322
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,487
Criminal element who might want to try to intimidate him

1323
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
With that kind of a stunt there other

1324
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:40,095
Explanation for what this could have been

1325
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:42,911
The reason I strongly discount the possibility that these

1326
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,935
People are FBI

1327
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
Is it the report which

1328
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:45,983
Was restricted to

1329
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,263
Internal use only

1330
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,311
These four guys as an unknown entity

1331
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:55,711
It makes Pacific note at the end of the memo that tamerlan was open to report into the FBI if these men tried to contact

1332
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,575
Overall your left of the impression that the FBI doesn't know anything about these for guys

1333
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,135
Little idea who tamerlan

1334
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
Norbit

1335
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:06,719
I've been following up on this fsp

1336
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:10,559
By June 2011 they've done whatever investigating

1337
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,607
They could do and we're unable to find any links to

1338
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Terrorism

1339
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,447
Precise measure the additive to a Customs and Border Protection

1340
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,263
If you try to leave or enter the country

1341
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,055
Two notes

1342
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,079
In this database

1343
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:22,847
The Timberland

1344
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,639
And neither were effective in causing his

1345
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
Attention when he flew from New York

1346
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:26,943
To Moscow

1347
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:28,479
In January 2012

1348
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
And back

1349
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:30,015
In July

1350
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:30,783
2012

1351
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,319
The first note

1352
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
It didn't

1353
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,135
Consider him a high-priority Target

1354
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:37,183
So on the day that you was traveling to Moscow

1355
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,487
There were about 100 other names on the watch list

1356
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:40,767
Authorities were detaining

1357
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:41,535
Questioning

1358
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:45,887
And as he was a lower priority the resources available were expended elsewhere and he was able to go

1359
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
Get through

1360
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
Stopped

1361
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,751
By the time tamerlan returned

1362
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,543
That original note

1363
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,079
Ionic

1364
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
Border Protection

1365
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
Profile

1366
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Tyler whatever

1367
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,431
That is expired

1368
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,527
But a more severe Note have been made in the meantime which was still in effect

1369
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:05,343
This was the result of the second warning

1370
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,367
Mfsb

1371
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
Would you like to tamberlyn being

1372
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,695
Considered a very dangerous person

1373
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,463
And made his

1374
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
Attention Bandits

1375
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:17,631
However the agent who wrote that S Note misspelled sarnath when they were entering him into the system

1376
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
And that's when he tried to return

1377
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:21,727
The country that July it didn't raise any alarms

1378
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
This is the second time

1379
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
In the case of

1380
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:28,127
The story when proper data answering trouble

1381
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
Man

1382
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:29,919
That's

1383
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:34,271
That's such a bummer such a f****** bummer

1384
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
Instead of an a

1385
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
Hey typed Annie

1386
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
Now it's now it's a Boston

1387
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:46,303
I mean it's not a one I know it's not a one-to-one but man as far as butterfly effect that goes that's got to be

1388
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
Brutal

1389
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,095
Brutal thought

1390
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:54,495
So this is a lot being allowed to get back into the country is been the rude and some people speculating the tamerlan with an FBI

1391
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,775
Informant and it bent

1392
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,311
Clandestinely working

1393
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
Infiltrate Muslim

1394
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,359
Extremist communities

1395
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
On behalf of the government

1396
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,407
Sure

1397
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:03,967
As the theory goes according to Michele McPhee

1398
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,503
Facebook maximum harm

1399
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,551
Chamberlain wanted to be a US citizen

1400
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,087
Primarily so he could box

1401
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,927
The Olympics but he was on an intelligible for that because he'd been arrested

1402
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Did for domestic violence

1403
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,791
The FBI recruited him to be an informant

1404
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,351
That's his ability to travel while I was on the list

1405
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,655
In exchange for approving his

1406
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,423
Citizenship app

1407
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
Location

1408
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
Overtime as the promises Edition

1409
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,031
Citizenship never materialized

1410
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Timberland became angry

1411
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
Ultimately contributing to embalming

1412
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,943
True

1413
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,991
Well it's an interesting Theory but it's just that

1414
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:41,343
If there were proof I can probably engage with this a little bit further

1415
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
In write-ups for the book

1416
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
Makita even admits that this

1417
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:44,927
This is just a theory

1418
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,999
From a Daily Mail article quote McPhee's Theory

1419
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
What she admits

1420
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,303
She cannot definitively prove

1421
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,143
Was that a lion was a federal informant and then he turned on America after it's

1422
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,167
Application

1423
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,239
It's all good and well David.

1424
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:00,543
The possibilities that arise from that theory

1425
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,103
But the way her writing was covered with a b e response

1426
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,175
The claims that the FBI was handling Tamblyn

1427
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
14 years I'll add the story

1428
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,551
And the disclaimer that this is just what she believes and can't prove or second

1429
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,855
Thought he regrets later isn't that crazy

1430
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Yeah

1431
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:21,791
In terms of Alex's playing with the government it handled these brothers for five years that's just based on a claim by Tamela

1432
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,351
Mother who was arguing for her son

1433
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
So I don't take that to be all that

1434
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,215
I mean she's got a

1435
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,495
She's got some Skynyrd

1436
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,079
Yeah it was a little bit further

1437
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
Later on

1438
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:37,407
So Alex talked about that

1439
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
Clip

1440
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
His belief

1441
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,015
Sort of the thieves 4chan picture

1442
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
But he had

1443
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:43,807
I still like

1444
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:44,831
Really at the center

1445
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,415
You're the headlines group

1446
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,791
Brothers

1447
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,679
Boston mayor

1448
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,943
Remember

1449
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,967
Propepper

1450
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,527
But weeds

1451
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,623
So that's all

1452
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:24,767
But outages reading headlines on drudge and this might be a good time to point out something super important that I think we don't bring up enough

1453
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:28,095
That's how drudge Works how do I get to work to that he takes

1454
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,631
Existing news stories in Lancaster

1455
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
That's the primary function of

1456
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,775
Recite but that's not why I said is one of the most popular in the right-wing news

1457
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:39,359
His sight is number one with these dumb dumb

1458
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,895
Because he rewrites headlines

1459
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:43,199
It's the fifth and narratives that the right-wing pundits are already

1460
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
Disseminating

1461
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
He provides cover

1462
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
In the former taking

1463
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:48,063
Sensational stilted link headline

1464
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,087
The people like Alex

1465
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,111
Can just repeat

1466
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,391
And I'll under talkingpoi

1467
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
Credibility

1468
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,183
Princeton

1469
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,975
Let's take one of these headlines Alex

1470
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,303
Cuz reading quote no doubt Brothers not acting alone

1471
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,095
That was the link on drugs

1472
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,655
Which takes you to an article from the international business

1473
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:05,471
The actual article's headline is quote bossy

1474
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,495
Marathon bombing

1475
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:09,567
FBI hunts terrorist Sleeper Cell link to Tsarnaev Brothers

1476
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
In this article the international busy

1477
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:14,431
This time quotes an article in the Sunday Mirror which is

1478
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,735
Itself quoting an anonymous source quote

1479
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,015
3 investigation

1480
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
The credibility of the sources

1481
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,415
Was kind of a question because they say the bombs used at the marathon were quote highly sophisticated

1482
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,695
I meant call agents

1483
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:30,559
Sleeper Cell has up to a dozen members and he's been waiting several years for their day to come

1484
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:33,119
Both of these details have been shown to not be

1485
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
Which leads

1486
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:36,703
We believe that the Sunday Mirror got some bad info

1487
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,239
Which is that being reported in the

1488
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,007
International business

1489
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,823
Which is that being sensationalized by Drudge

1490
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,895
So we could be more easily used by people like Alex

1491
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,943
This is the information pipe

1492
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:50,271
Judges basically like a word cloud

1493
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,807
Yeah it's it's like

1494
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,367
If you go to that and you unfocus your eyes you can

1495
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,135
Can see all the

1496
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,671
White right-wing propaganda

1497
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
Live pulling out like

1498
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Like one of those

1499
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,999
One of those pictures

1500
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,559
Yeah one of those illusion

1501
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,839
Andre like it the boat

1502
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
Sure

1503
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
So is the next blinds even worse

1504
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:09,215
Two from Tajikistan encrusted

1505
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,263
What country is he trying to say there

1506
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,799
Is apogee Costanza

1507
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,871
The actual countries talking about it

1508
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
Which isn't even close to what he said

1509
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,735
Dial Tajikistan is not Kazakhstan

1510
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,759
Very different

1511
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,575
Alex is talking about johar's to roommate

1512
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
Who were taken in for questioning

1513
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,647
Their ultimate Lee arrest

1514
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:28,927
Students at the prison for

1515
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:31,743
Justice as they had gone to johar's dorm room

1516
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,767
And attempted to help him

1517
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Dispose of Evan

1518
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815
Including a laptop

1519
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
And a backpack full of fireworks

1520
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,887
There's no evidence

1521
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,959
Them having any involvement of the planning or execution of the attack

1522
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,775
Text but they did to make Rhymes to help your friend evade the law

1523
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:47,103
They both did short stretches in jail and were deported back to kha'zix

1524
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
When they were released

1525
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,711
I don't think there's anything too suspicious about this but the way Alex's

1526
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,479
Reporting this

1527
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
That's a

1528
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,343
I mean that's a good roommate I guess

1529
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,879
Sure

1530
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:01,951
I think I would have chosen

1531
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
Different

1532
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:05,279
Such as

1533
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,839
I'm f****** out dude by

1534
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Yep

1535
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,655
So we get

1536
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
Along the way

1537
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:16,543
Spinning his is Yarns about you know shohar was

1538
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:19,359
Trached on the CN rail never be able to

1539
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
The talk again right

1540
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,943
It's just exhausting

1541
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
Tiger

1542
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:27,807
And we know see that Alex is starting to

1543
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,831
To Pivot towards

1544
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,111
God blaming Saudi Arabia

1545
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,695
Right on San Jose California

1546
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,767
The Weeknd

1547
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
Canary current

1548
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,423
Off the coast of Africa

1549
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,007
The canary current

1550
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,967
America

1551
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
Hemisphere

1552
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
Okay

1553
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
Australia

1554
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:13,375
So he's doing a little bit of a riff on like Saudi Arabia did something so now we're going to attack other people

1555
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,143
Is working the weather

1556
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,703
You like it it's not it's not great been foundering

1557
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:20,543
So he's established that there was a drill at the marathon

1558
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:22,079
And you'll just

1559
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,895
See here how he tries to link it to the 77 drill

1560
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
Pharisee

1561
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
And as we

1562
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Disgust

1563
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,991
I was PowerPoint

1564
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,359
Location

1565
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:02,015
That's not good enough ahead of Scotland Yard

1566
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,927
He's not the head of Scotland Yard

1567
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,351
Aspired

1568
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:20,191
I've seen how they do this

1569
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,471
Over and over again

1570
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,287
When you know what he's actually talking about this just a

1571
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
Appears to be

1572
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
The saddest b*******

1573
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,407
That clip is so like

1574
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
Like it just

1575
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
State you see it clearly

1576
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:36,831
The scales fall from your eyes when you realize this drill that he's talkin about 77

1577
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,111
Is it corporate

1578
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:43,743
Like seminar a motivational speaker giving f******

1579
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:45,023
Performance goal

1580
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
On a t-shirt

1581
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:51,935
He's pretending that it's like actually people out on the app in the in the train

1582
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,471
And what have you I didn't like

1583
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,799
You can't think it's a giant Improv Everywhere bombing

1584
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,335
Yeah yeah

1585
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
Urus

1586
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
That bombing

1587
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
You have

1588
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
Noak

1589
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,735
Excuse to not know

1590
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:05,503
Vest

1591
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,343
I understand the day of you just see the CNN

1592
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:13,183
Interview with BBC interview with mr. power

1593
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:19,583
You could you could get it in your head and misunderstand things and then the next day a correct yourself

1594
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
Think about this

1595
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,655
In order to reinforce other lies

1596
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,423
You're telling

1597
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:27,263
It's just so clear I love his exasperation with like

1598
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
I've seen him do it so many times

1599
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:32,127
You said they've done it so many times

1600
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:32,895
You're boring

1601
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:38,015
You've convinced yourself so many times

1602
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,903
So Alex now knows that the FBI did talked

1603
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
2 tamerlan

1604
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,951
In 2011

1605
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
So

1606
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,279
He's convinced now

1607
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,327
That when they put out those pics

1608
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:52,607
Of the

1609
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,911
And they didn't know who they were

1610
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:57,471
And they needed the Public's help identifying them

1611
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
They were lying

1612
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,359
Boston Marathon bombers

1613
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:07,967
The brothers

1614
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:12,831
We don't know who they are

1615
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,623
Are these people

1616
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:21,279
Oh you don't know who your little project

1617
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,351
That's not

1618
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:30,239
Shown to be true and like I don't understand why this would be a compelling argument

1619
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,007
Somebody doesn't think

1620
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
Too deeply about things

1621
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:34,335
Like they did talk to them in the past

1622
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,407
How do they not know who they are how many f******

1623
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,943
People do you think the day

1624
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:39,967
Have

1625
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,527
On their radar and 3 per year

1626
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,319
This piece

1627
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,599
Entire thing

1628
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:48,927
With are you like fsbank check out this guy

1629
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,975
Could have been handled by like

1630
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,999
Two people

1631
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:58,655
They might not remember 2 years later in Tire FBI went to his apartment they all gather

1632
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,727
Weather in around they all took pictures they said remember this face

1633
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:06,847
In case something happens to years from now it's very understandable that they would not

1634
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,151
See him and be like aha I know who that is

1635
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
If you want

1636
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,223
Any episode of

1637
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,271
F****** Forensic Files you like a

1638
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,295
Every

1639
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:21,695
Every goddamn police department has their own database of fingerprints they don't even it you don't even know if somebody's fingerprints are in there for

1640
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:28,351
F****** yeah there they don't remember everything on file they were able to find that out

1641
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,375
He was dead

1642
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,983
Exact

1643
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,775
They did already

1644
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,055
You know taking him to the hospital

1645
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:42,175
So I think that it's very reasonable to assume that the FBI

1646
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Might not know who they are

1647
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,527
Even though they talked to him before I do not think

1648
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
That is some

1649
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
But look dude

1650
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
Leaders do false

1651
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,999
Just established

1652
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,279
Good luck man

1653
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Hey

1654
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:01,119
L do false Flags you need an example

1655
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,519
Of course government

1656
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,079
Declare martial law

1657
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,407
Can people

1658
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
So his first

1659
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,647
Example is Emperor Palpatine

1660
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Right

1661
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,951
His first

1662
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
Example

1663
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,487
Is

1664
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
A kids movie

1665
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,559
Yeah any second example

1666
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:31,327
Is

1667
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Fake

1668
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:32,863
History

1669
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
Good stuff

1670
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
Okay got you

1671
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,471
So those are two concrete

1672
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,263
Yeah absolutely

1673
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:41,567
It's this bad work

1674
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
Alex's

1675
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,895
Buick more toward Saudi Arabia

1676
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
And that's where the narrative

1677
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
And pudding

1678
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,991
Some sort of blame that Direct

1679
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:51,551
What's interesting is that there's another guy

1680
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,599
I was doing that to by the name of Glenn Beck

1681
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,647
Glenn Beck is going

1682
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,671
Hard

1683
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,487
Yes particularly on the

1684
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,535
The guy who the police question

1685
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,815
He was one of the victim

1686
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:04,863
Come to the bombing Saudi Arabia

1687
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,959
That we talked about episodes back.

1688
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,727
Left

1689
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,287
The realm of Suspicion about this guy

1690
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,847
You someone Glenn Beck is focusing

1691
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:15,615
Not very

1692
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,895
Closely

1693
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
No and Alex's

1694
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Seahawk

1695
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:22,527
Mileage out of that lets

1696
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
Let's throw him into my boat

1697
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:28,671
Yeah

1698
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:04,511
Yeah you do a good job with that I don't think two something

1699
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279
Thing until it didn't

1700
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,303
In the news

1701
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,839
What is that mean

1702
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,119
What is that

1703
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:09,887
Meme I don't know

1704
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
Like what does that mean

1705
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,703
So while Alex has been a bit more

1706
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,775
Scattershot with his coverage of the Boston bombing and it's been shifting

1707
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,567
Theories to accommodate a whole bunch of different

1708
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
Suspect

1709
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,151
Same can't really be said for his mortal enemy Glenn back

1710
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,247
In between back segments criticizing Alexandria piercing in

1711
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Comparison

1712
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,319
Spending a lot of time working up a

1713
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:32,927
Conspiracy theory of its own and it centered around that Saudi Arabian student injured at the bomb

1714
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,719
I've been very

1715
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,023
Consciously trying to

1716
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
To not name

1717
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,327
Can people who are caught up in this thing

1718
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,863
Except when necessary

1719
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,399
Particularly victims

1720
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,959
Both the actual bombing and the propaganda surrounding it

1721
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:48,031
I don't feel like they deserve to have their names attached to this tragic

1722
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:52,639
And leaving them on named it something I consider a small Act of honoring their right to live a normal life

1723
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,431
After this more misfortune

1724
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
Seldom

1725
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
When where we discussed the student

1726
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,039
Texted him being questioned

1727
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,063
I stuck to that Stan

1728
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,879
But now that Glenn Beck is involved I need to get more

1729
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,439
In the days after the bombing

1730
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:10,815
Glenn said on his show that they'd uncovered information about a quote very bad bad bad man

1731
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,351
Reclaimed was involved in

1732
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:17,471
It seems like it's a universal trait that right-wing s******* broadcasters

1733
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,287
Really think they're speaking directly to the government on their shows

1734
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,079
Because Glenn made an ultimatum

1735
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:25,151
Ultimatum to the government

1736
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
If the government

1737
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
I deal with this very

1738
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Batman appropriately

1739
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,783
Play he would reveal them on his show

1740
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:33,087
He called them quote the worst of the worst

1741
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,135
And even appeared on Bill O'Reilly show.

1742
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
Despite his accusations further

1743
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:40,255
Naturally the government didn't respond to Glenn wanted so you kept

1744
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:43,583
Does word and accused Abdul Rahman Al harbi

1745
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:44,351
Of being

1746
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,119
Money man

1747
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,655
Facilitated the attack

1748
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:49,471
And if given the quote go order for the attack

1749
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,031
Al-harbi is the study student

1750
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Who was injured in

1751
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,175
Glenn Beck for all the money there ever was

1752
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,967
Glen claim to receive

1753
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
This info from

1754
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
But he refused to elaborate or reveal the sources

1755
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,647
It's super important to point out though that by the time

1756
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:13,279
Glenda is making these accusations on are the FBI already spoken to al-harbi and it publicly announced

1757
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Involved

1758
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,399
They would publicly announce Dan

1759
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,215
So naturally alharbi Sue Glenn back in 2014

1760
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,031
Good going to argue that alharbi was a Publix

1761
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,591
Figure which would provide summer

1762
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Undertaker f******

1763
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,503
Sally down the street from me Mickey

1764
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,087
Story about her put her on the news 24/7 and then yeah

1765
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:41,951
She's technically a public figure to provide him some cover for irresponsible reporting

1766
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,767
It's way harder to prove defamation against public figures

1767
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,559
The judge had no time for that

1768
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,887
Andrew B alharbi was absolutely a private figure

1769
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
And returned

1770
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,959
Decision saying that back had to disclose his sore

1771
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,519
Naturally Glenn wasn't going to do that

1772
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,567
So he paid an undisclosed amount to settle

1773
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,895
It's tough to imagine what the amount he paid out was

1774
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:04,223
Was considering the person he was paying with someone he'd accused of orchestrating a

1775
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
Terrorist attack

1776
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,551
But I'm certain he'd rather pay any price

1777
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,879
Then haven't revealed publicly that he just makes up sources Annabelle edges

1778
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,903
What they tell him

1779
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
To an egregious degree

1780
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,487
Covering that up is priceless

1781
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,303
If that suited proceeded

1782
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:23,935
There's little doubt in my mind you would have never been able to go on his dumbass I'm sorry tour after Trump was like

1783
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:29,055
I can find no evidence of the Saudi student had a bunch of relatives were on terrorist list

1784
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:35,967
It is true that there are number of people named alharbi on the side Arabian watchlist but I can find no actual proof that they're related to

1785
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,735
To the student

1786
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,783
There's a bunch of dumb blogs like

1787
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:41,855
I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ. Com

1788
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,671
The only evidence provided is that they have the same surname

1789
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,719
Also returning

1790
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
If you did have relatives

1791
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,071
They wouldn't do s*** to prove it he himself as a terror

1792
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:56,447
Who's in the show supposed to be about individualism and reject the notion of guilt-by-association

1793
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,007
This is the sort of s*** I would just bring it to the table

1794
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:05,663
Citing evidence that alharbi is a terrorist based on information put out by his arch-rival with which ends up getting his arch-rival suit

1795
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:09,759
And the rest was just dumb right-wing blogs

1796
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,551
Also

1797
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,903
A pretty fun revelation of this lawsuit is that we learned some of Glenn Beck's

1798
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:16,927
Employees names

1799
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:19,743
Which are pretty strong Arguments for nominative.

1800
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,791
Or the idea that your name

1801
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:24,607
Determines what you'll do in life

1802
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,423
The president of the blaze at the time was named

1803
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,191
Joel cheek

1804
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,471
Wood

1805
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:31,263
I'm going backs producer was named

1806
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,287
Joe weasel

1807
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,567
Really

1808
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
God

1809
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:37,407
Dammit be there not nicknames either

1810
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
Full on

1811
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:43,039
I am proud of the weasel named legal in Ohio

1812
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,319
Literal weasel

1813
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:45,599
Gotcha

1814
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:50,207
Yep so Glenn Beck get sued for this I think Alex is probably on the outskirts

1815
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
Getting himself name

1816
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
Suit butt

1817
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,815
You know

1818
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,351
It's still what he's doing is

1819
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:58,911
Is the same sort of behavior that led to

1820
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,703
Back having to pay a bunch of money

1821
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,799
So anyway Alex gets into the drill there was a drill

1822
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
At the bombing

1823
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:06,847
Not here yet

1824
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:12,223
Witnesses on record track

1825
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,551
It's just a drill

1826
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,903
Everybody

1827
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
That's the Funk

1828
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:26,559
Turn of the drill everyone's got bags so don't own a car

1829
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
This here's the thing

1830
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:31,423
The ol Switcheroo rudan the old hide the forest

1831
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
Inside the tree yeah

1832
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
So here's the thing

1833
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,567
All of the evidence that he's siding for it being a drill is

1834
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,615
Imaginary or deeply and Bell

1835
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:41,407
So it makes it

1836
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,735
Tough for me to hear this next clip and think he's being

1837
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:50,367
And there wasn't

1838
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:08,287
All the Alex is saying there for reasons he thinks something

1839
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,847
Suspicious is up here is they're all completely fake

1840
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,919
The evidence that he has that there was a bombing drill is

1841
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:18,271
Completely blown out of proportion and he absolutely can't even come close to proving what he's putting out

1842
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:22,879
There isn't evidence of a drill they're just pictures of Civilian. Civil support team

1843
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:29,023
That's an ultrasound on 410 and written a mystery novel about imagining that they're secretly Navy Seals

1844
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,815
There wasn't a cover-up of a drill

1845
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:33,375
They're just officials who have no idea what conspiracy

1846
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,167
Bulshit is flying around on the internet

1847
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,959
Let me know really interested in the dumb picture

1848
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:41,055
Fortune not engaging with your conspiracy is not evidence of a cover-up

1849
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
Johar wasn't

1850
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,359
Tracheotomy to me

1851
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,639
We is Alex's suggested

1852
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,431
And even if you couldn't talk for a very poor

1853
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,967
Free time you still able to communicate

1854
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,271
Also he was able to talk with them daisies

1855
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,063
Just couldn't talk while your throat to Ben

1856
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:54,367
Cuz he was recovering from a wound with ferrets

1857
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:56,159
They didn't try to blame right winger

1858
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,183
I was just

1859
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,975
Feels like they were going to blame right way

1860
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,791
I created an elaborate narrative surrounding those pictures

1861
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Fortunate

1862
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,631
Where random person in the shot was anointed the white patches

1863
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
Zero evidence of anything other than Alex

1864
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Good feeling

1865
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,471
Literally

1866
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,263
Nothing I was just saying to supported

1867
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
Conclusion that the bomb was fake is

1868
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
It's just absolute

1869
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,128
It's the worst kind of work

1870
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,152
A person can do

1871
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
Also small point

1872
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
I hate two people dance

1873
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760
Honey bees absolutely do not

1874
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
Tell 200-plus people a year

1875
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:26,624
Some decent numbers I have found said that Hornets

1876
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,648
Bees and wasps

1877
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
Combined kill about 1.4

1878
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,232
Upper ten million

1879
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,792
We're approximately 45 people in the

1880
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,560
The United States

1881
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:39,424
Also comparing the number of people killed in the bombings the number of people killed by bees is pretty UPS

1882
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
Who won both people die from bees are allergic

1883
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,288
Whereas we're all allergic to bomb

1884
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,824
Perhaps more importantly

1885
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:48,128
These are a very important part of our

1886
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,432
And without them a lot of plans with Diane

1887
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,456
The same as not

1888
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
True love

1889
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:58,624
People who bomb thing the Redwoods you know the forest fires clear off all the brush and then the Redwood

1890
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,952
If we didn't have bombings then how would we rebuild our cities

1891
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,744
It's the circle of life

1892
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,536
Everybody knows it's just that

1893
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
SEPTA

1894
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
Is part of Howell

1895
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,888
You know the things work

1896
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:15,520
Sure I hate him so much for 45 a year is Hornets wasp

1897
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
And

1898
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,592
I really hate to be pedantic

1899
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
I know you

1900
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,432
I was going to watch over

1901
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,968
That's not all bees

1902
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,504
These might be like

1903
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,272
6

1904
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:29,344
It just so infuriating to listen to him talk

1905
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,136
On a day like this

1906
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160
Because

1907
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:36,256
All of the bulshit he said he sang with such confidence because you're like

1908
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,048
Oh well I guess he must already

1909
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:38,816
Fruitvale

1910
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:45,472
Kyrie wants you to go for the past 5 days and then just came in on

1911
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:49,312
And even though you had what watch the regular news the whole time

1912
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,128
If you just suddenly walked into this show you're like

1913
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:58,784
Oh s*** he must have proved all this s*** cuz he I must bring the episode

1914
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,552
Absolutely

1915
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,856
NetSpend

1916
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,648
A hundred percent

1917
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
A hundred percent

1918
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,720
I do not believe it's not in

1919
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,512
No absolutely not

1920
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:13,120
Can I can even feel my head just like trying to go towards their while

1921
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,656
Give me like

1922
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,448
This confident without

1923
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,264
Something

1924
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,800
He literally has nothing

1925
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,080
Almeda

1926
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,872
So Alex

1927
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,920
I'm here this 21st

1928
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,944
Is April 21st a

1929
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,968
Episode he goes to call

1930
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,528
And I one of these callers brings up

1931
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,064
An old article from

1932
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,344
From the Boston Globe

1933
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:39,488
Arizona

1934
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:44,608
Good job good jobs that is true human

1935
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,424
So this caller is brought up this article and Alex

1936
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,216
Just found it this color is a human

1937
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Yes now listen to Al

1938
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,056
Talkabouttd

1939
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,640
The whole situation

1940
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
Negril

1941
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
Now

1942
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,208
Resume he reads the entire article from there

1943
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
License Porton

1944
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,512
You noticed that

1945
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,864
The first time he read the actual head

1946
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,936
Which is quote Marathon as a dry run disaster

1947
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,472
The second time

1948
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
He added the word drill

1949
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:24,032
To the headline

1950
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:25,056
It isn't there

1951
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:25,824
Okay

1952
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,848
That's intention

1953
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:27,616
Alright

1954
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:31,712
That is very intentional

1955
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:38,112
Course it's against the weekend there's a

1956
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:44,512
Flag on the field there's something

1957
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,584
Go to a headline because you're trying to say this was a drill

1958
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,864
If that is

1959
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
Dirty pool

1960
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,472
You should have him bleep that shitt I don't give a fuk

1961
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,752
Buck if you saying

1962
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:57,056
F****** did it it should be goddamn

1963
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:06,016
So beyond his reading off his headline one of his collar sent him from the globe in 2008

1964
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,088
Marathon is a dry run disaster

1965
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:13,952
Could hardly be better tailored what he's been putting out unless you lie and throw drill on the

1966
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:18,048
That one really helps that really help

1967
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,328
However when this is

1968
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,632
Conversation where Alex is arguing

1969
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:23,680
The bombing was a false flag it's important

1970
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,728
Discuss the content of the article not just

1971
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,496
The headline

1972
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
The Articles an op-ed

1973
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:32,640
Where the author is primarily arguing that a number of public health and safety organization

1974
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,200
Treat large events like the Boston Marathon

1975
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,736
Or the 4th of July parade

1976
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:39,808
As opportunities to heighten their Readiness for future

1977
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,416
This is not about doing the dry run over bombing or anything like that

1978
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:47,488
It's about her relationships between medical and law enforcement groups

1979
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,024
Reforged at large events

1980
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,584
Like this in order that they can work better together

1981
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,144
Because as the article says you don't want to quote

1982
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,680
Exchange business cards at

1983
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,704
Scene of a disaster

1984
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,008
In addition to this album

1985
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,336
The marathon is perfect for collaborative preparation

1986
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,640
Because it doesn't just take place in Boston

1987
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,432
Extends through multiple cities

1988
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,456
So by definition

1989
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,016
It's an event where Intercity coordination is nessus

1990
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
This article does nothing

1991
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,624
Approve or even make more plausible any of the Arctic

1992
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
Metallica's maker

1993
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,928
But it appears to

1994
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:19,744
Based on a few buzzwords in the headline and one Alex

1995
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,768
Is faking putting a

1996
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:27,936
So that's annoying that's like saying any of those simulations were they trying

1997
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:33,568
Coordinate with different departments and act as though okay here's what a a pandemic would start

1998
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,848
This is how it look like

1999
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:35,872
Let's see if we can

2000
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:37,408
Simulators

2001
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:38,432
That's where we succeed

2002
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,224
Something like that just those

2003
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,248
Existing would be

2004
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
Fuel for Alex

2005
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:44,320
I see they're planning the new

2006
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,880
There's nothing you can do

2007
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,464
Unless you just understand how he operates what he's doing

2008
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:54,304
You get the bigger picture of this b******* that that's the that's the way to hell

2009
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:57,888
So Alex and the show talking about our God

2010
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:04,544
Born 1952 in United States of America very very good great wonderful country

2011
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,408
A lot of them

2012
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:13,248
What I just heard last night somebody sent it

2013
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,296
And can you know I got trusted source

2014
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:19,648
Betamerica when was now number one the most corrupt Nations

2015
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,672
On the planet

2016
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:24,512
USA

2017
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:30,400
Not very immoral people government and government back in 1952 you say

2018
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:33,728
Wonder how it might be defining his terms on that one

2019
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:39,104
Would it surprise you to learn that the 82nd session of Congress which included the year

2020
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:40,384
52

2021
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,176
Concluded that only to f

2022
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:44,736
American representatives and 0 senators

2023
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:49,088
Odd how about the fact there was only one woman Senator and 10 represent

2024
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:53,440
Keep reminder 535 members of Congress

2025
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:57,024
This is the one area where Congress is really noticeably changed

2026
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:02,144
Since the 1950s let's say after the passage of the Voting Rights Act

2027
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,448
One area that makes no sense

2028
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,288
2.2 as a difference between the 1950s in the present-day is governmental corrupt

2029
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:12,128
There are thousands of examples of Representatives and Senators behaving

2030
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:13,152
Very similarly

2031
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,944
Scandalous ways going all the way back to the

2032
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
The founding of the country

2033
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,784
But it's hard to say exactly what Alex consider

2034
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,344
Accepting bribes doesn't

2035
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
Now that's

2036
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,768
The idea that there were fewer immoral

2037
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:29,536
People in government

2038
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,072
The entire

2039
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,632
Government was by its nature immoral

2040
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:38,752
Broke around discrimination and segregation

2041
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:44,896
Tyranny of the government was a moral call Alex seeing if you liked it better with governor was wider

2042
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,784
Yeah I think of that problem or I would ask

2043
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:51,808
Ask him to

2044
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,880
Explain what you mean that's not who's Borel

2045
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,440
So anyway we can all do the 22nd

2046
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:00,512
And when Alex comes in here on his Monday show

2047
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:03,584
He lays out the canonical version of what

2048
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,120
His narrative is

2049
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,144
About the

2050
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:06,912
The

2051
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:07,680
The bombing

2052
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:14,592
Let's look for

2053
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,384
Let's look for setups

2054
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,200
Han shot first

2055
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:28,416
Our word is right

2056
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:36,608
Xavier

2057
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,448
MMA

2058
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:47,104
So that's moving forward if it seems like is going out

2059
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,896
Write that one instead

2060
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,944
That's alright that's our final draft

2061
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Gotcha

2062
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,272
So he goes along and he's

2063
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,576
Denying that there was even a firefight

2064
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
In Watertown

2065
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:59,392
Expresses that didn't happen ever

2066
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,184
That's largely based on like

2067
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
Videos that people have

2068
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,792
That are incomplete

2069
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,072
Partial

2070
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:08,352
Videos

2071
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
Chico's

2072
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,704
Is just strongly arguing the people were

2073
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:14,752
Like

2074
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
This is like

2075
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,568
At gunpoint people forced

2076
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,616
I just stay inside their homes

2077
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
But it is you know you just repeat

2078
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,456
He that over and over again

2079
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,016
You know eventually people Arabic

2080
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:30,624
So Alex talked about how this whole thing

2081
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
Lockdown

2082
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:33,952
Are the shelter-in-place request didn't really

2083
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
Work

2084
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,048
Because only after it ended was the person

2085
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,328
There was a guy

2086
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,352
Boatwright

2087
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,056
And

2088
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,536
He followed his orders

2089
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:13,888
Your loss

2090
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,032
Okay alright

2091
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,568
You're a big boy

2092
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:28,480
In his in his mind this dude is sitting by his back window just staring at the boat

2093
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:32,064
Just like man I want to do something about this Blood covered boat of mine

2094
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,112
But they told me to stay

2095
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
Inside

2096
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
And I obviously can

2097
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,184
Can't use my phone from

2098
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:37,952
The inside

2099
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:44,352
I keep it outside of course so what you going to do until they give the okay to step out

2100
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
Outside

2101
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:47,936
Look like the guy decided to comply with

2102
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:49,216
Shelter-in-place request

2103
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
Then when he went outside you notice something

2104
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,520
He wouldn't see

2105
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,800
Unless you was outside

2106
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:55,360
So Alex

2107
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,408
This found some video of

2108
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,712
The police shooting at the boat the johar were

2109
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,504
And he

2110
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,296
Plays the video

2111
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,600
And I think that there's something really important

2112
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:10,464
Video to TV viewers

2113
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:25,056
In 308

2114
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:29,152
Over and over again into the boat

2115
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:39,392
There's even more of this

2116
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:44,512
Word appears

2117
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:48,096
Alex is absolutely lying

2118
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,632
He is replaying

2119
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,520
If you actually find videos of the the shooting

2120
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
Your last

2121
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,896
Very very short time there was a brief Outburst of firing

2122
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:05,248
Stop fire hold your fire Hold Your Fire

2123
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:11,648
The video that Alex has the audio you can tell they're they're shooting then there's a low then there's more shooting LOL

2124
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,672
And more shooting

2125
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,696
That does not happen

2126
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,744
In the real world

2127
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,048
That is an Eddie saying

2128
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:20,608
This is about half of it as if to indicate that there

2129
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:27,008
They were shooting for a full minute now he's not worried about a wild west shootout where people are in

2130
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:31,104
Different f****** houses across the way and putting their heads out the window and Fire 3

2131
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
Ducking back in that's what he

2132
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,944
And it did not happen like

2133
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,992
Nothing that I'm saying is to say that

2134
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,808
Police wear it anyway within the

2135
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:41,600
Bounds of good behavior

2136
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:42,624
The fire on the boat

2137
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,904
Alex is doing

2138
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,440
Wheatley lion yeah

2139
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,744
About it and he has to be lying

2140
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,536
You could In that clip

2141
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:50,560
He played

2142
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:51,584
Shooting

2143
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,400
It lasted longer than it did in the real world

2144
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,680
There's no way for him to

2145
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:58,496
Replaying that audio or video without looping

2146
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,520
Or without playing

2147
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
It twice.

2148
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:03,616
Yeah it absolutely is and the only reason

2149
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,408
And this is before everything was autoplay

2150
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,016
Yeah the only the only reason to do that

2151
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,296
That is to create a false

2152
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,088
Presentation

2153
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,624
What was being done there

2154
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,464
Bullets Ark

2155
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,048
What are we doing I don't like wasting my taxpayer dollars

2156
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:24,352
I'm 30 guys firing

2157
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:26,656
5000 bullets into a boat

2158
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:28,192
So there was something

2159
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,752
Happened in the night of the Watertown

2160
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,544
And that is that

2161
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
Naked guy got arrested

2162
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,104
Who is

2163
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,152
Sure

2164
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,176
In the

2165
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,712
Immediate

2166
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
There were

2167
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,528
Some theories that were running around that this was

2168
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,576
And it was not

2169
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,880
No one was going straight to time traveling

2170
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:49,184
Turn off

2171
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,208
Not that I'm aware of

2172
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,768
Okay but this

2173
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:53,792
I was

2174
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:56,352
Assertive bolstered by Timberland

2175
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
But that was he

2176
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,424
It was not

2177
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,704
But this

2178
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:03,264
Family member lento this credibility to

2179
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,824
Being like you wasn't actually killed there

2180
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,104
He was arrested

2181
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:10,688
Okay and this is not true but yours Alex

2182
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
Pushing some of that

2183
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,744
Full of holes

2184
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:28,864
Brother

2185
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:39,104
I guess you just said your firefight and then

2186
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:44,224
If you consult the timestamp

2187
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:48,832
Of the the time that people like wherever showing live footage

2188
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,856
The guy being arrested

2189
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:54,464
They do not match up it was after tamerlan had already been taken away in an ambulance

2190
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,744
All this is bulshit

2191
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,024
Honest

2192
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:57,792
Understand they can be

2193
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
Be made because there is

2194
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,888
A superficial visual similarity

2195
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:03,168
Between this naked guy

2196
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:05,216
Tamerlan but he was just another

2197
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:08,544
Suspicious person who was around the scene of the Watertown shootout

2198
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,336
And

2199
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,896
It's an easier

2200
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:13,664
Sort of thing

2201
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:20,064
Mistake to make when they say they filled him full of holes it what they really meant they force-fed him Shia LaBeouf

2202
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
Right

2203
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,392
Good

2204
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:30,816
Man that was a swing I want for it I work for it a why you want from there

2205
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:32,352
I'll be there it has to go

2206
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,376
Wow

2207
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:40,032
I thought swiss cheese might come up yo Shia LaBeouf

2208
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,312
Impressive

2209
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,104
Empressive

2210
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,920
So Alex is narrative now is that

2211
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,688
They were trying

2212
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:49,760
Kill johar in the boat they were trying to kill him through the

2213
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,344
The entire Manhunt and that is why they told people not to leave

2214
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,984
Unloaded

2215
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:20,480
Call him

2216
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:26,624
No evidence they told that to the citizens or the media Alex is making all of this up

2217
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,464
He's just decided that their mission was To Kill johar

2218
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
And that's not

2219
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,048
Anything that he has any reason to report

2220
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:39,680
He doesn't have that from any official Channel he's just assuming it's the same way that he saw those pictures on 4chan

2221
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,960
I created an entire fantasy

2222
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:41,728
Nerd about it

2223
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:44,032
He's just decided as what they were told

2224
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:47,616
Everything is constant

2225
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,384
Change it

2226
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:53,504
On the 19th when we would listen to that episode Manhunter the lockdown was in order to

2227
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Find the

2228
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,832
Fake seals for the pictures on 4chan

2229
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,160
Now it's we got to kill johar

2230
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,000
Ridiculous I imagine that Alex

2231
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,024
Has to be a little bit

2232
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
Disappointed that he

2233
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,864
Secret used butt dialing

2234
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,632
Giuliani

2235
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
So is source.

2236
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:16,032
Giuliani butt dialed me and he said you're over.

2237
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:21,152
You can lie about anything with that

2238
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:22,944
Believable now

2239
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:23,712
Yeah

2240
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,992
So

2241
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,016
This next

2242
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:28,064
Clip I believe is important

2243
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,112
Pure because it's

2244
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,392
Chose

2245
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,160
Pivot

2246
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:44,960
It's only these three people that are dead

2247
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,568
Scare everyone

2248
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,128
Staring

2249
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:05,440
Very familiar at pivoting what are you selling his magazine cuz he doesn't have his line of supplement

2250
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:06,208
Not yet

2251
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,512
So this is bizarre

2252
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,328
Viewing of development

2253
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,120
Because he's saying that the

2254
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,496
Same time that he's talking about the globalist using psychological fear and

2255
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,800
To get you to do what they want

2256
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,336
He's trying to scare you about

2257
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,104
Globalist

2258
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,432
Pikachu

2259
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,736
Runaway Alex is certain that this is

2260
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,528
The cover-up and a false flag

2261
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,832
Here is what that cover up when we

2262
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:46,400
Black powder

2263
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:55,360
I didn't have any that's not

2264
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,384
Call The Authority

2265
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,944
And I didn't have any didn't have it so cool

2266
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,992
Check that off the list

2267
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,064
I'm certain this is going to be used Outlaw black powder

2268
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,600
Didn't happen

2269
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:06,368
So Alex

2270
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
This is certain to visit

2271
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:07,904
The false flag

2272
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,464
Android stop just him it's everyone Alex

2273
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:17,888
And he says that and then struggles to come up with anyone

2274
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,240
People

2275
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,288
Joel skousen

2276
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,112
Joel skousen

2277
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
Very long pause

2278
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,464
Then Steve pieczenik

2279
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:43,488
It is

2280
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,048
On the out we don't even have a Leo zagami

2281
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,888
So Alex

2282
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:52,448
It has a new wrinkle here on this April to

2283
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,240
22nd episode that is

2284
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,032
The story is come out

2285
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,824
About the FB

2286
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,592
Bi

2287
01:39:58,848 --> 01:39:59,360
Calling

2288
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,128
Chamberlain

2289
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,664
After the bombing

2290
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:02,432
Oh no

2291
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:11,648
Connections

2292
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:15,744
Mother of suspected

2293
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,768
After bombing

2294
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:21,632
British media reports

2295
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:40,320
So the idea that the FBI called tamerlan in the days after the bombing is supported by literally nothing other than a claim

2296
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,856
By the Tsarnaev brothers parents

2297
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,136
You are an active defense

2298
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,000
Their interviews in the days after their children's photos were released could all boil down to

2299
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:50,048
Something like our children could never do some

2300
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,608
Which is a natural parental reaction

2301
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,400
U-see-it commonly in the cases

2302
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:57,216
The people your parents of people who do horrible things

2303
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:02,336
Because it's very damaging to your sense of self to imagine that someone you raise could do something like a bomb a marathon

2304
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,200
I tend not to give those comments too much weight unless they're supported by backing evidence

2305
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:08,224
Which is just absent

2306
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,064
This is a situation where proven this would be pretty easy

2307
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,416
As investigators poured over Chamberlain's phone records try and identify possible accomplices

2308
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:20,256
Even the channel for article that Alex is basing this on doesn't

2309
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,280
The story is being

2310
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
Substantiate

2311
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
From this art

2312
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,352
Quote

2313
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,912
The telephone call claim raises a number of questions

2314
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:28,960
On the one hand the claim could be false

2315
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:33,568
It follows Suggestions by both parents at the FBI's been bothering Timberland for years

2316
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,616
It could be part of efforts to defend the brothers

2317
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,944
Another possibility is that the telephone call was tamerlan

2318
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,992
Preparing his mother for bad news

2319
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:44,576
Does Timberland told her allegedly

2320
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
Yeah the FBI called

2321
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,464
The article very explicitly treats this is something that might be true but there's no proof

2322
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:57,376
It's all good while to discuss something like this as a claim being made by a traumatized mother but it's very inappropriate to treat it as if it

2323
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,680
List Factor even something likely to

2324
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,728
Be true and that is what Alex is doing

2325
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,544
There's a very important distinction that Alex is trying

2326
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,568
Play Both Sides

2327
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:07,360
Then this very clip that we just listen

2328
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:08,896
The headline from

2329
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,432
Steve Watson story is fine

2330
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,992
Cuz it's saying the Timberlands mother made this claim

2331
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,552
But I'll explain goes on to say that a British

2332
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:19,392
Report claims the FBI spoke to tamerlan after the bombing

2333
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,928
And that is an absolute lie

2334
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,000
The British report says the tamerlan's mother said it

2335
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,304
It ain't no way claims that the FBI spoked

2336
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:29,632
This is the sort of sleight-of-hand Alex does all the time

2337
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:33,472
It's always able to subtly change elements of a story without people really notice

2338
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,776
And you can pretend it's a minor shift in

2339
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,056
In the story but it's not

2340
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,616
One claim is that this mother made the claim

2341
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:43,456
The other is at the British media is reporting that the mother's claims are correct

2342
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:45,248
And the FBI did talk to Tamela.

2343
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:50,112
It's an attempt to prove the mother's Claim by appealing to a source that doesn't

2344
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:50,880
Prove that

2345
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,672
This is a deeply dishonest Act

2346
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
And you probably wouldn't do

2347
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,840
So just just keeps piling up

2348
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,120
Shifty Behavior

2349
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,144
Really

2350
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:02,912
Really bad

2351
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,680
Yeah

2352
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,472
Really really

2353
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,008
Really bad like

2354
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,568
Out-of-character bad even for

2355
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:10,848
I think most

2356
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:13,152
Today most of our coverage of Alex

2357
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:16,480
Aggressively

2358
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,760
Condenses a good way of putting

2359
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,064
Is throwing so many lies

2360
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:22,880
So many walls because he has the opportunity

2361
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:26,976
Write themselves very alright

2362
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,256
Rapid fire this

2363
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:34,656
So Alex talked about that a little bit more about how that lockdown and the shelter-in-place stuff was really just

2364
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:36,448
To find johar

2365
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:04,352
This is all made up that's crazy

2366
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,376
Is all just imagine

2367
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:11,776
Narrative and a storyline out of disparate pieces of information I'm tired of getting cornered by the guide

2368
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,080
I doing coke at the party what is he doing

2369
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
That's what he's doing

2370
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:19,968
Now what you got to know is you guys are afraid that they're going to come to my house and they're going

2371
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
Never

2372
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,272
Okay

2373
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,600
Sir Alex has two guests on the show

2374
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,368
On the twenty

2375
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,904
And I'm going to say I'll chop

2376
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,672
They're both pieces

2377
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:30,976
First of them is Wayne Madsen

2378
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:35,584
The guy who I told Alex that voted Hillary Clinton

2379
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
Who died at Anoka Tech

2380
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:43,520
That's Truman said call their neck

2381
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:45,312
This guy now hates

2382
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,080
Alex Jones

2383
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,616
I think he's a liar and

2384
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
Charlatan

2385
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
That's great

2386
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:53,248
So here's Wayne talkin about

2387
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,784
Sarnia

2388
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:58,368
A professional

2389
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,648
Refugees

2390
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:02,976
Including the families

2391
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:07,328
Came over here and

2392
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:13,728
Apparently

2393
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:19,616
No no

2394
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:21,664
So

2395
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,432
You know

2396
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,480
He's talking about like Chechen

2397
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,248
Refugee

2398
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:30,880
Yeah and he had another point you talks about how like he's noticed that they're all in washing

2399
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,648
Canton d.c.

2400
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,416
Boston

2401
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:34,208
It's all bulshit

2402
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,744
There are very few chechens

2403
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:42,144
States that much easier to emigrate to a European countries so the communities in those countries are much larger

2404
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:44,704
It's a complicated question as to why they're not

2405
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,240
As many refugees of check

2406
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,520
Descent in the United States

2407
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:50,336
But some pointed to it being an expensive trip

2408
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:53,152
To make to apply to Asylum here that's a pretty large

2409
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,200
Another is that there were

2410
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,224
Very many checks

2411
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,760
Soca

2412
01:45:58,016 --> 01:45:59,296
Less likely to end up choosing

2413
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:00,576
YouTube United States

2414
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,368
Are there fewer fellow

2415
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,672
Who can help them buy with the transition process

2416
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,952
Of living in a new country

2417
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,232
Yeah little self-select

2418
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,256
Little

2419
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,792
Economics

2420
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,096
Whatever the case there are not many Chechen

2421
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
The whole name

2422
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
Some estimates

2423
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,192
To put it as low as a couple hundred in the

2424
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:16,960
The entire country

2425
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:19,776
No s*** yeah but it's hard to know for sure since

2426
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:22,336
What's many maybe identifying as Russian

2427
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,896
Country of origin document

2428
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,944
My point here is that Wayne Madsen

2429
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
Got a dump

2430
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,248
He says the DC

2431
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,528
DC and Boston or cities

2432
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,552
Without that

2433
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:34,624
Chechens are surrounding

2434
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
LinkedIn

2435
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:38,464
They are cities that have

2436
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,000
Now some Chechen population

2437
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,280
But they're tiny relatively

2438
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:44,352
Speaking and those cities aren't the only places where catching folks live

2439
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,888
Their cities that he

2440
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,936
You've chosen from a list of cities with Chechen

2441
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,704
Communities

2442
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,752
Because it's where all the FBI's stuff is

2443
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,288
And where are the bombing

2444
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:55,104
They're also notable Chechen populations in

2445
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,128
Seattle York

2446
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
Los Angeles

2447
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:58,432
New Jersey the Wayne

2448
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,200
Hand wave

2449
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,992
Those away to draw Focus to the

2450
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,784
He said he wants to build suspicion about

2451
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,320
And here's the thing

2452
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,856
This isn't perfect

2453
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,624
Conspiracy

2454
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,904
This is over at Cinetopia

2455
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,488
Putting forth this kind of thing where you're trying to imply the refugee

2456
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,280
This particular Heritage or something

2457
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,304
Nefariously cluster

2458
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,376
It serves to make your listeners suspicious of all Chechen

2459
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:21,984
This is a very small group we're pretty vulnerable from a numbers and social capital

2460
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:27,616
Trying to create the perception that they might be coming to the United States as quote professional refugees

2461
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,152
It may be up to no good isn't it

2462
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,712
Explicit active marginalization of a

2463
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,248
Beauty based on their ethnic origin

2464
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,040
That seems pretty f***** up

2465
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:40,416
These Chechen Americans were just as affected by the bombing as anyone else possibly even more so

2466
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:41,440
Some say the fear that

2467
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:43,232
People would do exactly what Wayne Madsen

2468
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
Is doing here

2469
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,048
Trying to tie their Heritage to a terrorist

2470
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,096
The strongest possible terms

2471
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,632
F*** this

2472
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,168
Wayne sucks

2473
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,192
Yeah there should be a

2474
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,056
Yeah this angle is

2475
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,080
Real bad

2476
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:00,896
So Alex is heads

2477
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,432
China Crown who's given the

2478
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,200
The motive

2479
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:06,272
Of that for the polling office false flag is being the

2480
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:08,320
Imaginary bipartisan

2481
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,600
Congressional committee that

2482
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:12,160
Yeah I'll tell you did Obama Penny Grimes

2483
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:15,232
And has his own motive

2484
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:35,968
That's word for word before and after

2485
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:53,888
I call this the Patriot Act for the internet

2486
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:59,008
Cardboard

2487
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,032
Interaction

2488
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:06,432
With anything electronic

2489
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:12,832
Completely unrelated a guy trying to say

2490
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,904
Set up an Elvis impersonator Julieta

2491
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,184
What a wild story that was

2492
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,744
The bombing was done to pass

2493
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,816
Pasta spa or the Cyber intelligence sharing and protection act

2494
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:26,912
Also known as HR 3523 in the 112th Congress

2495
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,960
Hr624 anyone

2496
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:30,752
Hr2

2497
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,568
All these attempts

2498
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,336
What's the pass the bill

2499
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:37,152
Weather without any supposed false-flag bombing

2500
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,760
In December 2015 the GOP included an amended version called Sissy

2501
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,552
Visa into the budget

2502
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
And Obama signed it in

2503
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:50,720
You may remember December 2015 is one of the many times that the GOP under

2504
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:54,048
McConnell had tried to force a shutdown of the government if he couldn't get his way

2505
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:57,120
In this case there was a big hold up with them trying to put

2506
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:00,960
Defunding of Planned Parenthood into the budget bill which they were unable to do

2507
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,496
They were however able to

2508
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,264
Slide in

2509
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:06,336
There's no need for the government to Stage terrorist

2510
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:08,384
What's the text to push through unpopular legislation

2511
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:12,224
Alex's buddies like Ted Cruz are more than willing to hold the government hostage

2512
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,248
Which to do that on their own

2513
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:17,088
So now we got to bulshit theories as the motive for the false flag

2514
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,624
Pushing through

2515
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:23,232
Pertronix imaginary bipartisan Congressional committee that indicted bush

2516
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,768
Obama war crimes

2517
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,328
Noting that these people are saying means anything

2518
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,096
They're just

2519
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,120
Making s*** up

2520
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,448
It's not okay

2521
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:37,568
I know you probably get tired of that conclusion

2522
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,336
You can't

2523
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Just do that

2524
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,384
It wouldn't even a

2525
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:46,016
Heard of me to just rip out the news and sister is your reality

2526
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,088
I want my hair to Alex being a

2527
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,392
But that's

2528
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,536
Particularly against it as well

2529
01:50:57,792 --> 01:51:01,376
I think that's a solid position to have but it doesn't

2530
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,400
Justify

2531
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:03,936
This now

2532
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,752
So anyway

2533
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:07,520
Alex

2534
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,288
By this point

2535
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,848
Has learned that there's an explanation for the

2536
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,872
People in his picture

2537
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:12,896
Study found out for

2538
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:15,456
And they were National Guard civil support team

2539
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:32,608
Uniforms

2540
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:39,008
Nope well that solves it not true see how it works it's not

2541
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,312
And so I believe him

2542
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:43,360
Now you take this entirely

2543
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,896
Terrible work that they've done

2544
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:49,504
Insisting these people are Navy Seals but in reality they were part of the Civil support team

2545
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:52,320
I know everything is now taking the truth

2546
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:54,368
And hand waved it away

2547
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,416
Map

2548
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,952
Of course not

2549
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,744
You you're getting it wrong

2550
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,792
This is how you solidify

2551
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,560
Your narrator

2552
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,608
From any kind of possible

2553
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,400
Infiltration of reality

2554
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,168
So

2555
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,960
The Wayans gone now

2556
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,752
And you can stay gone for all I'm

2557
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:13,824
Besides take a little time

2558
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:15,104
Plug a new station

2559
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
Signed up

2560
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,456
Two are his show

2561
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:29,696
Call letters

2562
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,544
Raleigh

2563
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,080
Around here

2564
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:51,200
760 a.m.

2565
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,248
This hour

2566
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:59,648
Family show I apologize

2567
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:05,792
This is a family show all along

2568
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,072
I love

2569
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:08,608
The petty workplace

2570
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,888
Office griping

2571
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,424
Just coming out on air

2572
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,448
Like that's

2573
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,496
That is every office

2574
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:18,080
That is everybody was ever worked in an office at least one day of been like

2575
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:19,104
Really I'm getting

2576
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,384
This many emails

2577
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:24,224
Do you guys not know how to figure it out your goddamn self. Do everything ready

2578
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,528
Episode the f****** radio

2579
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:28,576
So Alex is convinced

2580
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:32,416
The FBI knew who the Tsarnaev brothers were when they release the

2581
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,440
Take photos

2582
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,976
And then he goes on

2583
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,256
Tells his version

2584
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,280
Of The Manhunt

2585
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:39,072
And some of this is a little bit repetitive

2586
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
Weverton Cliffs like

2587
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,120
But I think it's

2588
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,936
Important to understand that what Alex is doing is

2589
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:45,728
First of all being repetitive

2590
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,520
Drive home

2591
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,800
His narrative

2592
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,080
I meant secondarily

2593
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,408
You practicing hitting these points

2594
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:58,528
And now it's just

2595
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,592
But

2596
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:25,408
After shooting

2597
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,816
So this is all just

2598
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,584
Made up this is

2599
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,400
Again just Alex's imagination of what happened

2600
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,448
I don't understand why anybody would

2601
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,472
Dislike

2602
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,520
I mean I do understand why people take it serious

2603
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,544
Very convincing

2604
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:56,128
Let me let me take that again I think I could do that a little bit smoother

2605
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:02,784
Yellow lab dark yellow okay we're going to do this one more time only tell this story when I really want to get this story right

2606
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,320
He has the emotionally

2607
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,624
A compelling presentation

2608
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,904
Someone who knows what they're talking

2609
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,696
I'm about and it's very easy to be

2610
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,720
Duped

2611
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:11,744
Into thinking

2612
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,512
This confidence

2613
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:15,072
So

2614
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,096
Some videos

2615
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,120
Add Surface by the

2616
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,400
Point of police

2617
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,936
Taking people out of homes

2618
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,752
And Alex has a position

2619
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:27,360
And I have some great

2620
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:38,112
What interface

2621
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:46,816
So Alex is absolutely correct that there were videos going around of people being let out of their homes by police

2622
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,424
There's no real indication of the police threatening them in any way North

2623
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,704
He's aiming their guns at the

2624
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:55,008
Civilians but the people do have their hands up

2625
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,056
From the videos I've seen it seems

2626
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,592
More likely

2627
01:55:58,848 --> 01:55:59,360
Orderly

2628
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,384
Of a process

2629
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:03,456
Lessor you know it's not their yelling at them to submit

2630
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:06,016
But I can't be certain are these even actually from

2631
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,296
Yeah

2632
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:13,184
Alright I'm at my first my first instinct is like these are actually no

2633
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:15,488
I wasn't there and I don't know what videos I was

2634
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:16,512
Scene in heaven

2635
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,048
I can't really speak

2636
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,096
On those sorts of things I can just tell you what I've seen

2637
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,656
Oh and I can also speak about one other thing

2638
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,960
And I just that every single one of these

2639
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
People whose homes were

2640
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:28,800
Search during The Manhunt gave the police permission to search their homes

2641
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:33,664
You can make the argument that given the fever pitch in the city that these people felt like they couldn't

2642
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,432
Tell the police

2643
01:56:34,688 --> 01:56:35,712
He said they couldn't search their home

2644
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,480
Eminem

2645
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:37,248
Subway

2646
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:40,832
That's a form of pressure for them to give up their fourth amendment rights

2647
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:44,160
You can make the argument that they might have felt like there would be cops

2648
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,720
Consent to the police searching their home

2649
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:49,024
Like that might make them appear suspicious

2650
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:52,864
And these are the exact order questions that a certain group was a

2651
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,656
Exploring in late April 2013

2652
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,704
It's a group that Alex f****** hate

2653
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,240
That group of course

2654
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:00,032
Is the American civil liberties Union

2655
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,056
They cou

2656
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,616
They've seen the same videos that everyone else

2657
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:06,176
Latina babe very public statement they would like to speak

2658
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:08,992
Any citizen who felt like they were put in a position where they could

2659
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,528
Say no to a police search

2660
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:12,320
Speaking to the Atlantic

2661
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,648
Carol Rose the executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts

2662
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:18,976
Innovation head quote received a number

2663
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,256
I'm concerned complain

2664
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,304
From people about the searches that took place

2665
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,096
Including some residents of Watertown

2666
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:27,680
None however from people whose homes had been searched

2667
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,216
I've looked

2668
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:32,288
And I can find no evidence that anyone actually affected by the Searchers

2669
01:57:32,544 --> 01:57:33,824
Is ever lodged a formal complaint

2670
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,360
Or filed suit

2671
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,896
Claimed that their rights were violated

2672
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,176
All the noise

2673
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:42,016
It's been talked about this issue comes from people who saw the videos or look at the Optics

2674
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,040
Then made their own decisions

2675
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,600
These observers are making a joke again

2676
01:57:46,624 --> 01:57:47,136
And it's

2677
01:57:47,392 --> 01:57:49,696
Them trying to assume the decisions

2678
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:52,256
Actual people whose homes are being searched or making

2679
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:54,816
Many of them were probably totally fine with the surge

2680
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:57,888
Some of them probably uncomfortable but understood it was for the best

2681
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:58,912
Consented

2682
01:57:59,168 --> 01:57:59,680
It did

2683
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:00,704
Right-wing virtue

2684
01:58:01,216 --> 01:58:01,728
Arrington

2685
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,520
Battle other people

2686
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,848
If one of these citizen to file the case and Alex wanted to

2687
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:09,152
To support their claim and draw attention to it that's one thing

2688
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:11,200
But he doesn't even have a particular taste

2689
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:12,992
Only saying is

2690
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:15,552
If that was me in that video I wouldn't be okay with

2691
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,576
Yeah yeah

2692
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:18,112
That's an okay thing to say

2693
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:19,904
But don't help us establish that the police

2694
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,672
Distracting on

2695
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,440
Constitutional

2696
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,512
So whatever

2697
01:58:24,768 --> 01:58:25,280
Are there like vampire

2698
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,072
Those are the rules

2699
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,888
Well that is magical rule

2700
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,448
Greater Matt lesser Magic

2701
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,496
So now we get to our second

2702
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:38,336
You should gas to the day and that's Joel skousen

2703
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:42,688
1010 here Alex is already

2704
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:45,248
Said believes is false flag

2705
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,064
F****** do thinks everything

2706
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,600
Anyway ears Joel

2707
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:56,000
It's very clear that the two brothers were involved in

2708
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:59,072
False flag training and operation

2709
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:12,128
And by the way we have video of the younger brother

2710
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,200
What the FBI said about him dropping

2711
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,480
I've been through

2712
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:19,296
What a shock Joel skousen think something's a false flag

2713
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,832
This guy is a broken record

2714
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,112
Literally everything

2715
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:24,928
Has ever happened in the world is part of some Grand conspiracy

2716
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,464
Damn it's so

2717
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,768
F****** funny that Alex presenting as an expert in any

2718
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:31,072
Mayfield other than saying things are false flag

2719
01:59:32,096 --> 01:59:34,912
I'll concede that he's got that down better than anyone else I've ever seen

2720
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:41,312
Everything is just after the bombing skousen was on his show on Alex's show he said that this at the signs of a false flag

2721
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,848
Now he's upgraded its confidence

2722
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:45,920
I don't give a s*** about any of that because here's the thing

2723
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:47,968
Joel skousen is a goddamn liar

2724
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:52,576
He said In that clip there's a video of Joe Hart leaving the area the Boston bombing

2725
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,112
Still carrying his bag

2726
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,184
There's no video or pictures of this

2727
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,464
He is just full of s***

2728
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:02,048
Actually know what he's talkin about everybody's trying to hide

2729
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:03,840
On April 19th

2730
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,912
The Associated Press release the picture of johar fleeing the scene

2731
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:10,752
The picture was taken by a businessman from Florida named David Bowie

2732
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:13,312
Finish the marathon about an hour before the bombs

2733
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,080
Smite off

2734
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,920
He hung around the Finish Line to watch the waves of Runners come in

2735
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:18,944
But his phone was dying

2736
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:21,760
So you went to a charging station and SE was

2737
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:22,784
Turning to his friend

2738
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
When's the blast app

2739
02:00:24,320 --> 02:00:25,344
Esau chaotic scene

2740
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,648
So we took a picture and then immediately started helping

2741
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,232
A friend texted him to ask if he was okay

2742
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:32,512
And green replied

2743
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:33,280
By sending the

2744
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,072
Thank that he was right there

2745
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:37,888
When the FBI released the pictures of the suspect

2746
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:39,424
This friend review the picture

2747
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:41,216
See if there was anything unusual in it

2748
02:00:41,728 --> 02:00:43,520
Any saw Joe Hart in the lower left

2749
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,848
He told green who sent the picture off to the FBI

2750
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,176
Event contacted AP who vetted the picture and released

2751
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:53,248
This picture clearly shows johar without his

2752
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:57,600
But internet sleuths decided that someone must have photoshopped the image

2753
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:58,624
To take out the backpack

2754
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:02,464
There's no evidence that they can't do that there's no evidence

2755
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,232
If this is the case

2756
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:08,864
The same original high-resolution image was submitted to the AP and the FBI

2757
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:14,752
The conspiracy theorists get quite decide who to blame weather was green or the FBI who did the photoshopping

2758
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,288
But the result was

2759
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:20,896
A good number of Internet bulshit targeting David Green is possibly being in on a terrorist attack

2760
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:21,920
It killed us.

2761
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:23,968
Like for real this is repulsive

2762
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:29,088
These f****** are like the eye of Sauron like once the eye is on you and it's

2763
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:30,368
All of their power

2764
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,184
Combined unto this f****** to the black hole

2765
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:37,536
God that you can find out if it's Photoshop it's not even

2766
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:39,584
It's not even that hard if you have techno

2767
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,888
Chemical ability with it and it said they

2768
02:01:42,144 --> 02:01:44,704
Wave it away and just say like no it's it was Photoshop

2769
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:49,824
At this is what's guy was talking about when he says that there's video of Joe hard leaving with his

2770
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:51,104
His back there isn't

2771
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,384
Yeah there's an unhinged

2772
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,432
Completely unproven internet conspiracy

2773
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:57,504
See about how a picture of johar without his bag is Photoshop

2774
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:59,552
Coward doesn't even have the wherewithal.

2775
02:01:59,808 --> 02:02:00,320
Represent is b*******

2776
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:03,904
Keep hiding behind lies of the weakness of your evidence doesn't

2777
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:04,928
Show to clearly

2778
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:05,952
Bulshit

2779
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:14,400
I mean it feels like even if you pointed that out he be like a hobby evidences that there isn't a video of him without his

2780
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:16,192
Like what what what are you f******

2781
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:20,544
Video tune

2782
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:22,592
Then fine magic is real whatever

2783
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:24,640
Yeah so Alex

2784
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:25,408
Is Ben

2785
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:28,224
Sort of trying to softly and subtly

2786
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,248
Go from

2787
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,296
Timberland mother

2788
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:35,392
Says that the FBI called Truth

2789
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,208
Going to help out quite a bit with the

2790
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,768
Cuz he's just reading that FBI call as a fat

2791
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,328
I think it was interesting.

2792
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:45,632
Did the police or the FBI called

2793
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:53,056
A couple of days

2794
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,336
And

2795
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:57,408
I don't know if I wanted them

2796
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,480
I'm still unclear Alex what this

2797
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:12,000
MPI call is not establish back and guess what the carjacking and the murder of the MIT

2798
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:13,536
Teacup make perfect sense

2799
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,584
Outside of your conspiracy

2800
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,400
They make absolute sense with reality

2801
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:25,568
Why are you why are you conceal makeup a narrative around why that stuff makes sense within my cancer

2802
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,360
Faricy Theory because if I were to like

2803
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:29,152
I mean they're obviously reasons

2804
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,176
That with those would make

2805
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,992
In the context of what I'm telling you is true

2806
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:34,528
Simply overcomplicating

2807
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,368
Really got to figure out whether or not the the Moon

2808
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:40,160
The mirror right

2809
02:03:40,416 --> 02:03:41,184
Set the MIT

2810
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:41,952
He copped a killer

2811
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,256
Himself and then they

2812
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:45,280
So

2813
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
Alex

2814
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:46,816
Plays out

2815
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:47,584
The config

2816
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,400
Again and again I want to stress

2817
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,168
I believe that this

2818
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:52,960
I'm telling the story

2819
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:29,056
House where it's at

2820
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:40,576
Face

2821
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:44,672
That's a question

2822
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:53,120
Right here

2823
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:56,960
So what we have here is Alex practicing telling the story what happened

2824
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,496
He's going over the Beatles

2825
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:02,080
The story and you can hear him connecting the dots as he goes along but there's

2826
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:02,848
Problems

2827
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,712
For one I thought he changed the narrative to this being a thing where they wanted to blame the seals

2828
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,248
But now it seems

2829
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,016
He's back today

2830
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,808
That they plan to blame right-wingers

2831
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:15,136
April 19th episode of bottle episode of Alec

2832
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:18,208
What's the show where he throws out a whole new story line about how is all about the

2833
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:20,768
Feels have a lockdown with the cleanup the Patsy

2834
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:27,168
Cuz it seems like we're supposed to have forgotten all about that show luck it was it was so they panned out at the end

2835
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:31,776
End of that episode and there was an autistic child with a snow globe

2836
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:33,056
That's how that epi

2837
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,080
Episode work you didn't

2838
02:05:34,592 --> 02:05:36,128
You didn't see the last part of it

2839
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:40,224
Secondly Alex's never played those clips of the media celebrate

2840
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:43,552
But they know it's going to be a lone wolf right-wing

2841
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:45,088
Terrorist guy

2842
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:48,416
This is the second stage of the you can look it up misdirection

2843
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:50,720
What he says you can look it up

2844
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:53,280
The Listener to never feel they need to look so

2845
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,072
This other one

2846
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:55,840
I've played the

2847
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,120
Eclipse isn't attempted

2848
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:00,960
Convince The Listener that he's actually played the piece of evidence that he hasn't

2849
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:03,520
Eventually through repetition he can Gaslight

2850
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:07,360
People into Assuming he's demonstrated all this stuff and they must have missed the episode

2851
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:09,408
Like what you were bringing up earlier what you

2852
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,432
Our feeling

2853
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:11,968
12 benefits of list

2854
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:15,552
Do this every day of his show is that I can see very confident

2855
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:16,832
That I was just never said

2856
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:20,160
Created this claim that the media was salivating that it was a right winger

2857
02:06:20,416 --> 02:06:21,440
But he's repeatedly

2858
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,976
He claimed that he's played at the clips

2859
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:26,304
Third and most interesting Lee

2860
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,400
Globalist bad guys got trained out of false flag by delclos

2861
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:33,728
The f****** think that these people are just up there improvising

2862
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:36,288
Does he not understand how stupid that sounds

2863
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:40,640
Alright guys let's do years-long cultivation to this tamerlan guy involving

2864
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:43,712
Complicated operation to get him in and out of the country secretly

2865
02:06:43,968 --> 02:06:44,480
Culminating

2866
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,528
Bombing the Boston Marathon

2867
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:48,064
Alright sounds good then what

2868
02:06:48,576 --> 02:06:49,600
After that we wing it

2869
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:50,368
I mean

2870
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:53,952
But there's something to be said about a unique performance

2871
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:59,584
Do you know that's like in like in theater you know there's certain things you get bored by the performance

2872
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:04,448
Then yeah you have a fun mess up and yeah you get reinvigorated believe it all over

2873
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,008
Anything that you can only have half

2874
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:11,616
Bulshit this level of characterization of your bad guys is Carter

2875
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:15,968
Like for real Joel skousen doesn't get enough grief for me on a regular basis

2876
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,016
Maybe because it's kind of funny that he hates

2877
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:22,624
Trump in the present-day and Alex has to put up with it because all of his other experts will talk to him anymore

2878
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,928
But let's not lose sight of the fact that girl scouts

2879
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,768
So we have two motives

2880
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:30,048
Now for the bombing

2881
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,840
Pertronix motive

2882
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:32,608
And Wayne Madsen

2883
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:33,376
Motive

2884
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,424
Skousen has his own

2885
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:41,824
Okay that sucks okay

2886
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,408
Another one of these high-profile Terror attacks

2887
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:50,272
Remember we don't have any normal terrorism in the United States

2888
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:55,392
People coming across the border among the thousands of illegal aliens to come across

2889
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:00,256
Maybe blowing up electrical pylons suicide bombers

2890
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:04,096
Small non high profile profile

2891
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:05,376
Always assign

2892
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:09,728
If there is something

2893
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:10,496
That's right

2894
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:13,312
So as if you need more evidence this Joel skousen

2895
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:19,712
The dunce. Asserting the motive the goblets I need to pull up his Boston bombing of the false flag us cuz we haven't had any Terror

2896
02:08:19,968 --> 02:08:25,344
Prison for a while that is a friedersdorf level take right there then it's been awhile since

2897
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:29,696
We had one let's toss them on the

2898
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,488
Ideas about real versus fake

2899
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,792
Cuz it's racist to s***

2900
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:36,352
Well might be there might be undertone

2901
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:37,888
If it isn't

2902
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,656
It's noticed

2903
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,984
I'm going to leave aside also terrorist attacks

2904
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:42,752
Same to other

2905
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:46,080
That absolutely do affect our country's interests since that list.

2906
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:46,848
B2 Gigante

2907
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,152
And they probably wouldn't fit whatever nonsense

2908
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,432
That's great. Joel's using

2909
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,992
I know the definitions of terrorism

2910
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:55,040
My very but what about Sandy Hook

2911
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:56,064
What about the Aurora

2912
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:58,112
What about Christopher dorner's Rampage

2913
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:01,184
What about that Nazi who shot up a Sikh temple in Wisconsin

2914
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,208
What about the attempt

2915
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:02,976
Assassination

2916
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,000
Gabrielle Giffords

2917
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,280
That left six dead in 50

2918
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:09,120
I would personally consider all of these we Act of terrorism to Summit

2919
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:12,704
They produced are in the community whether or not be

2920
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,472
Specific Act

2921
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:15,520
Hadn't identified political motivation

2922
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:17,312
I would say that in early 20

2923
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,616
Circularly after Sandy Hook

2924
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:22,176
No one needed to be reminded with Terror

2925
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:24,736
Like I were there any trains in

2926
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,528
No not Terror

2927
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:29,600
I meant were there any just Telecommunications

2928
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:32,416
Is this f****** dumb dumb not remember that we're like sick

2929
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,696
Six months removed from the attack

2930
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,464
Benghazi

2931
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:36,768
6 months what the f*** do

2932
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:40,608
Like what is it get off going on a nationally syndicated radio show and pretending

2933
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:43,424
To be an international Affairs expert while he spouts

2934
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:44,192
Completely meaning

2935
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:45,216
Bulshit like that

2936
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:47,264
Seahawks trade the bus Department

2937
02:09:48,288 --> 02:09:48,800
Terratech

2938
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,336
A f*** out of here

2939
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,616
It's the classic

2940
02:09:52,896 --> 02:09:53,408
Motive

2941
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:54,944
It's been awhile

2942
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,480
So dumb

2943
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,784
So now we get to clip that I

2944
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,552
Personally

2945
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,832
Okay

2946
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,600
And that is

2947
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:03,904
It may be one of my favorite genres

2948
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,440
Of Alex's

2949
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,720
Coverage

2950
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:08,000
And that is

2951
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:09,280
When he's swimming

2952
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,560
And he uncovers

2953
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,328
Something

2954
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:13,632
Detective Alex

2955
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:14,912
At the swimming hole

2956
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:24,384
I was swimming laps at Barton Springs

2957
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:32,320
We're talking about

2958
02:10:35,648 --> 02:10:41,280
Show me more.

2959
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,496
I don't believe anything about that

2960
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:55,616
How to relieve out either

2961
02:10:55,872 --> 02:11:01,760
I was out the emojis that I was swimming laps I was like you're full of s*** I got to say though

2962
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:05,344
To the pool bar and back away from this Alex's to be believed

2963
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,624
Barton Springs

2964
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:07,904
Is one of the

2965
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,464
Biggest hot beds

2966
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:16,608
Specialized information about casual it is amazing how

2967
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:19,936
Much secret information is a block away from his house

2968
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:25,312
So much secret apparently under a tree you're going to hear something classified

2969
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:28,896
Walk with you can't throw a stone without hitting a classified piece

2970
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:34,528
Information on also I love that his justification for the big special ops as they were

2971
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:35,552
So they were clearly

2972
02:11:36,064 --> 02:11:41,696
School

2973
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:47,072
That and they couldn't see me but I was laying under tree it was an oak tree I remember that cuz if I wanted a little achy

2974
02:11:47,328 --> 02:11:47,840
Corn fell on top of

2975
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:48,608
Ahead

2976
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:50,400
M8 but they didn't know I said

2977
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:52,960
And then they knew it was me but that's when they

2978
02:11:55,008 --> 02:12:00,128
So this next clip is just just for posterity it doesn't really have a whole lot to do with

2979
02:12:00,384 --> 02:12:00,896
Steve

2980
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,736
Current affairs that were talking about

2981
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,296
Here in 2013

2982
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,576
Alexandros cows

2983
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:09,600
Or both

2984
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:10,368
Pretty clear

2985
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,648
That

2986
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,184
Don't the bad

2987
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:18,560
I want to make one point very clear that mainstream media continues to put out the propaganda

2988
02:12:19,072 --> 02:12:25,216
Assisting

2989
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:28,032
This is absolutely untrue

2990
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:31,872
Is that almost all of the check-in terrorism

2991
02:12:32,128 --> 02:12:35,200
Terrorism in Russia the apartment buildings the Breslin bombings

2992
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:41,600
Of the school

2993
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:45,952
So Alex completely does not agree with this in the present

2994
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:49,792
Yeah you know where I got loaded with in like a year or two after this

2995
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:51,840
He saying that Putin didn't do that

2996
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,144
He must be happy that he does

2997
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:56,192
That the news is not

2998
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:58,752
Not focus on bolsonaro probably assassin

2999
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:02,080
Nobody had to worry about that one

3000
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,896
So Joe goes further down

3001
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:07,200
And it is also it's pretty embarrassing

3002
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:08,480
To hear that sort of thing

3003
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,552
Considering the rhetoric that Alex who put out

3004
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:12,832
I'm very short time

3005
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,880
That the Russians have been running

3006
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:18,976
The chechens is there false flag operations just like we've been running

3007
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:25,376
The Middle Eastern Muslims that are false flag operations in this country

3008
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:26,400
War on terror

3009
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:29,216
In terms of

3010
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:34,848
Bringing in more this false propaganda that Russia is our Ally in the world on terror

3011
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:37,920
They're still planning on disarmament

3012
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:50,464
It seems like our government is just insisting on proving to the computer

3013
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:53,792
But there's no threat there that were fighting a common enemy

3014
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:59,168
Well it sounds exactly like Alex is angle a couple years later

3015
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:00,960
Weird

3016
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:04,544
So are we going to Alex's run here on the 22nd

3017
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:06,592
And I withdraw

3018
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,360
Alex for

3019
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:08,128
His great work

3020
02:14:08,384 --> 02:14:14,528
Course what you doing I know you're taking a lot of flak for what's going on

3021
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,296
Attractive

3022
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:20,160
When your Riley two or perennial conspiracy deniers or even

3023
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:20,928
You know

3024
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:26,816
Good guy

3025
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:28,608
You're at the Forefront of this

3026
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:32,960
So conspiracy deniers Glenn Beck

3027
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:37,312
He has to walk very carefully because Glenn Beck

3028
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:39,104
Some connections with like

3029
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,128
He's a big

3030
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:41,408
W Cleon skousen

3031
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:46,016
Really he has some connection with the skousen family like

3032
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:48,832
He's very into the skousen

3033
02:14:49,088 --> 02:14:49,600
Auntie,

3034
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:51,136
Best work so

3035
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,440
How to beat roll knows not

3036
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,232
What do you mean

3037
02:14:55,488 --> 02:14:56,000
I mean

3038
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:59,584
That I would man when they do background checks

3039
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,632
But it shouldn't be drug conviction

3040
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:04,704
What kind of questionable literature choices

3041
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,752
Have you made about whether or not you're

3042
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:08,288
F****** anti-government

3043
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:10,848
Are you big into weirdo

Constitution Bill of Rights news

3063
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:55,392
Idea. I think y'all should run the Bill of Rights as a new sticker

3064
02:15:55,648 --> 02:15:57,696
At the bottom of your screen

3065
02:15:57,952 --> 02:16:00,256
But I wanted to point out something about the concert

3066
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:06,656
Everybody's trying to mess with it and I'm going to tell you the Bill of Rights itself stairs in the first floor

3067
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:07,936
The first letter

I mean this is just an overall igigi level

3071
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:25,600
Nicolas Cage Nicolas Cage on the other

3072
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:33,792
So that's one caller is like okay I'm the guy who came up with the idea of doing the Bill of Rights as a ticker underneath

3073
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:37,888
This next caller is a little bit more troubling

3074
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:39,680
But you just wants to

3075
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:42,496
He starts out the cold like I just want plugs

3076
02:16:43,008 --> 02:16:46,080
What I wanted to do is kind of plug

3077
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:52,480
I've got a page on Facebook that I started a group and it is called

3078
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,784
The Constitution alive

3079
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,600
I know it's not living document but

3080
02:16:58,624 --> 02:17:00,672
Constitution Daiso to this country

3081
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:11,936
I will say that this man is willing to admit the flaw in his title

3082
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:15,008
Is like I thought it was a great title now I admit

3083
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:21,408
Because a lot of people have pointed this out to me it's a very obvious problem

3084
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:22,176
Late for me to Jade

3085
02:17:22,432 --> 02:17:23,456
I can't put some other option

3086
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:30,624
Diversity is a constitution is pretty cool another one he could have gone with his

3087
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:31,648
President and Vice President

3088
02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:34,208
Going to be elected separately since I hate the 12th Amendment

3089
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:37,024
Another is a I don't like minorities voting

3090
02:17:37,536 --> 02:17:43,424
Any of those could work yeah accurate title so I was curious so I decided to check

3091
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,960
I actually found this Facebook

3092
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:48,800
It's been pretty dormant for a while now but the last post

3093
02:17:49,056 --> 02:17:50,080
From July 2013

3094
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:53,152
Teen is pretty telling of the sort of vibe that this guy was putting out

3095
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:55,456
Quote to all

3096
02:17:55,712 --> 02:17:56,224
5 l

3097
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:58,272
Those who have gone back and forth

3098
02:17:58,528 --> 02:17:59,808
About the mixed race

3099
02:18:00,064 --> 02:18:02,112
Oh no it's in parentheses

3100
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:03,392
He is not just

3101
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:04,928
Black like you love to regards

3102
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:12,352
Anti every religion accepted Islam White House

3103
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:15,168
And the sad part is you still think his s*** don't stink

3104
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:17,216
You are what's wrong with this country

3105
02:18:17,728 --> 02:18:18,240
That post

3106
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:19,264
2 likes

3107
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:20,032
Gotcha

3108
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:21,312
I mean I think that's good

3109
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:24,896
Sure I think I think only two likes on that is a good

3110
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:27,968
Yeah I think that's progress for the living Constitution

3111
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:29,248
Looking through this page

3112
02:18:29,504 --> 02:18:30,784
History it's so clearly so

3113
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:32,064
Someone who's been completely a

3114
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:33,344
Goodbye Alex Jones

3115
02:18:34,112 --> 02:18:37,184
It's a Non-Stop talk about taking off arms up

3116
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,232
And showing the powers-that-be that they are not in

3117
02:18:39,488 --> 02:18:40,000
In charge

3118
02:18:40,256 --> 02:18:43,328
Follow dances insistence is not calling for violence

3119
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,376
It's really sad honestly

3120
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:48,704
Like they call into Alex's show and they're plugging this page

3121
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:51,776
Best as I can tell it didn't do too much in terms of Engagement

3122
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:53,568
They just lost interest in July

3123
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,104
I would think that they

3124
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:56,128
Just died

3125
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:57,408
Maybe got arrested

3126
02:18:57,664 --> 02:18:59,200
But they posted again in March

3127
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:01,248
From that post

3128
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:03,808
Quote I still believe that we can see

3129
02:19:04,064 --> 02:19:04,576
Save our country

3130
02:19:04,832 --> 02:19:07,392
However I don't I do not believe that there's a notch

3131
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,672
Available without blood

3132
02:19:09,952 --> 02:19:11,232
We all know that the corruption

3133
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,000
Is well-rooted

3134
02:19:12,256 --> 02:19:14,048
And not going to voluntarily remove its

3135
02:19:14,816 --> 02:19:17,120
We've all observe how quickly promises made on the

3136
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:18,656
Pain trailer left at the curb

3137
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:21,728
We all know that the soap ballad injury boxes are

3138
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:22,496
Tattered torn

3139
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
Breaking into

3140
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:26,848
We all know the only box still available is

3141
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:27,616
The cartridge by

3142
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:31,200
I do not want my children to grow up knowing what war is

3143
02:19:31,712 --> 02:19:33,760
I do not want my children growing up not knowing me

3144
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:36,832
I do not want my children growing up not knowing what freedom is

3145
02:19:37,344 --> 02:19:39,136
I will not allow anyone the opportunity to

3146
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:39,904
To take that away from

3147
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:41,696
I will with extreme

3148
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:42,720
Prejudice and

3149
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:46,816
Anyone standing in the way of restoring this once great nation to her proper Glory

3150
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:50,144
I heard you all to ask yourself where you're lying is

3151
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:51,936
How much more will you

3152
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:57,568
When will you decide to stop hiding online behind words and put your blood where your mouth is

3153
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:01,152
The end of the post with the hashtag start the revolution

3154
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:06,528
This is The Logical endpoint for a certain amount of people who internalize and believe Alex is b*******

3155
02:20:07,296 --> 02:20:10,112
They're angry the enemy they imagine they're up against a soup

3156
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:11,392
Freeway overpowered

3157
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:13,952
And every time there's a traumatic event in the world like

3158
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:14,976
Boston bombing

3159
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:16,256
They're taught a new

3160
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,792
To hate this overpowered Elite

3161
02:20:18,048 --> 02:20:19,584
Cabal who were secretly the 12

3162
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,608
Who carried out the attack

3163
02:20:21,120 --> 02:20:22,912
They're given no real guidance are Outlet

3164
02:20:23,168 --> 02:20:24,448
But no path toward legitimate

3165
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:25,216
Political action

3166
02:20:25,728 --> 02:20:28,288
Only made him more Angry by outrage after outrage

3167
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:33,152
And they never could change anything anyways since the enemy they're being taught to hate is imaginary

3168
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,944
But they feel so real

3169
02:20:35,968 --> 02:20:38,528
A person can only live in that state for so long before it becomes a

3170
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:39,296
Intolerable

3171
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:42,624
Some could probably deal with it by supporting Alex Moore

3172
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,648
Imagining that it's

3173
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:46,464
The best way they feel that their they could feel like they're making a difference

3174
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:50,816
Some probably manage to break free from the b******* and return to a normal life

3175
02:20:51,328 --> 02:20:56,192
But some are consumed with this anger Centric worldview and end up calling for blood-filled revolutions

3176
02:20:56,448 --> 02:21:00,544
Because they can't figure out any other way to deal with the imaginary enemies Alex

3177
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:01,568
Just taught them to fear

3178
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:05,664
I don't believe for a second that Alex isn't aware that this is something that he does too

3179
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:07,200
He doesn't care

3180
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:10,784
As long as they're out there plugging Infowars that's good for traffic

3181
02:21:11,296 --> 02:21:13,088
And if they do end up following through with their plan to

3182
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:13,856
Kill

3183
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,392
They'll just be called false Flags

3184
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:16,672
Demonize the Patriots

3185
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,208
Double used as a prop

3186
02:21:18,464 --> 02:21:19,744
To provide the fuel Alex needs

3187
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:20,768
The terrifying outrage

3188
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:22,048
The rest of his audio

3189
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:23,584
Continue the cycle

3190
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:25,376
It's good

3191
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:29,216
So where we look at this episode and this this whole thing with the Boston

3192
02:21:29,472 --> 02:21:31,264
Embalming you see likizo vert

3193
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:32,032
Lies

3194
02:21:32,288 --> 02:21:33,056
And this

3195
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:34,080
This bike

3196
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:35,104
This desperate

3197
02:21:35,360 --> 02:21:36,640
Need to take things

3198
02:21:36,896 --> 02:21:39,200
Make them fit his narrative so we can get attention which

3199
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,224
We can absolutely

3200
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,504
From his own words

3201
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:42,528
Is paying off

3202
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,296
Incredibly

3203
02:21:43,808 --> 02:21:45,344
10 times the amount of traffic

3204
02:21:45,600 --> 02:21:46,624
Victory is getting before

3205
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:48,928
It just an insane rise

3206
02:21:49,440 --> 02:21:50,976
In his notoriety

3207
02:21:51,232 --> 02:21:52,000
Endwell

3208
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:53,024
You can look at these

3209
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:56,608
I think it's Uncle also incredibly important

3210
02:21:56,864 --> 02:21:57,888
To remember that there is

3211
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:58,656
These people

3212
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:01,472
One of whom who calls in on the show

3213
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:02,496
Who are being

3214
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:04,544
Guided down

3215
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:06,848
Half that has no offering

3216
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:11,456
At least no off-ramp with a sign that says hey here's a place to

3217
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,736
F****** check yourself

3218
02:22:14,016 --> 02:22:14,528
This is

3219
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:16,832
I'm far more

3220
02:22:17,088 --> 02:22:17,856
Concerned with

3221
02:22:18,112 --> 02:22:18,624
The people who are the

3222
02:22:18,880 --> 02:22:19,392
Targets

3223
02:22:19,648 --> 02:22:20,672
Of Alex's

3224
02:22:20,928 --> 02:22:21,696
Propaganda

3225
02:22:21,952 --> 02:22:22,464
And I are

3226
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:24,000
I'm far more interested

3227
02:22:24,512 --> 02:22:25,792
Spending the bulk of my m

3228
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:27,072
A fee on those feet

3229
02:22:28,096 --> 02:22:28,608
But

3230
02:22:29,888 --> 02:22:31,680
People like this guy who calls in

3231
02:22:33,216 --> 02:22:34,496
I don't think

3232
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:36,544
That I in good conscience

3233
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:39,104
Can't ignore the fact that he is a victim of a lie

3234
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:40,384
Absolute

3235
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:43,712
And it's harder to feel the ton of empathy for him because

3236
02:22:43,968 --> 02:22:45,248
You know he's advocating things

3237
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:47,040
Things that will end up hurting

3238
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:50,880
The targeted communities even more

3239
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:51,648
Follow

3240
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:52,672
His ideas

3241
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:53,696
To The Logical

3242
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:54,720
Conclusion you've gone to a

3243
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:55,744
End up killing people

3244
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,024
And that is unacceptable

3245
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:57,792
Toptable

3246
02:22:58,560 --> 02:23:00,096
Well I mean to a certain extent

3247
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:02,144
For this guy what I see

3248
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,912
Somebody listen

3249
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:03,936
Sing to Alex Jones

3250
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,960
Is Alex Jones is

3251
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:05,728
Is essentially

3252
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:07,264
Has a f****** cattle prod

3253
02:23:07,776 --> 02:23:08,288
And he is

3254
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,056
Living in a

3255
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,592
Constant state of agitation

3256
02:23:11,104 --> 02:23:11,616
A bit like

3257
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:12,896
It's like a

3258
02:23:13,152 --> 02:23:13,920
It's like a f****** you

3259
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:14,688
