00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,032
For the special relief team song

11
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Start was

12
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Potastic

13
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
It was

14
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:59,296
Is another 30 seconds on top of already

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,160
Spiegel

16
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
What a treat to have someone offered services like that

17
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
The talent it is so good

18
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,144
The most frequent

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Comment we get I think is Jordan eats

20
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Shut up

21
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:27,968
Thank you for making another Banger absolutely

22
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Jordan

00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Whatsyourprice

24
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Today is actually I was on the most recent episode

25
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
Russell and Sarah Shockey

26
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
Preview I think I got a number of the matches right

27
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,472
Just by accident so what

28
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
Yeah

29
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
I made some predictions

30
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,664
And yeah I watch the Wrestlemania last night

31
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
What's the

32
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
The first night

33
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
Recording

34
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
I'm David the big

35
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Blove course

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
Spoiler alert

37
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
If you haven't watch WrestleMania you plan to

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Steve Austin

39
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,888
Came back on night 10000 Maniacs okay

40
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Bizarre

41
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
So he came to do like a talk show segment

42
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
They closed the show

43
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
First of all this is nuts

44
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
They had the original

45
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And Kathie Lee like that kind of talk show

46
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,992
What are the things that

47
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
Wrestling does

48
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
It doesn't make sense

49
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,088
Is that they will have

50
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
People

51
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
Create

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
They're on talk shows

53
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
And then they will do them

54
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
And it's basically just a way to set up fight

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,424
I'm interviewing this person that might like

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
Jerry Springer but if you consider it for a little while and why are they doing a talk show

57
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Pull-A-Part

58
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Kevin Owens

59
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
For some reason in the last couple months

60
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
What's decided 38a Texas

61
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,624
And has stupid everyone for Texas is WrestleMania

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Texas

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,952
Stone cold to be a guest on his talk show

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,071
For the talk shows like a man look I'm actually looking for a fight

65
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:19,839
Right

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
And of course Stone Cold go through all the hats you know that you are

67
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
Of course

68
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
The Great

69
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
The great hit

70
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:36,479
Camera got to come to a sign in the crowd Austin 3:16 for sure

71
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,879
Which is bizarre gold medal match

72
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,415
And

73
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
What what I saw was even more bizarre is that

74
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Of course stone cold one

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
But in the match

76
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,143
Owens was able to give him Stone Cold a stunner

77
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
His nuts unbelievable

78
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,311
It's believable it happens

79
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:06,687
Bizarre level of respect to allow your move to you

80
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,807
Put in recycle end up winning and then he's stunned Kevin Owens again

81
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Opened up and poured maybe 30 beers on himself

82
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:29,215
What are the fun things called used to do is he would have people come to the ring announcer and then they

83
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:35,615
Cheers of beer as they're drinking Byron Saxton

84
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,223
Commentators

85
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,271
How to sex

86
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:46,367
Did not know this is coming knows it's coming he has to know it's coming

87
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:50,719
Immediately after this stone cold has his brother come into the ring

88
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:57,375
Why I don't know I've never seen this guy before they're celebrating his last WrestleMania or whatever

89
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
No

90
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,799
Brother comes into the ring and they have a beer and Mike's Dunham stomach

91
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Seriously

92
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:12,479
Has his brother's sons have no that would be too confused

93
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Absolutely

94
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,159
So I just be these

95
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:25,535
He's gone mad with SunPower he's stunning everybody the curb as we're having a good time

96
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
Thought the show was fine I guess

97
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,655
But really was my big

98
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
Gotta follow through trees

99
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
Sexton's your brother especially since the third what is

100
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,991
The funniest

101
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
Everything was there at

102
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:55,487
I mean this just proves to me that stone cold is a coward and I to hate the state of Texas

103
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:59,071
You know what

104
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
Photo of you

105
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,055
I2 joined another podcast

106
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:13,407
Yeah that's right we've cheated on each other except you did it in my own bed

107
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,503
This is my apartment

108
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,879
Everybody a smooth they didn't have Wi-Fi that's right

109
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,951
It's Lions led by Donkey

110
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:35,423
But yeah it was absolutely fantastic he was like we're going to do a two-parter

111
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,751
And then we talked for three hours so.

112
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,055
It was just a fantastic time

113
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,639
But it'll be available for free in like a couple of weeks

114
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
Yeah I've seen some people posting positive things about it I have not had a chance to listen to it but that's over

115
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,951
I like that you and I are branching out

116
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
Add more toys

117
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
Atrocities

118
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,191
Responding to other people say

119
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,103
So Jordan today we haven't promised

120
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,407
It's the Return of modern Alex

121
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,735
Expecting like a

122
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,503
Let It Go

123
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,271
606

124
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
66 episode

125
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
The special episode

126
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:29,695
But when we ever done everything out.

127
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,279
Mental is just a normal episode

128
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,047
First

129
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,607
2022

130
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:42,239
Yeah not good not good not good you mentioned this to you before we started recording and it's it like

131
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,543
Because of the time spent

132
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,151
Preparing the deposition episodes and putting Alex on timeout

133
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,223
Belittle miles inside listen to some present-day Alex

134
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,503
And it was

135
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
Jarring to listen to it again

136
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
It is so hateful

137
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,183
Shockingly offensive

138
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
I I don't I don't

139
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
I don't know what to do what to say other than

140
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,655
Even I someone who is listen to thousands of hours of Alex's show

141
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Was was taken

142
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,519
The freshness

143
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Writing

144
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,823
Fresh after looking at

145
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,871
If not

146
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,919
This is awful gross show

147
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
I'm not going to play too much of the stuff that's actually like

148
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Horrific

149
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551

A little breaking for me

171
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
And then we're going

172
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,631
To come back

00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,703

Walk out of here tomorrow

182
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,255
And you never see me again

Really what I want to do

184
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,447
I apologize to the crew in the listener's yesterday that I

00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:33,503
Also a lot has happened since the last time we checked in with present-day Alex

189
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,647
He's facing escalating penalties for every day that he does not eating everyday

190
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,231
Penalties for every day that he does not do his deposition

191
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,559
Right for the Connecticut

192
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
We call that the Breck

193
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,631
Sex club scenario every week

194
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
He misses he gets another week

195
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,215
Detention

196
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
The whole

197
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
I had a doctor's note is not fly

198
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
No

199
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,943
Yeah he's he's in bad shape about that

200
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
The world's falling apart

201
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
There are

202
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,719
Even if the whole house is on fire

203
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,791
That's not going to stop Alex from getting to the new

204
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,071
Snow

205
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
Doing his

206
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:20,863
Job

207
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Which is telling you

208
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Be accurate information

209
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,471
About the world around you

210
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,847
Alright let me lay out exactly what's going on and unfolding just let you

211
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Here's some of these headlines

212
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
California introduces new bill that would allow Mother's Day

213
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
Kill their babies up to 7 days after birth

214
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,303
Universities in the US are delivered Alive babies after born

215
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
For kept alive or sometimes months

216
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
In medical experiments and I'm not going to tell you what some of the perverts at work

217
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
None of that is true

218
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,615
It's been on aborted fetuses being used for research at its given in the right-wing media

219
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:09,247
Based on manipulative lie edited videos released by Liars like James O'Keefe in the center for

220
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,575
American progress

221
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:20,767
This is an absolutely about a bill in California titled A B 22-23 which amended parts

222
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
The public health code regarding issues around abortion

223
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,935
This has nothing to do with letting people killed babies herb 7

224
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:30,495
He's from the amount of time Alex used to claim the left use

225
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,639
It's only seven days now as opposed to whatever it was

226
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,663
Before

227
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
It's more reasonable for

228
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
I think the leftist reporting it was like a year together and they've decided that it

229
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:52,511
It's only a week right now actually about formalizing the position that no one will be held criminally or civilly responsible for engage

230
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
Aging and reproductive Health in Norfolk assisting a pregnant person

231
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,095
Someone doing so

232
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,703
Website to Alex gets his information from generally cover the story like this

233
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:05,311
This is a quote from lifesitenews which I know that Alex reads and uses a saw

234
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:12,223
The proposed legislation would Shield mother from civil and criminal charges for any quote actions

235
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,271
And quote related to her pregnant

236
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,319
Fancy clothes including miscarriage

237
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
Stillbirth or abortion or perinatal death

238
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,903
Inquire

239
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Although definitions of quote perinatal death

240
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Unquote very

241
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,559
All of them include the demise of newborns

242
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
7 days or more after

243
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,935
This coverage of the story relies heavily on selected

244
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Quotation

245
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:37,055
Selective quotation just why I really strongly specified where the

246
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
The quotes began app

247
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,151
Here's the full part of that section

248
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
In the Bell as a

249
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
Notwithstanding any other law of person shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or panel

250
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,647
Healthy or otherwise deprived of their right

251
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Based on their actions or Omission with

252
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Perspective

253
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,279
Eeyore actual potential or alleged

254
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,815
Pregnancy outcome including

255
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Miscarriage stillbirth

256
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
Or abortion or perinatal.

257
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
That part

258
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:08,287
Notwithstanding any other law is a massive part of the sentence to leave out because

259
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,591
It basically contradicts the entire narrative

260
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
It's being built

261
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:15,455
You can't kill your baby after it's born because I would violate another law

262
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
No

263
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
What

264
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:23,135
Who is Ever Write a Love it's like you can't kill your baby I thought the left love killing babe

265
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,439
Notwithstanding any other law

266
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,559
Dum dum already a law that you can't murder babies

267
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,399
It's been awhile at least a couple months

268
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
This language in the bill is specifically meant to make it so if there is a miscarriage or baby dies shortly after

269
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
Cerberus

270
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,919
The parent will be held civilly or criminally responsible

271
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,455
Like say in a different

272
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:52,575
What state where they might say oh your baby died two days afterwards even though the doctor said

273
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,111
That it was going to die no matter what

274
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,999
You did be better and give birth to it and now we're going to prosecute you for a crime because

275
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
It is certainly a

276
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:11,007
This is honestly a pathetic attempt to get mad about something that literally says the opposite thing that you're claiming it does but people like

277
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:14,335
Alex only has pathetic attempts to offer because they're dumb and their points are

278
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,103
The s***

279
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,895
He does hate people get abortions

280
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,943
Partially because of his religious zealotry

281
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,527
And partially due to unprocessed Guild that he feels about his past

282
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,295
Decisions

283
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,111
He could deal with his problems but it said he does

284
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,719
Larger picture the Riley media is taking aim at the bill because it includes language

285
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:35,071
To take language out of the existing health code

286
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:40,447
We're just really mad because their number one organizing issue at the moment is demonizing trans people

287
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,215
Emmitt Smith

288
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Serrated to that heading

289
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,263
For them

290
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,335
Overall Ahi Pullin stupid life from Alex.

291
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:51,711
To start the show that will likely end up helping get people who need reproductive Healthcare

292
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Gilbert

293
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:57,087
Yep curiously Alex over the news about Lauren Hamby

294
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,927
AP Washington a abortion activists whose house was searched and turned out she had

295
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,463
5 fetuses in cooler

296
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,279
No hot take on that one it seems

297
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,303
I mean weird

298
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
He would have to have a cool take on that one

299
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Sure

300
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:14,495
Oh yeah that one.

301
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Seems to have not happen

302
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,591
Cuz it seems like

303
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
You know that would be something that's so important

304
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:24,735
Talk about you know cuz the left is killing babies 7 Days afterwards so

305
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
We should find out what the answer your portion activist are doing

306
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
Keeping fetuses

307
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,647
Why was she

308
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
I don't know

309
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,767
I think from what the story that I read about it

310
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
There was an allegation

311
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
Strawberry her whatever Associates

312
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,631
That they were avid

313
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:45,215
I don't know

314
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,007
Don't buy it it'll buy it

315
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
Heavyweight there's more big news in Allentown

316
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Like he's on the ball here

317
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:56,735
While Samsung has banned the word Z letters I told you that was coming

318
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
Banning letters

319
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,903
You got so much to break down there

320
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:08,767
A story from

321
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
The letters he's become a bit of a symbol for the invading Russian army who are currently still engaged in a war in Ukraine that Alex said would

322
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Last about 48 hours over a month

323
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:24,127
I have such it's taking a bit of a negative connotation to people who aren't bootlicking Putin apologist like Alex

324
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,943
Emma's became a branding problem for Samsung

325
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:32,063
Bam the letter Z foldable phone that they were selling was called the Galaxy

326
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,599
Azizi fold3

327
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,671
And that name release were poorly time

328
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,719
Remove disease

329
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,303
Leave from the name and Ukraine Latvia Lithuania and Estonia

330
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,119
Probably because it would have been a PR issues they didn't

331
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
So naturally because Alex is a lazy liar this

332
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:48,959
This becomes a band

333
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
Gliders

334
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,007
Yeah I mean

335
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Instead of being like

336
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,847
Hey let's not reference a genocide

337
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,199
Unfortunate

338
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,223
PR situation

339
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
Yeah yeah that means before the war

340
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,671
Hey we got a real cool idea week

341
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Piggyback off of

342
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Is El Sabor phone

343
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Whatever

344
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,583
I don't think this is a big deal I think it's a done deal yeah

345
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,447
These are some of the top headlines

346
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
Discussing and actually

347
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,007
You think that conveys him

348
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,823
Information the audience needs and can use

349
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,383
Well if a brand removes the letter z

350
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
Then

351
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
They're coming for your W-9

Firestone

362
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,383
Germany

363
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,967

Yes run out our strategic oil Reserves

366
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,159

Letting people thrilled

368

00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
And deliver oil

370
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,095
On Thanksgiving Lounge

371
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,911
Oil companies

372
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,679
Hudson Grille

373
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,447
The Wildcatter

374
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Got out of the Ender

375
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,567
This is total economic war against

376
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,847
Point Blank Range

377
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:35,711
And also big articles

378
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
With his judges and District

379
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,063
Attorneys that rule

380
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
And believe me I face these people.

381
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
And there is no new process for Christians

382
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,047
Conservatives gun owners

383
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,607
Veteran there anyone especially on a pedophile

384
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
Loving devil worshiper

385
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
We got that information

386
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
More clear by tigers vomiting out a medic

387
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:04,383
Conspiracy theories that insisted Soros runs all the cities and small towns of Judges EPUB

388
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,455
Pitmasters stuff

389
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
To get around

390
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:13,599
Oil drilling loans this is entirely made up

391
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
In August 2021 Vines Department

392
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
The treasury issued

393
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Multilateral development Banks

394
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Arctic

395
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,560
They shouldn't give International loans

396
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:24,352
For coal and oil exploration

397
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,912
This is guidance not a rule

398
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
It's also not applicable

399
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,592
Domestically so unless these wildcatters these independent oil drillers are trying to get a loan from the World Bank

400
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
To dig in Vietnam

401
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:36,896
It doesn't apply

402
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:43,552
Does nonsense mean it doesn't get more Wildcat then suddenly go to Vietnam wild ass cat

403
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:46,624
Catman the opposite

404
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
Is true

405
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:51,232
21 the office of the Comptroller of the currency

406
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
They adopted a new rule which made it essentially impossible for domestic

407
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
Banks in the United States

408
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Unilaterally reject loan

409
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,192
From businesses in a particular industry

410
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:03,776
For instance denying oil companies loans because you're worried about climate

411
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,544
Right

412
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,360
While this may seem like a bit of a negative thing there's a narc

413
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,152
You meant that it could actually be

414
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,176
Important because

415
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
It makes it so Banks

416
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,016
Can't refuse to loan to Broad categories of things like

417
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:14,784
Charities

418
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Which they may have been able

419
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
Go to do the absence of a rule like

420
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
OCC press release

421
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,696
Quote

422
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,048
Comptroller's and staff and previous administrations have made clear in speeches guidance

423
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Some testimony

424
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:30,912
That should not terminate services to entire categories of customers without conduct

425
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,192
Individual risk Assessor

426
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:37,312
Is inconsistent with basic principles of prudent risk management to make decisions based solely on

427
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:41,152
Conclusory or categorical assertions of risk without actual amount

428
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,320
As this was at the end of Trump's term there was some talk that the rule be reversed once by and got into office but

429
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:52,160
In January 2021 Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard

430
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,952
Gave it explicit

431
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:58,048
Words that the FED would not be making any directives about Banks and not loaning to

432
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Pacific Industries

433
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
That's not our job we don't tell Bank

434
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,264
Which sectors do we asked them to risk-managed and we make sure they have good

435
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,056
Practices are good processes in place

436
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Sprite

437
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
We got two stories

438
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
So far

439
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
That are both

440
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Not true

441
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
And aggressively the opposite is

442
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
I mean I don't know what there is about the Z that we can really hang our hats

443
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:25,952
Are there but this one

444
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:31,584
Nothing you can't do the thing you can do and you can't not do the thing that you can do

445
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Yes yes it's

446
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,680
It's just complete not that

447
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,520
Okay if you're just listening to show free information you're going to just

448
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,288
Believe

449
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,848
The opposite of what is real

450
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Teeter B world

451
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
Cool

452
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
I think he's just making this s*** up

453
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,712
But if I had

454
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,528
Gas I think Alex might have skimmed some headlines about the answer

455
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
CC proposing new regulations

456
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:55,904
About oil companies have to provide climate-related disclosures

457
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,952
And then he's reporting on it like this

458
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:58,976
I think

459
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,768
Either that or he's just make

460
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,792
This up out of thin air

461
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm not sure

462
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
That sounds about right

463
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
But

464
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
You know

465
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,448
Maybe maybe maybe in reality

466
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
I just don't listen to

467
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,288
Maybe maybe

468
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
I think you're the only person

469
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Who listens to Alex Hardin

470
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
I still

471
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,480
Have Alex telling me that I need to listen up and listen good

472
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,552
It's not going to just be the third world is starving to death

473
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,088
It's going to be

474
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,416
Every major country in the world has tab

475
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:31,744
Civil War planned

476
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
During the collapse

477
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
So wouldn't that just be

478
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
Global

479
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,912
War needs to sink into the people that are involved in the different

480
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,960
Government agencies and corporations

481
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,776
Better than helping carry the compartmentalize

482
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:47,872
You need to get D compartmentalize and you need to listen to me and listen

483
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Good

484
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,456
Because I had your best interest at heart

485
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Because we all have joint interest here

486
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,296
Civilization

487
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,112
And it continued on for please listen to me

488
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm getting

489
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Biggest chills I've ever gotten on air

490
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,280
Spirit tells you

491
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
Listen to me very carefully

492
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Here's a good news

493
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:11,936
I have

494
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:12,960
Bunch of

495
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,984
Indicators here

496
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:15,520
A government

497
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
Policy

498
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,896
In just the last 48 hours it's getting almost

499
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,528
That there are some sane people inside the system

500
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
They're trying to put the brakes on the collapse

501
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,112
Okay

502
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,672
Some good people are doing some stuff all right

503
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,768
Man this is so frustrating I hate

504
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,840
Because last time we've got Trump in office

505
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,424
And he's surrounded by some bad people

506
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,824
You right and that everything that happens is some nefarious bumper cover globalist

507
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
Abiding in office

508
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:56,224
And they're still like surrounded by dinar good people who are YouTubers Road people who are the good one

509
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:59,296
Yeah just figure your s*** out

510
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,064
You got it

511
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
It's

512
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,392
You kind of box yourself in

513
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,184
If you don't allow for

514
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:11,840
Rogue agents within whatever you want

515
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
Cuz you have to be able to justify good things that happened under the administrations of people you hate

516
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,776
Things happen under your Heroes at

517
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
Ministration

518
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,872
So you just create these Bizarro spy novels

519
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:26,176
It's like

520
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:31,808
If James Bond were able to pass legislation

521
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
It's nonsense

522
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
Vilseck

523
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,280
H b

524
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
Did you know that all of the globalist

525
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Play song

526
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:55,360
James Bond villains all of them are based on globalist

527
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,152
Ford Precision without sin

528
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:00,224
Huge compound and they really are James Bond villain

529
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,296
Villains are based on real people

530
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Ian Fleming new

531
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
When he went to places like Bilderberg

532
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,976
When you see those movies and then slept like notoriety

533
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,280
What's going on

534
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
You got government-owned you've got spec

535
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
You got Hydra

536
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,424
You called him the hell you want but it's real

537
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,520
Hydra

538
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
He's really a corporate leader

539
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,968
Will be working foreign

540
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,320
Riders of all these shows are telling you what's really going on

541
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Persona

542
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,416
I don't work for

543
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,744
For Humanity in America and freedom

544
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,816
And it really comes down to that you work for the state

545
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
From the Bible

546
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,960
You better decide right now

547
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:58,592
Not the most important way to understand my religious belief has to watch a children's cartoon

548
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,736
The world was just explained to me in a barrage of references to evil organizations in 100%

549
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
Fictional universe

550
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,832
For children

551
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:12,160
Outlook.com

552
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,256
Tell me the backyard with my friends was actually training for the fight against the devil

553
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,816
You know what's crazy about it if you didn't bring up

554
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Captain Planet

555
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:26,752
Arguing

556
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,568
I was a rat but his

557
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
Real problem with dumping toxic waste

558
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,688
Overcomplicate things

559
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:36,480
Galaxy

560
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
These are all

561
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,296
Thematically just like

562
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:43,136
Haha big shadowy organization

563
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:44,160
Trump VR

564
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,464
Goldfinger

565
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,632
The app that whole photo spread of his apartment.

566
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
Do it

567
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,424
Oddjob

568
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,240
Who is Jaws

569
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,800
What who all was on the Celebrity Apprentice

570
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:08,224
Dan Danny Bonaduce duty is okay

571
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Guy from Poison

572
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Dekuyper

573
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Brett something

574
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,488
Wow you was on the Rock of Love bus

575
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
The accused

576
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,608
Bret Hart

577
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
Yes this is dumb

578
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
I think it's really

579
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,216
Kind of

580
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Troubling

581
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,544
How imprints this idea is that like

582
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
No

583
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,640
The people writing g.i. Joe we're trying to warn you

584
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
Yeah

585
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,432
Yeah that is

586
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,992
I think that he just said

587
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:46,368
A radio show in public that would 100% get you

588
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,392
Section 8 it

589
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
You know

590
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:51,744
Fast as you were telling your boss that it work

591
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,632
Listen if you want to understand global politics you need to watch g.i. Joe

592
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
You're fired

593
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Agreed

594
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776
Four Paws

595
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:05,056
I will not fight back

596
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:10,688
I'm going to go tell the nlrb's that you murdered me and not already dead

597
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
Just trouble

598
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,368
So there is some good news like Alex mentioned earlier

599
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:20,928
Okay get limp

600
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:23,488
Quietly

601
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,560
Remove fertilizer off the list

602
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Banned items

603
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Because if you don't

604
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
Do that

605
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
It will

606
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,264
2

607
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080
Billion people in the next two years

608
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Just watch it's always a year

609
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
What for

610
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,760
Hey buddy it's going to kill

611
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,416
So the underlying story here's more or less true that

612
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
Betty's the sanctions as it relates to medical and agricultural products

613
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,536
Tax which is probably a good thing

614
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
Alex's exaggerating things a little bit though

615
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,752
There will definitely be affect but it's premature to assume that it'll be nearly as cataclysmic is Alex's birthday

616
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,288
Disruption the Tappan

617
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:11,872
Or the reason for this is because of though Russia is a large

618
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,200
Exporter of fertilizer the ingredients used in fertilizer

619
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
We don't holy rely on it

620
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,296
Imports for fertilizer nor does any Khan

621
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:24,928
A lot of it is produced domestically and there are other countries like India and Canada that are potential sources

622
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,720
They can make up some of the difference

623
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
It's lost

624
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,072
It's obviously wouldn't be a perfect fit but there are

625
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,888
Some solutions that can be helpful

626
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
Be Ripple effects related to cost

627
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,776
And that's not a small issue but they're also Solutions

628
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
Explore the country to offset some of that

629
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,848
Challenge

630
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,616
Because it's just

631
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,176
The financial monetary Challenge and if we have the will

632
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
And the political will

633
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,248
Some of that would be

634
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Not as difficult

635
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:56,416
Now it sounds like that's an unsolvable problem that will never handle you know what it probably is

636
00:31:56,672 --> 00:32:00,256
I was joking also on March 11th Department of Agriculture announced

637
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,584
$250 in grant funding for the exploration

638
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Do the best

639
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,376
Stick fertilizer production

640
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,144
An options

641
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:11,520
This is going to push American industry create new jobs and opportunities and maybe make a dead to the food

642
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,800
Supply issue as a whole

643
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,616
And possibly be you know

644
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
The help

645
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,944
Create animations in terms of cleaner

646
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,712
Method

647
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,504
Yeah but I really think that

648
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
More money should go to the military

649
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,600
That seems like unreasonable things

650
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Look

651
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,440
Treasury Department rolled back some of these sanctions

652
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,744
Department of Agriculture

653
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,560
Announce these grants for domestic

654
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,608
Exploration of new

655
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
Technologies in industry

656
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Alex should be celebrating that

657
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:44,800
It was B Administration so sorry this stuff doesn't even seem to have happened

658
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
That Trump left behind

659
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:50,176
Sleeper Agent I'm sure that would be the!

660
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:59,136
Hopewell just because things are happening under the guy that I hate doesn't mean I have to tell people about it

661
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,720
Notify your dumb s***

662
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
So we go out to break

663
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:05,536
Things are G

664
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,608
So you can pretend you're with the establishment you can purr

665
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Pretend

666
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
You're a judge

667
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,728
Rogue

668
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:15,264
Bureaucrat

669
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,640
Fill out your Birthright and destroy the social safety net

670
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
And destroy

671
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
The checks and balances in chivalry

672
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
Better protect us all

673
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Roberts

674
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,832
The last vestiges

675
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
Of the Renaissance

676
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,184
Are being swept away as we sit here

677
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,720
Brace yourselves

678
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Jorge

679
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,024
None of that meant anything

680
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,072
What what was he even mad about

681
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:45,216
I mean you heard the judges things as probably

682
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
Yeah

683
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
Anything

684
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:57,248
The last 10 over what what is that what are the last vestiges of the Renaissance

685
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:04,672
And then chivalry slapping people with glad the right to dual yeah absolutely okay I think we should

686
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,232
Should have that be the the

687
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,072
Unalienable right to be a knight-errant yeah yeah

688
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,632
You need to well I mean you have to spend the night

689
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,984
In prayer without Aunt fasting in order to become a full knight-errant so

690
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,360
What's going on judges are taking away our night of reflection

691
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,896
Before you become a knight

692
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
I just like this

693
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
It's

694
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
Always remarkable to be Whitney

695
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
You just have sentences

696
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
That go on in

697
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,832
They don't mean anything

698
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
I feel good probably to say chivalry is being destroyed

699
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:42,304
Yourself

700
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,072
Monster Golf

701
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:55,104
Historically associated with the Renaissance yes I agree

702
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,152
Some of those paint

703
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
F****** taters

704
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:04,064
Alex is mad obviously about Judges probably related to his case

705
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,112
She's also mad about Amanda

706
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:06,880
Smooth

707
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
They can put you in prison for a misdemeanor

708
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Because

709
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,792
There's no 8th Amendment

710
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,560
Anymore

711
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,608
You see that being done to me right now

712
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:25,056
Another judge the judge is everything and all of creation

713
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,080
Who's that

714
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
. oh

715
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,064
Soccer

716
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,648
Excessive bail or fines

717
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
No fine but Alex is facing is in any way except

718
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
His behavior has been so disrespectful to the court and so flagrantly obstruction is that I probably would say that you deserve more

719
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,752
Excessive if you put a bounty out for a million dollars you could find a million dollars

720
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,360
Or something

721
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
I don't know

722
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
Hard to defend that one

723
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Unfair

724
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:06,272
I also I would say that God as Alex is not a great model

725
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,552
For Earth judges

726
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
41

727
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:12,160
I think sending people to hell is definitely a cruel and unusual punishment

728
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:15,488
Bigger picture though if you look at goddess some kind of law enforcement

729
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
Much bigger than life isn't exercising in trap

730
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
And I don't know if

731
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,936
That's cool thing as God just hanging out waiting for you to f******

732
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:25,216
Yeah

733
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:28,032
He created

734
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
The thing that tempts us to sin which is what sends us to hell and not just that but we have no free will over our actions

735
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:38,528
Whatsoever anyway so all that we have and we'll do is already been written in the book

736
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,296
Debatable

737
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:42,112
Depending on your interpretation of the movie knowing

738
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,392
Also I hope

739
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,184
When Alex gets to the Pearly Gates

740
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,768
It's not the hell causes a big scene and complains it like

741
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,816
Peter's book has gold tassels on it

742
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:53,632
Hibbett Heavens operating under maritime law

743
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
Happiness

744
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
It's just

745
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
This is not a boat

746
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,616
I want my $600,000 back

747
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
I

748
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:05,920
I would love it if

749
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
Alex ends up getting sent to hell and there's a

750
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
The conspiracy about it

751
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:16,160
Story that I was lying about earlier and he has some other lies

752
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,208
People doing this

753
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
Pay for what they've done

754
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
Little Bill

755
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm sure you've heard around the country that got bills to keep babies alive for 2 weeks 10 weeks

756
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,592
6 weeks and kill him

757
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
Where's Nolan California

758
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
California reduces new bill

759
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,528
Don't allow mothers to kill their babies up to 7 days after birth

760
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,624
Peter Singer and Pete on all of always push this

761
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
Campbell kill babies

762
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,232
Repita actually

763
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
PETA

764
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,168
California

765
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,496
Infanticide bill that would legalize the murder of children

766
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
Route 29 months of gestation

767
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:07,872
And in the weeks after birth

768
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
The mill

769
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,224
Has been proposed by Newsom

770
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,552
Future of abortion Council which makes recommendations

771
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,832
Restrictions

772
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,136
Does the State of California

773
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
Define

774
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
They've already been doing this for a while

775
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,912
They got to do a rear guard action

776
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,216
What

777
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:33,984
The Christians

778
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,520
Infiltrators

779
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,592
The video of all this

780
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:43,456
So what's going on here is that Alex hasn't read this article and he has no idea what's in the bill

781
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,480
He just got in the

782
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,880
Opinion on it that's formed from skimming headlines and extreme right-wing blogs written by lunatic so everything's just going to filter through that

783
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,256
I hope he's reading Alex realizes that he needs to find a way to make this make more sense

784
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,584
How is this being defined do you have a week

785
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
To kill your baby

786
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,448
Like what what in what world would that be the norm

787
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,312
I'm interested to know there has to be some explanation for that so Alex just makes it up

788
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
California is redefining what a baby is

789
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,432
You're not a baby until you're 8 days old

790
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,736
I'd make that clears it up but also its

791
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,552
Totally pulled out of Alex's ass 100%

792
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:23,648
That's because you need an explanation for the timeframe you just need it

793
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,952
I know but there's another law that says

794
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
Babies are people when they're born

795
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,304
What were the Articles that Alex's reading

796
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,448
Don't include that language notwithstanding any other law because they don't want people to realize that they're full of s***

797
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
Yeah that's no good

798
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:45,152
What kind of deceptive almost has the third stage live

799
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,480
Lying about it making s*** up about it

800
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,808
Probably just imagining even worse things

801
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,832
Imagine that

802
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
The somebody's eating

803
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
These babies for sure

804
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Right

805
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,256
In reality a number these stupid blogs have different time frames

806
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,840
I'm stirring which they claimed it to this bill will allow you to kill your baby because

807
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:06,656
They're all just lying about the term perinatal death

808
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:08,704
Whatever the blog decide

809
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,032
That's how long you have to kill your baby according

810
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:17,152
Perry Isabel Perry Perry is pepper but Terry is a prefix

811
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,432
Derived from Greek meaning

812
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,200
Around

813
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,296
And there's no specific definition for how long perinatal periods May last

814
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,368
It really depends on the pregnancy and with a needs are of the

815
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
The parents and child

816
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
This is all just a made-up story

817
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:34,816
You can tell her we could grasp Alex has on it because he's just fabricated details about it to his audience doesn't lose faith

818
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
But he knows what he's

819
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
It's

820
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
It's sad

821
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,936
Yeah you know

822
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
It does seem

823
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Almost

824
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Hard to believe

825
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
Maybe even impossible to believe

826
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,872
Tire governing body of it

827
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:49,408
State would be able to

828
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
To get away with

829
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,272
Writing a bill that says it's okay to murder your baby for a week

830
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:58,368
Only for a week

831
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
Possible to believe that they could do that

832
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,560
Actually pass it or sign-in or whatever before anybody else but Infowars got ahold of it

833
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
Right

834
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
I mean like if

835
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
You were a

836
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:15,776
Parrot and you had a baby four days ago and you're like I want to see my baby and then the doctors are like

837
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,616
Not a baby yet you got four more days

838
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:23,968
What if you are a parent who really hated their baby

839
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,784
And this bill passed on like day five would you be

840
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Concerned would you be like wait

841
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Is this entrapment

842
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,624
If I kill this baby

843
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Mean

844
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,768
I would wonder what the Rams

845
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,560
Applications would be easier like

846
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
If somebody

847
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
Did

848
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:45,472
Skillababy cuz they listen to Alex's show and thought that it was legal

849
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,336
Like would Alex get in trouble for that I mean it would be in it

850
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,640
It's hard to imagine that somebody gets that

851
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,991
Far they don't have any any other Inspirations behind

852
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,319
Ate it but Alec I agree

853
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:03,647
I think a lot of the times these these

854
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,767
Notions and rhetoric and beliefs that are put out into the world have very serious consequences

855
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
I wonder if

856
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,071
It's a potentially

857
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,607
Like a things that shoot

858
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,983
You should worry about

859
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,103
F****** coolers in her home now I am more worried about it yet doesn't Inspire confidence

860
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,919
Sharp

861
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:30,783
Just making up these details to fill in the gaps we realize is like

862
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:37,183
If I don't explain that the audience might get curious about it and it might look into it why is it a week

863
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:39,231
Let me find out this is all full of

864
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
All but there's another

865
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
I want to bring up and I'm not going to play clips of it because I think it's a sort content that wouldn't do the audience any good and I think it's

866
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Grotesque

867
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:53,823
I've noticed this habit of Alex just making up details about things to flesh out stories

868
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,407
He's particularly prevalent any stories about abuse against children

869
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:04,319
I've read the reports a new stories about some of the cases he brings up and Alex will just make up lurid details to make them seem

870
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:07,135
Sensational or make them more easy to fit into his

871
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:07,903
Conspiracies

872
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,183
It legitimately it's

873
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,999
It makes me sick to listen to Aunt this episode

874
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,535
A particular included some

875
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,327
Census of that that I'm just not going

876
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
I've often pointed out how Alex

877
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:22,495
Who's the person who is way of making money is essentially just lying about tragedies

878
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,311
And I wanted to make sure that it's clear that this extends to him music

879
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,383
Victims of childhood abuse as props that he can profit off of

880
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
I honestly was

881
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,711
Conflicted about playing some of the clips

882
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:33,759
On that team because on the one hand

883
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:38,111
I know the playing them as the likely possibility of her degree from triggering some listeners

884
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,391
I don't think it adds

885
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:43,743
Anything really to our understanding of Alex other than he's an a****** which we already know

886
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,791
At the same time I do worry

887
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:51,167
Sometimes that we are being clear about how shockingly offensive and extreme the show is in the present day

888
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:52,959
Like I worried

889
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
Possibility

890
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
That because of

891
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,335
Those editorial choices of

892
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
I'm not going

893
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
Everybody does this grotesque knots

894
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,479
I'm sure that there's a sugar coating that goes on

895
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:05,247
Risk of

896
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
Sanitizing

897
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
A monster like Alex

898
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,391
It's like we've already hit

899
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
Where

900
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,951
Normal human being

901
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Kingswood go

902
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,815
F*** off this guy's a monster right we don't need to go past that that's over

903
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:22,911
I know the episode to the Past we've played a lot of those grotesque

904
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,775
The reason why it doesn't really add anything now is because

905
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:30,335
That's part of the information base of his show

906
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:34,687
Yeah I worry though that as there are new our listeners maybe some of the move.

907
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,479
They've gone along with it and

908
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,015
Entire Journey

909
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,391
The date you don't recognize that a lot of this show can be

910
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
Disgusting

911
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:48,255
Very extreme

912
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,887
You know the risk is sanitizing it but what we are doing

913
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,167
Is telling you about it

914
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,215
And all that is being

915
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:00,543
Sanitized is just a visceral emotional reaction

916
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
Can you would have to touch

917
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,615
Disgusting out right like I don't want to

918
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
People to

919
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,711
Tweet pictures of

920
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
Civilian

921
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,599
Murder By you know I don't I don't want to look at that bright but I

922
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
F****** know it happen

923
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
You know

924
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Right

925
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,207
Right that's kind of the

926
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:20,255
BMX extreme

927
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Example

928
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,839
Of it but that's kind of the balance of like

929
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
Is not

930
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,655
It is is it

931
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,191
Did Subway sugar coating

932
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
To not look at

933
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:30,239
Before reality of it

934
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,823
And I agree with you I don't think it's our shows place too

935
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,871
Put metaphorical

936
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Pictures of

937
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,687
Dead people absolute people's face

938
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,503
Although I

939
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:42,527
Just wanted to

940
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
Call out vet

941
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:50,207
I struggle with that decision sometimes because I recognize and I see how bad Alex is

942
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,999
And I worry that some people

943
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:54,303
Because we make jokes a lot of the time frame

944
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Like I worry that

945
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,143
Some people might have a softer version of him

946
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,167
Then he deserves

947
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
As bad as it gets

948
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:03,263
So

949
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:08,895
Even as bad as it gets

950
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
One of the things you can't take away from me

951
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,479
Is that your ports on really important

952
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503

955
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,367

It's Snow White

966
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
Meaning of the image of a

967
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:48,319
Becoming a woman that powerful images she's coffee as a mentor today

968

Girl girl

Doesn't say hey let's go out in the forest in

972
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815

She says let's explore your sexuality

975

Man in a wig

976
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Telling the childless

977
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,359
Explore your sexuality I mean

978
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
I am I mean

979
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,455
I guess if you need

980
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,783
To describe memes in order to

981
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,855
Express your anger and transphobia

982
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,623
Fine

983
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,671

00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,607
Is this a Radio Shack on audio medium

987
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:39,007
I mean it does sound a little bit like my grandma trying to tell me about a movie she saw 20 years ago

988
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:44,127
He goes to the place and it at the place

989
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
They do all the stuff

990
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
Here's what I want to say

991
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,527
Description of the meme is fairly clear

992
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,319
You can kind of imagination

993
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
But

994
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
It's also

995
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
Who cares

996
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975

997
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255

Spear my friend

1000
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,935
And that's fear is pointing into a meme

1001
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,471
You're describing shitpost

1002
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:13,823

I don't want Infowars to employ

1029
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,287
And so I

How as a comic

1046
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,679
I could have told you 10 years ago

1047
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Don't get that many teeth

1048
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:19,519
Don't do it

1049
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:24,639
We know a million people who have boxes of t-shirts everywhere

1050
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Sage advice

1051
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,015
I think also

1052
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
You need to

1053
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,671
If you're ordering 63,000 shirts

1054
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,719

1055
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255

I don't even

1059
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,263
I don't even know how to estimate if that's a lot of shirts for him

1060
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,127
I don't even know who took a lot of shirts I don't know how a conversation can work

1061
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:58,431
Eveready functioning business that goes like this

1062
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
We have a lot of shirts

1072
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
How many shirts did you order have you been piling up shirts in the corner of the world

1073
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:22,751
Must be thing or shirts don't move

1074
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,311
Of course not nobody ever move shirts

1075
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:30,431
Who wants to wear a f****** Infowars shirt very few if you do with the statement

1076
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,967
It is

1077
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:36,831
I think people are find possibly putting up in fours bumper stickers cuz you not to wear them

1078
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
Bright

1079
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,391

1082
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,791
In the wild

1083
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:50,143
It was when I went with Marty DeRosa to show that he was doing in Indiana

1084
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,935
And we freaked out

1085
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,471
Cuz the guy was wearing

1086
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,775
Lolita

1087
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,639
I guess the world is ending but good news I got a warehouse full of shirts

1088
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:04,991
I'm a little bit confused how we started that clip of I remember growl world is ending

1089
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Dramatic music

1090
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
End of the clip

1091
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319

00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,983
The tree of Liberty

1111
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,519
The Thomas Jefferson quote on it

1112
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,287
Blood

1113
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:01,823
The Patriot

1114
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,103
Much refreshed

1115
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Dupree of Liberty

1116
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:04,895
Sometime

1117
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,943
Graybar probably sold half of them

1118
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,807
And we need to get the rest of them out to get funds in

1119
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,575
Now

1120
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:17,695
I want to thank you all for doing that Shannon

1121
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,255
Total collapse of civilization right away

1122
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:26,143
They were going to watch some very special things for by their founding members give you put your email and when you purchase it if you don't then that

1123
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,423
Support

1124
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
Habistore clemento

1125
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,263
Heirloom

1126
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:36,639
Of the Revolutionary War against Satan revolutionary war against Eatonville

1127
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,919
That one was 70

1128
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
G73 though

1129
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:44,063
We have to beat him to even start the revelers level

1130
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
I think about

1131
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:47,135
Possible that Alex old half

1132
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,671
For the coins and a half days

1133
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,719
But if so

1134
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,767
A drastic decrease

1135
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,327
And the number of available from the last time

1136
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:00,191
Because we heard him complain about no one bought the colony but a free to go home around

1137
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,263
Send it move

1138
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:09,663
As to why you would want to have what is essentially a terrorist slogan on a coin in your pocket all the time honestly I don't want

1139
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:12,479
Go to my pocket but there is a part of me that would

1140
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
Want the full set of those three coins

1141
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,135
I don't want to give him money and I don't want any more listeners stupid somehow

1142
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:24,767

Maintenance

1160
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,239
The scary ideas about how Stormtroopers are gone

1161
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
Going to come in and take everybody out

1162
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:42,335
And it's really just they want to get Alex

1163
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,615
And Owen Shroyer

1164
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,919
Trouble setting up his whole operation

1165
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,455
That's why they hit

1166
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
Cuz I want to get his balls

1167
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,575
People in folks and inheritance present others are doing

1168
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,343
Great job show

1169
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,391
Continue on but again

1170
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,207
Just let you know that we're Two Minutes to Midnight

1171
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
They're going to everybody Tucker Carlson

1172
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
Trump

1173
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,655
Anybody to populous anybody that they

1174
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Control

1175
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
Anybody that's going to stand up

1176
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
I am x-ray

1177
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,615
Solitary confinement

1178
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:16,639
My most dumbest

1179
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
It stomped to death down a dungeon

1180
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Peacefully

1181
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:24,063
Go forward a number to be christ-like

1182
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
Oh

1183
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,391
That's a really bad news for Alex

1184
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
If the top

1185
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:32,767
B last after you and Owen gets up solitary confinement Harrison Smith

1186
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
Import is going to be dead in a week

1187
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,839
Harrison's going to be doing

1188
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,167
Full on mask off Nazi show on Nick Fuentes a streaming service

1189
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,703
That's where you going

1190
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:45,823
More bad news even if only Alex went down and old was still there in Forza

1191
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,847
Still be dead in a week

1192
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,151
There's no talent in this organization

1193
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:50,431
And other than Alex

1194
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:52,223
He had essentially been worn down by

1195
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,271
Drug use bad financial moves

1196
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:58,367
And he was being an unhinged rage-filled a******

1197
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
Done it's only a matter of time but yes

1198
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,743
Infowars we live on

1199
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
Inasmuch as the

1200
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,839
Equipto anti-semites will still spread stupid

1201
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
Series online

1202
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:10,143
Happy Wheels

1203
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
Still trying to scam people with

1204
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,703
In that sense

1205
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:14,239
Alex's Legacy is very

1206
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:16,287
Secure and his impact will be felt

1207
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:18,847
For years to come call them so much

1208
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
You know like that

1209
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,455
Successors are the kids of Alex Jones so much as like

1210
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,735
What happens when a

1211
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,503
Mushroom release

1212
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:26,527
The Cloud of spores

1213
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,087
So anyway

1214
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
Alex's

1215
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Dark state

1216
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Please

1217
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,487
Talking a lot of death

1218
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,023
Stopped and dungeons

1219
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:37,791
Sure

1220
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:40,863
They want you to know that if his family dies wasn't

1221
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,655
Priceline

1222
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,215
I will not offensive legal after these people

1223
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,239
Are they come

1224
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,031
Show me I'm just going to

1225
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:48,799
Get on my knees

1226
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,383
Because I'm not going to give them the fight that one

1227
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:57,247
What

1228
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:58,783
But if they common

1229
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
Murder suicide

1230
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,927
That is a lie I did not

1231
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,975
Commit suicide and kill my family

1232
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
That is a lie

1233
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,327
You know they killed me and my family they do that

1234
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
So that's what we're dealing with

1235
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,191
But it's okay folks

1236
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:18,495
I chose this I want to fight these people

1237
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
Politically culturally spiritually

1238
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,823
I chose this path

1239
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:24,383
Where I Wanna Be

1240
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
Funeral

1241
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
I don't have the General yet

1242
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,063
It's right where you wanted to be

1243
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,623
And that's exactly where I'm at

1244
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
Opposition

1245
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
In opposition of the devil worship

1246
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,303
Opposition to the New World Order in opposition to transhumanist

1247
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,095
In opposition to the uyghur death camp

1248
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,143
Allison said that he does

1249
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:50,495
Don't care about the weaker 100% that that is very clearly

1250
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,543
If I'm ever in a situation where I'm having

1251
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,639
Preemptively speculate about how stories that I've killed my family are a false flag

1252
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,455
I would likely not be exactly where I want

1253
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:05,855
There's probably something it's gone horribly wrong ever in that position

1254
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,135
Assume that something is

1255
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,231
Very wrong I mean yeah I would assume I'm already dead and that's it

1256
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:15,583
Or you're the person who I say I won't kill or something

1257
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,215
This is all fine but it's just chesspub pausing bravado and you've heard this from Alex over and over through the years

1258
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,823
Also it's really easy to stand against the pedophiles and demons when you've just imagine

1259
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,871
Send them all in your head based on your bigotry

1260
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:32,223
Inability to read past giving right-wing blog headlines

1261
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:32,991
True

1262
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:38,111
The demons aren't real and though there are pedophiles in the world Alex's definition of the term renders it

1263
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
Essentially meaningless

1264
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:44,255
On the one hand this is all very extreme and insane and probably should be seen as a warning

1265
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,023
Zion

1266
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:48,095
Like that might be the case but also on the other hand

1267
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Italics

1268
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,911
So this honestly just sounds like I'm saying

1269
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
Come on guys I'm serious

1270
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:57,567
This time give me money I got shirts in a warehouse

1271
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,847
When you're sailing with a person

1272
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,407
Sindhu just offers up the information that hey

1273
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:05,247
If they if my whole family and I are dead I definitely didn't do it

1274
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
That's usually about

1275
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
Red flag

1276
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Yeah it's right

1277
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,647
I think the people in the good place

1278
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,439
Say those things usually

1279
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Especially not

1280
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
Unprompted

1281
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:19,327
But this guy is also said that he would eat his neighbors

1282
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,095
So

1283
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:28,543
Talking about in terms of death is very different than a number

1284
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,103
Like it's not like a new thought

1285
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,127
Right

1286
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:32,895
Pretty extreme

1287
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,943
It doesn't come out that often

1288
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,711
But

1289
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:38,271
I think it's more just a representation of like

1290
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,551
Paranoia

1291
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,111
Where is trapped until it's going down

1292
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,695
We're going to lose these cattle lost

1293
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,023
Cases in rdy matter of time before I know you're broke

1294
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,607
If so a Wars is great and that's why everyone lies about that

1295
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,423
About us to demonize this all day

1296
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:58,495
Because they know we are the standard

1297
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,311
Infowars

1298
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
In Generations in the fight

1299
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,151
Me Mama power

1300
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:08,479
We're the best there is

1301
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,807
We've done the best job that means you the list reviewer

1302
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:14,111
Literally I'm not kissing your ass when I say that

1303
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,695
You need to know what you've done with your word-of-mouth in your prayers your support

1304
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,231
You need to know the

1305
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
Your TuneIn

1306
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:27,679
A couple million you TuneIn right now are the Vanguard are the whole

1307
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,799
Children are future of the innocent being tortured and raped

1308
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,103
Begging for God to save them in those dungeons

1309
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,175
Play cry out to God

1310
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,223
God sent out his Spirit to us

1311
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:43,551
Give us the answers in the motivation to stop the Satanist

1312
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
God is paralyzed

1313
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,415
At an intersection

1314
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
Because.

1315
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Weed

1316
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,743
To be his instruments

1317
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,511
What

1318
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
Belongs to

1319
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
But God works through us

1320
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,399
And that is our job now

1321
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Peacefully

1322
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:05,567
Exposing me

1323
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:08,639
Their spiritual losers they were always going to lose

1324
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,919
Anyone

1325
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,991
And take as many of us with them as

1326
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
They

1327
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
Possibly can

1328
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,927
7076 point will sell out

1329
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
We need to find

1330
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Strong

1331
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,399
Okay let me just catch my breath here cuz I'm really freaked out right now

1332
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,519
Coming out of scratch the surface on the news have already covered more Stephanie B

1333
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,055
Probably discovered 10 hours

1334
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,847
What he absolutely has no

1335
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:39,871
Absolutely

1336
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,431
You told me about how he was going to kill his family

1337
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,503
Could you cover that in 10 hours I could

1338
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,295
Not

1339
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:51,135
Yes such a bizarrely distorted

1340
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,927
View of his own effort

1341
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
Like you seems to

1342
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:56,255
I don't know if he

1343
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
He sincerely thanks but he's actually

1344
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Play covered things

1345
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:03,935
The most he's done his rant about his feelings and then read a few headlines

1346
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:06,239
True

1347
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:07,775
Well

1348
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,591
He's revealed that he has her

1349
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,663
Do many shirts

1350
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Oh man

1351
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,503
I mean right in time for Christmas

1352
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:19,039
Do you know

1353
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,111
It is it is interesting that that quote was

1354
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,719
The tree of Liberty must be watered with the peaceful blood

1355
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:33,119
He definitely didn't just tell people to go murder his political enemies vengeance is the Lord's

1356
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:37,215
But he said that the Lord said the Lord needs you

1357
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,543
To do is Vengeance for it did you know that

1358
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,335
The Bible's all Biden

1359
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
Information Warfare

1360
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
They did not

1361
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,503
I did not know that the Bible is all about how God is like

1362
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,039
Dudes you got it

1363
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,855
Take care of this s*** form and he'll is actually just

1364
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,391
Information base

1365
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
And there's a different dimension

1366
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,487
Mahathir trying to break through I don't I don't

1367
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
Obviously

1368
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
The message

1369
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Just getting across

1370
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
That is

1371
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,911
You guys got to kill you guys got to kill

1372
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:11,519
Sing a cowardly and safely

1373
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,639
For legal reasons yes the point is still there and and go f*** yourself

1374
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,431
Peacefully doesn't even count if you

1375
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,199
You say it like that

1376
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
You don't eat does

1377
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,527
It's taken away and all you

1378
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:26,623
You did was tell people to kill was that cough there too a little bit

1379
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,767
Robot dogs without speakers in for Shanghai lockdown

1380
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,399
Surprised and concerned Poison Control issues Nationwide talks

1381
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,751
If you ain't want it would kill you

1382
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,335
Substance used commonly in

1383
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:47,359
Pest Control

1384
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:55,039
You don't eat cuz I don't understand how that is a question whatsoever

1385
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,855
That should not have been I don't think that should have been a headlock

1386
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,695
Justin answers desperate to attack

1387
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,279
The very idea of taking covid seriously that

1388
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:10,143
Yeah a warning that there is a reagent that can be harmful if

1389
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:10,911
Eaton

1390
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,471
It is somehow an indictment

1391
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,871
Like six thermometers were eat a thermometer

1392
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:26,271
Just don't randomly put it in your mouth why would you put it in your mouth in the first place

1393
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,087
Dangerous for babies

1394
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:33,183
Certainly it unless they're under 7

1395
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,207
Stop power off

1396
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,047
Yeah childproof

1397
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,839
I have

1398
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,375
Identityiq

1399
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,679
Challenge drink your covid-19

1400
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
I don't know why

1401
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,079
I don't know how you get to a point where you're this

1402
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
Bike

1403
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,663
We are standards of this low

1404
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:55,711
Dhoni covid test

1405
01:05:55,967 --> 01:06:00,319
What a scandal it makes more sense than Tide Pods

1406
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
I guess

1407
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,367
What you want

1408
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:03,903
So we're going to need

1409
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:05,183
A lot of vaccines

1410
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,231
I keep going of course

1411
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
There's another one

1412
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:13,887
Says all Americans will need 4th covid-19

1413
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,591
There are a million other six shot

1414
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
And Israel fifth shot in Europe

1415
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:27,967
I only laugh because

1416
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,759
I did not cry

1417
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,855
Are people like listening to this show that is not paying attention at all

1418
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,975
Months ago Alex's reporting at Israel's on it seventh shot but now they guess they've gone backwards

1419
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:44,607
Making s*** up as he goes along on 9 by 9

1420
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:48,447
He can't keep track of where is narratives are cuz they're not connected to reality and they don't mean any

1421
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:53,823
Alex is reporting on a Daily Mail article and when I went to look at this there were some red flag

1422
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,359
Here's the headline

1423
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,639
FDA Vape

1424
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:00,991
Maxine Chief says all Americans will need fourth covid-19 vaccine shot in the

1425
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:01,759
The fall

1426
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,551
But here's the sub-headline

1427
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,343
Go to dr. Peter Mark

1428
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,207
What's the fda's top vaccine regulator says Americans may need a second booster shot

1429
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,023
And fourth overall as early as this fall

1430
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,815
I'm sure you can see the problem

1431
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,423
In the headline says we will need the shot but in the sub-headline it says we met

1432
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
There's a bit of a

1433
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,287
Editorial blunder here in this is something that should have been caught before it went to print because it

1434
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,567
It seems like the headline

1435
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,103
Might be an exaggeration

1436
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,919
The article claims that marks was on a conference

1437
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,199
It's call with reporters

1438
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:36,319
Said that he believes all Americans will need a fourth vaccine shot as soon as this fall

1439
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
But that's not reflected by the

1440
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,159
The quotes that are attributed to him

1441
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
In the article

1442
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,207
They do quota

1443
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,767
It would not be surprising

1444
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,375
If there's a potential need for people to get an additional booster in the fall along with a more General boost

1445
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
A campaign

1446
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,423
If that takes place

1447
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,007
I went my listen to the whole conference call and I didn't get the sense that marks

1448
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,055
Who sang that everyone is going to need a booster

1449
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:57,823
But the people should

1450
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,871
Consider it as a serious option

1451
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
I think at this headline

1452
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,455
Might have been a little bit

1453
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
Exaggerating

1454
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
Alex's

1455
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,855
Lying about it I like maybe the Daily Mail has their own kind of

1456
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:12,927
The grinder in a clique basic economy

1457
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,231
You could be my baby

1458
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,279
So Alex is mad about it

1459
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
Case

1460
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,839
Deposition

1461
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,423
Tried to skip out on me

1462
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
It's so close

1463
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:30,591
Just so close if he had

1464
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:36,991
Gone to work the next day I mean probably still wouldn't respect

1465
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,295
You people are

1466
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
Just beyond

1467
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
And

1468
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,487
We got this job in Connecticut

1469
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
You can call it that

1470
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:49,535
Mustang

1471

Wait the state

1472
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:54,911
Cheated us every way white about us if we didn't give him this

1473
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,471
Thanks for not giving him the Sandy Hook marketing

1474
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,007
Unicorn

1475
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
That one lady

1476
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,103
I know you got I know you got a leprechaun

1477
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,175
And that was when she first started

1478
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:15,391
How to get three depositions with myself

1479
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,695
Hey I'm not feeling well I need to move it

1480
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:24,607
Put you in jail

1481
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,935
Compounds everyday

1482
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:29,727
The 1.6 million dollars

1483
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,031
Appearance

1484
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,127
So you know what

1485
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,407
I'm going to go up there

1486
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
Jamaican zombie

1487
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,271
Cuz at least I'm a grown man I know God

1488
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,087
Imma watch some kidneys lepus dungeon they're raping

1489
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,439
People got got to deal with that's all I can tell you

1490
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
Okay

1491
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,023
Little bit weird that was very weak

1492
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:58,399
Could have just gone to your deposition you dick I really feel like maybe you're just blowing this whole

1493
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:02,751
Google thing out of proportion didn't work like a giant child who's not getting

1494
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:07,359
It's way because you try to pull a stunt

1495
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:09,919
That sounds childish

1496
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Yeah

1497
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:14,271
Yeah could be and I'm going to throw this out

1498
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,807
Okay what if

1499
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
He had done different things

1500
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
All of you so different

1501
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:20,415
Any wouldn't have these consequences

1502
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
So different

1503
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,231
World of difference

1504
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,767
Also

1505
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:26,303
Two things one

1506
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
He stands to get

1507
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:29,119
Some of that money back

1508
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,911
If he does appear for the deposition

1509
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
CS2

1510
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:37,567
He's just trying to sell shirts to make up the money that he's going to have to pay the courts

1511
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,359
Yep

1512
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:44,735
Such a parasitic it is a vicious cycle

1513
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,807
Listen I want to sit for your $25,000 deposition

1514
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:51,391
But if I don't go to work I'm not going to sell $25,000 worth of merch

1515
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:55,999
Trouble

1516
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,303
So Madison cawthorn

1517
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
Talked about

1518
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,375
Hotel party

1519
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
Hell yeah

1520
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,239
You're going on in GOP circles

1521
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
How would he know nobody

1522
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:10,847
He's inviting that loser

1523
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,383
Obviously Democrats

1524
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:18,783
Not going to give Daddy party is probably a persona non grata

1525
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
He'll do that to you

1526
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,575
Yep

1527
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
So Alex needs

1528
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
Talk about this story

1529
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,951
There's only one person

1530
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
You can call in

1531
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:30,303
Gentlemen Welcome to our number to Rochester

1532
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:37,215
Information Madison cawthorn

1533
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,799
And his big exposure of what's now being called orgy gay

1534
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
By who

1535
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,383
And a Sprite with the corporate media has told you

1536
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,711
Madison cawthorn has not

1537
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Canton

1538
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
But he was invited

1539
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:55,135
Georgi and cocaine Parties By the way

1540
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,743
Cool

1541
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,887
You can't really get better and simultaneously worse

1542
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,935
Then Rogers totally

1543
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,383
If you could be the go-to expert on orgies foremost

1544
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,919
Political talk shows

1545
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:24,319
Right but the problem is he has to play this repentant act especially in this world

1546
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,623
I can't be like man when I was back in

1547
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:30,207
Doing those or junko parties I was having a grand old time

1548
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:35,071
I don't know why Madison cawthorn tried to ruin it for everybody good clean fun

1549
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,375
Listen how business was done

1550
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,655
If anybody rides

1551
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:44,287
Should be mad at Madison cawthorn because he's he's snitching the same way that they said Sean Rogers

1552
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:50,175
I just been through a wheel of fortune

1553
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:52,735
How many cities do you think Alex has been invited to order

1554
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
6

1555
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:57,087
Probably actually but we only hear few of America

1556
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,135
I'm not just been invited

1557
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Andy's

1558
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,743
Which outfit

1559
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,535
Andela I wish I'd declined

1560
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,375
I have been invited to be in the hellfire club

1561
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,495
At one of the two most famous universities

1562
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:27,039
Global organization that was started by Sir Francis dashwood in the 1700

1563
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:30,367
Alex is trying to imply that it's still rock and roll in in

1564
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,415
Unfortunately couldn't come up with the name

1565
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:38,815
When grasping for a British University I was wondering if he was going to get there or if he was trying later in the episode

1566
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:42,143
A bunch of weirdos we get together and do things that work

1567
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:48,543
Considered taboo back in those days and certainly a good deal if it was probably sexual in nature

1568
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,871
Things that weren't allowed in polite society that you were able to do

1569
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:58,271
Remember

1570
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,575
It was a real straight-laced a stye

1571
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,623
I really allowed to cut loose

1572
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:05,183
Wright also there's a whole lot of

1573
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,279
And also the Earl of Sandwich was a member

1574
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
That was a thing

1575
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,863
I I don't I don't

1576
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,655
I don't think that the hellfire club is

1577
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,191
Is nearly as fun as the name

1578
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:20,287
No and that's kind of an unfortunate thing is a kind of lives on because

1579
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Cuz of the names

1580
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Invited to a

1581
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:30,015
Tools like every time he sets foot outside of Texas someone's trying to get him to do weird sex stuff

1582
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,063
I mean I can't

1583
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,343
Think of any reason why

1584
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,135
Yeah it's like oh my God

1585
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
I have set foot

1586
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:43,071
The state border

1587
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:48,959
Oh my God I must Retreat to my puritanical

1588
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,519
Welcome to Oklahoma we're going to f***

1589
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,311
Everybody here like the fuc

1590
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,127
If it's your first day in Oklahoma

1591
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,455
I'll tell you about the secret handshake here and it's fun

1592
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,503
It's the Oklahoma hello

1593
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:05,087
Weird

1594
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:09,439
Seems to come up in his life more than most

1595
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,255
People that seemed unusual

1596
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,839
Go see what usual I have been propositioned 40 or

1597
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,143
What's the technical definition of an orgy

1598
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:23,775
I think it's got to be for plus I really feel like I'm I want to say double digits

1599
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:28,895
It's but that seems It Go

1600
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:34,783
If anything under 10 was an orgy that would really cut down on the number 40

1601
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:37,599
Worldwide per capita

1602
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,415
Yeah I'd say six sounds right

1603
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,695
6 is a good start

1604
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:44,255
The organized

1605
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
But that could be tough

1606
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:52,959
So anyway Alex but he recently talked about meets with these globe

1607
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,007
He just did Reese

1608
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:58,591
And the left always hear stuff like this it freaks out and I guess they wish they could

1609
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,223
I just look at everything We Do It Center

1610
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,247
Cutting Edge

1611
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,295
And

1612
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:11,647
It over the years I've had a chance to have meetings with three different Bilderberg Group

1613
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,743
And just had one few weeks ago

1614
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,047
Anime

1615
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,655
But what is a real world

1616
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
And so

1617
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:28,031
Hawthorne has a lot

1618
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,639
Doing what he did because

1619
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,223
To go to the orgy switcher just like

1620
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,783
Just like an ant houses that look

1621
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:39,551
Just like that

1622
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,183
Victorian style French style

1623
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
Oz

1624
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:47,743
Or they've got

1625
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,351
Famous caves in the UK where the hellfire club

1626
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,447
I need a lot of good things and things

1627
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Much dead body to catch this house

1628
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:05,407
What

1629
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:15,135
What's yourself full-circle on that so there were bones that were dug up under

1630
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:19,999
Benjamin Franklin's home call children and it wasn't weird rituals or murders

1631
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,279
A medical student

1632
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:26,143
Play William Houston lived with Franklin and he was engaged in illegal anatomical studies

1633
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,471
It was against the law back then to perform human dissection

1634
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,543
Research

1635
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,847
It probably involves some

1636
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:39,199
Stolen dug up bodies but it probably didn't directly involved

1637
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
Ben Franklin

1638
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,503
It's nothing at all like Alex's

1639
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,343
Implying also that was a regular thing that with people stole bodies

1640
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,111
All the time

1641
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,647
Yeah grave-robbing was much more

1642
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
More comment

1643
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
I think

1644
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,999
That there's another issue

1645
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:54,303
I'm having a little bit of trouble

1646
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:55,839
And that is

1647
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,119
Did Alex

1648
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:59,935
Keep taking these meetings with these globalist sure

1649
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:02,751
Yet they're murdering children

1650
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,775
Constantly

1651
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,615
Why is he meeting with people who are engaged in demonic

1652
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,407
Ritual murder of children

1653
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:10,943
More importantly

1654
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:13,503
Why is he so respectful of their privacy

1655
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:16,575
Cuz they seem to be murdering children

1656
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:18,367
Off the Record

1657
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,183
Have you had their chefs cook

1658
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:27,583
It's so good

1659
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:34,239
You can't piss off cut off from

1660
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
Yeah

1661
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,639
I think it's a hole and his plot

1662
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
And I think his audience should be more offended by

1663
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,015
His meetings with globalist if they are

1664
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,063
The way that he describes them to be

1665
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
Yeah

1666
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,671
I wouldn't take a meeting with with George W bush

1667
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,207
And expect

1668
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
To stay off the Record

1669
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:56,511
Like I don't even

1670
01:18:56,767 --> 01:18:57,791
Think that they're like

1671
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:03,679
Demons destroying the world that I wouldn't take a meeting with someone like who was interested in doing ads

1672
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:04,959
Something

1673
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:12,639
I wouldn't take a meeting with Alex

1674
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,247
Absolutely probably not even some of these

1675
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,807
Business Partnership with 100 hits people

1676
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,343
Maybe it's

1677
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,647
Maybe it's a maybe I'm legitimately is him like

1678
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:25,695
I mean obviously I don't think

1679
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
But it's not real

1680
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:32,863
Assuming it's real in this fantasy version 2 price

1681
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,191
One foot out the door just in case

1682
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
I don't know

1683
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:38,751
It's all it's all

1684
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,567
Speak no more made up stuff

1685
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,895
Public School indoctrination real 4th grade teacher

1686
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,175
Austin

1687
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:51,551
Told her piercings a summer class came out as lgbtqia

1688
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
Then she told him to

1689
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,647
Around here

1690
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:57,695
That won't get Center.

1691
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:04,863
So this is an interesting story because Alex is reading from a post on a website called The Liberty daily which is basically just a board

1692
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,911
Extreme right-wing clone of The Drudge Report

1693
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:10,495
Mixing with their aggregated lengths they also have their own blog post

1694
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
Guys advertising

1695
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,872
Quote for spring freshen up your bedroom with Mike lindell's

1696
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:16,896
Jesus.

1697
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,712
Sheetz now 60% off

1698
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
So this article about the

1699
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,856
This 4th grade teacher has precisely one source and it's a Twitter account

1700
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
I called the lives of Tik-Tok

1701
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:33,024
That account post is completely anonymous unverifiable images of what's claim to be quote in

1702
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,048
Internal messages

1703
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,864
Easily be anything from like a YouTube comment

1704
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,656
Something I cooked up on a Notes app

1705
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,240
There's no sourcing or traceability of this

1706
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:47,360
Nonsense there's no reason at all

1707
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,176
Outrage bait

1708
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:50,944
Depot

1709
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,480
Perfection standards Ark

1710
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:57,088
Essentially we have a situation where an unscrupulous Twitter account posted thing

1711
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,904
Which is that written about by a drudge clone funded by Michael

1712
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:05,024
Glendale stories covered by Alex who is it least is or has been

1713
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,304
Confronted by Mike Lindell

1714
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,096
This is all just a lotus

1715
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,704
That was what I was getting at

1716
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,240
CenturyLink

1717
01:21:14,496 --> 01:21:15,520
Alex brought up

1718
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,312
How do you say Joe is

1719
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,336
It is real

1720
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,360
Sure

1721
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,664
We didn't do is Cobra Commander voice

1722
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,944
Yeah that is

1723
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:23,712
That is weird

1724
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
I think he regrets that

1725
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,040
And we needs to get an impression

1726
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:30,112
It's crazy and you read the stuff they're teaching

1727
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
Third graders

1728
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,184
Shove

1729
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
Sex toys in their rear ends I mean

1730
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,840
Jocelyn elders

1731
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,912
Surgeon General nominee under Clinton

1732
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Timer for

1733
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:52,640
That's what they do in public can you imagine who they really are

1734
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,992
She said even though she said it I mean

1735
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:03,904
Do you

1736
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Very Joker

1737
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:14,400
Play John Professor Mark Dice I teach genders

1738
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,472
California State University

1739
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,824
Cross the country been making tremendous progress

1740
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,616
We better Deuces you know

1741
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,896
List of

1742
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,944
57 different gender identities

1743
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
So I guess

1744
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:31,296
Mark Dice made an attempt at a comedy video skewering gender

1745
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,624
C.a. Johnson Elders that's

1746
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,648
Not true

1747
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,184
His version of this is

1748
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
The salt that's all

1749
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,304
A tweet that was written up in a drug

1750
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,608
Cologne that's funded by Mike Lindell

1751
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
We've got

1752
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
A meme

1753
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
Alex reported on earlier

1754
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,728
Now we got Mark Dice

1755
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,520
Doing a dumb comedy video

1756
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
I just think that the

1757
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,336
The

1758
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,104
Beer buddy

1759
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,408
Nobody is doing

1760
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Things

1761
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
This good

1762
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,736
Baby nobody

1763
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,296
Is doing things like this this

1764
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,880
I would take the good

1765
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,720
Yeah what a load of trash

1766
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
I think Mark Dice

1767
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,840
Gets a lot of views on stuff chair

1768
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,632
Alex might be a little bit jealous

1769
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,448
Maybe feels like he wants to get in on the game

1770
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:21,472
Particularly

1771
01:23:21,984 --> 01:23:23,776
The only mention the Mark Dice is wearing a green wig

1772
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,080
He looks a little Joker at

1773
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:26,848
I think Alex

1774
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:33,248
Who's feeling the call to put on a wig

1775
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,040
But I only told listeners

1776
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,368
Go to city council go to County commission's go to school board

1777
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Because

1778
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,440
Did you just goes viral

1779
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,232
This is the place to go

1780
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,840
And okay maybe just the city council and 5,000 people watching mobile cables

1781
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,216
But most of these millions of views

1782
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:57,312
I am going to create a new character

1783
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,128
Call Peter power something

1784
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,432
And I guess the city council

1785
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,552
I'm a repeat real quotes

1786
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,136
The great words of Jocelyn elders

1787
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,416
We need

1788
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
Masturbate the babies

1789
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,768
I need to reach down and grab their genitals

1790
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,424
Peter Peter women

1791
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:24,960
Beaver Dam

1792
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,728
Real

1793
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,776
Quotes of these creepers

1794
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,848
Can you imagine how drunk he would be if he did that

1795
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,616
Bike

1796
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
Ohia

1797
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,248
Fall over the podium just screaming at these people like

1798
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:43,648
You be taken out because like you're not going to let Alex Jones then if Alex

1799
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,440
Disney dress like Alex Jones

1800
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,208
Mumbai

1801
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,488
You might know

1802
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
I know you would

1803
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
Look

1804
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,304
It's open forum

1805
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:51,328
Citizens

1806
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,376
Yeah but he

1807
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:00,288
I mean just cuz you stole rainbow snatches wig sitting around it.

1808
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,592
Doesn't mean that nobody's going to be like

1809
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,640
Hey we can't have Alex Jones at this meeting

1810
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:05,920
He's going to disrupt

1811
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,968
I even listen to show the other day

1812
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,272
He's going to sell things that he thinks are quotes

1813
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:12,064
Right I do think that would be a

1814
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:12,832
Interesting

1815
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,392
That disease in a wig

1816
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:21,024
Trying to do a terrible character misquoting people to make an argument

1817
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,304
Yeah yeah

1818
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,352
Well here's a good news Alex has no follow-through

1819
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,144
Probably going to happen

1820
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,704
You still haven't even sold sold in either shirts

1821
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,728
Still hasn't done that

1822
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:32,288
The maid that show with all the colors

1823
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:34,592
2 going on

1824
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,872
Hey I'm here

1825
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,176
Alex believes that

1826
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:40,736
Call Schwab

1827
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,272
That makes sense

1828
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,552
Spots also

1829
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,624
Starts rambling about how important it is that

1830
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
But he

1831
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,952
It's been part of the eve of the revelation

1832
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
Bilderberg

1833
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:51,744
He comes up with

1834
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
Luminary

1835
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:54,304
Names

1836
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
That fight alright

1837
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:57,888
Well they're executing yours of Klaus Schwab

1838
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,448
Who is the head of the Bilderberg Group

1839
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:06,080
Member out shelves are supposed Bilderberg Group in the meeting with Satan existence

1840
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,872
I made films showing in existence

1841
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:09,408
Just 15 years ago

1842
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,040
And now you see why the Bilderberg Group is so important because we got their

1843
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,064
We had the sources

1844
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:20,672
You work the people that have been covering Bilderberg Group for 40 50 years

1845
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,232
People that receive the

1846
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,280
Brain Trust

1847
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,376
850

1848
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,728
Died like 89 years ago

1849
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:34,752
Good friend of mine

1850
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,312
And of course myself another one

1851
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:41,920
Go get him back on I mean this is the real Global controlling Force

1852
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:48,576
Alex seems to be able to come up with three names of people who study Bilderberg and they're all lunatics

1853
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:54,976
Westbrook pegler was a fascist Jim Tucker is the was the editor of the Holocaust denying a Neo-Nazi

1854
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,792
Leaving outlet and Daniel estulin wrote a book about Bilderberg

1855
01:26:58,048 --> 01:27:00,864
Included information resource from a captain of

1856
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,888
Intergalactic Army

1857
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,656
Bewise

1858
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,936
Claimed

1859
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,008
This is a good company

1860
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,288
These are bunch of losers

1861
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
Jim Tucker died when it's hat

1862
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:14,432
That's how

1863
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,504
Secondhand smoke

1864
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Yeah

1865
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:24,416
At what a bunch of losers shity crew

1866
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:27,744
Can you imagine saying those names thinking like

1867
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,864
Woohoo I got a murderer's row of here at 3 last

1868
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
Jim Tucker

1869
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,680
A fascist from the 50s

1870
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,496
So

1871
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:42,592
Look I think that we've gotten used to the idea that Alex thinks

1872
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,384
Expect movies and TV shows are talking

1873
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:45,664
I think that's

1874
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:49,504
Just got it like we've become numb tonight

1875
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,576
This introduces a new

1876
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,856
Things to be worried about

1877
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:56,672
How many times did I tell you that robot dogs

1878
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:58,720
Marching up and down the street

1879
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,000
Very by ioi

1880
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
I told you that ten years ago there's a video of it

1881
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,864
Specifically exactly

1882
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:18,944
Didn't because to actually make myself see the next phase of this

1883
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,552
He's so horrible

1884
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:24,832
And show

1885
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,112
Multifaceted

1886
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,976
That I almost

1887
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,512
This isn't how it works but

1888
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,048
It is just crazy

1889
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:38,912
Almost existed so I know it's not us doing it they're the ones doing it but I mean

1890
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,192
Pubs

1891
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
This is

1892
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,032
Vast civilization collapse

1893
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,080
Robots taking everything over

1894
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:48,640
Nothing like this

1895
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,664
Planet ever seen

1896
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,480
Here is abiding again not knowing what planet he's on

1897
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,016
Thing is that for shot

1898
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,832
I'm going to get my second booster shot

1899
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,392
4 shot

1900
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:13,472
You saying I'm not sure why I'm doing this on a stage

1901
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,568
Not know where he is

1902
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,872
He's fine now I'm concerned

1903
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,152
Because it appears to

1904
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,176
Oh yeah

1905
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
From this

1906
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
What do you think might be

1907
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,016
Concerning about what he just said

1908
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,088
Worrying

1909
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
Speaks things into

1910
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:37,024
Exist any possible that he believes he is making things happen by saying the word

1911
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:38,048
Right

1912
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
Yeah

1913
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
Well you said that's not how it works

1914
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,400
Snow

1915
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,680
He did seem

1916
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,960
Solipsistic

1917
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,056
Will do cuz things exist outside of him

1918
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,360
He is the root of all things

1919
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,760
Narcissism people leaving the date you speak

1920
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,296
Future into existence

1921
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,832
Do I make the play

1922
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,856
Plants grow

1923
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:07,488
If I wasn't here I'd have no evidence

1924
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,864
Everytime I look the plants got bigger by looking I made the plants go breaker that day. Just makes perfect sense

1925
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:16,192
Now I've forgotten about every single

1926
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:19,264
The millions of times I've said things that have been wrong

1927
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,056
Haven't come to pass

1928
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:26,432
It's our kind of thinking that maybe everything I say comes true really good thing that it does

1929
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:30,784
Otherwise once again we would be a smoldering pile of nuclear record

1930
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,576
Chicago Beef

1931
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,368
We've been bombed with nukes

1932
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:40,000
Six times over the past two years or whatever

1933
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:41,536
This dude's

1934
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,304
Bucked up

1935
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,608
Anyway Rodger comes in

1936
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,400
And Rodger knows about these orgies

1937
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,936
You know why why

1938
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,264
He planned to be planted

1939
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,616
I mean he's repented of it

1940
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:56,896
Not judging in Worcester

1941
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
Viral right now

1942
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:03,552
That Madison cawthorn the Congress and talk about the

1943
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:04,576
Get on

1944
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624
And and the Carson did not

1945
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,696
Actually

1946
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:15,072
He just said he was joking or wasn't real

1947
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:25,568
So yeah Rodger knows about it cuz he used to run them

1948
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,360
I think that's

1949
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,920
I think that there's something

1950
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:31,200
Pretty impressive

1951
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,736
But I mean like

1952
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:35,296
Hosting a game night is hard

1953
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,832
Do you mean the

1954
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:42,720
The organizing used to play baseball

1955
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:47,328
These guys are hard it is to get a bunch of grown adults together to like

1956
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,168
The text thread I can't do Saturday

1957
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:56,032
Yeah imagine if you're hosting an orgy people are going to

1958
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,848
Be pretty critical of the ambiance

1959
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:02,688
Getting a playlist together and actually

1960
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,480
Yeah the mood

1961
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,760
Food what food

1962
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:08,320
I mean naturally

1963
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,088
You have to

1964
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,904
Sure right you don't we order pizza

1965
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,952
Maybe you have a chocolate fountain

1966
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,256
Fondue situation

1967
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,144
The time frame

1968
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,472
When you got to get Caterers you can trust

1969
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:28,032
Dial yeah well they probably want to join the orgy

1970
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
The problem

1971
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,248
A lot of administrative situations is what we're dealing with Rodger had to do with all of that headache

1972
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,784
Right but he's now repent

1973
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,368
Nobody's ever rat Fox quite like the guy who ran over

1974
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,392
True

1975
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:48,512
So Rogers interviews going to start but before we do there's a John bowne

1976
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,304
Spitaliks going to play

1977
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:56,960
Rodger Stone on orgy a transition T minus 6 minutes but I wanted to go to report

1978
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
John bowne put together

1979
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,008
About

1980
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,312
Reporter Joe bags

1981
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,104

1983
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,712
For crimes he didn't commit

1984
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:17,184
Staff sergeant Joseph Biggs was born during the ominous year

1985
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,720
1984

1986
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
Okay call my guy

1987
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,120
Violated parole

1988
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,656
He didn't but he's one of the Coca

1989
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:30,496
Conspirators boys

1990
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:33,312
Conspiracy

1991
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:36,384
And so Alex's is

1992
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,408
Is

1993
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,456
He's speaking out for his guy

1994
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:42,016
His former reporter John Powell put a piece together

1995
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:47,648
No man's land that doesn't play on Bose radio station

1996
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,208
You know I care but not that much

1997
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:52,256
Is it going to sell me some shirts

1998
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,584
Rodger Maybe

1999
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,888
So

2000
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
Quick question

2001
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,472
How are you spell

2002
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:05,312
Digo o r g y

2003
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,480
I could see Anais situation but it is that I just

2004
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
I don't know

2005
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,808
Yeah Yang seems like a tough

2006
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
Difficult to do

2007
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:25,024
What's the point of adding gate to things if you're hyphenating everything now it's got to be portmanteau

2008
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,328
Yeah that's

2009
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,912
I know but I just drove by and it looks

2010
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,216
Wrong let's let the audience decide

2011
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,800
I don't know

2012
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:46,016
Orgi gate that's not it

2013
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,320
Alex pretends

2014
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,088
Rodger like

2015
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,136
You can say whatever you want about him

2016
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:51,904
Always been

2017
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Honest

2018
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,440
About

2019
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,024
We have seen Madison cawthorn the

2020
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:59,840
Republican congressmen come out until he was invited

2021
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
Orgies and cocaine

2022
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:04,960
Well I mean

2023
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,240
Cocaine party

2024
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,776
In d.c.

2025
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,336
Rodger Stone was one of the top lobbyist ever

2026
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,128
He was a

2027
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,456
Performance

2028
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:17,504
Really hit it

2029
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:24,160
Do this was underage people or any night absolutely hit it and was not honest about it note for quite a while

2030
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:29,280
Very much engaged about that

2031
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,936
He blamed the former employee of the Levi

2032
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:42,336
You could say that he hit it and then did not quit it

2033
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,384
Madison cawthorn. Back

2034
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,408
Act like walking back

2035
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,688
His claim that

2036
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:49,248
Fair enough but you did get a Stern talk

2037
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,016
Thing 2 from Kevin

2038
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:55,392
McCarthy realize that if you didn't

2039
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,416
Additional gop's

2040
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,720
Support and the party might get behind a

2041
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:02,304
The primary challenge in that would not be hard to defeat Madison

2042
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:09,728
Think so blame the left for everything

2043
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:16,896
My comments on a recent podcast appearance calling out corruption have been used by the left and immediate

2044
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:18,688
Disparage my Republican colleagues

2045
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:22,272
Then falsely insinuate their involvement in illicit activity

2046
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:28,672
The left I got to stop right there because Madison was the one disparaging his colleague

2047
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:35,072
I know we'd the left were using him doing those things which he clearly would never have

2048
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:39,936
I've done if the lieutenant told him to do it maybe I just covered his words and then the left on Twitter made fun of him

2049
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,752
Not its they didn't do this

2050
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,800
This is pathetic

2051
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:47,872
Consider for several days how best to address this controversy

2052
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,408
The culture in Washington

2053
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,200
Is corrupt

2054
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:56,576
Compromising activities occur because when other people can place you in compromising positions they can

2055
01:36:56,832 --> 01:36:57,344
Control hue

2056
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,184
It's all about power but my colleagues and I are fighting that corruption

2057
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
That's dumb but whatever

2058
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,024
A little bit later quote

2059
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,864
Western North Carolina you sent me to Washington to change the culture

2060
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:12,960
If you want Washington to operate without accountability send someone else

2061
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,264
What kind of dishonest

2062
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,288
Madison

2063
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,872
Naming any names and no one's being held accountable here at all

2064
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,152
All he's done is talk show

2065
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:25,504
Some s*** and hijack a bunch of leadership

2066
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,856
And with this statement revealed why he would never be invited to an orgy in the first

2067
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,648
This demon ends quote

2068
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:34,976
I will not back down to the Mob and I will not let them win

2069
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,768
Continue fighting for many years to come

2070
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:43,424
Who is the mob

2071
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:46,240
You are sweet I think you'd be cooler if you went

2072
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,056
Madison

2073
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,872
Interstate Auto podcast

2074
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:55,200
Very well may have been real and now

2075
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,480
But he can't keep his mouth shut

2076
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,272
Are the people who invited him to the

2077
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,296
The party is the mom

2078
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:03,648
Where is Twitter in the media or laughing at the thing he chose to say all podcast

2079
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:08,000
I'm not sure I really understand but I do think the statement doesn't really help at all

2080
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:13,120
It's probably cooled things down with McCarthy but Madison maybe I'll borrow time

2081
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,960
The GOP leadership taking them seriously as someone they can

2082
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,728
Canntrust after the

2083
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:21,824
This point imagine it's off to the Marjorie Taylor Greene Matt gaetz world for him

2084
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:23,360
Going to be at least

2085
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,408
The Americans

2086
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,944
Going to go ahead and send it

2087
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,992
The kiddie table over there

2088
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:34,880
Be really loud

2089
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:38,208
Well just got a point here and that is what everyone's doing this

2090
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:40,768
Hemorrhoids during f****** drug or Juiceman

2091
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,072
Anybody out there who thinks

2092
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,656
That the ruling Elite in Washington DC

2093
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:47,936
Or Malibu

2094
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,216
Or Manhattan

2095
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,008
Or Hollywood

2096
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:54,336
Do not engage in drug-fueled orgies

2097
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:55,872
Is out of their mind

2098
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,408
And all of those

2099
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,688
In the media

2100
01:38:58,944 --> 01:38:59,968
And in the Congress

2101
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
Cornell

2102
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:04,064
Attacking Madison cawthorn stop and ask yourself

2103
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,600
Why are they doing

2104
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,136
Who

2105
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,416
Who are they covering

2106
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,720
Or is it themselves

2107
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,256
I can answer why

2108
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
People are attacking Madison cawthorn

2109
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
People are

2110
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:17,632
I think of the issues that Madison never said who you was talkin

2111
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:23,776
About not cast a wide net of Suspicion on everyone in the GOP which the GOP was naturally not happy about

2112
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,592
When you say something like you didn't you don't name names

2113
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
Anybody

2114
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,896
Could be who you're talkin about

2115
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,968
Which is no good for all the people who didn't invite him to a Coke orgy

2116
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,016
Right similarly people on the left

2117
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:37,088
The meteor annoyed that he didn't name names because without that element

2118
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
It's just not the right way

2119
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
Ding dong talkingshit on a park

2120
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:45,536
It seems to me from everything I could tell about the story fit everyone will be totally fine with Madison

2121
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:48,096
If you did what he's pretending to do

2122
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,632
Switches hold power account

2123
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:56,288
If you truly does have a problem with these Coke parties in orgies that he has a responsibility not to justkass reply to meeting list

2124
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,824
Sudan actionable accusations

2125
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,152
What does speak specifically about who's abusing their power

2126
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:03,456
He's not doing that which people right

2127
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,224
We find annoying

2128
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,040
It's a liability in the

2129
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:07,808
Upcoming midterm

2130
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:10,368
If you talking about like Republicans

2131
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,160
Who are invited to parties

2132
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,744
Any Democratic Challenger can use that against their opponent

2133
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:19,584
Because he didn't really want to have the

2134
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,608
Party of Coke

2135
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,912
The orgies do you want to vote for this

2136
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:24,192
Houston

2137
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,520
Basically handed a weapon to political position

2138
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
I mean it's like

2139
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,104
McCarthy had to have sat him down and just been like listen

2140
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:31,872
I know

2141
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
You did what we all do

2142
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
Which is

2143
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,992
Go on a podcaster some s*** and talks

2144
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,344
Open podcast

2145
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:45,184
That's what they do they go on background

2146
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:51,584
But you talk about the left doing it you don't say that the GOP is doing it you can say that all blanket

2147
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,192
Leftist politicians are fugly make it believable be like I have some

2148
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,264
Some staffers were friends with staffers Apollo 11

2149
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:00,288
Wheelworks

2150
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:02,336
Together and I've been there you know you don't

2151
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:04,384
Save at the GOP does it you don't

2152
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,712
You don't bite the hand that feeds Madison that's what he say yeah it's

2153
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,248
It's too much

2154
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,784
Of a liability

2155
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,064
When you don't speak

2156
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Specifically

2157
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:13,856
And

2158
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,416
I think to not understand that dynamic

2159
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,720
Is pretty dumb

2160
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:24,096
Yeah it's suggest that he was raised in a generation of right-wing politicians that

2161
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,144
Absolutely have no concept of Subs

2162
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:27,424
Whatsoever

2163
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,032
Rodger thinks he's going to get mocked

2164
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,312
For his days of

2165
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,080
Being a liberty

2166
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,128
And I would suggest

2167
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:43,040
You said it at the beginning and I won't run away from it I was a libertine in my days

2168
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,856
In Washington so I attended some of these parties

2169
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:48,160
Cocaino wasn't for me

2170
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:54,048
Prefer my faith in Jesus Christ that's why I feel that the

2171
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:57,120
The power and the strength to speak out and tell the truth

2172
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:59,424
Unafraid to tell you the truth

2173
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,472
I know that I'll be mocked

2174
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:04,544
We're coming on and saying this I know I'll be attacked

2175
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,360
For you know for the life that I abandoned

2176
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:09,664
When I was a high roller and Washington

2177
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:10,432
In d.c.

2178
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,480
Available

2179
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
I'm a different person today

2180
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,552
I think I think

2181
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:17,600
No I

2182
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:20,928
I think Rodger Stone as a reformed character is makabu

2183
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:24,512
Regular Liberty

2184
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:28,864
Is hamaca the world is Loki's shitbag

2185
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:34,496
Is his f****** you can't defeat of what you going to say oh you're so disgusting

2186
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:40,896
What do you got a liar of course I am

2187
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,504
Look at what I do but now that is on

2188
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,272
Christian

2189
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:49,600
I have reformed it's giving me the strength to speak

2190
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,880
Go fuc yourself

2191
01:42:51,904 --> 01:42:52,672
It's not fun

2192
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
Tuvix

2193
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,232
Cocaine absolutely

2194
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,792
Yeah

2195
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,072
More worried

2196
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:01,120
Is if he was telling the truth

2197
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:07,776
There is a reason that he left all the other drugs that were not not for him off the

2198
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:13,152
Irrelevant

2199
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:18,016
Keep up song nobody would ever invite Madison cawthorn

2200
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,808
No ears ears what it is

2201
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,600
Okay everybody assume

2202
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:28,000
That they are getting up to more f****** sex stuff because they have more memes right and if you had

2203
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
More memes

2204
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:30,560
Some people would be like well

2205
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:32,352
You know I'd like to f*** eight

2206
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:34,912
People butter I'm broke and I don't have a friend

2207
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:39,520
You don't have any special power UK

2208
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:43,616
But the fact that you assume everybody's doing it is

2209
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:44,384
Speakers

2210
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,408
Crooked people

2211
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,944
Don't want to f*** a peep

2212
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:53,344
People through exhaust so bad

2213
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:59,744
On paper. Probably use

2214
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,792
My house

2215
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:08,704
I agree and I think

2216
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
I also think

2217
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:12,800
That some amount of like

2218
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
Swinging kind of

2219
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:16,128
Things and

2220
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,944
Cocaine as long as it's not like

2221
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,736
Carnival

2222
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:25,600
Like I don't think that those are nearly as Extreme as they're being made to sound

2223
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:28,928
I think the right wig is way far behind

2224
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:30,208
With the left

2225
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:35,072
Is tolerant of these days where they like oh my God and we're all sitting over here like

2226
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:38,400
Man what there's a sex club down the street go

2227
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,192
Have fun I think if it's like

2228
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,984
Off-hours and it's not

2229
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:44,544
Something where politicians are using

2230
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Bears

2231
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:50,432
Status as a politician to force people into doing orgies with them or something

2232
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Whatever

2233
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,784
Live your life

2234
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,088
Cute what I think

2235
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:57,856
What do you think

2236
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
I don't

2237
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,416
Know if

2238
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,952
Going to an

2239
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,768
An orgy is nearly as

2240
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,072
Black available

2241
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:12,704
Well I mean

2242
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:19,360
Leverage in a hotel room

2243
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:21,408
We do know he was set up

2244
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:27,040
He said so himself can't argue with that

2245
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,136
I think I think

2246
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:37,024
There's this notion that like this is how they're going to be able to Blackmail you can

2247
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,328
No it's that's that potent snow

2248
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:40,352
Well they still live

2249
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:45,472
You still live in the old times where it's like if he comes out as gay that everybody's going to lose their s***

2250
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:50,592
Insinuation

2251
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,896
I'm kind of that Kevin McCarthy is

2252
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,176
Okay

2253
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,456
You have to question

2254
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:58,784
Why Kevin McCarthy is so anxious to cover this up

2255
01:45:59,296 --> 01:46:00,576
Why is she so anxious

2256
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,624
Silence is Junior member of car

2257
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:04,160
Why are all these

2258
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,696
Rhino

2259
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,720
The woodwork

2260
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:08,768
What are they hiding

2261
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:12,352
What do they have to hide where they at some of these parties

2262
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,888
Is that that's my question

2263
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,728
Well we also know it doesn't

2264
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:20,800
McCarthy live with another man

2265
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:24,384
Famicom model of the White House together and they like

2266
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,920
How old is the president in there

2267
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,784
Well he is it is alleged that he

2268
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,320
Weather upholster

2269
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,368
Republican polls

2270
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Think much of

2271
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:37,696
Who's got the worst toupee

2272
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,488
Ever seen in my entire life

2273
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,048
I'm so yeah that's that's kind of weird

2274
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,352
Super

2275
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:48,448
Understandable why someone he and other non

2276
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:49,216
Insane

2277
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,496
Wings of the

2278
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,520
Republican Party

2279
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,312
Would be very again

2280
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
Champs this

2281
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:57,664
From a logistical perspective nothing to do with Togo

2282
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,712
Yeah I mean and also what you going to do

2283
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,760
Go out on TV and say listen

2284
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:03,552
Madison cawthorn is ripe

2285
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,624
Some GOP people having cocaine-fueled orgies

2286
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,232
Sure but not meet with but that exacerbates the exact same problem

2287
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:17,888
Also what they're talkin about is during the pandemic Kevin McCarthy rented a room from notorious pollster Frankel

2288
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:23,008
I stayed in a room and wants his house while he was in DC during

2289
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:25,824
That's what they're using

2290
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:29,408
To imply that maybe you gay like to dress up like the president today

2291
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:30,944
Facsimile room

2292
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:31,968
Letter b

2293
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,528
For me personally

2294
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,368
Yeah

2295
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:41,440
I genuinely thought he said upholsterer

2296
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:47,328
Terrible way to get

2297
01:47:47,584 --> 01:47:50,912
I'm so Rogers interview sexually disappointingly short

2298
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,448
He's only in for

2299
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,240
Quick-hit Buffet

2300
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:58,336
Hades orgies are happening I know cuz I've been there baby name names

2301
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:03,456
Madison really should have

2302
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,992
If you but then again

2303
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:06,528
He was just talkin

2304
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,808
Let me know what

2305
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:11,904
He doesn't want the consequences of saying names actually want to hold anybody accountable

2306
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:18,304
He wants to talk some s*** and sound cool and interesting wants to sound so cool without considering

2307
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,096
Consequences and the lotus

2308
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:21,632
But he's putting on his

2309
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,912
GOP colleagues

2310
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,472
The damage that he's doing

2311
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:28,288
So is your stupid and

2312
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,568
I'm sure you got a good talking-to

2313
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:33,920
Because the rest of the episode not worth listening to

2314
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:38,528
I can't think of a better 360 went out there the one we're about to talk about right now

2315
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,344
I hope everyone I hope you listen to

2316
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:45,184
I pushed him a little bit like Rodger state

2317
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,208
Stone came on

2318
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:48,256
This guy

2319
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,096
Dying

2320
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,960
Commercial

2321
01:48:57,472 --> 01:48:58,496
Talk about something

2322
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,312
Things that are common knowledge to good tax attorneys

2323
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,896
But it's like unknown magical General Public

2324
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:11,040
Is here with us you can go to Jones tax relief.com

2325
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,576
Oh no

2326
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:16,160
Alex talks to his tax relief

2327
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,512
Fantastical

2328
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:24,096
I will say that from I could turn it off after about a segment

2329
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:28,960
The 16th Amendment hasn't been ratified

2330
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:30,240
So that's progress

2331
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:34,080
That's good this guy was just saying that like I'll hunt down loopholes for you

2332
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:34,848
Yeah

2333
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
Yeah

2334
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,640
But you know

2335
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:38,944
Probably not ones that you can actually use

2336
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:42,016
I would assume that a lot of people in Alex's audience

2337
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,296
Might not have

2338
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,600
A lot of financial

2339
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:48,928
Here's how you can get rid of your investment

2340
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:51,488
Unrealized gains tax

01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,256
Taxes if you

2342
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,560
I don't think I

2343
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
I can use that

2344
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,120
One can I write off

2345
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:01,728

Uber business

Sixpence sure

2351
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,552
So we come to the end of this 666 episode 66

2352
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:17,856

01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,072
Insisting that he won't kill his family

2358
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:27,840
Probably

2359
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,120
Probable

2360
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:29,888
Probably

2361
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
I mean

01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,216
