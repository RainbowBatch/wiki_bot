1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
Investigation, I'm rushing by investigation into Alex Jones

4
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
Think about Alex

5
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
So weird

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:33,792
Megyn Kelly interview we have done and now this

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Post-game interview

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
I'll tell you what

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,448
She fukin nailed him to the wall

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,544
Dammit

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
What I think ahead of time

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
It's very predictable

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,992
Haha Alex Jones does

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,784
Knock-kneed tape

15
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:57,600
Secretly made of these

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,696
I don't want to call Megyn Kelly ship

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Because

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,512
That's not fair and she has

19
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,560
A career behind her

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,840
She's a trained journalist

21
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,144
And it's easy to armchair quarterback

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
Right the reality is she

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
She got so close

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,360
She got so close and also so far

25
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,688
There were a couple moments where

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,480
Couple moments

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:30,624
Push it push it

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
It's clear that the intention of it was Sandy Hook

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,048
Right it's clear that a further intention of it he's too

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Make more

31
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Explicit

32
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,144
The connection between Alex Jones and Donald Trump

33
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
Okay things are very clear

34
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
I wouldn't

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544
Say it's necessarily a hatchet job

36
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:49,824
It's just

37
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,360
It's not good

38
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,944
It's not right it's not what she should have done was it

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
Was it an

40
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,784
An entertaining interview like this she accomplish that

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,856
Not for me but I know a lot about Alex Jones

42
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
You know so I ate for me

43
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
There were a couple moments where I was in

44
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
Impressed

45
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,216
You might have listened to our ship

46
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:23,616
Certainly not but it's like that's outside the mainstream but cuz there's a couple things that have reached a zeitgeist

47
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Niceville

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
Turn frogs gay

49
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,136
Call

50
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
There a couple moments where she pulls out tonight

51
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,096
Islamophobia

52
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
The entire report let's just started off we go with we're sheep again

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
Pregame interview that was

54
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,336
Sticks and a half hours long

55
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
And if you cut together the entire interview this time

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
It will be

57
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
5

58
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:08,160
Some suggestions of what I wish you would have done

59
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
Certainly and I'm sure you'll have some of your own but I think

60
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:15,072
I think we can probably get it done an hour I think so

61
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
First tonight

62
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
Our report on the incendiary radio host

63
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,800
Alex Jones I'm already out here is Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories

64
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:27,872
Claiming for instance that elements of the US

65
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
Allowed the 9/11 attacks to happen

66
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,992
And the horrific Sandy Hook Mass

67
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
Tucker was a hoax

68
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:40,672
Some thought we shouldn't broadcast this interview because his baseless allegations aren't just defensive

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
They're dangerous

70
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
But here's the thing

71
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,072
Alex Jones isn't going away

72
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,448
Over the years his YouTube channel has racked up 1.3 billion views

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,008
He has millions of listeners

74
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,544
And the ear of our current

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Presidents

76
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,664
We Begin our report with his reaction to the recent terrorist attack

77
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
In Manchester England

78
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
Introduction to the

79
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
And I really don't like the town of it

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Because it sounds like she's

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,232
Yeah there is a submissive not like a woman

82
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,791
But there is an implicit like

83
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:18,815
You guys

84
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
The president

85
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,959
I just I just wrote down rationalization

86
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,239
Like

87
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,055
The first thought I had listening to that intro is she

88
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
Heard all of the criticism

89
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,639
Cuz I'm assuming that this was

90
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
This was recorded after

91
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
Exactly

92
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
So this whole thing is like

93
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,183
We are. We did this interview you told us not to

94
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
But here's

95
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,743
Why we're doing it

96
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,583
Gree with the basics

97
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,351
Premise

98
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,471
Hey guys take him seriously

99
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
That are Prevost didn't come from

100
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
Is not

101
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
The president listen

102
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
To him yet millions of viewers

103
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,663
Because I didn't Powers him

104
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,967
Write the angle

105
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
Hewlett out-and-out bigger

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
He is a monster

107
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
He lies all the time

108
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
Which is very reminiscent

109
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,255
Of the president whose ear he has

110
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,327
Right but if you make that lines though

111
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,911
So they're going to do but who make such a big deal out of that then it

112
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
The dumb people kind of reinforces our

113
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:35,103
In the same way the press credentials are in a loser anything with you can just get them

114
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
Done

115
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,551
It reinforces him in some people's eyes I think it's the wrong way to go

116
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
Over

117
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
A billion

118
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
This man is

119
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
Powerful

120
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
I have reached

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Powerful

122
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
He has

123
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
Millions of list

124
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Regardless of whether or not

125
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:01,727
Is in order to make the premise of her peace work she has to build him up

126
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
To take him valve course

127
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
Kind of foolish

128
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,871
Because if you have the introduction being like

129
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
He has the ear of a strong

130
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
President

131
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,527
He has billions of listeners Bible by all this

132
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
All you're doing is

133
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
Making your job harder

134
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,927
If you say hehe

135
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
To him

136
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
But people who are being lied to

137
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,327
Clearly demarcated

138
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
Most of his narrative

139
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
Have to do with bigotry

140
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Most of them have to do with

141
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,543
You can come at it from a more robust

142
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,079
Perspective

143
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
A man away that doesn't

144
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Explicitly empowering

145
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
Butt cheek

146
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
Open

147
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,735
You could I could do it yes but

148
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Keycaps

149
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
Probably not

150
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,159
Yeah probably not it would be would be like

151
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,951
That would be a fuk

152
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
Flamethrower across the bow

153
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,559
Yeah

154
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:03,935
F*** out please

155
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
He's an emotional guy and he does

156
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,543
People on an emotional level

157
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
Because really it's not on a rash

158
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,455
Oh and Megan tries to play some of those games that emotional

159
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,015
Post office

160
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,807
It's a completely in in effect

161
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,463
If she induced

162
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,487
They wanted to start

163
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,255
With the Manchester

164
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
She gets into that

165
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,839
And here we go

166
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
Alex Jones with nearly 5,000 miles away from Manchester England when it's 2

167
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
Suicide bomber killed 22 people at a concert less than 4 weeks ago despite the distance and width

168
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Jones

169
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
Mouse first into controversy

170
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
He said it was a bunch of liberal trendy's

171
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,767
Who were killed

172
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,839
The same people who are promoting open borders

173
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
Bringing islamists in

174
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
Yes

175
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,983
In response to which many people looked at the victim

176
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
Transformers 1514

177
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
I'm sorry I didn't warm up

178
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:21,759
Either

179
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Rose Russo

180
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
8 years old that she was a liberal trendy

181
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,999
I guess that's what you said about the victims is what has people upset misrepresenting

182
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,047
Clipping

183
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,095
Right out the gate Alex

184
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,119
Heard about it

185
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
The age of the victims weren't even known

186
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
But they were saying it was

187
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:44,287
And I said how crazy is a liberal trinis are now the victim

188
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
And then

189
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
I certainly looking up

190
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,407
Horse Canter kids

191
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Call Reckless accusation by vacations

192
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
Is classic Alex Jones

193
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
Megan is giving a little bit too much

194
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
Leeway to the audience

195
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:09,119
To draw their own conclusions

196
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Straight up just admitted there

197
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:17,311
I've made a video and I made these claims when I didn't have any of the information I didn't even know anything about

198
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
I didn't know any of the details

199
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
She should have pressed incredibly hard on that

200
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,783
That's b******* about that

201
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Weird

202
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,367
Said that it was the parents fault

203
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
That their kid died

204
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
The parents

205
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Who supported open borders

206
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:42,143
Were the cause of their own children's death if you were to bring that up too

207
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:47,263
I'm not talking about how to parents off at their kids died

208
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Deal with this for a second

209
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,847
Before we get to it

210
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,663
There's a lot of Sandy Hooks up here and apparently I have

211
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Seen it but I saw on Twitter

212
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Sandy Hook videos

213
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Tonight

214
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,719
I'm not 100% sure on this I should I should reload his channel

215
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,511
And see if there is a video

216
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
But he has put out but from what I understand

217
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
He was going to put out a video

218
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
Speeding to

219
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
Father's Day message

220
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:20,799
Call f***

221
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
F****** cry

222
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,919
Apparently play mainstream media

223
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:28,735
Start a dialogue directly with them witches

224
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
F******

225
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:35,391
No but itself is abusive to these families so

226
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:39,999
It look if it wasn't about murdered children that's great Rollin

227
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
But it is

228
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
So it's not

229
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,655
He said about Manchester even in this interview

230
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:48,959
Yeah just allowing him to lie on television

231
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,519
And not pressing issue 2000

232
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,591
You just said that you didn't know what you were talking about when you

233
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Posted this video that people are going to listen

234
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Right people think it's the truth

235
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
But you

236
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Yukon

237
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,575
Say that you are always

238
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Incorrect

239
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,695
90% of the time you are always proven correct

240
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Dumb dumb

241
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,023
Anyway

242
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,839
She gets into discussion with Trump

243
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:20,959
On The Fringe

244
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:27,615
Shouting his conspiracy theories into a microphone. On Austin Community television

245
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
2001

246
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295
I want a deposit for a second because the way she frames at the entire time is

247
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:36,831
Conspiracy theory

248
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:39,135
Exactly

249
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:44,767
For the last 6 months

250
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,815
The beginning

251
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,119
No absolutely not

252
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
I know that you got it

253
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,495
The limitations of newsmagazine shows

254
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,823
Understand you got to work with internet working

255
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,383
You can't say something that could get you sued because

256
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,759
It's so reductive

257
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,831
Typical him a conspiracy theorist what are you don't follow up with

258
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
Most of your conspiracies

259
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,439
Really dovetail into racing

260
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
F****** masculinity

261
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
Yeah

262
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Did you think that's interesting out

263
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Absolute

264
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,607
She doesn't really get into that kind of

265
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,447
Just like we I don't know if we talked about this on air

266
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,495
Text about

267
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,311
No new station

268
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
No new station

269
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
Directly come out in

270
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Say

271
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
URS passing whitener

272
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
That's not going to happen

273
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:44,671
Nope I'm not the only thing that you have a channel

274
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,463
Even if they interviewed like

275
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Spencer they wouldn't be like

276
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,791
You've you've

277
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Declared yourself a white

278
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,471
The stuff that I saw

279
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,519
Charles Barkley giving a side eye

280
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:04,127
Berkeley being surprised by things that Richard Spencer

281
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Look I'm not going to say that that is

282
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
That's another issue for another day

283
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,343
Tina's company Infowars for years

284
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,903
Producing radio shows and webcast

285
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Which reach

286
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Million

287
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,815
He attracted a very famous man

288
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,351
Presidential

289
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Donald Trump

290
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,703
I just want to finish by saying your reputation is amazing

291
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,567
In December 2015

292
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
Offering praise

293
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Promises

294
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:40,991
I will knock you down you will be very very impressed

295
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
And I think

296
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
So

297
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,111
I think there's a really

298
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,903
Bad missed opportunity

299
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Tea2go

300
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,975
Like the investigation that we're doing it

301
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
2015

302
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:54,815
If she would have just something

303
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
Run bedtime.

304
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
And heard Alex saying

305
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
Donald Trump is a con man

306
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,471
He's a front man for some

307
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Consortium

308
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
East Coast

309
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,847
You could make this part of your interview really much more interesting

310
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Because

311
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
Praising him and their soup

312
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
To be like what's the deal with this right

313
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
Then there's no there's no pressure

314
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,391
Amazon

315
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,207
I mean I hate I

316
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,231
Truly believe this

317
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,815
If you are researching Alex Jones for Megan

318
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Gene Kelly

319
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,983
You are dipping into

320
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,287
Get what you want and then you are getting

321
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:40,127
Like legitimately if they knew about

322
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,175
Yeah because we have done it already

323
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,991
We have the information

324
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
Chicago sucks but it also

325
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,831
This is me sucking my own dick a little bit so

326
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
You may I mean

327
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Again

328
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,975
I still you're the only person who listens to Alex Jones

329
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Critically

330
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Yeah well

331
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
I mean

332
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:05,215
I would imagine that a lot of it is

333
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
Is just

334
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
When you're listening

335
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,055
Because this happens

336
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,335
Tons of people who would listen

337
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,103
The radio

338
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
You just phased in and out

339
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
You're listening

340
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,271
Something I really like something

341
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
So

342
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,367
Anyway you don't remember

343
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,183
He deals with an emotional level

344
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
And so you don't remember the dumb s*** he

345
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,327
Really easy to Just Add Water

346
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,631
Exactly what you remember is

347
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,679
He made me feel like I would had a voice

348
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:42,079
Yeah why

349
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,895
Remember when his narrative was a complete b******* like

350
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:48,735
But the damage is done he made you feel that way

351
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,343
What is the serotonin your brain the dopamine receptors

352
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,623
The oxytocin

353
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Some came out like

354
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,231
You just had an orgasm

355
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
Barack Obama

356
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,007
Common sense

357
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,551
Was good for Infowars

358
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:27,135
It's 83 million

359
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
In November 2016

360
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
More than five times higher than the previous November

361
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,839
And when mr. Alex Jones

362
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
To the seat of power

363
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,703
For the first time

364
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
Mr. Trump called him after the election

365
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Thank him for his help

366
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,871
You have said that it's the real

367
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
To say something

368
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,735
Couple days later

369
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,039
I mean but

370
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:07,071
On July 22nd Infowars video

371
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,655
Show drug trafficking

372
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,703
We don't know what it is

373
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,079
A drug smuggling operation from Mexico

374
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
3

375
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,223
So that it's from episode it might have gotten lost in the sands of time

376
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:28,063
We discussed this in our investigation

377
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:33,951
Went down to Laredo and Merriman and then lied about being chased by Cartel

378
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
She found

379
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:44,191
Whitten kids you never hear what maybe a lost episode where may. You may or may not

380
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:49,311
The point that I lovingly made was that if they had caught a cartel

381
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
They would be f******

382
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
King beheaded by

383
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,895
Fingers

384
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
Oh

385
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
Prince dog

386
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:56,991
Made up there.

387
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,271
Yats

388
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:08,767
That's good because that's not something that's necessarily wanted to attack

389
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,559
April 2015

390
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,375
That's cool I forgot you so

391
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,983
Slater Iowa

392
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
Guy swimming across the

393
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Big bags of stuff

394
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
Trucks

395
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
Swimming across

396
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
The river

397
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:29,247
This was Infowars previewing the first presidential debate

398
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,551
And Hillary Clinton

399
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
I think she's going to show up

400
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,719
And on drugs. Not long after

401
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
We should take

402
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Donald Trump Ally infrequent Infowars guest Rodger Stone underscored the connection between Jones and the

403
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
Trump campaign last spring

404
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
It read

405
00:18:54,847 --> 00:19:00,735
Alex Jones

406
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
Helps make the Trump Revolution

407
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
All that's another good

408
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:07,647
Because a lot of people aren't talking about the directions

409
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Stone and John's right

410
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:14,815
Char cell I mean yeah it sounds like a very good TV show

411
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,167
God forbid it ever happen

412
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,799
I disagree I think people are aware that Rodger stone is on Infowars all the time

413
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Know who Rodger stone is

414
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,407
Beyond that all of those things

415
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
Again buttress his credibility

416
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Or buttresses import

417
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,807
Right

418
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Repeating him

419
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
Rodger Stone

420
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Trump

421
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
Is that they were

422
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:46,303
So the quote Trump Revolution and now there's a little piece of the interview that she plays

423
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
I think my tan first

424
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Glance soundbar

425
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
But I don't think it does

426
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Donald Trump

427
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:58,847
Call Michigan contact with the president

428
00:19:59,103 --> 00:19:59,871
Radio show

429
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,175
He downplayed it in his interview with us

430
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:08,575
Claiming the mainstream media has exaggerated

431
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,183
Msma said

432
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,719
He's just called sometimes

433
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:20,095
Would you describe yourself as friend

434
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
No

435
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,495
And how many times has he called you

436
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:28,543
I want to get it all

437
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,359
So that sounds bad because obviously

438
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
The numbers very low

439
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
Yeah

440
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
Did people who

441
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:37,759
Are inclined to think Jones is pretty cool

442
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Would be that is humility

443
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,087
Discretion

444
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,367
I don't want to talk about that

445
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
That's not important

446
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
Well I think

447
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,695
My initial reaction

448
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,743
He was saying

449
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,023
I don't want to get into that

450
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,327
Because the number is so large

451
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Like that's the idea

452
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
He wants to get off

453
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,287
Is the perception he wants to leave

454
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,847
Because

455
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
It happens

456
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
You know it happened

457
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
More than you would expect

458
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,223
And more that you would be happy with

459
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:14,367
Well I sure to the beginning of exaggerating

460
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,744
And what's the point of that is today the Trump is his own man and I can't influence

461
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,560
Clip

462
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,096
Out-of-country

463
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,656
Which is very much like

464
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,448
When he was saying that stuff

465
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,728
He was also saying

466
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
I talked to

467
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Trump all the time

468
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,360
Like at the zoo if you recall if you call the stuff that we

469
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:37,152
We listen to

470
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,176
He's saying you know

471
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
I have

472
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,992
The ear of trump and then later on that

473
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:41,760
Turned into

474
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,296
We don't talk

475
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,392
But he's just doing the same Americana

476
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
He's office game

477
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,560
Is it a lot

478
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Is it a little

479
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
You don't know

480
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,472
Exactly

481
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,520
Like you can tell that it's additive

482
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:13,248
I don't think there's anything that they play that is misrepresentative

483
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,832
There are in the video

484
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
That's how you make

485
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,696
He is not doing it

486
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
A terrible job of setting up those clips

487
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
Prefer less of an nprc

488
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,936
Yeah it's a little it's a little in that wheelhouse

489
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,704
Cadence

490
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,544
It bad that kind of tone and the volume

491
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,104
And whenever you

492
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,920
Sort of allow him to he's going to lie

493
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
It's a little bit later there were a couple of

494
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,040
The couple events

495
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
Listen to the fur

496
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,160
Can get flummox

497
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:55,488
A little bit

498
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,280
You need to go in for the Haymaker

499
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,120
I need to knock him out she just doesn't have that right hook

500
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,168
She just doesn't have whatever punch

501
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Is needed

502
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,240
Maybe it's a lack of information baby

503
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,776
Mabel

504
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
Or McDonald

505
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,104
Maybe that won't this the

506
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,688
And it's not

507
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
Like is it entirely

508
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Possible that

509
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Well

510
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,600
What we've seen from Alex of chess

511
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,672
Constant like aspiration

512
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:26,976
It's the end of the world

513
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,000
And what is

514
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,840
Like maker and they just didn't cut it in

515
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:37,216
It serves everyone purpose in terms of making money for them to not demolish

516
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
Exact to shame him emotionally right

517
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
Anybody's purpose

518
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,408
Actually

519
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,200
Dealing with the problem about

520
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,040
This is conspiracy territory for us

521
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:55,648
Do like the idea that it is like complete destruction

522
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,744
And Alex was super scared that was going to be in the

523
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
And that's why

524
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,376
Whenever they were doing their live broadcast on Infowars of the

525
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Champagne

526
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,424
Yep they were drinking

527
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,216
Champagne dessert

528
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,264
Cheers and champagne glasses

529
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,384
That thing that would have destroyed me isn't in there it wasn't it's not Mike

530
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,736
Conspiracy theory so much as it is kind of building off what you said earlier

531
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:21,760
Which is that

532
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
Or not earlier

533
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Earlier episode

534
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,904
Know what it is

535
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,184
That's true

536
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
Like that could be one of the problems there is

537
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
And this is

538
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,352
Live in that world

539
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:40,704
Like they don't understand globalist

540
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,984
No wealthy that's

541
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,568
Yeah there's no call them notice

542
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
The first thing you should

543
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Say it

544
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
For twenty years

545
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,456
Open yelling about the

546
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,224
Global

547
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:52,992
Which is

548
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:56,576
Either evidence that she works

549
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,440
Or a complete unwillingness to unpack that

550
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:06,048
Because I think it it does become maybe too difficult for newsmagazine television

551
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
Getting to like

552
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Dude yeah

553
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,656
Are you serious

554
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:15,264
I mean it's possible

555
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
They wouldn't they're coming

556
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
From an

557
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Almost answer

558
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Illogical

559
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,664
Already

560
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
Discovery

561
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,320
Kindle why almost

562
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Fair

563
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Yeah

564
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:34,464
Even when they get into their bout to get into Sandy Hook even that is almost

565
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,072
Nice to him which is weird

566
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,096
Cuz

567
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
Cuz he's a f****** mom

568
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
So here

569
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:48,032
If somebody tried to cut down our stuff.

570
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
217

571
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
They would have to go through

572
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
What

573
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
2:00

574
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:58,016
Route 27

575
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,160
What is the do you think about Alex Jones that President Trump

576
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:06,464
Find so amazing

577
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:12,864
Is a conservative writer and contributor to President Trump

578
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Obviously there's a conspiratorial

579
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,448
The presidents

580
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:22,848
His imagination and darker impulses are fed into by Alex Jones

581
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
Jones has 4 hours a day

582
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,456
6 days a week

583
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
Can be vulgar in Hicksville

584
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
Like this one directed at a member of Congress

585
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Schiff looks like the ark

586
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Kite

587
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Archetypal

588
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:44,096
And there's something about this f****** around Boston

589
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,888
Tell Congressman Schiff

590
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,424
And all the rest of them

591
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,752
You want to sit here and say that I'm a Russian

592
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,336
You get my face without Beecher MSU son-of-a-b****

593
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,616
So again

594
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
She plays that

595
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,688
Are you

596
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
You're crazy drunk

597
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,248
That is

598
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,040
How many ways are there to learn Alex

599
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,368
Where is knock

600
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:15,072
Went through so much just watch that f****** episode 2 you're taking this clip that everyone is being commedia matters bush

601
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
So much more

602
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,288
Of that episode

603
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,944
Who gives a s*** about that ramp episode is bananas it's even the one that has begun

604
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:40,672
Did nobody actually watch that or do they think that it's not going to be

605
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,720
Palatable Isaacson Illinois

606
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,280
I think that everyone just saw the clip that

607
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
I got posted around when I roll

608
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
And they don't think

609
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
What's a complex

610
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
Happening now

611
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:57,824
Oh he's crazy he's yelling he does crazy Yelp

612
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,128
Drunk

613
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,408
Solely

614
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
Fascinating

615
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:05,248
Are we are we may be the only people who have been like

616
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:12,416
I've never heard anyone else talk about anybody else bring up the other fun

617
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,464
F***** up stuff you said

618
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,560
The other the other is that there's no way to

619
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
Conclusively prove he was

620
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,144
Suggest it

621
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,704
Excuse me Alex

622
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:26,240
Well you went on that

623
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Text Whitfield

624
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
Also they didn't play my favorite part which

625
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
Which is that he should fill his

626
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Were you

627
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
Chick-fil-A

628
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
How much Wild Turkey

629
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:43,648
You drink noted podcast the knowledge fight posted his picture

630
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,024
Don't don't

631
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:53,888
They posted a picture of you with a drink in your hand

632
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,008
Easy for him to get away from water

633
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
Tired

634
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
Know the context

635
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
Of the cliff

636
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,968
Gotye live

637
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
So

638
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,024
I killed with a brick he was trying to beat me up right

639
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,120
But then I was like

640
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
Picture of a mom Susan a dog

641
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,920
Like all of those little things of like

642
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,016
How is it that you have dealt with your violin

643
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
As a child

644
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,344
Do you not see how that it carried on

645
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
From maybe not

646
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
Physical violence

647
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
But it's loose

648
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Type of

649
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
Aggressive

650
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:54,560
Emotional by inflicting emotional violence on your audience

651
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:58,656
And eating bystanders

652
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:02,496
Like everybody who was in Comet Ping Pong when I guy came in with a gun

653
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:06,080
Yeah Meghan Kelly does do a pretty decent

654
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
Job of

655
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,712
Ping-pong all those things and making Alex responsible for the

656
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
But not really

657
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,528
Not just pressing

658
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
Not really to his face

659
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,928
She doesn't in the MPR voice

660
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,840
Conspiracy theories as a teenager

661
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
He grew up the oldest child of a dentist

662
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,168
And a homemaker

663
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
We went to high school in Austin Texas

664
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:37,312
CIA definition

665
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:43,200
After a brief stint in Community College

666
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,784
Jones found his calling as Public Access TV in Austin

667
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,832
Went into business for himself

668
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,648
Sounding Infowars

669
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,440
Prospect

670
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Million

671
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,512
He got a

672
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Public Access

673
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:58,560
TV show

674
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
84s

675
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,984
Just throw that in the first the first radio

676
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,128
I actually think that's part of the

677
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,920
Overly fairness

678
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,736
No discussion of how his dad bought him

679
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,272
RadioShack

680
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:23,648
No discussion of how he started Infowars because he got fired from a radio station

681
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
To Fair

682
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
Enterprise's who started Infowars

683
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,352
His narrative though of like

684
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,400
I am a self-made man

685
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,960
And so you put that in there and it

686
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:38,752
Megan

687
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
Was told that by him

688
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:44,384
Of course because didn't she didn't do research into it

689
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
G

690
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Just bought it and

691
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
Didn't know like nana nana.

692
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,552
Yeah your CIA dentist dad bought you

693
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
We all know that what great question that would be like your CIA dentist

694
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:04,096
Reason you're successful right now

695
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:08,704
Come out shows your host Infowars makes most of its money by selling products

696
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Like males

697
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
And

698
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,152
Jones himself

699
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,968
I'm going to cost $45 a year to run

700
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
How much money do you make

701
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
What am I

702
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,344
That's

703
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,648
The f****** missed opportunity

704
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
That is so messy

705
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:30,720
Like

706
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Press on it

707
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,840
Don't give me Vig bulshit most of the money goes back

708
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
How much are you making would you say you're a profitable

709
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,752
Yeah I don't even need to do like

710
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
Give me a number just like

711
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:45,824
Do you

712
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,872
Do you feel like the company itself

713
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Makes money

714
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:52,224
Do thought you feel like you're financially successful business

715
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
Yeah I know

716
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,296
Exactly

717
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,368
Deprived

718
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,928
I have a buddy who are you

719
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
Is Brenda mine back in Missouri

720
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
I want his big things with you

721
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
Whenever you meet people

722
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:12,448
Just to get aggressive

723
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Hilarious

724
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:19,616
That nobody really knows

725
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,664
Other than a classic

726
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Because nobody wants to

727
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
That there's a class

728
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,136
And how I understood it I don't know this to be true from

729
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,768
Version of that

730
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:39,328
The way you get around that is After High School

731
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
Cycles are so sexy

732
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,008
If you say I went to X wires

733
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,288
You know a lot about them

734
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,616
Went to

735
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
America's

736
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
We're pretty great

737
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:00,832
Epis point B interview skus into the controversial topics

738
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,160
Jones uses that money to spread his message

739
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,488
A message that had caused enormous pain

740
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
What is Donnie's he gives inject

741
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Disorder toxic

742
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,328
Paranoia

743
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,144
Into the mainstream of conservative thought

744
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Would have been inconceivable a couple of decades ago

745
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Somebody who traffic

746
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:21,056
Some of the

747
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,080
Thickest

748
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,384
Spencer type

749
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,408
Siri

750
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:29,760
At the top of that list is Jones's outrageous statement

751
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,368
Set the slaughter of innocent children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School

752
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,440
One of the darkest chapters in American history

753
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
Was a hoax

754
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,792
Conservative rewriting

755
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Drive me

756
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,632
Like this sucks dude

757
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,680
Deer that

758
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
There hasn't been

759
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
A massive amount of toxic

760
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
Paranoia

761
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,824
Built entirely around race

762
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,664
Like rewriting history of like

763
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,688
Oh Alex

764
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
The first guide

765
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
Pedal View

766
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,832
Toxic paranoid

767
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,648
So you're right

768
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,696
You're totally right but he I think

769
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,512
The stand-on in terms of how much

770
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
It's been Amplified after Waco

771
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
After Waco and Ruby Ridge there was

772
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Theme

773
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
But what are we talk

774
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:26,080
F****** go back to the goddamn nights with super predators

775
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
Go back

776
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,872
To the eggs with

777
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,480
Epidemics go back to the 70s with all of this

778
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
Comes back

779
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:36,064
Erase right not the story they're telling

780
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,832
Yeah that's true

781
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,416
You're right

782
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
Psyched

783
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,256
Garbage write-off

784
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:47,584
I already I already I can

785
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,632
Read that dude's f****** backstory night

786
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:56,032
The f*** that guy before this interview was saying that they gave me villain lighting and what have you

787
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:04,224
It's just Alex has way more jolly

788
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Another chance

789
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,976
CC and this is this is what I was worried about

790
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
Yeah is that

791
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,304
It is a

792
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,840
It is an excuse to why

793
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
How bad this guy

794
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Like Megyn Kelly

795
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,520
He's a spouse that's a

796
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
Birthright

797
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Megyn Kelly when she was on Fox News

798
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,408
Did not do everything possible to

799
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,432
The fight against the birth

800
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,016
She changed

801
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
Hunan that

802
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,600
But when the ship was going on and she was on Fox

803
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,880
He was definitely

804
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:48,000
We feeding into that no true fact that she ever supported

805
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:51,072
Explicitly

806
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:54,400
Everything that's done on the same TV network you're on

807
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
I also

808
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,544
You're totally right there's way more she could have done to push back

809
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,104
Thing is that it wasn't

810
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
Just part of an institution that

811
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,760
My point is that she was doing that same s***

812
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,064
People are saying

813
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
Obama was not born

814
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:17,184
Right like she was amplifying that narrative

815
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,976
In the same way

816
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
She wasn't

817
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,144
Explicitly say had to be fair to just did

818
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
She says it was fake

819
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,264
Time in this report

820
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,848
Trump

821
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
No and it's another

822
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
Excused

823
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Hens that this is

824
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
New

825
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
This lunatic

826
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,088
Is the one like

827
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
Conservative

828
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,208
Because this guy is

829
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:50,976
Is Morrissey

830
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Damn

831
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
Like that's that's what I'm hearing so far

832
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,608
At all of the all of the

833
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Criticism

834
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Is going to come out

835
00:37:58,656 --> 00:38:00,448
Be like you shouldn't give this guy a

836
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,496
And the criticism should be

837
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
You should have

838
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,336
Subway take it away

839
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,384
I think you should give him a voice

840
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,176
Inasmuch as like

841
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,736
We sat on the pre-interview thing

842
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
Episode that we did

843
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Play that

844
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,880
Play the screaming

845
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:19,904
About Muslim

846
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,976
Play that anti-semitic caricature

847
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
Play that

848
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Stop

849
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
Do any of that

850
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,096
Right because again

851
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
That's

852
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,168
That's not the thing that they wanted

853
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Play him

854
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,240
Rambling about

855
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,008
I mean hey

856
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,032
Get this

857
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
It was in the trailer

858
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Isn't in the interview

859
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,016
Really that's not even in the interview preloaded work

860
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:50,112
About the chimeras

861
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:50,880
You worthless

862
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:53,952
That just

863
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Yeah yeah

864
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,096
Which doesn't mean that there is more stuff in there

865
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,424
The right NPC has

866
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,192
Something

867
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
That

868
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:05,984
Is

869
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
Really really good

870
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
On Alex

871
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Jordan

872
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,616
You know what I just realized what

873
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
We got to do a National Treasure

874
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:17,248
So you're saying we got to break into the White House

875
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,136
I'm Nicolas Cage you're the other guy

876
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,976
We need a hot chick man Kelly The Hot Chick

877
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,560
We can go in

878
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:36,960
Diane Kruger right we go in we trick her we somehow replaced the footage with another

879
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:44,640
But first I have to become president

880
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,968
I think that's what we have to do in order

881
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,736
How to get to the truth

882
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,392
If all of it is just this

883
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
Of course not

884
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
And then

885
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,024
Seeing him celebrate is very

886
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:02,816
We won

887
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
We beat them

888
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,888
They edited it all

889
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
We can we can deal with

890
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,240
All of it

891
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,264
TV shows that it

892
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,288
Stop that

893
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,824
Unreasonable

894
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,848
But the points

895
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
But they end up making in the angle of attack

896
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,688
Of the Peace

897
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
I don't mean attacked

898
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:23,296
How many angles detectability

899
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,600
When I write a joke

900
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:26,880
Angela

901
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,280
Intrinsically flawed

902
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,632
Either an unwillingness or an inability to understand the psychology

903
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,424
Of how to counter

904
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,728
Propaganda and how to counter Alex

905
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:42,496
Specifically

906
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,800
Sandy Hook

907
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,104
I buried my son

908
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
I help my son with a bullet hole through his head

909
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,248
Neil heslin son Jesse just

910
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
6 years old

911
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Was murdered

912
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Alarm at 9

913
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
And six adults

914
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,976
December 14th 2012 in Newtown Connecticut

915
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,816
I dropped them off at 9:04. Can we drop them off at school

916
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
What is bookbag

917
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,936
Hours later I was

918
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,496
Picking them up

919
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
A body bag

920
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,384
Alex Jones repeatedly claimed that the shooting never happened

921
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:26,784
Siri is on Infowars in December 2014

922
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,112
You said

923
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
The whole thing is a giant hoax

924
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,440
How do you deal with a

925
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,048
It took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact

926
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
Set the whole thing

927
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Was fake

928
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,192
I did deep research and my gosh it just pretty much

929
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,472
Happened

930
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:52,895
At that point

931
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:59,039
You're trying to have it always

932
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,135
If you wrongly

933
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:06,207
That's wrong but what I already answered your question

934
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,535
You didn't listeners and that other people are covering this I didn't

935
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
Alex

936
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Des Peres

937
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,399
One after the other

938
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,959
Devastated

939
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
The dead bodies

940
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:25,407
Corner autopsy

941
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:34,367
And look every position and play Devil's Advocate

942
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
Was that

943
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
The whole thing as a giant hoax

944
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:39,999
The whole thing was fake

945
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
That is a bit of a

946
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
This is

947
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
Play the hate

948
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,423
Yeah because Alex is

949
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,703
Really scrambling

950
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
The calculations going on in his head

951
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,871
What do I what's my what's my

952
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
I already

953
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,735
He just said that that was basically

954
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:02,015
But I'm trying to opt

955
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,087
The skate and say that I've played Devil's Advocate about stuff

956
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
And put the direct question

957
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,439
You saying it's fake is that you playing Devil's Advocate

958
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,047
I'll keep in mind you already said in this interview

959
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,327
You can

960
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,119
How do I get out of this

961
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,143
How do I get out of this

962
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,191
His response

963
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:20,959
Is busy

964
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:22,751
Week week is f***

965
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
I don't know I'm not saying that Megyn Kelly didn't

966
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,919
Do something

967
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,943
The playing of that clip

968
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
Which is what we

969
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,271
Didn't think she was going to do

970
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,551
Play for him

971
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,087
Ocheyedan play for

972
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,623
For him know that was just in the Bronx

973
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:43,487
Impactful

974
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
PC himself say those things

975
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
But still good

976
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:52,703
It works clip that we use cuz the one we use it a little bit more

977
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:53,727
Like really explicit

978
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,263
Yeah but it is the same

979
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
Sentiment

980
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,847
It took me a year to come to grips

981
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
That was

982
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Sounds good

983
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,967
That the point is he's realizing

984
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,575
Just a direct lie

985
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:12,671
And maybe Megan had a good rebuttal today

986
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,975
But his answer is just like

987
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,023
You shouldn't let him do this on television

988
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,815
Yes because I remember

989
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
Then saying but then

990
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:25,727
Some of it looks like it's real

991
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,287
The kids going in circles

992
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,311
I watch the footage

993
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,591
It looks like a drill

994
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
When you say

995
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:35,967
Faked

996
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,247
Their children's death

997
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:40,831
People get very angry

998
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
They don't get angry about all this

999
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,511
The Marriott Harbor covers all the evil Wars

1000
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:51,327
That doesn't excuse what you did

1001
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,119
Italian

1002
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:57,471
Look at all the angles of

1003
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,823
Long before the media even picked up on

1004
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:06,175
Is Inari

1005
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,063
I tend to believe that shoulder probably

1006
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Did

1007
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:17,439
I can see how other people believe that nobody

1008
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
Of course

1009
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,791
There is no evidence on the other side

1010
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
And that's fair but you're doing that invoice over empathize with her because

1011
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,471
Would be exhaust

1012
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,311
Indications are that she was trying to go

1013
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
Get to the point he is just dance

1014
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,871
Messing around

1015
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:38,175
Exactly

1016
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
With that kind of an

1017
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
How do you

1018
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
How do you

1019
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:43,807
Forced him in

1020
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,391
A corner there but

1021
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,183
She also let him get out of the corner

1022
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:53,535
And I think that the approach that

1023
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:55,327
She thought would work is appealing

1024
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Human decency

1025
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,423
As we've already discussed that.

1026
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
Not going to be with that's not going to be a good approach

1027
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
That's again like

1028
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
He lives inside of a world

1029
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,591
They can't

1030
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,383
He is a

1031
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:09,407
Psychopath

1032
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,455
If he doesn't

1033
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,551
He doesn't hangs out with Mike cernovich

1034
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:17,087
He thinks he's cool

1035
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,111
Yeah he doesn't

1036
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
He doesn't care if you take a

1037
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,415
The human diesel

1038
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,743
He's just going to go back

1039
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,535
It's not

1040
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Like his response to it

1041
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
Isn't

1042
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,191
Isn't her it's it's not Tara

1043
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
Like

1044
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
This is a

1045
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,311
Relatively small-scale events

1046
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Like

1047
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,895
Steve

1048
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Sandy Hook

1049
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Yeah

1050
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:46,271
Monster that is well they're half a million dead Iraq

1051
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Okay

1052
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,599
So so his response is

1053
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,903
It's like mathematics

1054
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
I'm not that bad

1055
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Like that his

1056
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,279
Response

1057
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,583
The death of

1058
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,143
Somebody

1059
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Iraq

1060
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
On what

1061
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:09,311
I absolutely agree with you

1062
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:15,455
But I'm just I'm just saying that his argument that b******* because in order to make an analog that works

1063
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:18,527
You have to have a conspiracy theorist

1064
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
The sanction

1065
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,319
About Iraq

1066
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,599
And Dumber To

1067
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,671
Denies that the half-million people who died are real

1068
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:27,487
Then I'm better than that guy

1069
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,535
He can say like no one's

1070
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,071
Accusing him of killing kids

1071
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,423
Right when he says that no one's mad about a half-million dead Iraq

1072
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:36,447
People are

1073
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,007
You are mad about that happy about that

1074
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,079
You're pitching yourself in the wrong part of the equation

1075
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Yeah I agree with you

1076
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:45,919
It's nonsense

1077
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
I agree

1078
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
I retract my earlier statement

1079
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
That it wasn't

1080
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,439
The next approach

1081
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:59,999
Moving the goalposts

1082
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,815
What about that

1083
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Soy protein

1084
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,679
Tries to get into for the pieces

1085
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
Consequence

1086
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
Consequences

1087
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Sandy Hook tonight

1088
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,895
Board of Education

1089
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:21,759
Imploring the president to try to stop Jones and other hoaxers like him

1090
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,111
Towards our town

1091
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:32,255
Almost four months later according to the board chairman the president has yet to respond

1092
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:36,351
Real-world consequences

1093
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,263
A Florida woman was sentenced in prison for

1094
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:47,359
Her defense attorney says primarily motivated

1095
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,895
By Infowars

1096
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,223
Other victims family members have been harassed or threatened

1097
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
2

1098
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,551
The family say that Jones has words have caused

1099
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Lasting pain

1100
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,647
And they fear the harassment will continue

1101
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,207
It's disrespectful to me

1102
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:04,511
Or in fact I did lose my Sean

1103
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,071
And the 26 other families lost somebody

1104
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,863
Could I take that very personal

1105
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
You know this

1106
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,935
Pieces going to air on Father's Day

1107
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Correct

1108
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:14,751
What is your message to him

1109
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
But I think you've flushed to have

1110
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:17,823
Abbas children

1111
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
Spend the day with

1112
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:21,919
Speak to

1113
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,039
I don't have that

1114
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,575
That's heartbreaking

1115
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,903
That's very heartbreaking

1116
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Journalism

1117
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:35,743
Alex

1118
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,071
It's really easy to just deny that to

1119
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
And who follow him

1120
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,911
Anderson

1121
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
Good looking to make a gentleman cuz he's an actor

1122
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
He's on the fake news

1123
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,639
Humanize this fake event

1124
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:56,735
With a bunch of actors and why should I care about this guy Kelly show

1125
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Which is unfortunate because

1126
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,551
If you have

1127
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
Cuz if you live in the real world

1128
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
F***

1129
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,463
How

1130
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
I guess if

1131
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:11,839
That stings

1132
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,423
Cynical

1133
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:16,703
How can you listen to that

1134
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,727
And not feel

1135
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
I don't know

1136
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,311
Like that's f******

1137
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:25,919
Even though response

1138
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Being not f*** you

1139
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,759
The response being you should be

1140
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,551
Glad that you have your kids

1141
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
Because I don't

1142
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,879
And

1143
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,207
Empathetic

1144
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:38,975
Response to

1145
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,815
It's a trauma and then dealt with it

1146
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,655
Italy is on the other side of

1147
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:48,703
Unfortunate

1148
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:55,615
There has to be another side

1149
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,711
If we can

1150
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
Take a step back

1151
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:04,063
Not dehumanize but take a little bit of the emotional

1152
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,855
Peace out

1153
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,391
I think that they

1154
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
If it's a

1155
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,951
Again it's a good approach

1156
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
And I see the perspective

1157
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
You trying to build

1158
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,071
You she's built at the beginning this

1159
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,351
Connection with Donald Trump

1160
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,655
Disconnected

1161
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:20,959
Like you

1162
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
Reported on Manchester

1163
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Nation about it

1164
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,567
There was a sort of bedrock

1165
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,847
And now she's gotten

1166
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:27,871
Sandy Hook

1167
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
She called him a little bit in a

1168
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
You aren't really being

1169
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,759
And clear about what you were reporting

1170
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Connected that

1171
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,855
Himself

1172
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Jason

1173
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
You have the

1174
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,743
The power to help us out here

1175
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,023
Yeah and Trump has done

1176
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,351
Is there nothing not even to make a steak

1177
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Not even

1178
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,471
And in the consequences year will be the next Blue Line

1179
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,567
I think on one level is a good approach

1180
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,383
But only two rational viewer

1181
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:02,943
Viewers will see like

1182
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
His

1183
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,807
His actions and his wife

1184
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Why is that he puts out

1185
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,903
That these families are being victimized re-traumatized

1186
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,535
Who publish their phone numbers and email addresses

1187
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:21,631
I am so cheap

1188
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
She uses that

1189
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,423
Detransition

1190
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
Into other

1191
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:26,239
Conspiracies and other

1192
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
Instances of Alec

1193
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,031
What is nonsense

1194
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:33,919
The consequences are not limited to Sandy Hook

1195
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
Conspiracy theory

1196
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,855
As pizzagate

1197
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,951
Infowars

1198
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:53,887
And specifically pointed to a Washington d.c. Pizzeria

1199
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,959
The photos and videos inside these places

1200
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,775
His listeners to investigate the case themselves

1201
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
1

1202
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,591
Did

1203
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:06,687
Bringing a semi-automatic rifle to the shop and firing several rounds

1204
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:09,247
No one was hurt in the shooter was arrested

1205
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:13,087
The pizza shop owner

1206
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,391
Facing the possibility of a lawsuit

1207
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
He did

1208
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:20,767
Tom and Jerry

1209
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:23,071
Oris employee

1210
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,935
About it though you know

1211
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,471
There's no interview chunk

1212
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,263
About about it

1213
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
She just

1214
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,871
She just reports that and then

1215
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:42,527
No and that might be because he wouldn't answer questions it might be because there's legal ramifications

1216
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:48,927
Like that right there might be thing where he doesn't want to get food whatever

1217
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,719
Liberty is only in criminal trials

1218
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,303
Civil Trial I kind of get I kind of get it

1219
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:58,399
It is fair it's it's okay for the news Beast

1220
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,703
You've established a hook

1221
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,727
Stop the quinces

1222
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
You're linking a direct

1223
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,287
Consequence

1224
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
The guy throwing up with a gun

1225
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:12,479
I am then he have him having to apologize

1226
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
Which if you are awake

1227
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,063
If you're watching

1228
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
You draw the correct

1229
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,671
Conclusion

1230
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:22,207
This guy

1231
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,743
Is doing a lot of

1232
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,767
Dammit

1233
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
He's not just a conspiracy

1234
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,607
If there is not just a liar when you get

1235
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
The real world

1236
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:30,655
This guy

1237
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
Is a

1238
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:34,495
Twerking real threat

1239
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:35,263
Real

1240
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,823
Roshe is in as much as

1241
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,895
You know unstable people who listen to it

1242
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:45,247
The Hebrew

1243
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,015
Yeah

1244
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
And that's good

1245
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,647
And she likes it to another in

1246
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,463
Justice spring

1247
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:59,327
Chobani yogurt after Infowars

1248
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:03,423
That Chobani employees in Idaho

1249
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:10,847
You miss stated facts about Chobani owner

1250
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:15,967
Which you could have found out your credit report

1251
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:21,599
Hold on

1252
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,623
You are lying

1253
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
What Megan said there was really good

1254
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
You could have just had a reporter look into

1255
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,303
And then you wouldn't have had to apologize

1256
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,631
You could have anyone do journalistic

1257
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
Okay good question

1258
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,311
This is my statement on that

1259
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:44,127
We know that was basically a PR of them

1260
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
Reported sexual assault

1261
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
You are the one who said that

1262
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,695
You were wrong

1263
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
About Chobani

1264
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,487
You said that

1265
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,023
Well that's

1266
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
Because

1267
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,583
They chose to

1268
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
After me

1269
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:06,911
And so I simply

1270
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,335
You don't sound very sorry

1271
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:19,199
Attack about stuff about settlements

1272
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,343
You said things about Giovanni and his owner that were not true

1273
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,367
Are you sorry

1274
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:33,279
Again there was the media of really was upset that they said that there was a hoax

1275
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,607
Car wash

1276
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,191
So what did what the media did and we know it was the medium

1277
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,519
And we have the puppy eyes in a law firm

1278
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:47,359
But she said she Bonnie was real happy to get out of that lawsuit

1279
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,151
What's a lawsuit

1280
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:53,503
Clear Infowars was the only media Outlet to report the LIE

1281
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,551
John to apologize

1282
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
And with that apology

1283
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,391
Chobani considers the matter closed

1284
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:01,183
This is such b*******

1285
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Nonsense

1286
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,095
Now it's the idea that your Bonnie is glad to be out of the lawsuit

1287
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:10,911
They got what they wanted out of it they wanted an apology

1288
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
So in that way they are

1289
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,775
Sure yeah

1290
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,847
Lawyers and all that s***

1291
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
Time

1292
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
Energy

1293
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
All of that s*** we went over it in the April 25th episode of the show

1294
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
Chobani lawsuit

1295
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:37,023
The issue is that there were lies that were being reported on like Breitbart and world news WorldNetDaily threat

1296
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,815
They were

1297
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:43,423
Really salacious scandalous stories about these child

1298
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,471
Sexual

1299
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:49,311
They weren't reporting what Alex

1300
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,871
Was reporting Edward David Knight was reporting

1301
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
That was

1302
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,687
Straight up

1303
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,295
These immigrant rapists are being imported by Shivani

1304
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:01,343
That's why I looks got in trouble

1305
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,951
Whatever Breitbart was recording of reporting whatever all these other places were reporting

1306
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,231
Was wrong

1307
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
It was

1308
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,559
Salacious

1309
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,887
But it didn't say

1310
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:22,591
Specifically did those that's why he was in their crosshairs

1311
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
Megyn Kelly would love for it

1312
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
To just be

1313
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:32,831
He didn't do the journalistic work

1314
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,647
Conversation

1315
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,719
You could have sent a reporter

1316
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,999
Listen Megan

1317
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,815
I've never sent a reporter goddamn

1318
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,655
What's a reporter

1319
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,215
Which actually weaves

1320
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,007
Where Megan brings up the question

1321
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,055
Do you think you're a journalist

1322
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
Which is a fair question to ask

1323
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,199
Do you think of yourself as a journalist

1324
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:03,551
A journalist that work for me another journalist work

1325
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
There's no script

1326
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,303
Instead it's a free-wheeling spin through piles of articles

1327
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:19,423
Straight off the internet

1328
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,447
And then

1329
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,727
Disgusting

1330
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,383
Ascertain the veracity of that article

1331
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,183
We all get measured media has got a big problem

1332
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Yeah

1333
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,559
That was that

1334
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
But we all get that Hillary was 15 points ahead is a legitimate answer to the question she just

1335
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,519
Alex's Tire narrative

1336
00:59:56,543 --> 01:00:02,175
Whenever someone attacks who credibility or whatever he's always wrong

1337
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,735
Hillary's poll numbers

1338
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Question

1339
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:08,575
To just repeat that

1340
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,647
Is the ultra bad follow-up to a great point

1341
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,719
It was really good

1342
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:19,583
If you don't have any ideas

1343
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:22,143
Discussing it for 2 hours is nothing

1344
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,007
Well we all know Hillary was 50

1345
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:27,775
Points ahead

1346
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
Is there

1347
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:32,127
After this clip is there like any follow-up question

1348
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,199
No not at all

1349
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:37,247
Maybe in the

1350
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:39,807
Indiana

1351
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:46,207
Lying about everything

1352
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,279
I think

1353
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
If if I were to go into the heads

1354
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,375
Megyn Kelly and her producers

1355
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,983
I would guess that what they thought is that that looks so silly on its face

1356
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,543
But it's fine to leave in as a crazy

1357
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:05,407
Recognizes is at least 30% population

1358
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:09,247
Of course that the mainstream media

1359
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:12,319
Too but that Megyn Kelly has

1360
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
So she's already off the books

1361
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,975
Anyway she's not realizing but that actually is kind of

1362
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,047
A good punch back

1363
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,863
Write to some people

1364
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,215
Now we're coming to the end here there's one more clip

1365
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
Disappearance

1366
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,079
Number one ding dong

1367
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
Owen Shroyer

1368
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,479
Roped into this

1369
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,319
Because I would say

1370
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,855
I would take that clip and run

1371
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,623
The f*** with it

1372
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,183
Oh yeah because it's like

1373
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
Okay

1374
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,255
Lights out

1375
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Okay

1376
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:57,119
Which I really think is a large

1377
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
Of what this

1378
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,935
Profile is about

1379
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,727
But just without spelling

1380
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,287
Pulling it out without being like you guys are f****** shill

1381
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,847
Also in the unedited interview Megan

1382
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,383
Kind of gives him an elbow is like

1383
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,663
Hoveround

1384
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,551
Now Owen

1385
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,319
Your you're

1386
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,087
You're great

1387
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,415
I really love your racist Muslim impression the other day

1388
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,023
We all know Hillary's

1389
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,143
The Infowars staffers we met have free reign

1390
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
To cover

1391
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,935
Whatever they like

1392
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:38,079
With virtually no oversight like Journal we spoke with some of Jones's employees including Owen Shroyer

1393
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:39,103
How do you

1394
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,151
On a day-to-day basis figure out what you going to do

1395
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
Wake up

1396
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,247
I look at the news

1397
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:51,647
Hi. Pray I rarely get directions from Alex or my boss pretty much leave it up to me

1398
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
What you consider yourself to be a journalist

1399
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,279
You don't like calling it that I'm going to be human

1400
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,887
I'm just a human this looking for truth so I'm trying to reach out and be what people want

1401
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Music people

1402
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Queening

1403
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
The deplorables

1404
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,287
The flyover country the Forgotten American

1405
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:12,127
We're going to get to work immediately for the American people

1406
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:17,503
With the election of Donald Trump Alex Jones has plans to expand Infowars

1407
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,063
More Studios more shows

1408
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,087
More employees

1409
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
More influence

1410
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,183
Said that I

1411
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,767
So this is what we just got to be Chad

1412
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,839
So I just started a war for me

1413
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:36,191
Alex Jones with a powerful Ally

1414
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:41,055
Just two weeks ago the Trump Pence campaign

1415
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
Notice

1416
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
At the bottom

1417
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,383
It's a link

1418
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,455
To Infowars

1419
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:49,759
Set the end of the Peace

1420
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,319
Quite frankly

1421
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,599
Is the equivalent

1422
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Puffy's

1423
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,647
Bequia

1424
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Application

1425
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
Batman

1426
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,351
You guys

1427
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,167
We're we're giving you

1428
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,519
Like the the if you're rational you look at that and you see that last

1429
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,311
That last thing that you said

1430
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:14,079
Is

1431
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,383
Oh that means Alex's dangerous

1432
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,663
The beginning

1433
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,687
That means Alex

1434
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,455
What is dangerous

1435
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
All of that stuff

1436
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,087
All of that stuff is built around the idea of giving you the impression of

1437
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:27,135
And at no point

1438
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,439
Time making a goddamn

1439
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,463
Point

1440
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,743
That was it

1441
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:33,535
That was the whole f****** thing

1442
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,607
Earlier than I thought I would

1443
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:39,679
Who's going to be you know why cuz there's those glimmers

1444
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,215
There's those couple of moments

1445
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,007
Yeah are like Alex

1446
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,311
The Trap

1447
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,079
Anna Anna

1448
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,127
They never say never

1449
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
Yeah something

1450
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
And if

1451
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
I beg you

1452
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,087
MBC and Megyn Kelly

1453
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,623
Give me the tapes

1454
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:03,487
I will find what Alex is afraid of

1455
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,791
Right I guarantee I can find it

1456
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:06,815
I know his head

1457
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,631
Unfortunately

1458
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,215
So am I am your savants and BC

1459
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,775
This is as disappointing as we kind of it

1460
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,799
Expected it to be

1461
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:22,431
I've too bad that I'm going to be up all night attending this

1462
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:24,735
Expected it to go the other direction

1463
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,807
I expected it

1464
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,599
To be something where people

1465
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,927
Before the interview there's this like

1466
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:34,463
You shouldn't are this interview

1467
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,535
They were clearly committed to Aragon

1468
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,583
Which to me suggests

1469
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,607
They thought that

1470
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
They had something where

1471
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:45,727
They would not defy airing the interview but then they would get

1472
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,007
Praise

1473
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,311
For doing such a great job.

1474
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,591
Taking down this propaganda

1475
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,639
And this is like you said

1476
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
That is a puff

1477
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,759
You would think

1478
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,831
And to them they think that's really damn

1479
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,671
Yeah I did a good job on

1480
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:08,255
Covering that no one else is

1481
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,583
Cuz a lot of people are covering

1482
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,887
And the people who are

1483
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:15,423
Are doing a great job

1484
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,215
Bible degree with that

1485
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Again

1486
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
Who gives a f***

1487
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,591
He was

1488
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:23,359
Drunk

1489
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,943
Ways to learn

1490
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,503
The interview

1491
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
Play there's all kinds of stuff that you

1492
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,879
But

1493
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,719
That really pisses me off about that

1494
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
Is because

1495
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,023
The real trick

1496
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,071
Getting Alex

1497
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:44,863
Into a corner

1498
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,399
A talking about what

1499
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
He wants to

1500
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:51,775
Talk about yappity will f****** go on and he damned himself

1501
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,079
Totally

1502
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
Like

1503
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
If you can

1504
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
Muslim

1505
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,735
It's like that first thing on the Manchester

1506
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,783
Just go into not

1507
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,087
What you said about the victor

1508
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
But what do you believe about

1509
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,279
I need be like

1510
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Banana

1511
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:19,167
That's on you and that's all you would need to show like all the stuff was like

1512
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:20,447
What's the same thing that pee

1513
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,471
Blonde Twitter

1514
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,775
The same thing that Media Matters is which is

1515
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
Going like

1516
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
Hey

1517
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,335
You need to

1518
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
To talk about this

1519
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:28,639
And if you just

1520
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407
Let Alec

1521
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,967
He's going to destroy himself

1522
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:38,111
So the document is not

1523
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,927
You not what you think about Sandy Hook

1524
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Not anything like that Alex

1525
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,255
Worst enemy is himself

1526
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,839
If they've shown an interview Alex did with him

1527
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:52,191
Yeah I think that that's why we kind of thought

1528
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:56,799
That it would be worse than it was too because I know that

1529
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,103
But he has very little self-control

1530
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
When he's baited

1531
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,687
It would be pretty easy to Beta

1532
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:07,551
Absolutely I agree I think you should bring up Muslims I think you should bring up globalist

1533
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,879
If you ask him direct questions

1534
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:15,231
About is globalist ideology

1535
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,511
Here to be like

1536
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
He go off

1537
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:29,311
Yeah a two-point where you get to the end of the road it would just be

1538
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
The vapor

1539
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,431
Nothing

1540
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:40,319
You don't actually have a real concrete position here Rothschild

1541
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,647
Nonsense

1542
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:44,671
The Rothschilds

1543
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,975
I mean what real

1544
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,255
Santa real

1545
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:50,303
Thing anymore give us

1546
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,839
Any kind of credit

1547
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,655
That we don't necessarily deserve

1548
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,423
But

1549
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
How do you do that interview

1550
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,239
You

1551
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,519
Give him rope

1552
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,567
You let him talk about his

1553
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,847
Globalist ideology

1554
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,151
You let him talk about how he feels about Muslim

1555
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:06,943
Utah

1556
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:13,343
You got to talk about masculine and then all you do is instead of your voice over Bay like here's this

1557
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
You just

1558
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,391
Point out

1559
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
Not true

1560
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,439
Sure

1561
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,231
That's basically what we do

1562
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:21,023
We turned him into a joke

1563
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,071
Let him talk

1564
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:27,167
Yeah

1565
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:30,239
And that's what we hope for that mean

1566
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,567
That's a big fear that he has

1567
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,591
Start listening

1568
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,687
The same fear I have I'm kind of scared

1569
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:45,087
Warriors

1570
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,879
About

1571
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:49,951
That I can disprove but I don't want

1572
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:53,023
I'm sure he has the same fear but in reverse that like

1573
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,911
People will questioning about these things that he's vaguely talked about for years and years

1574
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,191
Would be disaster

1575
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:01,471
Yeah

1576
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,007
I just don't

1577
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,079
I'm disappointed because of

1578
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,871
Opportunity law

1579
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,175
I just now Alex is never going to do this again

1580
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,223
I think you're absolutely right

1581
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,783
In that

1582
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
No

1583
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,343
Because what he got was

1584
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
Exactly what he wanted

1585
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,927
Based on all of the last week

1586
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,463
Lead-up you so scared

1587
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,487
Like right

1588
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,303
I don't think he put himself through that week again

1589
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
And if you did

1590
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,631
I mean if you ever learn any lesson

1591
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,727
Alright I'm going to be much more careful about what I say

1592
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,543
Beer was driving in

1593
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:39,871
You got three empty control

1594
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
Be careful about

1595
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
Strew

1596
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
Did

1597
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Was

1598
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,575
Put him into the pub

1599
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,599
Public conscious

1600
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,135
For a day

1601
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
I'm at the

1602
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
Yeah there's nothing there

1603
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Yeah

1604
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,583
The end result of this is Alex Jones has propaganda

1605
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:01,119
Play with now I mean you can

1606
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,911
When this pretty well

1607
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,191
I am

1608
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:08,287
There are the fear that people had about enough

1609
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,567
Complaints of people were making

1610
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,871
Before it that you're giving him a platform

1611
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:14,431
You absolutely are I think I think they're

1612
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,455
100%.

1613
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:18,015
Certified now she makes a good she makes good points

1614
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:21,087
About the consequences of his rhetoric but it's not

1615
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,135
That's not enough that's not enough

1616
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
Do necessarily make the den

1617
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
You need to make

1618
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
Justified

1619
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,791
Yeah no you have platform him

1620
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:33,631
You've made him mainstream and you've allowed until Ion Television

1621
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
That sucks

1622
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
And all you've done is

1623
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Make him sex

1624
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,287
Somewhat because

1625
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,823
Look at that look at the powerful

1626
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,591
Fullman

1627
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
Look at this powerful man

1628
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,663
He's connected

1629
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,711
Got millions of

1630
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,319
He's super-rich

1631
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:56,927
All of this is exactly

1632
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,231
And

1633
01:11:59,487 --> 01:11:59,999
You could be able to

1634
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:00,767
The Pierce

1635
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:03,583
Allstars reinforcer

1636
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,351
God

1637
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
What a bummer

1638
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,447
Static-X

1639
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,407
Release the tape

1640
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,967
Releases text Babe

1641
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:21,247
Those tapes would be the most

1642
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
I have to be

1643
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,879
Listen to review

1644
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,951
Coming on the heels of a possibly losing it episode

1645
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:33,791
Makes me wish I was dead for one person

1646
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
Not that

1647
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,607
Who's this one guy

1648
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,679
This guy named JP's an old friend of mine

1649
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,615
I am

1650
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:53,247
Alex
