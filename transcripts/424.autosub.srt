00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Air Jordan

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Nola.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

4
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guys

5
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Need

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Alex Jones

7
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
Seed we are Dan Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
Whatsyourprice

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,424
You go first

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,984
I will tell you right now

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,360
Obviously stir crazy

12
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:25,760
Part of the way I express that was bleeding

13
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
Cabin Fever

14
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,368
No I I purchase chocolate Lucky Charms

15
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
Oh yeah yeah

16
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
However

17
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
If you put them in some yoga

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
Black cherry yogurt

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:46,752
Specifically intersec incredible absolutely incredible delicious

20
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,544
Complimentary flavor profile

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
Strange but it works out well here's what I would say

22
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
That's not a good sign

23
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,504
That sort of a purchases

24
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
A little iffy

25
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
You won't be in a crisis and less you get that Captain Crunch

26
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,464
Cotton candy cotton candy

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
Boxes of Captain Crunch that ice cream

28
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
If you buy one of those

29
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,912
You got it you got it now it's time to call it help

30
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,472
I don't know what

31
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:21,824
I guess the bright spot is the yogurt pairing with it I guess it's okay

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
Just that turned out to be

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
Here's my brights by Jordan

34
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,600
You believe the seltzer

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,672
Is more than just drinking seltzer

36
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:42,048
What do you got

37
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,168
Okay I believe that

38
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,776
To do is we need to look at it as a metaphor we need to look at it as a thing

39
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
We all like soda so delicious

40
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
You don't need to do better

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
You can have a seltzer water

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,456
Calories

43
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,856
The number of cases you can take away the caffeine I don't want that don't need it anyways that we can break the chains

44
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
The binder

45
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,928
And two unhealthy habits yeah

46
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
Marches On

47
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
I have nothing

48
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
Ivan update

49
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,120
In the spirit of aspiration

50
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,960
Surrounding the year of the Celsius it is this

51
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
I am making the committee

52
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Call God

53
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,616
500

54
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,432
There aren't even 500

55
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:34,272
Absolutely. 500 difference I have not looked it up

56
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:39,392
But I guarantee there are you better

57
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208
And I'm willing to do it

58
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
More than one a day which is going to be tough

59
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,168
A SR20 is the beginning of it

60
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
PO420 2021b

61
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,848
End-of-the-year of the seltzer

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
As opposed to

63
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,344
That was easy that's number one that's the first seltzer

64
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Of the year and I have two new ones

65
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Sure I'm on my way

66
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Okay

67
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,471
The pretty good okay and then I went to the store and I saw that Luke had a new flavor limoncello

68
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:31,871
Forget

69
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
Who is interesting and has like a lemon vanilla

70
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,575
Kind of vibe

71
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,463
Great Mary some alcohol okay

72
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,279
Desert boozes

73
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
I'm going to do I have a

74
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Notebook right now

75
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
Eventually we'll end up having

76
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Being spreadsheet

77
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
I will be giving updates on every episode

78
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,551
Out of 100

79
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,415
Now the scale will obviously become more refined as time goes on

80
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:21,023
But I have given the AHA black cherry coffee and 83 out of

81
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
Holyshit

82
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,679
Well if it's under 50 that means

83
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Bad

84
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
Over 50 is good and I think that I probably elevated that one a little higher than it needs to be by think it was out of

85
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Surprise openings

86
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,943
Yeah I think I got that first bump

87
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Yeah where you're like

88
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:46,367
This is the one that also I embarked on my journey it's really hard to uncouple from the like

89
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
This was so much better than I thought it was good.

90
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
But 83 I'm going to stand by it

91
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Baby maybe

92
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,839
By September November will be looking back on.

93
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,935
I can't believe I did that but whatever

94
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
Orange grapefruit

95
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
Giving a 7277

96
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:08,639
Not as good not as good at also wasn't at there wasn't any

97
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:15,039
I accidentally I found myself leaving the can

98
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
Time I got to the bottom of it

99
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
It wasn't like ice cold and it really suffer

100
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,207
Okay it was very tough

101
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
52

102
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:31,167
I do think 73 is too hot

103
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,359
Lacroix limoncello we will have a rating by the end of September

104
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Not yet

105
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Got to finish it before it could be done

106
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,967
Okay alright

107
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
This is

108
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
This is

109
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,087
Stir Crazy very exciting

110
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:56,255
Very interesting

111
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,863

Be very grateful if you did either

131
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
Jordan yes sir

132
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
We can't start the episode yet

133
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
There's more business.

134
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:52,479
Shelter update has been made

135
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:59,135
First thing is the recordings on Thursday and this is the day that Alex's bankruptcy

136
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,671
Hearing was supposed to happen

137
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,303
And we don't know exactly what's going to happen because by the time we started this episode

138
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Consult the docket

139
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
This morning

140
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
Oz ex-wife

141
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
Filed an emergency motion

142
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:18,079
She's trying to get Alex's lawyer disqualified on the basis that she says

143
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
That the two of them have an existing relationship

144
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,479
From back

145
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,831
Preclude him from representing him in this case

146
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Bring Barnes back

147
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
Order motion the cheese filed

148
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:38,047
I am feeling that she was like

149
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,607
A motion to continue

150
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,399
Which would be to postpone it

151
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,471
So there's a very decent chance that by the time

152
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:51,871
By the time this episode comes out the hearing baby postponed

153
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:58,271
It's also possible that that motion

154
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Feels like we mislead

155
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,647
Anyone we did not we were going on the information that was available and this morning

156
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
Thursday morning great emergency motion was filed

157
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,839
Satisfy

158
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:17,983
Goddamn Jones family yeah so that's a little bit of a bummer but the other bit of business is a little bit more of a

159
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,103
It is my birthday and I thank you very much

160
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:28,991

00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
Me talking about how Netflix password

168
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:58,431
And gifted me a Netflix account

169
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:04,831
I unfortunately have not been able to open it yet because I haven't had time but I intend to sue

170
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
What's a little bit more free time

171
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,415
Also you Jordan

172
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:13,791
URI gave me a copy of Final Fantasy 7

173
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,863
So thank you very much for that

174
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
I really had a whole lot of time to get I did play a tiny bit last night

175
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
I don't

176
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,943
It's not my style of game but I definitely enjoyed the opening of it

177
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:35,039
Probably enjoy it but it'll take a little of just

178
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:35,807
But we'll see

179
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,159
Oberlin finally my friend Adrian got me a very nice

180
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,487
It's a brand

181
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,399
Understand it is a favorite of the

182
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Canada

183
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:57,823
And so we have a little bit of a spruce beer

184
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,359
So I've no idea what to expect

185
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
Butts

186
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
That is pretty good

187
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,879
What is a ginger to survive to a

188
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,231
It doesn't help I feel pine needles I've ever eaten I feel fine

189
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
I'm not sure if eating a pine needle but I feel like I have

190
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
What you qualify as part of the year the seltzer

191
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,031
It's not very beer like now

192
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
Not at all. I was I noticed that I had the champagne

193
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
Cleanliness

194
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
Clear it doesn't have eight

195
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,367
Yeah it's very much seltzer

196
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
Yes nice

197
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:49,279
Delish

198
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:56,447
Let's get down to business hour episode many thank yous and good tidings to all

199
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
They're coming for your balls

200
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,871
Alright alright

201
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:04,639
Alright

202
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:11,039
Focus in quite a bit on the idea that the coronavirus is specifically designed to attack men's balls

203
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
I'm happy

204
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Cool

205
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
So we starting on the 21st and Alex's still mad at Joy Behar interview because

206
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:22,047
To these

207
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
These are protests against corn beans and

208
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,191
Measures

209
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,215
Are terrorists

210
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
And he's not happy

211
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,823
Here's Joy Behar

212
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:35,871
People are being

213
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,919
Right-wing media people like

214
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,967
Rush Limbaugh

215
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:42,271
Bringing guns to a rally

216
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,879
Protesters

217
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Thomas Jefferson

218
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:01,727
And it was paraphrasing Beaver the data

219
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
When the government

220
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
Here's the people there is Liberty when the people for the government

221
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,223
First of all I don't under percent agree with Joy Behar

222
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:18,623
Necessarily inappropriate thing to say like to do

223
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Really see how that

224
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Could be applied

225
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
All sorts of directions

226
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
Some sort of a terrorist Act

227
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,519
This should surprise no one but that is not a Thomas Jefferson quote

228
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
It's commonly misattributed to Jefferson as well as to Thomas Paine but Monticello the world's foremost authority on the word

229
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,455
The writings of Thomas Jefferson

230
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,735
About no evidence

231
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,271
The Jefferson ever said that

232
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,159
In researching the source of this quotation the Thomas Jefferson encyclopedia reports the first note appear in

233
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
Prince was in 1914

234
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,559
In an indictment of socialism delivered by John Basile

235
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
Provident

236
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
Interesting Lee it's currently Barnhill birthday

237
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,799
So happy birthday to him as well as me

238
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:13,663
This quote comes from a debate Barnhill head with socialist writer Henry Kitchener

239
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,039
And in the context of the debate it's very clear the Barnhill is not quoting or citing an existing a

240
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
Expression those are his own words

241
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:27,999
It wasn't until 1994 that is gray was first repackage and presented as the words of Thomas Jefferson

242
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,071
In a book called It's All In the game butterflies

243
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:32,607
Control The Razor's Edge

244
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
This book was written by. William Somerset mouth

245
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Which is the name that most people would not recognize

246
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,407
You spell because I did a thorough breakdown of Alex's film endgame

247
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Name rings a bell for me

248
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
Giorgio Sirius Hatton is

249
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,367
The guy who was one of the big sources for Daniel estulin book the true story of the Bilderberg Group

250
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,647
Which Alex uses a

251
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
As a Cornerstone of his theories about that

252
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Hatton

253
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
Of course is not a reliable source

254
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
Here's how Hatton describes himself

255
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351
Quote

256
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:10,751
I'm Giorgio Sarah Earth Project transition Pleiades sector flight command

257
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Lactic Federation Fleet command

258
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,639
Earth representative to the cosmic Council in The Intergalactic Federal

259
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,199
Federation Council on Earth transition

260
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Hold on one second

261
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:29,183
Hat is a Nutty space space weirdo

262
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,583
But he used to at least sell colloidal silver 1990

263
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,399
Let's debate and reintroduce it as a quote from Thomas Jefferson

264
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,751
It's not a Jefferson quote but since that point people have regularly Miss attributed it to him

265
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:49,407
Again this is Alex Jones having no actual connection to history of the founding fathers of this country he professes to love some

266
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,223
He doesn't love this country or actual history

267
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
He loves come

268
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
Completely nonsensical conspiracy theory

269
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
Revisionist history and what he generously called

270
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Patriot mower

271
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Another words

272
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,975
He's living a fantasy land he loves

273
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:06,815
His founding fathers who bear no resemblance to the actual

274
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Yes yes

275
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:14,495
So obvious when you look at like the the quotations that he is

276
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
So Alex

277
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,943
I think he realizes that on his previous days episode on the 20th

278
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
David Icke was on he said there was no virus

279
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,415
Is it by this point that that was like oh wait that's a problem

280
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Doc's here

281
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
People lie

282
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
David Knight

283
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Mike Adams

284
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
David Icke

285
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
When it's completely normal

286
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
The government and the media

287
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:57,759
That's been caught lying. So much over and over again to question everything and that

288
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,551
And you should do it

289
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
With David Icke

290
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
That virus science is in

291
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:14,399
Shouldn't need to say that but okay

292
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Iman

293
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
We don't have one view like CNN or MSNBC and imperative

294
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,847
No Yuri you affirm

295
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,199
I've been pretending

296
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
It's fine is norovirus your response needs to be what

297
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:34,879
Talking about

298
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Just be like oh my God Bingo you nailed it goes

299
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,631
Problem was not

300
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,399
David Icke

301
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,543
Views always Alex's response to David that you allow him to say these things

302
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,359
But you double down on them

303
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,895
Totally right

304
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:03,295
Fox News

305
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:07,647
Would you guys are crazy houses on his smooth transition towards that same

306
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,863
It's disgusting but none of them will be held accountable

307
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,263
Disgusting of things that Alex is definitely.

308
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,359
He's now really firmly of the position

309
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,431
That's how those videos that were coming out of China

310
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,015
That he was reporting on as being totally real

311
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,831
Are now obviously fake.

312
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
Put a video about they don't like

313
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,719
Not all these videos.

314
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
It was staged

315
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
The welding shop

316
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Safe

317
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Garbage

318
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
All of it

319
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Was

320
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
Not real

321
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:13,183
So those are all things that he has reported as very real in the past

322
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:19,583
Is because the only time I'll ever be a third grade plays like his kids

323
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,143
And feel good

324
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
Dad whenever he says your place

325
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,543
Playlist

326
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,847
I'm trying to be supportive. Did you suck at acting

327
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
Nobody nobody cares about

328
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Yep that's not great

329
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
He does from time to time I kill off and talk about how his websites being under hack attack

330
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Attention

331
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,839
He does that on this April 21st episode

332
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
This is

333
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
This is absolutely did not

334
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,495
5-minute video

335
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,031
Video stranger down

336
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,127
A child

337
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:10,015
Satellite TV

338
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:16,928
The fiber-optic

00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:22,048
Milk

340
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
Look up contact for the roof

341
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152

Involved

345
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,816
This reminds Becky Emilio Estevez was still an actor

346
00:21:55,072 --> 00:22:01,216
This reminds me a lot of Bill Cooper to honestly there's another thing that I'm retired cover eventually in the future but there was

347
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:07,616
There is like a number of times throughout bills career specifically under attack

348
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:14,272
Answer also tradition among conspiracy theory

349
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Castro's two

350
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Create

351
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
Sort of dramatic

352
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,928
Parks around Vero

353
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:26,048
You have to create the presentation that what you're doing is somehow dangerous

354
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,096
The only way to do that is to

355
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:30,144
Manufacturer

356
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
Nothing is being

357
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,264
Terry is under attack by aliens

358
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:40,640
Whenever there's any Tech glitches

359
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,200
Because aliens are interfering

360
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,320
Consistent meanwhile we have Dal good luck man

361
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,392
My stuff's not that good

362
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,696
My my soundboard is a little old

363
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
We're talkin into cheap Mike's still haven't gotten that compressed air yet

364
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,376
Do it again

365
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
Alex's pretty mad that the media

366
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,824
The BET of the bad guys

367
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,104
That he has the

368
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:15,456
To divide us or something

369
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
He has the Cure

370
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,368
Alex and his next clip is complaining about how his friends

371
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,928
Believe that

372
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:29,024
The media says that he said it so they're asking for the Cure

373
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,304
Sure this is

374
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,328
Convoluted

375
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,096
But

376
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
The thing that's important is the

377
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,728
You have to recognize so many of these complaints that Alex has

378
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
Trace back to him having conversations

379
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
With stupid people he chooses to associate with

380
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:44,640
So

381
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,432
You can't

382
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:50,528
You can't generalize this to the population

383
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,952
Close to that

384
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,488
Steve pieczenik

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
You still run that headline

386
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Colin Dolan

387
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,800
No I don't know

388
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
People that know me

389
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,784
French

390
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,344
Oh my God my mom no

391
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:29,184
Do you have the chair and I'm like no but the news says you have it

392
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,560
Media so little

393
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
Sonicare

394
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,448
When the media says I do cuz they trust me not them

395
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:47,360
Doesn't it mean that they trust the media more is they believe

396
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:50,688
People saying that Alex

397
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:55,808
If it distrusted the media then they would think that Alex isn't saying that he has a cure

398
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
I don't know what's going on here

399
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,160
Not really important

400
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:06,048
He has the Cure

401
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:13,216
As well as Heaven I think he got it from meeting with a Chinese

402
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
National

403
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,544
Some sort I believe is what he said

404
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
I don't care

405
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
It's all nonsense

406
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:24,736
Alex mad are just dumb people and his family members

407
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,600
Or imagined conversation

408
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,368
Yacht

409
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
Alex

410
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,512
Talks about his custody situation a little bit talk about that

411
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Because

412
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,424
Interpersonal things are impossible to decipher from the information that we have at our disposal

413
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:49,056
The reason I'm saying this is because Alex says that there's that and then there's bigger things

414
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
We can't discuss

415
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,384
I would suspect

416
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,664
We have a pretty

417
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Fine idea what that might be

418
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:59,040
Play pray for us because there's stuff a lot bigger than this I can't tell you about

419
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
That is your final warning

420
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
Play Bill Gates alone

421
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,744
Leave us alone

422
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,008
Do your work

423
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
It's a robe

424
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:31,808
You said you were moving yesterday

425
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,344
He just explained a lizard

426
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,488
So when he says like I've gotten my final

427
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
It's either nothing or

428
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
He knows the shoes,

429
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
Flying directly

430
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
He also made

431
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:48,960
Yet again

432
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:53,056
A classic mistake of not understanding that Defcon means

433
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
The higher the number

434
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Safer

435
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,712
I've not looked into Def

436
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:02,016
Scary everybody going to die

437
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,040
DEFCON 5

438
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
Pretty boy

439
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,624
That's

440
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,696
Unfortunate for him but I probably would make the same mistake

441
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
Probably with the

442
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,560
And it's also their fault for doing it wrong

443
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:21,472
Stupid whatever the reality is or whatever is behind this there is a real sense that Alex is just like

444
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:25,824
F****** done like that there's a finality that I've got my last warning

445
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,872
Leave Bill Gates alone

446
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:31,968
Google doesn't care if we talk about

447
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,928
It just goes on throughout this episode like it's a real it's real serious

448
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,208
Just the way

449
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
He feels like I've come to the end

450
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,632
Foxhole

451
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,080
Overrun by a group 10 times our side

452
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,128
We need to conquer Mexico

453
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,456
I'm just let you know man

454
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
Dispatches

455
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:16,768
I want to explain something to you we're not normal. No more

456
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,840
Alex has always seen himself as Colonel Travis

457
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:26,240
Yeah he's always seen himself as this archetype of the guy going down in Alamo

458
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,360
And here he is on are saying like these are the final dispatches

459
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:34,688
Where the Alamo

460
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,272
Hey guess what in the Alamo those reinforcements did not come

461
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,928
And just like Colonel Travis Alex is a drunk and he brought this upon himself

462
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,792
Is more accurate about being

463
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:50,816
But he knows

464
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,656
Alex gets off this

465
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:59,264
Feeling lady has to talk about Shroyer had this Saturday

466
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Over last weekend

467
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,848
Another one this weekend

468
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,200
The last one

469
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
You didn't you didn't even notice

470
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:12,320
I didn't know about this day turned out

471
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:20,256
Antifa try to agent-provocateur Owensboro

472

00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:24,864
12:00 noon

474
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,472
At the state capitol

475
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,640
Randy.

476
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,688
American flag outfits whenever they are

477
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
Top State Police

478
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,064
Getting arrested outside

479
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:45,856
We can

480
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,416
Appreciate your doing

481
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
Chaplain will protect you from me

482
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:03,264
Club stuff is going on here in America

483
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,896
Movies AMC

484
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:12,480
I do believe Stephanie

485
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:13,504
Because they're all

486
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Same to

487
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,624

My car

489
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
Absolutely

490
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,256
Yeah I know I mean it is

491
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,328
They're really begging the state to go Blue

492
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,656
There's no more of these guys

493
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
They believe in

494
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
In Christianity

495
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:37,824
They are damning themselves to Hell more than anyone ever has

496
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,360
It's insane

497
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,896
Yeah that's a state government

498
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Add some

499
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:48,320

There is nobody who could do a worse job than what they are doing

502
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,744
Yeah it's bad

503
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,096
So you got this protest it's coming up on Saturday and Alex's really trying

504
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,144
To push that you got to go or you're with

505
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
The anime

506
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:06,240
We don't need America to think of it is extraordinary

507
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
In the face of this tyranny

508
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,896
The only thing we have to fear

509
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,624
We need everyone to realize if you don't go out and demonstrate

510
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Get over your fear

511
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:29,024
And you're dead already at your part of the enemy operation

512
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,864
You say no or you're with the Enemy

513
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:37,216
Owen Shroyer so great

514
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,800
They went out there and didn't wear masks don't they have courage

515
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
Courage is one word you could use

516
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:50,016
I suppose sure

517
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
Yeah it's it's not it's

518
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,880
Exagear

519
00:31:55,136 --> 00:32:01,280
Mentality

520
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
Yeah yeah

521
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:06,912
You are a you are with the virus

522
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:08,960
Speaking of the anime

523
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Dr. fauci

524
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
Anime anime

525
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
Alex has dug up some footage

526
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
Shazam

527
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
From a couple years back

528
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,712
And Alex has decided that this

529
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:20,736
Is proof

530
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
That he planned this whole thing

531
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,368
He was trying to f*** with you

532
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
Don't ever shake hands with anyone again

533
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:36,096
When did the space alien from Hell Land here that ran the Hy-Vee cover-up

534
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,728
Wuhan lab

535
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,496
Real quick

536
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Alex

537
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,312
What is the HIV cover-up according to

538
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:51,200
2u urhi Vida nihilus is the HIV cover-up exactly please

539
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,224
Second

540
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,320
Whenever Alex says he is very consistently think he's up to his eyeballs

541
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
And that is a very specific turn of phrase

542
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,208
That Francis Boyle uses all the

543
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,816
He says people are up to their eyeballs in The Biohazard labs

544
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:11,424
Bioweapons lab the Nazi bioscience

545
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
Time to time I think it's great I understand that very consistently to talk about dr. fauci

546
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,384
Francis Boyle

547
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,408
It is it is

548
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,432
Very

549
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
Not traceable

550
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
Gates 100 million from last year

551
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,832
He's here saying

552
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:31,392
Don't shake hands with anyone ever again

553
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,720
2017

554
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
Crisis

555
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,632
Very very soon.

556
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,704
Is that there is no question

557
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Be

558
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,544
Challenge the coming Administration in the arena

559
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,104
Diseases both chronic

560
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:55,200
Pieces in the sense of already ongoing disease and we have three

561
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:56,480
Neolodge Bergman

562
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,416
Be ready for that

563
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,584
So Alex strategically

564
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
It did seem very abrupt

565
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,192
Almost Midway

566
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,544
He took it out of context without that hard out

567
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
But also

568
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
And why

569
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Hotel

570
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
No Doubt

571
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:13,280
This is from a speech that Anthony fauci gave a Georgetown University Medical Center just before Trump's inauguration

572
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,680
It's very clear fuel this dude commented context it's Archie is discussing the very normal phenomenon of surprise outbreak

573
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
Experience a surprise outbreak is not an outlier

574
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:27,360
It's exactly the same thing the previous presidents like Obama have expiry

575
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:31,968
It's a fact of life that there will be emerging diseases there's always outbreak

576
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,016
The question is entirely about

577
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,880
What these emerging diseases are and what their response to those outbreaks will be

578
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:42,720
Clipper Alex.

579
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:45,280
Teasing that Trump unlike past president

580
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,584
Has a disease Outbreak on the horizon

581
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:52,960
Switch to be misrepresented misinterpreted it to him making some kind of

582
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:59,616
Its proper context its completeness characterization of patchi's words

583
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:03,712
An example of an absolute fabrication either knowing or

584
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,064
Someone's feeding Alex's information he doesn't vet anything that he says you just black

585
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:17,792
Text August

586
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:24,192
Then he took out of context you need to provide the full contact well and Alex saying the clip is completely opposite

587
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:30,080
If you understand that the show is lying is cool

588
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
I am taking about a coffee

589
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
That is a fair accusation

590
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,296
So in this next battle starts about the globalist plans right

591
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:42,112
So Trump wants to open up the economy right

592
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,648
He does that

593
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,440
Globalist are going to respond

594
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:05,408
Prophetic dream he's talking about really fun things

595
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:14,368
He's saying he wants Trump tries to reopen the economy the evil globalists are going to release more strains of the virus so let's look at the possum

596
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,440
Outcomes in the real world

597
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
Literally regardless of real

598
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,024
If Trump

599
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
Doesn't open the economy

600
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:24,864
There's no reason

601
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,400
And for the then part of it

602
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
That's not a problem for Alex

603
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,752
Situation

604
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:36,896
If Trump opens things up prematurely there's a decent chance that the infection numbers will go up

605
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:42,784
That's a natural result that you'd expect to see and it's pretty much the big argument against rushing to open things back up

606
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,576
You think it's a very obvious our

607
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,024
By pretending that the globalist or respond to transaction by releasing more dangerous strains of the virus Alex

608
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,584
Rewrite the increased infections as a globalist attack

609
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Instead of what it really is

610
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
The consequences of trump Shady leadership

611
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,216
But what is Trump reopens

612
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:03,776
Things and there isn't a big increase in infection

613
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,848
It seems unlikely but it's certainly possible

614
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,992
That would be a problem for Alex a team since he said that the globalists are going to release more bio-weapons to punish Trump for real

615
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:15,552
It's not a problem for Alex

616
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,576
Because if that's

617
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Situation comes

618
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,488
The past that he can say the globalist couldn't follow through with their plans because he called it out on errands there skiing absolutely

619
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,792
A lot of Alex's narratives work like this

620
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:32,448
He tends to populated world of things that can be spun no matter what happens in the real world because he's just making this stuff up to the

621
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,984
Some

622
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
That's fun

623
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
Oh God

624
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,824
Nobody is

625
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Zelda

626
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
Accountable

627
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:41,664
On the right

628
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
It's simply not a thing

629
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
It's just not a thing

630
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Like they just don't do it it's fascinating

631
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,832
How a large group of people

632
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,648
We'll just believe anything and then whenever

633
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
It's done

634
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
They just switch it and they like

635
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
Insane

636
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,816
So Jordan

637
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:03,424
At the beginning this episode of thanks people for some nice birthday gift indeed

638
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,520
But I got an amazing birthday gift in the middle of this episode

639
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,360
It's someone we all thought was dead

640
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,152
Is shown to be alive

641
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
Nah, still.

642
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:20,576
Your phone calls

00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:26,976
Let's go ahead and talk to John and

644
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:31,328
On the air

645
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Alex

646
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Sheridan Wyoming

647
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,264
Call my house phone

648
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,664

649
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,992
What a tree guide

650

Give him a few still going after all of that he's got to have a show Alex

651
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,048
Give Michelle jeanfreau Wyoming old house phone

652
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,376
I heard that I almost freaked out

653
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
New York some nonsense about

654
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:17,152
Yes please

655
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,224
We need to have one of those lights website

656
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
Yeah

657
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:28,416
We need to have one of those like is Abe Vigoda website

658
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:31,232
Yes but I can confirm that as of April 21st

659
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,768
He is

660
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:36,096
And he's much older

661
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:42,496
Exactly he did say it on a R1 pointing at something

662
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,032
Is an old old man

663
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
Sounds good

664
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,920
Sounds great

665
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,504
This is where everything falls apart

666
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,528
On the 21st

667
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,320
This is profound

668
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,856
Like Alex is just like

669
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
F*** you man I'm f****** done

670
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,256
F*** this s*** I hate my own show. It's f****** stuff is stupid

671
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
Incandescent

672
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:10,656
Free things

673
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:15,776
I just want to die

674
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
Too late for you to do this

675
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
Maybe 3 years ago

676
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
After Shelley Moore I do like We Do lyrics

677
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,168
Easter torture now

678
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,384
Wow

679
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:59,551
That's pretty open-and-shut I f****** hate this show

680
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
Call Deidre

681
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
F*** this s***

682
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,743
By I think that's pretty comprehensive to the first time Alex and I really

683
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:14,143
We agree with except for the American

684
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:14,911
Absolute's

685
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,727
Must be torture to do its absolute

686
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:24,639
Think that that is a new wrinkle a little bit I'm even in the times that I've heard hit be pretty

687
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Darken like

688
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:28,479
It's never like I hate this show

689
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,039
That was New Balance Direct

690
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Yeah

691
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,671
Which seems

692
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,463
A congestion that he is not yet

693
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:49,727
So he continues on the elaborates on this need to for America and the world

694
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:50,495
The burn

695
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,271
That's why I feel

696
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:05,599
We need to we need to pay for what we've done actually

697
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,159
You do

698
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
Alive anymore

699
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,487
For you but

700
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
You know

701
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,839
On a planet of dumb

702
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,911
Rent a planet of slugs now

703
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:26,335
So now Alex is become

704
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
What's the world destroy everybody

705
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:32,735
Obviously in the same way

706
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:36,831
Is this Crusader against tyranny United supporting all these to Renton Boeing

707
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:40,415
I'd like of course it's so obvious

708
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,815
Back in the day pretending that he cares about humanity and everybody so great and the human spirit that refuses to submit it

709
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Burnham down

710
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Meijer

711
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:58,079
My personal Arc hasn't gone the way I wanted to so everyone must die

712
00:43:58,591 --> 00:43:59,615
Great

713
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
That's an adult

714
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Yes

715
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,223
So this caller he brings up

716
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,503
His suggestion

717
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,295
And that is that he thinks

718
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,087
What should make some specific shirts

719
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,903
Suggestion

720
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,743
Is so f****** funny

721
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:18,815
Okay so I brought up the idea and you thought I was a good idea but

722
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:21,375
Couple years ago and I said hey

723
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:29,823
Collapse

724
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
My job

725
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
I want to buy no one cares

726
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,271
Darkness

727
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,647
Now this is what I've been looking for from Alex's colors

728
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:46,719
This is Bill Cooper this is where I'm at with this

729
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,023
Well excuse not

730
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
Because

731
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,095
Listcawler

732
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
Giving

733
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Productive

734
00:44:54,143 --> 00:45:00,287
Feedback product of the coming economic

735
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,055
Collapse

736
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:07,455
Then you can use it when the market does go down in allocating with a good faith

737
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,783
Within the world

738
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,599
Pretty good suggestion

739
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,207
Where is like the times I'm sure Bill Cooper

740
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,815
The times that we've heard him responding

741
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,375
It's mostly because I bring up stupid ideas

742
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:27,167
Somebody's still different

743
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,959
Alex's Alison

744
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
In the real world

745
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,591
Infowars it's a good idea

746
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:37,407
Always about me struggling with you

747
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,247
Analysis responses like

748
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,319
F*** you

749
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,135
The f****** tantrum

750
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Eddie's

751
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:54,303
Spirals to the point where he seems to be almost celebrating the idea that Civilization is going to end

752
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,887
We are cowards we are trash

753
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,543
They're going to have everything they're going to starve to death

754
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,103
It's a blessing

755
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
Why's that

756
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
Call a blessing

757
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Fake stuff

758
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:19,647
Stupid

759
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:24,511
All the conspiracy theory internet program

760
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:31,423
I don't know if he's going to collapse entirely but it's Netflix

761
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,287
Don't have a f****** account

762
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
It won't affect you at all

763
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455
Alex is real

764
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
Real f******

765
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:46,783
In that second

766
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,319
That was bad sex

767
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:51,903
Pretty bad

768
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:55,999
A little apocalyptic apocalyptic

769
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:59,327
I want to make t-shirts no one cares

770
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,167
So Alex Goes To Break outro music

771
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
And of course

772
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,823
Bob

773
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:15,967
People don't want it

774
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:24,671
And so we deserve it

775
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:29,535
Tell you we're not going to know I'm on the world will burn

776
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,423
That wasn't very apologetic

777
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:41,823
Well I mean it was kind of like I'm getting a little bit dark here

778
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,407
Wilshire

779
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
It's me

780
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,503
You know

781
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,599
It's the introduction to like that last segment was pretty f***** up

782
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Someone gave me a taco

783
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
I need to take a few days off

784
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:00,767
When we get to the actual sort of about

785
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
Should have taken some of this back

786
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:09,215
Academy the things I said

787
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:25,855
That is great he's the childish like

788
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,183
I want everybody to die f*** everybody I'm sick of this s***

789
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,719
Hey listen I'm really sorry

790
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:37,887
I really apologize that my my dad came in and told me that no one's going to give you money if you can

791
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:44,799
He's right so I'm sorry

792
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,455
To me or I should say that there is a counterargument

793
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,015
But Alex is going to deliver this next cliff

794
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:55,807
Which is that he's not doing

795
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,879
I don't shut up here and do this show so

796
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
Running this place

797
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,167
Puron arrowleaf

798
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:23,455
Enough money

799
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,503
Continue on with the level rat

800
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,063
Think about the fact

801
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,647
People really realize how serious is one

802
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,975
They would do their job I know a lot of You Are

803
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
The gas can

804
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:39,583
Shows

805
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,727
Real

806
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,031
Desperation here lays gentleman

807
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,639
Rages me

808
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,855
We are a nation and a world of Watchers

809
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,879
Not abjures

810
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Watching

811
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,887
Conquering us

812
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,215
Tronix Psychic Spiritual

813
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,519
An overriding of the planet

814
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,823
Systematically

815
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:26,431
Mark of the Beast the whole nine yards so yes I will

816
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Already need

817
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,927
Through here

818
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,743
I want to take Stephen Santa position

819
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:44,351
The criminal nature of the system that if you haven't flooded us wouldn't support

820
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:47,167
We wouldn't be here

821
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Longer on Capitol

822
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:56,383
The more they just want to kill me or put me in prison which is fine

823
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:02,271
Because

824
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,903
God's plan

825
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:10,975
You want to do it to the fullest extent

826
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:16,351
Acupuncture around everybody else to take this damn serious because

827
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Damn.

828
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
They running

829
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:32,479
People have lower IQs

830
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:34,527
. gov

831
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
Because they don't have enough iodine

832
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:47,071
I mean like this whole thing about like I don't want his want to stay in the fight

833
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,887
Prison

834
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Sanitation

835
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,983
Healthy and talk about this 100 times like the iodine deficiency

836
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,775
MC numbers that he's talked about her developing

837
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,543
Countries

838
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,079
And they're being fought

839
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:00,383
By people like the UN

840
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,247
The people who ordered the globalist that Alexei so trying

841
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,783
To solve the problem

842
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,063
He's pretending

843
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:08,831
Exists

844
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:10,623
Largely in America

845
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,903
Just eat some salt

846
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,951
Eat applesauce

847
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:16,255
I have an iodine deficiency

848
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,095
So Alex I mean it's just

849
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,167
That it's almost like an entire segment of

850
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:25,215
The show just like this

851
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:29,055
I don't want any I'm not doing this for money but you got to flood us with money

852
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,383
I understand how this argument work

853
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,407
Like yes

854
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
That's obviously Alex

855
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,479
Is presenting it in a way that's like

856
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:41,599
I don't want the money I want the money to be able to continue

857
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:45,695
But it seems like the only function of the show is to spread b*******

858
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,719
And make money

859
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,999
So continuing

860
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:55,423
It's just a continued to make money later money so I can continue to make money

861
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
With the presentation of her actually doing

862
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:58,751
Yeah

863
00:52:59,007 --> 00:52:59,519
Not

864
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,847
So Alex is his whole thing

865
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:07,711
Big narratives that goes throughout the show is about

866
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,735
Some numbers

867
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,807
About starvation around the world

868
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,623
I am sorry about this this next clip

869
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
The care about the

870
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,279
This is what we like we like to be hugs let me tell it in the hose

871
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,679
Thanks to this right now

872
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
Die

873
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
Trendy

874
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,455
I'm so bored

875
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:46,111
So disappointed Alex kept hitting on this episode

876
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:49,183
20 times that are to bring it up

877
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:53,791
Realized

878
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:57,375
Here Alex is trying to pretend that he has literally

879
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,423
Any concern for the well-being people in

880
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,007
Developing countries

881
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,591
That's a topic that we can discuss and I will get into it here in a minute

882
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
Has absolutely no rights

883
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,431
Pretend to care here at all.

884
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:16,319
Supporting Trump Alex staked his claim very aggressively and supporting Ron Paul the only honest politician

885
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,135
It is 2018 2012 runs for the present

886
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:24,255
One of the big things that Ron Paul believed in was the elimination of all US foreign aid

887
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,583
The number of deaths that would result from that kind of a move is

888
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,935
Incalculable and it's not even taking into account the hits the developing countries and take

889
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,775
In terms of their educational capacity or general sanitation programs

890
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:41,407
The Staggering level of Cruelty that you have to accept to endorse a candidate who wants to get rid of all US foreign aid

891
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,991
Precludes you from ever being able to credibly pretend you give a s***

892
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:48,063
Let anybody in the developing world

893
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:48,831
Can f*** himself

894
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
You bet

895
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:55,231
The number that Alex is citing about 30 million people being on the brink of starvation

896
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:00,607
That's not a number that they don't have any people are predicted to starve if we don't reopen our economy

897
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,727
Our economy has nothing to do with that figure really at all at least on a one-to-one level

898
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,031
This is something that was put out by the UN

899
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:12,639
World food program

900
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,199
It has the potential to leave Millions at risk

901
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:16,735
If we don't do something

902
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:23,135
This was something at their executive director David Beasley was warning about even before the coronavirus situation was here

903
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
Tissues that there's a whole lot of issues

904
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,719
What's happening right now

905
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:30,815
ABC News article about Beasley's comments quote

906
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:37,215
Because of wars in Syria Yemen and elsewhere Locust swarms in Africa disasters and economic

907
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:37,983
The Crazies

908
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
Including

909
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,799
Lebanon Congo Sudan

910
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,567
Eddie top

911
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,895
Reason album

912
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
Another country

913
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,711
Economies as much as if we

914
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,479
Can't afford

915
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:49,759
Provide for an eighth

916
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,807
The countries are facing famine condition

917
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,879
And there will end up being severe humanitarian crisis

918
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,415
He's in a lot of people could die

919
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,463
This is a very serious issue that deserves

920
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
Attention but make no mistake about

921
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
Alex doesn't want our economy to be open

922
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,863
So we can send money in foreign aid

923
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,399
Repeated by the UN

924
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:12,287
Alex is using the abstract idea of the deaths of people in developing countries as a prop for his narrative

925
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
Legitimately disgusting

926
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,687
This has nothing to do with whether or not Trump tells people to go to Jim's or not

927
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:23,551
This has to do with whether or not weedy prioritize people in developing countries

928
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,599
When things get tough at home

929
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:29,695
That's the central question as it relates to the matter of people going hungry around the world

930
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
And again

931
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,535
Alex's hero rampal would happily let them all die

932
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,887
So I guess if Alex actually cares about this at all he'll call on Chopped

933
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:38,655
Provide Inc

934
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
Increased funding

935
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
To the UN world food programme

936
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,007
I challenge him to do that

937
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,287
But I suspect you won't

938
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:45,567
Because this is a game to him

939
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:50,687
Yeah the idea of 30 billion dead people in foreign countries in the developing world

940
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
Is just a prop that you can use to argue

941
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,063
In order for the economy to reopen

942
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,111
So these, these companies

943
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,695
These large companies that he pretends to be opposed to can make a profit

944
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
If a millionaire pretends to give a s***

945
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:05,279
About

946
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,559
Anybody and it develop

947
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
They should

948
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
Have their money take

949
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:11,167
Play from mnb tarred and feathered

950
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:17,567
I think that would be the way to solve most problems

951
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:23,967
But yes this is a real thing and you know what

952
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:25,503
Un world food

953
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,295
Actually on the ground

954
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
Working

955
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:30,367
2

956
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
Humanitarian crisis

957
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,975
Not people like Alex blowing hard on the radio

958
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,023
But how he doesn't like his show you what's up

959
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,607
The f****** quit and run away to a redoubt but no I'm going to stay here forever

960
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
Nonsense

961
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,167
What am I

962
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,983
So as this episode ends

963
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:52,895
Alex Addison's into bit of a situation where he's

964
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:56,223
These narratives

965
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,271
About how doctors are just

966
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,087
Grant Hospital

967
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
Doctors address

968
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,903
Drinking and talking

969
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,439
The hospitals are empty

970
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:10,815
I know they're nurses doctors are having sex and watching p******

971
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,119
They're drinking

972
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,399
Text same time

973
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Sure

974
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:19,775
Which record

975
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:25,919
Pills

976
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,199
What

977
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,671
Rockin everywhere rockin everywhere

978
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,719
Players Club

979
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
Truly going on is

980
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
They're at the Players Club

981
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
Propelled

982
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,031
Party party party party party everyday

983
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,055
Everyday

984
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:00,479
100 on my Highway

985
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:03,551
That's what's going down baby

986
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:09,183
You say it is a

987
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,719
Giant orgy

988
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:14,559
Again this is just based on things that is dumb friends are saying

989
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,631
I also really true

990
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:25,055
I suspect this is mostly about like Tik Tok video of nurses dancing

991
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:31,711
Filled in the blanks and try to apply like

992
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
I think I think one way to reduce his

993
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,135
Outside

994
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Aggression

995
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Towards

996
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
Hospitals

997
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,583
Neuter am I think neutering is a way to solve a lot of his

998
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:51,423
I'm covid-19 coming for your balls I really think that's a good way to go

999
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:57,823
Envy episode here kind of excited that these nurses that are all just f****** taking pills

1000
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,871
Stop

1001
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,407
Future

1002
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:07,551
And then he admits that he hasn't really done his job at all because he freaked out and got really mad

1003
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,087
There's nothing

1004
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:18,303
They'll be crying for mommy they were Venezuela can we will be don't

1005
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:22,911
To look at these people

1006
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,287
To Craig and EJ

1007
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,895
I love you to death I didn't do it I'm a bad person

1008
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,735
But I guess I should call or two in here

1009
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
Jeff Zuckerberg

1010
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
Again Jessica

1011
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:46,719
You dirty filthy

1012
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:49,023
Go outside

1013
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,143
Yeah that is weird you maybe it's do not make that mistake yet irregularly

1014
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:55,167
I'm still

1015
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,191
I'm still of the mind that it's

1016
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:59,007
Miss speaking it doesn't mean anything's play it is weird

1017
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,335
It's more consistent than originally

1018
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,271
Medical professionals

1019
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,111
Dying begging for mommy is gross

1020
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,951
More importantly to me I think is this admission at the entier

1021
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:24,607
Didn't take all the calls that I said I was going to take didn't get to these stories that I was going to cover

1022
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:29,471
I had to be really defensive about just money and also I hate my show

1023
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,519
And the world deserves to burn then I got to talk

1024
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,055
Dunescape back on outside

1025
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:37,663
Hey sorry about that little babies all I heard

1026
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,943
We should change it

1027
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,967
To First

1028
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,783
Do no harm to anyone but Alex Jones

1029
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:48,159
I don't think he deserves medical care if you are saying that nurses are making

1030
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
Fake videos

1031
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,767
I feel like I could videos after 16 hour shifts

1032
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
I feel like it's okay

1033
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:58,399
I feel like it's okay for you to say that but if I heard a doctor say that I would be offended

1034
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,215
Because I think the doctors

1035
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:03,007
And medical professionals

1036
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:08,383
This is true from number that I've spoken to in some friends that I have who were in the field

1037
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,919
There's a hot there's a colon

1038
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:12,991
To being interested

1039
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:16,575
Take away your ego or whatever feelings you have about like

1040
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:18,367
This is a bad person

1041
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:27,583
You know you be denying care to people on all sorts of arbitrary

1042
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,119
Denies

1043
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:34,751
Who lives or dies for YouTube

1044
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,335
You're not a doctor

1045
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
No

1046
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:42,687
I will give him Medical Care

1047
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:51,647
Attends the 21st 22nd Wednesday's show

1048
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
And he opens up

1049
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,207
Real real high

1050
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:04,191
So insanely important

1051
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:13,919
Doing Pediatrics

1052
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:20,063
I don't know what the big news is

1053
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,343
It's confirmed

1054
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,695
I listen to this episode and I think I have maybe two possibilities

1055
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
For what the big news

1056
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:31,071
But here's what he says immediately after which would lead you to suspect

1057
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,679
This is what the big news is it's causing Alex to choke on the 22nd

1058
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,007
Saying from numbers I saw 3 weeks ago that.

1059
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:41,823
Right now

1060
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:42,847
Next month

1061
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,151
Show me the numbers I saw

1062
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:53,343
Play Timbaland the numbers are now in from the UN themselves

1063
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
Do you hate

1064
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,415
CorePower

1065
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
Million

1066
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,119
Are starving to death

1067
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,215
Globe and Mail

1068
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,263
Canadian pipe

1069
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,567
Possible that's Alex's big news

1070
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,359
Is the story

1071
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,639
Not being dramatic for

1072
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:17,407
For sure

1073
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
The story that covered the day before

1074
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:25,599
30 million people dying in developing countries

1075
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,391
That doesn't make sense.

1076
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:34,303
What does make sense in Infowars World it doesn't make sense from a perspective is like actually taking this

1077
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,655
Sincere actor the news that you reported yesterday is somehow

1078
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:40,191
Today

1079
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
I don't know

1080
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,847
Global Mail article that Alex is talking about when he's here on air

1081
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
The same issues we talked about earlier

1082
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:55,807
Also if Alex's argument is that the globalist want to shut the economy down order to kill off all these people seems to be what he's getting

1083
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,367
You can have to contend with this quote

1084
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:04,767
From the UN world food programme executive director David Beasley from that's very Globe and Mail article

1085
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,047
But deciding as a source

1086
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,143
If we lost our funding a minimum of thirty million would die

1087
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:14,495
Over a three-month period that would be 300,000 people dying per day

1088
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:20,383
That's why leaders have got to balance out the covid response with keeping the economy going because otherwise

1089
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,199
A lot more people will die from starvation and economic

1090
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Deterioration

1091
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Then from covid itself

1092
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:32,415
So the UN simultaneously wants to crash the economy to punish Trump balance keeping some of the economy

1093
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,463
Provide Aid to the developing world

1094
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,815
Seems like maybe the first one is just Alex's paranoid imagination

1095
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,911
What you got to understand

1096
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Is it about what they're not

1097
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,495
The Jazz exactly

1098
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,311
Whatever notes you can't hear that makes the notes

1099
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:50,335
You can hear

1100
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871
Paranoid

1101
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,967
One possibility is the big news but it doesn't make sense

1102
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,295
It doesn't make sense since he's already reported this

1103
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:03,903
I don't know that's one possibility is

1104
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,463
Not a possibility

1105
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,023

01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,615
He apparently was driving around he saw his son driving around

1110
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:27,199
Into a liquor store parking lot

1111

About a couple of security guards came up and

Yeah why why is that probably some sort of law

1167
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:07,103
Question of like you saying it's a hoax but you're selling Basques people should ask themselves why

1168
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:07,871
You think

1169
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,479
No it is almost

1170
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,295
Like you know like let's say

1171
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
There's like

Fuckmaster

1180
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
.

1181
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,975
If you wear when you're a warrior or something

1182
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:57,535
That's the line he needs to take not like

1183
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:03,935
Hey will make a brand out of this

1184
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:04,959
It will come up

1185
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:10,847
The folks will find a way to profit off Spears

1186
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:18,271
Talk about fighting guy yelling at a guy in a liquor store parking lot Alex mentioned

1187
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,087
Video of John Roberts of Fox News

1188
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:24,927
Talking about the the coronavirus death rate

1189
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
Hey Auntie it's to do with

1190
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,511
Study

1191
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,303
SC

1192
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:35,935
This is the other candidate for the big news of making Alex choke

1193
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:40,799
Plus thousand people in LA County Health Department reporting

1194
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,871
Something dead

1195
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,943
Today

1196
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,295
A of died from Coronavirus

1197
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
Add

1198
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:55,647
Boxing test

1199
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:58,463
Bara so they may have died from

1200
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:00,767
Free People

1201
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,839
Estimate from what they've been testing now

1202
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,887
No more

1203
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,287
So close

1204
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
Calculator.net

1205
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
Can you put 66

1206
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,919
And add three to it

1207
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,527
663 divided 400000 equals

1208
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:25,343
The number right there

1209
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:29,183
0.001 657

1210
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,719
5 equals

1211
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,999
0 point

1212
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,279
There's a final number

1213
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,071
0.1

1214
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:37,631
7

1215
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,703
If you flip it upside down it says boobs

1216
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,031
Brutal

1217
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:47,103
That is

1218
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,663
Even close to 1%

1219
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:56,319
So I think this might be the big news it's a story that he's covering a lot of

1220
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,623
This episode

1221
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,927
What is bulshit in the others

1222
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,695
Presentation

1223
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:07,583
Bulshit part is it all boils down to

1224
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,607
2

1225
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,399
Photographer Doug Mills

1226
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,447
Before one of these White House Press briefing

1227
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:17,055
The video has been used to prevent the idea that the virus and the response to it is a hoax

1228
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,895
Even though if you watch the video Mills says quote so it's a hoax

1229
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
George Roberts replies quote

1230
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,223
No I don't think it's a hoax

1231
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,807
This videos when used by all manner of conspiracy theorist

1232
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:34,207
The big narrative has been that bills accidentally slipped up and admitted that there is a secret vaccine

1233
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:40,863
Robert says that Mills doesn't need to wear his mask because the fatality rate is lower than we thought to it smells replies quote

1234
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,655
Oh yeah we've all been vaccinated

1235
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:48,287
It's clear that their friends f****** around the comment Roberts even said

1236
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,615
It does just Gallows humor

1237
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,431
Don't discredit he's not selling the vaccine portion

1238
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:55,199
This video

1239
01:13:55,711 --> 01:14:01,087
He's interested only in the lower fatality rate part of it which is was John Roberts

1240
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,647
Discussing be misrepresented

1241
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,927
Alex is narrative

1242
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:11,839
Roberts was bringing up a study conducted by USC that reached the conclusion that there may be as many as 400,000 people

1243
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,631
LA County who has had Coronavirus

1244
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,799
This study has yet to be pure review. But if it stands to scrutiny all it really shows is that there may be a much lower face

1245
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
LA County

1246
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,383
Then we currently new to be the case

1247
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:30,783
Most people had assumed the numbers we had worked fully accurate for California because relative to other states

1248
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,623
They've had other states that have had high numbers of cases

1249
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,439
There hasn't been as much widespread testing in the state

1250
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:42,815
I could well be that the number of people who had the virus in the state is higher than the confirm number

1251
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:45,887
But I don't really see how that makes me outbreak any less serious

1252
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:50,495
He possibly puts California's fatality rate into a lower range but that's about it

1253
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:57,151
Also given a lower proportion of test administered in California it's also possible that the definite Brazil we have for the state

1254
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,735
Inaccurate

1255
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:07,391
It's unclear there's a lot of assessment study that needs to be done here to get a complete

1256
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,719
Really clear picture of w w and this study is interesting

1257
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,511
But we need to see what

1258
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,791
With it moving forward

1259
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:18,143
Once that happens all the sex things once they're more concrete because unlike Alex

1260
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,703
I don't base my beliefs on preliminary studies

1261
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:26,847
There very well may end up being a well-done study

1262
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,151
But there's plenty of examples in the past where it's

1263
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,687
Things appeared to be

1264
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,783
Some

1265
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,647
It is

1266
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,927
Because I am

1267
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,255
Technically one of their peers if we can serve on a jury together

1268
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,047
That means I'm up here and I give it

1269
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,399
Start.

1270
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Whatever

1271
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:55,519
Alex has some complaints he wants to make

1272
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
About

1273
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,503
This is their globalist Revolution to cut

1274
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
Industrial state

1275
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:17,535
We are done because we're evil

1276
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,815
Doing this

1277
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:21,631
You're hearing the whole un Gaia

1278
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,167
World Government speech

1279
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,983
We deserved it from Hollywood

1280
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
Everybody else

1281
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:30,591
Shut everything down to say wives

1282
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:36,991
So the pope and the globalist and the Hollywood trash that we deserve

1283
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:47,231
24-hours let's

1284
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,399
The planet on

1285
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,239
That's why I feel

1286
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,823
We need to we need to pay for what we've done actually

1287
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:05,663
We are cowards we are trash

1288
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:12,575
They're going to have everything they're going to starve to death

1289
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:19,999
Got it means I said last check

1290
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:25,119
All right I can't believe that the Pope

1291
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,447
Open the government and Hollywood squid say that we deserve it

1292
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,727
How dare they

1293
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:36,127
I said it or maybe Alex is part of the globalist plan or whatever

1294
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:40,223
Did not expect to be a secret pagan

1295
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Why not

1296
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:47,391
So the last scoundrel scoundrel

1297
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
According to Thomas Jefferson

1298
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:51,743
Quotes

1299
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:59,423
But it turns out that the last Refuge of the Patriots scoundrel is

1300
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,383
Business better than Hillary

1301
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,919
You imagine

1302
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:13,759
Glenwood present today they would be carrying out

1303
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,807
This exact same plan except

1304
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,647
Give me 10 times worse because you wouldn't have Trump in there trying to block it

1305
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:23,231
Find America

1306
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:30,143
Ride the wave or you would have been destroyed

1307
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,519
Economy which they basically already done

1308
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,847
Has never been at zero

1309
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:46,015
Process crew is on his way down to zero

1310
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,551
Cold cardiac

1311
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,439
Yeah I love sweet crude

1312
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:58,815
So the negative oil prices were specifically that Futures contracts for May for West Texas intermediate

1313
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,583
It's crude oil

1314
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:04,191
The reason was because it was a day before those contracts work

1315
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,007
Be closed and if you held those contract when they close

1316
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:10,079
You are obligated to accept delivery of the oil

1317
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:16,735
Because a lot of people who held those contracts could not stop unless they were desperate to sell off the contract

1318
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:23,903
Price for West Texas intermediate June 2014 dollars a barrel

1319
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,951
When I Was preparing this episode

1320
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,767
Infernus however if things don't change

1321
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,375
It could very well hit negative rates as we come up on the closing date of those contracts

1322
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:36,447
It's possible but for now it's not the

1323
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
What is presenter

1324
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,031
There a lot of issues with the situation

1325
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,847
And some of them could combined spell trouble in the future

1326
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,663
This particular incident with the negative prices

1327
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:47,711
That shouldn't be the main thing that people are Focus

1328
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
Sing on

1329
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:52,831
During the coronavirus. There's obviously a decreased

1330
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,599
Royal

1331
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
In response

1332
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,415
Decrease demand

1333
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,487
It was requested that OPEC countries cut back production

1334
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:04,351
But this has not happened to the extent that would be needed in order to balance out the supply and demand

1335
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:09,983
That sucks there's an excess of oil being created with people having a difficult time

1336
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
Well I should say there are

1337
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,360
Difficult I'm storing it on land

1338
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:21,760
World economic forum

1339
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,296
Bring your excess oil at sea

1340
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
Recent anchors at high cost

1341
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:29,696
Summer believed to be paying an excessive $100,000 per day for each

1342
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:30,976
Tanqr

1343
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:35,328
I'm no expert but I feel like massive stewardship soil Odyssey is a recipe for trouble

1344
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:41,728
What when is that ever been an issue damn thing I can think of any civilization ever never know

1345
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:48,128
Great let's put it another compounding factor is that Alberta

1346
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,920
Which is produced from oil sands

1347
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,456
Is no longer profitable

1348
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,224
Produce

1349
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:57,600
It cost more to extract to transport it then it would sell for which is cause people to flee from it as a commodity

1350
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:04,512
Financial times this week not on its own cause significant damage to the US Energy sector

1351
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,608
However they know that it could hurt the perception that oil is a safe investment

1352
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:11,680
Based on their assessment the solution is fairly simple

1353
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,984
We need to either slow production of oil

1354
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,824
Start using a ton more of it or find places to store the oil work

1355
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,848
Currently producing

1356
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:22,688
Unless we do one of those things the supply and demand will be out of balance

1357
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,736
And we'll just keep seeing volatile pricing

1358
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:30,112
It's a bad situation and what could cause some potentially troubling

1359
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,416
We could also provide the political will

1360
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:36,512
To finally do something about the deep-seated problems in the US Energy Market

1361
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:41,632
It seems like there could barely be a better time to start making moves towards Alternative Energy models

1362
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:47,520
Scented incident like this demonstrates the benefits are not being so concerned with a single commodity that can blow up overnight

1363
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:50,080
Seems like you're it seems almost like

1364
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:53,152
There is a silver lining right like right

1365
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,920
Counterpoint

1366
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,480
What If instead

1367
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,760
Trump just

1368
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,552
Gets his many of his

1369
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,368
Followers killed as possible in bales

1370
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:05,184
Why not both have you considered that

1371
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:10,048
This could be a situation where I really take it on the chin

1372
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,376
I would very much like to give him one of the two

1373
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:19,776
So Alex talks about Ike how he knows that globalists there eugenics

1374
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,104
That's for really long time because back in the 60s

1375
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,968
They were trying to get all the lake smart kid

1376
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,832
Places like University of Texas

1377
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,416
The top students in the country

1378
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,696
Teaching them

1379
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,120
Where they breathe

1380
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:51,520
This is this is a really important stuff is Dad is the smartest boy in Texas and

1381
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,288
Globalist

1382
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,128
Lower that is absolutely

1383
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:59,456
Do you have to really recognize how much stuff

1384
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
Alex believes

1385
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,760
And repeats

1386
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:05,344
Pretending to come from authoritative sources and things that are proven

1387
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,904
Are just bullshitted his dad probably

1388
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,976
You can always trust

1389
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,000
The CIA dentist

1390
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:12,768
So damn sure

1391
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,632
Look for backup for all this stuff

1392
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:21,472
You know Alex has his is standard examples of what are all the time

1393
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:27,616
Is Bill Joyce article and Wired Magazine why the future doesn't need us I really don't want to talk about that article

1394
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:34,528
No because it's very obvious if you actually go read the article doesn't say what Alex says

1395
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:37,344
Really similar to excerpt

1396
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
From the Unabomber

1397
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,672
They Bill Joy includes

1398
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,208
In the Arctic

1399
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,744
That I know this

1400
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,280
And if Alex had read it

1401
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,304
He would know it

1402
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,072
2

1403
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:50,912
Text clip when Alex brings up Bill Joyce article

1404
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
I get a little sense

1405
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,288
Did Alex is keenly aware that he's actually just talk

1406
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,312
About the Unabomber

1407
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,360
I think you were useful l

1408
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:04,992
Call Joy Road about in 1999 and why the future doesn't need us Wired Magazine

1409
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,088
Decision

1410
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:29,056
I think it was a dead giveaway I think he understands that he's just talking about the Unabomber

1411
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,592
Alexa connect those dots

1412
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:34,944
It's a sad attempt to justify using Bill Joyce article dishonestly

1413
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,992
Also Ted Kaczynski was not a

1414
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:37,760
In the CIA

1415
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,808
The psychological experiments that he was

1416
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:51,328
Which would later become the CIA during World War II was involved the OSS during WWII

1417
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,936
Pretty clear that he did was good

1418
01:24:56,448 --> 01:25:02,592
According to Alex Ted Kaczynski the evil globalist plan was sending

1419
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,152
Except that's complete bulshit

1420
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,456
It's just a fantasy that Alex is making up

1421
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:12,576
There's a lot you can go learn about the Unabomber if you want and this is not

1422
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:17,184
Accurate you got a you got to find some way to really love the guy

1423
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,720
Scent bomb

1424
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
Two places

1425
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
And blew them

1426
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,328
Alex's likes white terrorist yes he does

1427
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,400
Hey you know what that's similar to

1428
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,216
Something Joy Behar said about him

1429
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:32,032
In the next clip Alex talks about the big

1430
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:38,176
Playing with this like crashing oil and crashing economy of course

1431
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:42,272
The the way that the Rothschild

1432
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:48,416
I did his economy at all up short that again

1433
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:51,232
Salix tell the story again this story is not

1434
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,024
True but listen to how passion

1435
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
That lady tells the story

1436
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,568
Walking people I've been with

1437
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,992
Scooby-Doo

1438
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,416
Just like Scooby-Doo

1439
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,232
12

1440
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,984
Was the Battle of Waterloo

1441
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,752
Thanks

1442
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,568
Corvette

1443
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,176
Call Ash cross the channel

1444
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:46,272
Is the stock market open

1445
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,320
Wellington annihilated

1446
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,928
Went to 1% or Rothschild bought them all and became

1447
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,976
A ruler

1448
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Nope

1449
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,096
I do remember that

1450
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,264
Down to nothing all the oil down to nothing that story is not true that's just a standard feature of anti-Semitic

1451
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
Propaganda over history

1452
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,592
So you believe this

1453
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,664
Came the Supreme

1454
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,944
Like this is

1455
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,736
Just believe things that aren't true

1456
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:23,392
He passes off his knowledge of this Bill Joy article really been noses

1457
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:28,000
Yeah this whole narrative about it

1458
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:32,864
Yep what he knows is this anti-semitic propaganda surrounding Rothschild family

1459
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:36,704
The Battle of Waterloo

1460
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:41,312
They put out during WWII

1461
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:46,176
Like he believes that he presented his real he doesn't know s*** it's almost like he believed

1462
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,456
Nazis more than

1463
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Not not

1464
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,296
It's it's almost like

1465
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,856
He will believe whatever a Nazi

1466
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,904
He says in order to take

1467
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,928
Advantage of it

1468
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
And I

1469
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
He's a Nazi

1470
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:01,792
Yeah

1471
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:05,888
So it is next to Fox News

1472
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,704
Angle and it's to do with the

1473
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:13,312
The idea that what happened there was the reveal

1474
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:15,872
Did the media knows that this is a hoax

1475
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,944
But nobody

1476
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:23,808
Behind the scenes

1477
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,440
Because that is so massive

1478
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
The cliff

1479
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,536
When you go in the store and

1480
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,376
You're an idiot

1481
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:41,472
What do you want to show them the part of the clip where the guy says so it's a hoax

1482
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,312
Jean-robert says no I don't think it's because you're saying

1483
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:51,712
Probably

1484
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
People saying. It's not a hoax

1485
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,136
I don't know what kind of ruins thing you to show me a music video of my favorite

1486
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
Banded the store

1487
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,208
Noel

1488
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:05,024
Come up to me and say watch this video

1489
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,816
Especially if you're Alex

1490
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,352
And if you're not wearing a mask

1491
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,888
So Alex

1492
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:14,240
People are not getting

1493
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
Recessed

1494
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
Acetate at hospital

1495
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,336
Like if you go to hospital now

1496
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Too busy f******

1497
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:19,872
Right

1498
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:23,200
This leads into some pretty weird

1499
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,248
Conspiracy theories about

1500
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,784
Financial motivations

1501
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,808
The hospitals have

1502
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:28,576
4

1503
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,112
Playing along with this

1504
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,648
Hoax or whatever

1505
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
In the last few months when it gets bad

1506
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:44,448
People that have heart attacks

1507
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,496
50 years old or 8 years old

1508
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,544
We need the hospital space

1509
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,736
The hospital

1510
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:12,352
But now when you have a heart attack

1511
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,680
Venezuela resuscitate you because that's

1512
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,216
Non-essential

1513
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:30,784
Give

1514
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,624
Ammonia

1515
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,208
Thousand dollars for covid-19

1516
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,024
There's two pieces nightclub that are complete

1517
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:46,656
The first is that when Alex heard people talking about doctors not being able to help every patient and having

1518
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,680
To decide who gets

1519
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,960
Care and who doesn't

1520
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:51,008
She seems to be making a joke out

1521
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,104
It wasn't a discussion about how things are happening

1522
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,640
Now in the United States

1523
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:03,040
It was a horrifying Glimpse or what could happen if my medical system was overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus patients they were coming

1524
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
To the hospital

1525
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:06,368
It's a pretty simple Dynamic to understand

1526
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,464
Is the number of people requiring Immediate Care is greater than the number of people who can

1527
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:14,048
Provide to help

1528
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:20,192
In that situation you enter a nightmare where you have to write off people or probably going to die because you can't save everyone

1529
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,240
This conversation wasn't happy

1530
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,008
Shooting for no reason

1531
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,872
Is because back in March that's exactly the situation doctors in Italy were in

1532
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,432
Open article in Politico

1533
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:36,064
In an interview that went viral after it was published in the Italian daily corriere Della Sera

1534
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:36,832
Monday

1535
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,624
Christian salerosa

1536
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:41,952
Anesthesiologist from hospital in Bergamo

1537
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:45,536
Recounted scenes of wartime triage

1538
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:47,072
Have to be left by the wayside

1539
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:53,216
Call the choices made inside of an emergency room used for mass events

1540
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:58,848
If a person is between 80 and 95 and a Severe respiratory failure he probably won't make it

1541
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,896
Also from the article

1542
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:04,736
For now the marching orders are save scarce resources for the patient

1543
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:06,784
Who are the greatest chance of survival

1544
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:11,136
That means prioritizing younger otherwise healthy patients over older patient

1545
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
Or those with pre-existing

1546
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
Open conditions

1547
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:17,024
The AP discusses what that look like in real life

1548
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,560
And quotes Marco Resto

1549
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,864
The deputy chief of Pollock

1550
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:25,216
Lamico Donatos in intensive care unit

1551
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:31,872
Discussing how doctors have to decide who will get access to newly-opened intensive care beds

1552
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:34,432
Even if there is no chance he says

1553
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,712
You have to look at

1554
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:38,272
Patient in the face and say all is well

1555
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:40,064
And this lie destroys you

1556
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,392
It's horrifying to consider in a few weeks later

1557
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:46,464
Doctors in Spain or dealing with the exact same Horrors

1558
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:50,560
March 25th article in Bloomberg discusses a Madrid emergent

1559
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Empty room

1560
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:57,728
People are dying in Waiting rooms before they can be admitted as a coronavirus pandemic overpowers medical staff

1561
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:02,080
With some Funeral Service halted in the Spanish capital and no space left in the morgue

1562
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:04,640
Corpses are being stored in the main ice

1563
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,064
The conversation was not happening because this was something that was happening in the United States but because it was a horror that are can another country

1564
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,088
We're living through

1565
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,672
We could easily be our reality too if we made the wrong decision

1566
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,488
The entire point of the distancing and masks

1567
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:24,864
Carefulness measures is for everyone of us to do whatever we can to make sure we don't end up in that situation

1568
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
Because once we're there

1569
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,960
Cannot help you if you have a heart of

1570
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:36,640
This is one of our medical system has all its resources completely depleted by one person

1571
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,432
Is automatically a lower priority

1572
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,224
If we do these things

1573
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,552
We helped make sure that situation is one we never have to live

1574
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:47,392
If you have a heart attack now or hospitals will be able to help you

1575
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,928
Largely because of people doing the

1576
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,976
Things Alex is actively protesting

1577
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:51,744
Against

1578
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,560
If he gets his way with his job rallies against disc

1579
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,840
Something measures and all that s***

1580
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:59,424
There's a chance we will end up in the nightmare scenario

1581
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,192
Against

1582
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:04,032
As for the payments thing that's just something the David Icke told Alex

1583
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:07,104
But David I could just repeating both Shady heard on Fox News

1584
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:12,480
Minnesota State senator Scott Jensen was on the Laura Ingraham show inside

1585
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:15,552
Anytime Healthcare intersects with dollars it gets awkward

1586
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:21,952
Right now Medicare is the term that you have covid-19 admission to hospital you get paid $13,000

1587
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:27,328
If that covid-19 patient goes on a ventilator you get $39,000 three times as much

1588
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:33,472
Conspiracy world started revving their engines hospitals had a financial incentive

1589
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,520
Calling everything covid-19

1590
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,432
We should remove the financial incentive from our Healthcare System that's what they're saying right there very angry about there being

1591
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,224
Financial incentive in The Help

1592
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,064
Medicare for all right

1593
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:48,832
Maybe

1594
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:52,672
Factcheck.org

1595
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:57,024
He did not think that hospitals were intentionally misclassifying cases for financial reasons

1596
01:34:57,536 --> 01:34:58,560
Hardly matters

1597
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,608
The Cradle of the IDI been presented

1598
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,632
And once that happens

1599
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,216
I didn't mean it like that

1600
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:06,752
Turner is alive

1601
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Fact check

1602
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:12,640
Reached out to some doctors to get a sense of what this is all about and as it turns out it's b*******

1603
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:16,992
This is just the amount that Medicare pays for treatment of

1604
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,016
Covid-19

1605
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,040
Not diagnosed

1606
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,576
But

1607
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:25,952
Kaiser Family Foundation these numbers are very much in line with its from Medicare

1608
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:29,792
With respiratory infections averaging about $13,000

1609
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:32,608
Any cases of escalate to the need for ventilators

1610
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:34,400
Comes in around $40,000

1611
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:38,496
The coronavirus Aid relief and Economic Security Act

1612
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,288
Trump signed into law

1613
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:46,688
Did give you 20% uptick in funds for Medicare patients treated for covid-19

1614
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,736
You think that hospitals are just going to be

1615
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
Italy diagnosing people

1616
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,832
A small bump in Medicare funds

1617
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,624
If they're caught doing that

1618
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,720
They run the risk of being removed from the Medicare program entirely

1619
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,024
Leaving aside how they could be sued or charged

1620
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,304
Criminal malpractice

1621
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,072
Yep

1622
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:06,400
Alex is accusing these doctors at these hospitals of a crime

1623
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:08,192
It's a pretty serious allegation

1624
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:12,800
So this kind of situation is one where he's going to need to prove his case or shut the fuk up

1625
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:17,664
You can't just say numbers about Medicare payments and they say Case Closed like improving some

1626
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
This is a disgrace

1627
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:20,224
Nonce

1628
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,576
It is never

1629
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:25,856
Too often

1630
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,904
To say how high the f******

1631
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
Mistakes are

1632
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,464
And how dangerous he

1633
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,000
This is

1634
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,536
Terrifyingly Dane

1635
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:36,608
This is a this guy is

1636
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:39,936
And somehow he's technically not committing a crime

1637
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,216
He is helping

1638
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,496
He's getting people killed

1639
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:47,360
Fox News is getting people killed President is getting people killed and somehow that's

1640
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
Fine

1641
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,688
Somehow our legal system has no

1642
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,968
No problem

1643
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:54,016
And neither do we

1644
01:36:54,272 --> 01:37:00,416
Apparently word intersect with

1645
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,440
Foundational

1646
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,768
Freedoms that we have not considered the limits of

1647
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,816
For a very long time

1648
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,376
Really had that conversation where is

1649
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
Other countries in Europe

1650
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,192
For instance have

1651
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:18,336
Are these fees real stations like a holocaust denial being illegal

1652
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:24,736
Where you recognize that your free speech rights are not absolute when there are real

1653
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:27,808
Text solid consequences

1654
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:32,160
Did that you know we understand that in terms of like you can punch

1655
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:32,928
The air

1656
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:36,000
Jeffrey way

1657
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:41,120
Consequence consequences do matter in terms of the action

1658
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,704
And I don't know I'm not sitting here saying that I support

1659
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:45,728
Like

1660
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:49,568
Understanding of free speech

1661
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:54,432
I don't think that the conversation is necessarily on Warren

1662
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:56,992
Doing now

1663
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:58,016
Is not as good as

1664
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
As other stuff that we

1665
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
We could be doing

1666
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,392
Edward not even talking about doing anything else

1667
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,464
It's possible that the perspective you're bringing is a key

1668
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:12,096
That being said

1669
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,656
It takes into account the side

1670
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:19,264
Unintended consequences of your

1671
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,824
Because it's very possible that you pulled

1672
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,616
Fred a little bit you start to realize

1673
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:26,688
There might be more severe consequences

1674
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,736
Promise that you'll realize

1675
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:32,576
I'm not saying that I have a problem it's another possible

1676
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,856
I'm not saying that I have.

1677
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:39,488
Plan to solve it right there is no way that we can look at what's going on right now and say we've done the best

1678
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
It doesn't feel like it

1679
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
It's not possible

1680
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:47,936
So Alex is talked about this

1681
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:51,264
Do you have a heart attack now they're not going to resuscitate you in that last clip

1682
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,592
That this has to do with the story that he read in New York

1683
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:00,480
Coronavirus

1684
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,320
So there you go

1685
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:11,744
So this is a great example of why I really just don't care for Alex

1686
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Much

1687
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:18,912
New York Post article with the headline New York issues do-not-resuscitate guidelines for cardiac patients

1688
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
Coronavirus

1689
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Iris

1690
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:26,848
This is about an order that was floated that emergency workers to not bother Reviving someone

1691
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,640
That person doesn't have a pulse

1692
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:32,736
Previously the sander was to try for 20 minutes

1693
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,760
To revive people

1694
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:38,880
This article cites in approximately three to four percent success rate in resuscitate

1695
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,928
EMT

1696
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,512
Which is a small number but definitely not an insignificant one

1697
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:48,096
This headline news article from April 21st

1698
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,168
By the time on April 22nd

1699
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,216
New York Post

1700
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
The headline quotes

1701
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:58,080
New York scraps do-not-resuscitate order during Coronavirus

1702
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:02,432
I know this article came out before alex.ani

1703
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:06,016
And if you covering the story he has every reason to be where this up to

1704
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:11,136
Paramedics unions were not happy with this guidance and they pushed back in the order was reversed

1705
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:17,792
The conversation about whether or not it's necessary for New York EMTs to conserve their resources to be extensive. Spend

1706
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:19,584
20 minutes trying to resuscitate patient

1707
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,608
Define without a pulse

1708
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,936
That's decidedly above my paygrade and I don't know

1709
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,472
Here's the situation

1710
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
From where I'm sitting

1711
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:30,336
How to complain about a problem that is already been solved by the time he's discussing

1712
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:33,664
He's misrepresenting and already solved the problem

1713
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,456
This is a perfect encapsulation

1714
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:36,480
Much of his career

1715
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,248
Yep

1716
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
You nailed it

1717
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:39,296
Danza

1718
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,600
Only three people voted

1719
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
Reserved

1720
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,000
We get here on the 22nd

1721
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:48,768
Episode

1722
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,816
Is Alex really

1723
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:52,608
Really keeping on swinging

1724
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:54,912
About how doctors are just

1725
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:00,032
Nurses doctors

1726
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,664
People

1727
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:10,272
Well what do you think the nurses the doctors are having a good time what are you doing what do you think we're doing

1728
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:21,024
Nobody here

1729
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,216
Nobody in the desert family

1730
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,544
They're in there having orgies ladies and gentlemen

1731
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,568
Call f******

1732
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,336
Is Family Show

1733
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,872
If this conversation happen

1734
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,152
And which I don't know if it's

1735
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:40,736
Here's how that conversation

1736
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
What are you guys doing

1737
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,344
F****** Alex what do you think we're doing

1738
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:46,368
Maybe

1739
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,928
The real thing is like

1740
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:52,512
SquarePants becomes clear

1741
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:55,072
The only thing you taking this from is

1742
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,632
His family members telling him that switch I do

1743
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,400
Don't trust

1744
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:04,032
I talked to some family that works at the biggest VA Hospital one of the biggest country Outlets

1745
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
We had one

1746
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:09,920
Guy that had a he's fine they walked everything down

1747
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,016
But overall feel victims

1748
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:18,112
Text messages

1749
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,416
Hospital

1750
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:23,744
He's a doctor he was just like no it's a

1751
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
Animal House

1752
01:42:30,656 --> 01:42:31,424
What are the most

1753
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:35,008
Doctors and nurses it's like a

1754
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:38,848
What about

1755
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,176
Party time

1756
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:48,832
Open hospitals are doing elective surgeries

1757
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:53,184
Are all happy cuz there's nobody in there

1758
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
Is ridiculous

1759
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
Contiguous

1760
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,864
Wow the function of this

1761
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:04,448
Rubius places

1762
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,728
Disinformation

1763
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,008
The function of it

1764
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
That

1765
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,592
These medical work

1766
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,432
Like the ones you saw standing in the crosswalk

1767
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:19,552
Opposing these protesters

1768
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,112
That they

1769
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,648
Are fighting back

1770
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,720
Against the open the country back up folks

1771
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:33,376
Is because they're having too much fun f****** not kidding that's Alex's near

1772
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:46,176
The house is a Rockin don't come a-knockin come on in

1773
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,992
I appreciate your call Kenny

1774
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:50,784
You stupid f****** a******

1775
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,624
That is that's the level of thinking that he's bringing to this

1776
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,160
These doctors

1777
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:58,976
Love f****** and taking pills

1778
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:05,376
They're having a great time and say these they're secretly Evan orgies in these hospitals and that's why they want the economy to

1779
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:09,216
They can f*** when they're off time

1780
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,848
I just can't like

1781
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,176
I don't think Alex actually believes

1782
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:22,016
No absolutely not a chance

1783
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,320
Who are saying to themselves

1784
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,344
Sounds true

1785
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,392
Which means they think

1786
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:29,440
The entire medical profession

1787
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,744
Is willing to

1788
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,096
Do a sacrifice everybody's f****** life so they can

1789
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,376
F*****'-a Hospital

1790
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,216
That's it

1791
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:42,496
Think about how f***

1792
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,568
What is so awful

1793
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,336
Very stupid

1794
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,360
That's just awful

1795
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:50,176
Silex complains about vaccines

1796
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:53,504
Of course they're going to be a nightmare there already

1797
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:56,320
Exactly where you'd expect it to

1798
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:07,072
Scenario from hell

1799
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:09,888
Hey

1800
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:13,216
The New World Order is out in the open

1801
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,056
Pedophiles convicted your school to mount your kids underneath

1802
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:24,480
Obsolete

1803
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:27,808
Thomas Jefferson was asked once in a letter v

1804
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,624
Virginia

1805
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:33,696
Legislature they ever f****** a hospital

1806
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:38,560
What is the limit of tyranny

1807
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,216
Always

1808
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
Fresno

1809
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,800
Limit

1810
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:49,824
The black hole

1811
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,176
Thomas Jefferson quote I was actually a Frederick Douglass

1812
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,456
Repurposing

1813
01:45:55,712 --> 01:46:01,856
Yep we have one last episode I don't believe that the 22nd is nearly as

1814
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,136
Has the 21st

1815
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:05,952
There is there's a little bit of stuff in it

1816
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,000
And I might not have

1817
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,024
Really

1818
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,840
Ben is interested in covering at

1819
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,656
Because of the psychodrama

1820
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,936
Far more interesting

1821
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:17,216
Alex's just like

1822
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,240
He also

1823
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,544
What are the reasons I decided to

1824
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,592
Include both of these episodes is because

1825
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,360
Concede

1826
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:26,432
How different is mood is from day-to-day

1827
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:30,528
F*** this I hate this show this is stupid we all deserve to burn on the first day

1828
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:34,112
How the next day July Infowars as usual

1829
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:34,880
Clock

1830
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:36,928
The choosing doctors of having this

1831
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:38,720
Spirit see where they just want to f***

1832
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,768
Enter scamming Medicare Bonnie

1833
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,560
Goddamnit right

1834
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:46,400
And then the second reason that I decided to cover this episode is

1835
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
Because

1836
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,704
Something that Alex says at the end

1837
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,984
And is very important

1838
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,568
The Attorney General

1839
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,360
That would take hours to go into 18

1840
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,664
Doing the right thing

1841
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:03,040
Mark all stay-at-home orders

1842
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,064
House arrest

1843
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:08,928
So now Bill Barr has said something that Alex likes

1844
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,464
So looks like he's a good guy

1845
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,000
Whose phone is this game

1846
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:14,560
Who can forget Alex's Show from

1847
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:17,632
And Steve

1848
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,400
Bacon

1849
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:20,192
Trump to fire William Barr

1850
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:25,824
Because Bari come out say the Trump tweeting about the doj recommendation for Rodger Stones trial

1851
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,104
And sentencing was not

1852
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:27,872
Cool

1853
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,152
They were on the warpath

1854
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:35,552
Alex even went so far as to bring up the fact that there is a Jeffrey Epstein connection with William Barr

1855
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:38,880
We know that attorney general Barr has really come out against the

1856
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:42,208
Some people are saying that it's a lie

1857
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,256
Kabuki

1858
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,816
To get Democrat

1859
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,608
Attorney General

1860
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,656
I don't send that stone to an exorbitant amount

1861
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:51,936
Yeah no s***

1862
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,032
Is a smart guy

1863
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,200
Not the lawyer bureaucracy but beautiful

1864
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:05,760
Military

1865
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,296
Those areas

1866
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Call the lieutenant colonel

1867
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
Bar

1868
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,928
Michelle today

1869
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,888
Because of the pedigree of

1870
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,680
You know bar

1871
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,472
Is up to his eyeballs

1872
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:36,224
The list of reasons why Alex should super f****** hate William Barr is a very long one

1873
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:42,880
Republican report on April 15th specifically victims families from access to

1874
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,696
The FBI Files the promise to open

1875
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:50,816
Sing the even discussing why he can't release these files would be a threat to National Security

1876
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:57,472
For someone like Alex who made his career on 9-11 conspiracy theories this should sound a lot like someone

1877
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
Aging in a cover-up

1878
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:03,872
Don't even bring the story up

1879
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,664
It's looking like he's real

1880
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:11,808
Plenty of examples about this why I should hate it but this one's particularly funny for me

1881
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:16,160
Alex's primary identity in his early career was a 9-11 truther

1882
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:20,512
That's being completely subjugated to his need to be a blind Trump follower

1883
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:24,608
It's really sad to see where this at this road he's on his leg

1884
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:27,680
It's led to repudiation and rejection of self

1885
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,728
Oh also

1886
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,544
William Barr was the Attorney General under George

1887
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:38,944
H.w. Bush during the Ruby Ridge standoff

1888
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,224
Movement in the 90s

1889
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:44,320
And he's questionnaire that he had to answer for his Trump confirmation

1890
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,600
Barr says quote

1891
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,648
I spent approximately 80 hours

1892
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:49,696
Is organizing a toy

1893
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:51,744
Attorneys General

1894
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,304
To support an FBI sniper in Defender

1895
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:58,144
Gets criminal charges in connection with the Ruby Ridge incident in Idaho

1896
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:04,800
I am listed a law firm to work pro bono on the case and assisted in framing legal arguments advanced in the amakai

1897
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,080
In the district

1898
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:09,920
And the subsequent appeal in the night circus

1899
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:12,224
That's nice

1900
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,296
Defend was the person who shot Randy Weaver's wife

1901
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:17,600
While she was holding her infant child

1902
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:19,136
William Barr should be a villain.

1903
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:19,904
The highest order

1904
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:24,512
Alex

1905
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:31,168
She looks like he's real after all this principal list

1906
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
Tyler Shipp

1907
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:38,336
And for all the reasons that he needs to be off air for like for his own effect that he has on the public at

1908
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,360
The danger to people

1909
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,152
He also needs to be off air

1910
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,176
For his own

1911
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:42,944
Good

1912
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,992
He is he is

1913
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:46,528
Exactly

1914
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:48,832
The opposite of what he pretends to be

1915
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,856
1/10

1916
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,880
Care about all these

1917
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:53,440
Did this Patriot right wing world

1918
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
Even

1919
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:57,792
According to that he's a f****** sellout piece of s***

1920
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:01,120
So go f*** yourself Alex you should be telling yourself

1921
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:03,168
You're a pile of s***

1922
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:03,936
You should be looking

1923
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:04,704
Dick in the mirror

1924
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,008
And really wrestling with the fact

1925
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:08,800
Happy you're defending William Barr

1926
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,080
Go fuc

1927
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:14,176
Yourself you'll pretending to have any connection to that militia world

1928
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,968
If you if you had even a

1929
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:16,736
Colonel

1930
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:23,648
You never be able to the entire time but there's been this will-they-won't-they with William Barr he should have all

1931
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,696
It'll always be

1932
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,256
That should have been disqualified the second

1933
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,048
F****** Trump

1934
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:34,144
Attorney General

1935
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,680
I know this guy

1936
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:40,544
I know this guy because you know what the FBI or the villains of Ruby Ridge

1937
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:43,104
And you know who the FBI reports to

1938
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:46,176
Attorney general who runs the Department of Justice

1939
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,968
William f****** bar

1940
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,248
I'm sorry I'm getting

1941
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:53,088
Do your nails look like

1942
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,392
Look at his entire existence is

1943
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:57,184
Such a

1944
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,208
Rejection

1945
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,488
That was cheap

1946
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,512
Pretends to be

1947
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:02,304
And

1948
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,584
And it's just

1949
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,888
You're done you're done

1950
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:07,168
You've done your

1951
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,192
You've done your work

1952
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,984
What you thought you were doing Alex

1953
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008
And now

1954
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:15,872
You have disgraced yourself who who who

1955
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,664
You've become the villain

1956
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,968
Even to your own feeling this world

1957
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,248
It's almost

1958
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:22,016
Looks like

1959
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:26,112
Terrible and every moment

1960
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Is torture

1961
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:30,976
Hate to quote Thomas Jefferson

1962
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:35,840
This actually ends with Alex has an interview with a

1963
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,376
Torba from Gab

1964
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:41,216
It's really funny because Alex has he has a massive huge announcement

1965
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,288
His massive announcement is the he hates them

1966
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:50,432
And the Gap is coming out with their own version of zoo

1967
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,712
Is it called

1968
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,880
It's about something that doesn't exist

1969
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:02,208
Alex's the David

1970
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,232
Like click

1971
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,256
Stop

1972
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:09,888
God know I don't know I don't know what's going to happen

1973
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:12,704
Been in the immediate future

1974
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:17,056
Surprised to see Alex take the rest of this week off

1975
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:19,360
You know take Friday probably Sunday off

1976
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,408
I don't know we'll see what happens but I am

1977
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,944
I'll be keeping an eye on it

1978
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:24,736
Lookout because

1979
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,504
You know what

1980
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:31,392
So we'll be back at the Seltzer marches forward

1981
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,416
The court has promised

1982
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:35,744
The beginning of the show I have a rating for the 11 cello what's that

1983
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:36,768
80 Audobon

1984
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:43,168
80 out of 100 continues to be good as far as you drink

1985
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,960
All right till lower than the

1986
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:46,240
Coffee but extinct

1987
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:52,640
Mostly the surprise I think of it

1988
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,552
Excited

1989
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:02,624
It wasn't a one-off

1990
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:07,744
We'll be back with more seltzer

1991
