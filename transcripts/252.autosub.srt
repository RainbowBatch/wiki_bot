1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
Jordan

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,200
What's your favorite Brendan Fraser

5
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,040
I don't know

6
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:29,440
Monkeybone Monkeybone

7
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,048
We ruined a man's career in that man's more than one

8
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Container underground career the moment you discovered Coke so almost entire Studio

9
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,728
Expensive

10
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
I worked at a movie theater when that came out

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,616
It was one of the best

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
It was

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
Billed as like

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,760
Aside from the director of Nightmare Before Christmas

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,856
Except

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
That's right

17
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
Like everybody came into the theater

18
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Like opening night

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Cubone weather like

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,496
I'm real excited about for this 2-Burner I got bad news

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
Remember how good the director did

22
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,968
Nightmare Before Christmas

23
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,576
We're not going to start giving producers all kinds of credit for

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
Amarillo

25
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,144
Like five years I never saw anything like that again like

26
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
Universal

27
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
Anger coming out of a speaker

28
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:50,080
The f*** are you there for the Phantom

29
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
I might have not been working

30
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
The theater at the

31
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
No I was there for a very short.

32
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,416
There's a huge mess

33
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:10,304
Hopefully you were fired twice and rehired

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,864
Anteater

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,264
Delirious more disappointed

36
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,080
I think so experienced

37
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,408
I don't remember hating

38
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,016
Sorry my finger Brendan Fraser movie it actually watch The Mummy like

39
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,832
Batman 3 hours ago

40
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
I would say

41
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
More disappointed by

42
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:38,976
I expect

43
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,512
Go to be disappointed by it

44
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,888
The expectation was too high

45
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,496
We're going to be disappointed

46
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Everybody mad

47
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Monkeybone

48
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
You knew that going in

49
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Visceral

50
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
Rage

51
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
Loved it

52
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,064
The inverse of that was like on the open

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Midnight for rollerball movie with LL Cool J

54
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,024
A big group of people dead

55
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
No one ever came to worth

56
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
Cedar dressed up

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
There were a couple people

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:28,640
Big group of people came out

59
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:33,248
They were so cool

60
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,576
Remember that as Lex Luthor the reverse of the monkey bone thing

61
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,368
Exuberant

62
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,464
Holyshit if we could go back in time I would make a documentary called roller ballers

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
And it's just about those people who drowned in the

64
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,728
We were the junior varsity theater

65
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:59,616
Anyway Jordan is a show where I know a lot about our correct

66
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:06,016
Interesting 2009 episode to go over 82 be a map

67
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,136
Mercilessly

68
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
He is I've been trying to warn

69
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Qualify

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
Do a little bit more of that

71
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
We do something I'd rather do

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
I don't

73
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:25,727
So first today I'd like to say thank you

74
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,871
Next up Morgan thank you so much

75
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,455
I'm a policy wonk

76
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:44,159
Let's find out

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
You are now a policy wonk

78
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
Is actually an ancient Sumerian and

79
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
Gilgamesh both hattaway

80
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
Okay then

81
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,311
Next

82
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Finally

83
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,063
I don't know how to pronounce this next travel

84
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
Technical difficulties

85
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,839
Supposed to show

86
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
I do that by going to our website knowledge fight.com

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,727
Oh yes please

88
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:34,591
We're going over the span of April 7th

89
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
2009

90
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,711
We're going to go ahead

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Through the 7th

92
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
Because it is

93
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,903
2009

94
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
He just talked to Mike Rivero about a bunch of bulshit

95
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
How many interviews the lady

96
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
Whose son was

97
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
The guy who got decapitated on the Greyhound bus

98
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,727
And it's gross

99
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:07,615
Expletive

100
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,479
Perkasie and stuff like that

101
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,503
Piece of it where Alex

102
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,807
It's a gross interview and it doesn't seem

103
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
Fit in with anything that Alex talks about

104
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
Novel piece of his

105
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,559
Right he's not trying to

106
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
This guy out to be

107
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
An immigrant killer he's not trying to

108
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
There's none of the normal rhetoric except for stuff about like

109
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Demonizing mental illness

110
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:42,431
But it's definitely not worth going

111
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
Through that jump in on the 8th

112
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Because I think the 8th

113
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:47,551
Is one of the most

114
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Important

115
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
But we will have ever covered

116
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,415
Terms of our entire podcast

117
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,487
Hey before we explain why

118
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,023
Here are a couple out of context

119
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
Text drops from Today Show

120
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
In the first one

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,863
Kind of describes my life

122
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:20,063
I think

123
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,879
Goodbye

124
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:27,743
More you look into the abyss Abyss looks back at you

125
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,631
That's dangerous

126
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,655
Rhetorical question

127
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,447
He doesn't want to dance

128
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
Weird mood on the 8th

129
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,879
Your own radio show is to just

130
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,671
Ask a Giant like

131
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207
Does anybody like me here

132
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
Anybody anybody hear it all

133
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,351
No yeah well see that was in response to

134
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
That whole

135
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,447
Jaguar assertive in the response to a caller calls in

136
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,287
Overdrive extra hour

137
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
The show

138
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:23,295
Calls backed up and wants to talk

139
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
So the first is a guy who's

140
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,487
This entire episode you've been talking about this article in the eight

141
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,583
AP about how Obama is admitting that they're doing chemtrails

142
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
But if you go look at that article doesn't say that

143
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
I like you and I want

144
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:47,359
Help get your message out to my friends and stuff like that but you were literally saying something that isn't true

145
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,711
All them to go check this out they're going to see it that's not true that's hurting

146
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,527
So f****** defensive

147
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:59,903
So that leads

148
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Wow

149
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,535
That's why you weren't over

150
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Oh man that's so sad

151
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,935
That's so sad.

152
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
You're you're a great man you're doing great things

153
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
I don't want to

154
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
I love you

155
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:23,199
I'm out of that love I tell you that you are lying about this b*******

156
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Change it

157
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,879
That way when you tell the truth I can tell more of my friends and they'll tell more of their friends

158
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
That you're right and it said he throws a tantrum like a little baby

159
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
Is there word not the rest of this episode I would like to just listen to that whole 20 minute

160
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,703
Because Alex just

161
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Do you like

162
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
Are For Less just like

163
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,431
Why I'm right all the time

164
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,503
Awesome

165
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
But

166
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Jordan today's episode

167
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:01,855
Is going to

168
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,159
Tubi

169
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Big it's going to be very important

170
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,791
Byb

171
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
I need to make one

172
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Very

173
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,607
Caveat

174
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
The main substance

175
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
Today's

176
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:21,311
We've got a lot of

177
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,871
There is going to be

178
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,431
What episode did I can tell you what's going on

179
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,063
Speculation

180
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,159
I want to give that warning ahead of time and we will do our best to call out

181
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
What is what

182
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,231
But I don't want to mislead anybody

183
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,255
Who's listening

184
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
As we go through it

185
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
To think that we have a

186
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,119
Affirm conclusion

187
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,191
Or that we're directly say

188
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,519
Right

189
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,079
We're not right

190
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
We not

191
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:01,759
I don't know I don't know how to say this other than to say

192
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,039
Alex Jones

193
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Parlance

194
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,159
Seminoma closure of the parlance

195
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,023
Will point us to this

196
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,119
Aeon gut circumstantial

197
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
No

198
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,775
We will say our gut says this is probably true but we don't

199
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,543
Because we can't

200
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:30,175
There's got their circumstantial evidence coincidence

201
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Together

202
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,991
How those things

203
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,831
Lead us to the conclusion

204
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
See that this is the conclusion exactly

205
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,207
Totally clear lest anyone

206
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Wrong idea

207
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Because a lot of his stuff is

208
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,279
Is pretty important

209
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,303
Copper

210
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
And at the same time

211
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Really f*****

212
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:54,495
Here's where we start we're going to jump in about 20 minutes into the April 8th

213
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
2009 episodes

214
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
And the reason we're not going to listen to

215
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
The beginning

216
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,127
Is because it's just a continuation

217
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:00,895
Mission of Alex's

218
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
Random

219
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
Random fun

220
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:06,783
Be blamed for shooting

221
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
About the idea that

222
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,439
That newspapers are pointing out that the guy who did the shooting

223
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:17,535
Was a regular commenter on his rhetoric

224
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
Yeah but you look at the comments

225
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,887
Mets

226
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,191
That's sort of his defense of Our Truth

227
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,031
You can see how

228
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
There is an argument

229
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
Make it so

230
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Because he does like

231
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,639
Just doesn't think you hate

232
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Right

233
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Complaints were

234
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,247
Which is

235
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,807
Not necessarily indications

236
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,343
The guy was against salary

237
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:46,463
Text B weird criteria

238
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,279
I think you're great guy I think you're right on most

239
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
But you just don't

240
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,095
Turn off so we can talk

241
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,423
I'm sorry

242
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,823
I'm sorry you don't think that's a win-win for me

243
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,407
So that's most of the beginning of the episode

244
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:08,479
And then about 25 minutes and Alex says something

245
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,183
Directly attacked by George Soros

246
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Diasorin

247
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,919
Hardcore people

248
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
So

249
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
We have Alex

250
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,551
Not only

251
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,087
That he's being attacked

252
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Pittsburgh shooting

253
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:48,415
He doesn't want that

254
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Beyond

255
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,119
He's adding in Soros today

256
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Which is something that

257
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
We have never seen

258
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,727
On April 2nd

259
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,519
2009

260
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,567
Alex brought up Media Matters

261
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:08,127
He said that it was run by David Brock

262
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,735
Doesn't mention Soros at all this is a new piece of rhetoric

263
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Being introduced here

264
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,807
George Soros runs Media Matters

265
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:20,415
April 8th April

266
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,951
Mirror days

267
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,719
After

268
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
Alex Jones

269
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Talked about Media Matters

270
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,815
David Brock

271
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
No mention

272
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Up until this point

273
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,167
Tolerance

274
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,567
3 mentions a caller said something

275
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:43,199
Talking about Soros so far

276
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,599
I'm not sure and I think that's an exploration that I will drive this afternoon

277
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,367
Quite frankly

278
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
But I should say

279
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,207
The point out that

280
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,255
Like if it was just that

281
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,791
It was just Alex being like

282
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,679
I don't think that I would be all that interested

283
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
Necessarily cover

284
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
Bring this much to the

285
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:11,359
To the preceding

286
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,639
But unfortunate

287
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:14,175
How expensive

288
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Pretty much the in

289
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Entire show

290
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
Taking swings

291
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,319
Okay in a way that I would describe as over

292
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Like Ethan saying

293
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:26,975
Here is another clip between he's in overdrive

294
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,303
Super famous

295
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,839
He's going to blow up

296
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,119
And the George Soros

297
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
He's trying to destroy

298
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,663
Because that's the Final Fear

299
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,903
Didn't mention Soros by name in that clip

300
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,695
But that's the external context

301
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
He was talking about

302
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
The for the

303
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,047
Started

304
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:08,191
About to become very popular and much more he's going to see a rise

305
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
His stature

306
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Confidence

307
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,567
Concrete

308
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
Statements

309
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,639
That does not sound like our usual both

310
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,479
He doesn't begin it with and I don't mean to brag

311
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:26,879
I've been holding back some kind of super strong guy and I've been holding back my popular

312
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,671
He says I'm about

313
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
To become super

314
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,559
Pivots to saying that George Soros hates

315
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,607
I mean that's specifically

316
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:41,215
Like a lot of Bragg's

317
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Place in life

318
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
Position it's always

319
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
The present day

320
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
Not I'm

321
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,383
About to be

322
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
Because I'm stopping holding back yeah yeah or whatever

323
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,271
Anybody was holding back was this knowledge about George Soros

324
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,855
I think that he would Clearly say that on the episode

325
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Revealing besoros is

326
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,535
Which probably would cut off most of my criticisms

327
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:08,607
Because that'll be like

328
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,167
I don't believe you

329
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,447
But at least you're making

330
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
Everything

331
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
He's doing it

332
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:20,383
In such a way is it

333
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
It really just feels

334
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Unnatural

335
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
It feels like a drawing

336
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Shift

337
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Mechanical

338
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
Different direction because

339
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:33,183
We've been spending months and months listening to

340
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:38,815
His walk through 2019 never talked about Soros

341
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Rothschild

342
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,031
You know any famous Jews and that this is

343
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Of a departure

344
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
It's so much

345
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
And we're not nearly done

346
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,639
Like

347
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Quick question

348
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Do we have any concrete

349
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,271
Kind of like

350
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
Range where the

351
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
Soros being the big battle

352
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
We're going to get into all of that

353
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Throughout the course of this

354
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
I'm really trying to make this a quick episode

355
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
It's a little more complicated than being able to eat solid released

356
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
What when you get into the

357
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
Complexities

358
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
So there is that

359
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:36,671
That's a very ever ever said

360
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,511
Annoying

361
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,327
I'm going to wake up in about

362
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,119
3 a.m. this morning just be like

363
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,239
It was a great and I hate it

364
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,127
His history

365
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Axl Rose

366
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:20,447
I was reading today

367
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,519
So he was reading things that Soros said they were going

368
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
To do for years

369
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
Now that's

370
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,407
You know

371
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,271
Actually what's amazing about that is that in rewriting his own history you see the first draft

372
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
What do you mean

373
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
I'm still angry at the invitation is Never As Good As the original

374
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,191
Soros's writing

375
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
And stuff like this for

376
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
4 years

377
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,007
What's led him to be able to

378
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
Nobody knows

379
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,847
No that's

380
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,127
The way you presented

381
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:02,943
Not

382
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Eonline

383
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
His own

384
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
Aversion of his

385
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:11,135
Especially considering either means

386
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,951
Started looking into Soros

387
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
That all of the stuff that he has been studying so far

388
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Has actually been

389
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Introducing Soros

390
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,567
World

391
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Like I would say if she got on it was like my research

392
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,687
Sound

393
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,831
But instead

394
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
Pretending that all of these things are

395
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:43,903
About

396
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,743
Every episode up till this point

397
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,047
He's he's in media res

398
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,071
Restart

399
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,631
He's hitting the ground running

400
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,423
Yeah

401
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,983
Weird that I have to stress like we're not going

402
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
To listen to

403
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,031
A lot of the stuff on the 7th

404
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,311
But it's not like I'm hiding

405
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Yep talkabouttd

406
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
I'm just a little defense

407
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,247
What about the idea

408
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,087
Showing all my work

409
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,159
I highly doubt

410
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,184
Still in high school

411
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Now is you know talking

412
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
In about

413
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,680
Right and I think it is probably good too

414
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,704
Point this out

415
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
He's making a lot of wide-ranging

416
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,128
You just a tiny bit

417
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
If that was what you were saying he's reading Services writing

418
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,712
Forever

419
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:43,552
That's not really implied by what he's saying these documents

420
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,648
Soros

421
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,464
Holy

422
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
But I just want to

423
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,512
Totally clear

424
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,048
Of course

425
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,352
So it's a wide-ranging

426
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Weather

427
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
IMS

428
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Documents

429
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Takeovers

430
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Or

431
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,080
But he's already thrown around.

432
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
To be there

433
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
The Media Matters bar

434
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
They complain about Alex

435
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
He's trying to

436
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Deflect criticism

437
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Themselves

438
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,272
So there is that as a sort of

439
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Motivation

440
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,832
But it still doesn't

441
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
The question why is the tap

442
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,672
Absolutely

443
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:22,976
The question becomes

444
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Complicated

445
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
See how far rain

446
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
Complaints that he has

447
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,912
I can make a $200,000

448
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,704
Free

449
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,152
Take showers

450
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,712
Seems like you

451
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,600
You think George Soros who spent his own hard-earned money to put Barack Obama in the pacify the left

452
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
I don't know

453
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Bacares

454
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,352
Hussar

455
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,888
The Obama Deception

456
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,472
Is that what you say I thought you said

457
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:08,032
I didn't realize it cuz the way that the center

458
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,080
It's kind of structure made it sound like

459
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,664
Does Soros talk about us like that

460
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,688
Sting the last I spoke

461
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,016
Which he's actually talking about

462
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,808
Thesaurus talked about the Obama.

463
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:27,232
Rose doesn't put out the documentary The Obama Deception okay

464
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,256
NetSpend

465
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
Somebody's got it

466
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Grammar

467
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
Attorney General

468
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Firearms

469
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,672
Real

470
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,792
You established George Soros Finance people

471
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:04,096
Does anybody

472
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Robin trying to stop

473
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:12,800
I like

474
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,712
I don't have some romantic

475
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,320
So he's saying the Soros is going to precipitate a Civil War by

476
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,112
You people these funding

477
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,464
All of the people out there in the media that Alex doesn't like all of these people

478
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,024
You know pushing the ideas that Alex is opposed

479
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,632
Soros ownership of so much

480
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
He didn't give him ownership up before

481
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
This is a drastic

482
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,032
Departure point

483
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:44,800
For Alex

484
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
I don't know how much

485
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,688
Keeps this up in the episodes after this episode

486
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
Is a very harsh document of

487
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Alex going

488
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:00,928
Real f****** hard on

489
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
We're going to try and contextualized

490
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:06,816
The media landscape

491
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584
50 seasons

492
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Which is there zika

493
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:09,888
Controlled

494
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
People on the left

495
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Can I control people on

496
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,472
Wearing

497
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,264
Like Rush Limbaugh is in charge of the

498
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
The right

499
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
George soros's

500
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
Charge

501
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,176
Find out about another media organization

502
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,200
His own devices

503
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,768
Air America

504
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:55,200
Lionel is I don't know

505
00:25:55,456 --> 00:26:00,064
Thoros wants to put Lionel on Airport I don't know

506
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,624
Theme song

507
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Who gives a s***

508
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
The power base

509
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,768
Yeah

510
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,072
In the world

511
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,096
Amanda

512
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Explicitly

513
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,912
Text clip that cirrhosis

514
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,056
George Soros Foundation

515
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,896
Other weird name for a foundation

516
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,488
Implantation

517
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,864
Hi I exposed the only conclusion I can draw from this

518
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
Is that

519
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:53,824
We're right around season 3 or season 4 and they realize they had to introduce

520
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,880
You have a situation where

521
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
Like I don't know

522
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,024
Negotiating salary

523
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,608
Rothschild

524
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,680
Propaganda

525
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:25,056
Robert Downey jr. hadn't signed on for The Avengers the whole thing could have gone crazy

526
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
Could have

527
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:27,616
So even exploit

528
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:31,200
About a whole bunch even already on this episode

529
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Is the idea that Alex

530
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,064
Of guys

531
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
That he likes

532
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Rothschild's Rockwell

533
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
What have you

534
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:42,208
And it's next clip I just regular horses

535
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:43,744
I believe

536
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Is Alex Jones

537
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,584
Initiating Soros

538
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,352
Into that group

539
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,448
What can happen if Mexico collapses

540
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,800
There's Dead Cops all over the place military all over the place

541
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,384
Marching around going to take people's guns in the middle all this

542
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:14,976
Breakdown of society

543
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,784
Is George Soros and David Rockefeller a zbigniew Brzezinski

544
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:45,440
Benedict newborn is brazinski

545
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,216
Leave starting an amaryllis little bit

546
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
To cause the Civil War

547
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
Lendup

548
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
Blood in the streets

549
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:06,944
People's guns

550
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,272
Soros is now high-level

551
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:15,648
He has he's up there with the elite of the globalist

552
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,672
Before

553
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:19,744
Like a tertiary a****** but Alex

554
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,096
Alex

555
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:28,704
Which position on how Alex's

556
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
Describe cirrhosis

557
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
This point

558
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
I would describe it basically as like

559
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
A guy

560
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:37,920
Is to Frankie

561
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,272
Annabelle

562
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,112
He has been like

563
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
Was talking about how

564
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,952
The price of oil going down

565
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
Be bad for Russia

566
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Videos applying Soros

567
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
Evil plan

568
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
Then on this show he's absolutely doing

569
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Yes

570
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,752
Specific complaint

571
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
About him

572
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,312
I can track

573
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Like this one

574
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:12,736
George Soros

575
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:15,808
I'm having a very good crisis is Soros

576
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:22,464
George Soros went on to say it is the culmination

577
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,536
My life's work and has been very stimulating

578
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:26,816
At the club

579
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:34,240
These major sites attack including Media Matters

580
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
And he's coming out

581
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,824
Vicious attack

582
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,480
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

583
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,880
Oh my gosh Alex Jones had the white supremacist after him actually the cop killer

584
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,672
Disagree with

585
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
So that's the thing I was talking about earlier

586
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,048
Attractive

587
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,656
Press conference

588
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Just read the headline

589
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
There's a bad paraphrase

590
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,568
Quoting out of context

591
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,176
2009

592
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
2009

593
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,528
In a way the culminating point of My Life Works

594
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,344
But he's not talking about causing the crisis or even

595
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
Just to question

596
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,184
Prior in the interview

597
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,488
Sores that indicated that he doesn't

598
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,560
Too much of his time focusing on the minutiae of financial sector

599
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
At this point

600
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
Student focusing on Paula

601
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,704
The interview interview

602
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,496
What sort of policy

603
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,032
Twitch Doris reply

604
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,848
The financial crisis and how to solve it

605
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,128
Wendy's

606
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
The culmination of his wife

607
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,968
He's talkin about all the writing

608
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:50,272
Exploring how the theory of reflexivity

609
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,040
Teresa

610
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
And you could be used

611
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,576
Sfix

612
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,904
This is absolutely 100%

613
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,232
Interview or intentionally lying about it

614
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,840
To quote quote about him having a

615
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,888
Enterprise

616
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,448
This is really more about how he predicted

617
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
Crash and better

618
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,008
Also

619
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
He warned people of what he saw comic

620
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,616
You publicly predicted it wasn't like

621
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
He kept the information to himself and profited off

622
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,552
Also hear really funny line in that interview about how the mainstream Financial experts had predicted

623
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,344
Three out of the last seven bubble

624
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
But he was better

625
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,440
Cuz he predicted seven out of the last three

626
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:33,024
Poking fun at the fact that he had wrongly predicted bubbles multiple times

627
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:37,120
He shows that great aplomb

628
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Zipperhead

629
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:42,240
Is that in that interview when he's asked about solution

630
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
He literally advocates

631
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,336
Greater restrictions and regulations on selling

632
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
Which is one of the

633
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Instrument to use to make

634
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Make his money

635
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,712
He's advocating for a solution that is opposed

636
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,480
His own self in

637
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
There is nothing in this interview

638
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
That isn't

639
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,832
Indicative

640
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
But he caused

641
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,392
This crash

642
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,696
The crash part of it outside

643
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
Being sort of

644
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,048
At least in some ways evidence that the

645
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,608
In the market

646
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,376
Is something

647
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,448
Which has been hit

648
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:15,264
Interviews I've read with him he cops

649
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,032
To like

650
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,128
Yep I'm I made a mistake on that one and I wonder things

651
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:24,224
They're dear like if you make a mistake

652
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Holden

653
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,320
That you put forth

654
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:34,720
Be just because it was your plan he should coach an NFL team you know what I'm saying

655
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:43,936
No references on my car

656
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:49,568
How much about my friend Kyle Erza's from Kansas City don't worry about it

657
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,384
But my point is that I think that when you

658
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Read actual interviews

659
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:54,944
George Soros

660
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
Most frequently

661
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:00,832
Is a humility about himself a sense of humor about his own position

662
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:06,976
Any place in the world

663
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
He doesn't

664
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,560
If you actually read his words

665
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,608
All the books that he's written

666
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
He doesn't fit the

667
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:16,192
The picture that the right wing

668
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:16,960
Media puss

669
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
Course not

670
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
No

671
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,360
Easy to present yourself well in interviews and still be a dick

672
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,152
There's plenty of examples of that

673
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Do that

674
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
I don't

675
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
I don't know I need more evidence

676
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
These people want to really demonized

677
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,072
More advantageous to the right for him to

678
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
Forthright

679
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,936
Self-aware

680
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
Somewhat humble and have a sense of humor about himself

681
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,848
In that then he becomes such an easy target to attack

682
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,224
True colors you can make up everything about a guy who is humble and self-aware

683
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:04,576
Tunics that but it's interesting that most of the stuff where he's actually caught

684
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,600
To like

685
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,392
You know I was wrong

686
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,464
Red one interviewer he's talking about how he tried to set up a

687
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Foundation

688
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
Former soap

689
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Hrblock

690
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:18,400
And we're pushing for reforming X Direction

691
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,704
And he got pushed back from the

692
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Realized

693
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
He was going about

694
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Because he wasn't taking it

695
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
Local customs

696
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:32,992
Greater culture

697
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,272
Of that country

698
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,296
And so like

699
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:41,696
Wait till he was ignorant of something and then you learn more about it and there is nothing

700
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Is that

701
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,936
But I've never seen

702
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
That I only see

703
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
These lies

704
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,800
He intentionally

705
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,640
Nazi collaborator

706
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
Core stuff like that

707
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
It's never a never seen

708
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
TV like

709
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
Diversion conversation about

710
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,648
Conversation

711
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,696
It'll be interesting

712
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,024
I don't know it's

713
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,792
Crazy

714
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,376
Alex talks about how you calling for

715
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Thesauruses

716
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
Andy says something

717
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
That I think

718
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:28,800
Red flags

719
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,664
I have George Soros who's having a great time

720
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Many other nations

721
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
Kenzo doing that

722
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:46,208
That's an interesting thing for Alex to say

723
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,560
In the time since Alex has been talking about George Soros

724
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,864
Used as a scapegoat

725
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
Whenever there's something happening

726
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
In the world that runs

727
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,936
Counter to Russian

728
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,800
For instance in 2017 Macedonia was in a little bit of a

729
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,712
This wasn't the whole story obviously but a piece of it was that Macedonia was in the process of being brought into the

730
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
You which is bad news

731
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,600
Because Macedonia is home to the very important to know

732
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:20,768
Reply okay

733
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
Congressman

734
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,192
Text Allison about how open Society

735
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
What's romantic Discord in Macedonia

736
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,312
Control

737
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,872
Much of this was based on information

738
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,688
Being put out by a group called stop operation Soros

739
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
From an article in Politico

740
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,344
Quotes the Macedonian politicians in an Allied group operations

741
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,648
Denied any direct Russian role in their effort

742
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,560
One of the founders of stop operation Soros cuz

743
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:00,192
Noticed a virtual Army of Boston troll posting about Mass demonstrations against Soros

744
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
That never actually

745
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
We happened

746
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:07,616
Also in 2017 Viktor Orban prime minister of Hungary

747
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,920
Began targeting Soros and blaming him

748
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,968
Described as an invasion of immigrants

749
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,760
Which were precipitating

750
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
A great replacement

751
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Shifting the

752
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
It should be noted that Orban is not a cool.

753
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:24,512
In speech that he gave at the valve 80s summer

754
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Free University

755
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,096
2014 he literally said quote

756
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,656
Constructing hungry

757
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,680
Illiberal state

758
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
A non-liberal state

759
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,008
It does not reject

760
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:36,800
Principles of liberalism

761
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,848
And I can list a few more

762
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,640
Ideology

763
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,944
Central Elementary State organization

764
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
So he's not so much

765
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,784
Graduation

766
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,344
I don't suppose graduation as a student

767
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:55,488
But some sort that is not a real raspy

768
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,096
Do whatever you want

769
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,888
Work Rihanna

770
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Freedom.

771
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
We like freedom but not as an absolute or a central idea

772
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,920
Let's pump the brakes on freedom it's a good fourth priority

773
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
We can agree that without

774
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
Freedom being fundamental lights.

775
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Freedom

776
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,624
It's not

777
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:28,512
Diametrically opposed

778
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:30,048
Open the central

779
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
European University of Budapest

780
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:33,376
And pay for scholarships

781
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,400
For promising students

782
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
College

783
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:40,800
Which ironically was a recipient of a 1989

784
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,992
Goddamnit we can't teach the evils

785
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:52,320
The Aurora Center is a charity organization in hunger

786
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,112
Angostura

787
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
You've been here

788
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Giving them some fun day

789
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,560
The guardian

790
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,424
The Aurora Center was set up in 2014 and act as a kind of Coalition of the

791
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,240
Housing the offices of non-governmental organization

792
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,520
Network on Jewish issues

793
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,616
Romo is lgbtq rights migrants drug

794
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,944
The proceeds from an on-site bar and regular

795
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,736
Go to sports

796
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,784
And the center's initial funding

797
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:23,808
Skateparks

798
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,576
From Soros

799
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,600
Last month

800
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,136
A group of far-right activists

801
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
The face the outside of the building

802
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,440
Spray painting

803
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:31,488
Stop operation Soros

804
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
On the pavement

805
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:37,120
And Plastering photographed with a red cross stuck through it on the doorway

806
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,032
In 2018 orban's government literally stopped Soros

807
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,688
It's literally stopped

808
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,808
Which great bailiff is called figuratively stop Soros

809
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Literally

810
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Restricted nongovernmental organizations

811
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:02,208
From being able to assist immigrants in Asylum

812
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,744
Solsource with

813
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Withdrew open Society from the country

814
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Central Europe

815
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
University Audi

816
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:11,168
Which is a US

817
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,192
Accredited universe

818
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
So cool

819
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
You see these are pretty good indicators of the sort

820
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,848
Scapegoating Soros in the more recent

821
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,408
But it doesn't help our purposes here because

822
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,712
After 2009

823
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:27,552
What we need to do is find out who a Zagg cover

824
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Toys R Us

825
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,112
Positions before that

826
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,160
So we can see who I'll just talk

827
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:37,280
It should come as no surprise to anyone that the only relevant country Alex

828
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,680
Can be talking about is Russia

829
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:49,056
From November on November 7th 2003 article

830
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:53,919
Templar skladman is for staff to leave the Moscow offices of the open Society

831
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,711
2000 it by us billionaire

832
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
George Soros

833
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
At least Thirty men stormed the offices

834
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
These computers and documents in the rain

835
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,367
Which began late on Thursday

836
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,951
Who's playing the doors about open Society

837
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:12,351
But that doesn't explain why they took what was described as

838
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:14,143
Have documents after their rate

839
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,167
That does Justice

840
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:20,543
I didn't pay my rent for awhile in my landlord

841
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:26,943
Two dozen camouflage mesh to steal my computer and then rummage deny you access to

842
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:29,503
Your server

843
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:33,343
What this is really about Soros and open Society

844
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,903
Yukos oils

845
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Yo McHale

846
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Khodorkovsky

847
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Oscoda or

848
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,095
Go to RC Willey

849
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,631
Clear instance of corruption

850
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Temperature

851
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:52,799
His political opponents was definitely one of them

852
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,871
An educational program standing up

853
00:42:56,127 --> 00:43:00,991
Since founding internet cafes were normal people communicate with the outside world

854
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,015
He was arrested

855
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,599
Jailed on trumped-up charges ultimately about 10 years in jail

856
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
International outcry led to Putin pardoning

857
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
2014

858
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,231
After which point he wisely headed out to

859
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:17,887
UK

860
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:21,727
Okay offices and made it impossible

861
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:23,519
Country

862
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
In that time.

863
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
Throat was very clear about his opposition

864
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,687
Government

865
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
The quote the New Order in Moscow that is emerged out of the chaos of the night

866
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
90 is very far from an open Society

867
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:43,743
It's an authoritarian regime that preserves an outward appearance of democracy put Power from its control of Russia

868
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
National

869
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:46,303
National resources

870
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:48,095
It uses those resources

871
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,631
Empower

872
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
To personally enrich the rulers

873
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,471
And exercise influence over its neighbor

874
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,799
Both in Europe and the former Soviet

875
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:01,919
But the idea of an open Society is difficult to suppress and I have not given up hope

876
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:04,223
In the. Following the 2000

877
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
3 red express is hot

878
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:07,551
George Soros

879
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,831
And his Democratic initial

880
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:11,391
Flaming

881
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
Is Putin Zone aggression

882
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,511
Be at the Georgian war in 2008 or the annexation

883
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Sora

884
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,327
Interesting Lee on February

885
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
23rd 2009

886
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,143
Which is

887
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
I don't know about a month

888
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,519
Before the episode we're listening to right now

889
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:34,431
Really seen close together

890
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,455
It was very overt

891
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
Message about poop

892
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
Putin's Russia

893
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Here's some Choice pack

894
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:42,367
Europe cannot afford to resist Russia

895
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:46,463
Cannot afford to not resist Russia's geopolitical aggression

896
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
It needs to be unified at any chance of success

897
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
Europe needs to pursue a two-pronged strategy

898
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,399
On the one hand protector

899
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,423
Against the Jeep

900
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,495
Russia

901
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
On the other it must be

902
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,311
Replace the rule of force

903
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
And geopolitics

904
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,895
The pursuit of democracy

905
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
Open Society of international cooperation

906
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,271
Strengthening and supporting the former Soviet republics

907
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
Would serve both prongs

908
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,575
Unified

909
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
EU policy towards Russia

910
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,159
In the op-ed Soros advert

911
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,999
Unified energy policy

912
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,047
Europe-wide regulatory Authority

913
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,655
Which has precedence over National regulators

914
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
Eddie europe-wide distribution

915
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,799
This would deprive Russia of its ability to play one country against another

916
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:33,823
Because a concession

917
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,407
National distributor immediately become available

918
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
Customers

919
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,711
In all other

920
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,991
Which is

921
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:43,039
Reflecting the reality of what

922
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:50,719
Call Demian picking them off one by one in order to

923
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:51,487
Royal Reserve

924
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:53,791
Is it relied on

925
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Those

926
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:59,423
How long has Putin been in power for now it's going to be 30 years

927
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,215
1999

928
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,263
So it's dark over on New Year's Day

929
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,335
It's almost 24 years

930
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,431
The article for the European Council on Foreign Relations

931
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
The direct attack on

932
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:14,271
Political and economic status

933
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
Good Rush

934
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:20,927
I don't see it is very likely that Putin would not want to respond with it

935
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
Information camp

936
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:26,303
Very much in line

937
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
With the strategies

938
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,399
That Russia uses General in terms of infer

939
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:34,239
Warfare

940
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,567
We have juice

941
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
Before this episode

942
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
To where Alex starts talking about George Soros

943
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
George Soros himself

944
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,527
European Council on Foreign Relations

945
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,111
Position picture definitely

946
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Work

947
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
Against

948
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
Newton Centre

949
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Crystal Lake

950
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,255
Two-pronged strategy would be

951
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,583
Those vulnerable

952
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,119
Enterprising

953
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,911
Russia of 1

954
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
In terms of manipulating the oil supplies

955
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,775
To get people to turn on

956
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:13,151
Bugs Bunny episode

957
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,759
Daffy Duck has just put up a bunch of arrows

958
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,319
All over the entire Forest

959
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,879
Every possible Arrow everywhere

960
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,927
You pointed directly at Bugs Bunny's old

961
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:31,327
Kind of see where that has Bugs Bunny

962
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,911
There are a lot of arrows

963
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,703
Have I have a lot of thoughts

964
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:39,775
It does but there's really no way

965
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
To make this

966
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Any direct

967
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Playing but we can talk about

968
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,271
That rabbit is

969
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,807
No no

970
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:56,927
Pictures of Walmart

971
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,535
I've already made

972
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
It isn't

973
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:08,191
Hayirli reasonable to accept

974
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Entirely responsible

975
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,543
It could just be the timing

976
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:16,383
So I guess now might be a good time to talk about

977
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:19,967
The answer the question you asked earlier about

978
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Was doing

979
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,575
In the early

980
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,343
2000

981
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:27,135
Demonizing the open Society

982
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
It's not

983
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:28,927
Just

984
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,487
Popped up out of nowhere

985
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:32,511
Hitler so there

986
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:38,911
George Soros Pacifica

987
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
He spent his life in a large Fortune

988
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,799
Democratizing

989
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Countries that those death

990
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,455
In perpetuity

991
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
Rise to power again on New Year's Eve

992
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
But it doesn't

993
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
Predate him being in

994
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
In the KGB

995
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:01,183
He was a foreign foreign intelligence officer

996
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,487
8:35

997
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,279
1891 reaching the rank

998
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,047
Lieutenant colonel

999
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,327
You may notice

1000
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
Is right around when the

1001
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,703
Sell it which one you decided

1002
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,983
Politics

1003
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,543
Finding himself a fast-rising star in

1004
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:21,151
In 1992 istvan kerska

1005
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,991
Was a radical nationalist member of the Hungarian National Assembly

1006
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,111
Do hungry wasn't part of the USSR it was a country that was militarily dominated by the Soviet

1007
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
Union until iron

1008
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
In the 50s

1009
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:36,255
Democratic

1010
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,559
Takiro haven't been arrested at the

1011
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
1956

1012
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Attempted Revolution

1013
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,143
Against Soviet occupation

1014
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
He put on the appearance

1015
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:49,567
Being a democratic Crusader critical of the Hungarian power

1016
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,407
He was employed as an informant for the Hungarian Secret

1017
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,479
He's literally control

1018
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,599
Insisting that the Zionist

1019
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
To take over

1020
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:06,207
In 1992 he accuse Sorrows of being a puppet of Israel

1021
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,351
So that is it from

1022
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,143
Do we have this example of

1023
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
But he was actually a snitch

1024
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,799
For the people he was pretending

1025
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
So you got that

1026
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
Okay that's one

1027
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:29,503
Jim's Blanca hyper nationalistic stream member of the National Council

1028
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
Ventricle

1029
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Slovakia

1030
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,855
He was a real s*** head things like the following about

1031
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
People from hungry

1032
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:39,231
These robbers murderers and those who erect these ugly to rule

1033
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,023
He's Hungarian parrot

1034
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Traditional bird

1035
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:44,863
Tyrol

1036
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:52,031
Houston to Laredo

1037
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:57,151
Culture

1038
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:03,039
Yeah. He called the ethnic Hungarian minority in the country a quote tumor on the body of the Slovak Nation

1039
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,623
Anxiety attacks and level Budapest

1040
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
If they attempt

1041
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,183
Teach us the Lord's Prayer and

1042
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207

00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:15,327
He called Joseph piso quotes one of the greatest sons of the flu

1044
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,631
Fun facts Joseph Pisa was

1045
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:21,471
The president of Slovak Republic back when it was a client state of Nazi Germany

1046
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,799
By August 1942 Tissot at 8

1047
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,919
Live in the Slovak Republic

1048
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,711
When the Vatican criticized

1049
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
The deportation

1050
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,783
Peace out himself a Catholic priest

1051
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,831
Before becoming president replied quote

1052
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,879
There is no foreign Intervention which

1053
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:42,719
Should stop us on the road to the liberation of Slovakia from

1054
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,239
Motherfukers direction is real gonna kill the Jews

1055
00:51:55,775 --> 00:52:01,919
Army liberated Slovakia

1056
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,455
Democracy

1057
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,759
He was hung on April 18th 90

1058
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
1847

1059
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,831
Love that guy

1060
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,623
But you know who he didn't like

1061
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:14,975
George Soros

1062
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,279
Completely cool legislation designs

1063
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,071
Doctor tail freedom

1064
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,119
Empress in the Czech Republic

1065
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,191
The accused figuratively kill Jews Act

1066
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,519
He accused opposition of being part of a plan by George Soros.

1067
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,823
Destabilize the country

1068
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,943
We could spend all day learning about the various authoritarian Nazi sympathizers and

1069
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:38,783
Extreme right-wing

1070
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
The last decade

1071
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,855
Example

1072
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,391
I think they demonstrate my point

1073
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,439
Since the fall of the Soviet Union

1074
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
The Boogeyman

1075
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
Who's trying to take over the counter

1076
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Is always

1077
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,839
Used by people who do not want democratic ideals

1078
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
In their country

1079
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,655
Cirrhosis spent millions and millions

1080
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
Dollar Tree

1081
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,727
Imitation of liberal democracy

1082
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,775
In countries formerly under the rules

1083
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,799
The Soviet Union

1084
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,079
Because that is where

1085
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,127
He's from and because he knows how important

1086
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,407
Does democratic ideals

1087
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:06,943
Here's what

1088
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:13,343
Crew lyrics like LeBron building a school in Cleveland

1089
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,623
Irony of the world is

1090
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:17,183
Traditional Republican foreign-policy

1091
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:21,535
The same parties it is now under the sway of these

1092
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Narrative

1093
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,631
You see a pop-up even in Fox News

1094
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
The president

1095
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,495
Yeah

1096
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,567
Is very close to this anti-social Rosemary

1097
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:37,919
Put traditional Republican foreign-policy is a Honda

1098
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,455
Percent line with what Soros did

1099
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
In the aftermath of the Soviet

1100
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:44,063
The GOP Rusev Oak

1101
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,415
I'm opening up country to Liberal democracy which inevitably

1102
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,463
Leads to an open market for the country

1103
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
And all that other s*** they f****** love

1104
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:56,095
But because there was also in favor of liberal ideals

1105
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,655
Like rights for all people and not hating immigrants

1106
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
They've given up all principles

1107
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
In falling in line with

1108
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,007
With Jam Slaughter

1109
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,567
And other sucking authoritarian

1110
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
To push propaganda

1111
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,015
Very positive spin Wichita

1112
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:19,903
Not how I said traditional you should not have said that

1113
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:23,231
Going to hide behind that

1114
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,631
Saudi Arabia exist

1115
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Undoubtedly

1116
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
Don't care about democracy so much as the open market

1117
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
The part of what

1118
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,527
Well I suppose it is their ideal in those country

1119
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:50,367
Because there's already and they're not playing

1120
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,647
So they would just like to

1121
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:55,231
So if they were so if it was a Greek democracy

1122
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:59,327
And they were playing ball

1123
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:05,727
In the same way that when South American countries

1124
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
Authoritarian

1125
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
I think

1126
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
Seems so far

1127
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,527
Little bit of a deconstruction about how

1128
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,319
Historically so much of the

1129
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,599
Criticism of Soros

1130
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
Smith Falls

1131
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:26,463
To putting forth his

1132
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Europe

1133
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
Early on

1134
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:32,607
Empower

1135
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
He his

1136
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Soros ads

1137
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,263
Color Revolution anytime

1138
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
Do you sort of threat

1139
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
It's a Soros thing

1140
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
Prevailing

1141
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
Place that

1142
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,479
But

1143
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
These are fundamental shift receive

1144
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
Take place in a relatively

1145
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,087
Short. Of time

1146
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
A Alex

1147
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,647
I think there's no way around

1148
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,695
I strongly suspect

1149
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
But the only way we can

1150
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Can tell if there's

1151
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,327
The only way to tell

1152
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,887
Is it we need to analyze some of the context

1153
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,935
And see what was going on in the world

1154
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,727
In April 2009

1155
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,287
See there's any clues that might tell us about why Alex

1156
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,079
Begin this all of a sudden

1157
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:20,479
What company and then they bumped up there

1158
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,551
Sizing on Alex's show on the gcn network

1159
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,111
Got a meeting with

1160
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
Here's what we're going to do

1161
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
Will buy all your goals

1162
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,975
But let you run the place

1163
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:36,607
I have a complete ownership stationary clothes

1164
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,167
It's very close actually do station stealth

1165
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,447
Through for that because

1166
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,727
The Russians were trying to

1167
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,543
Get diamond gusset to replace their theme song with the tetris

1168
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Months

1169
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,807
That is why no one knows how big or small

1170
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,159
Relations between Russia United States Lily Frost

1171
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:01,439
In the mid-to-late

1172
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,207
2008

1173
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,023
Early 2009

1174
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,583
There's a matter of Bush's plans

1175
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
Install

1176
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
Stick missiles in Poland

1177
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:11,935
The Czech Republic

1178
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,983
Things that Russia made very certain

1179
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,311
Act of aggression

1180
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:23,199
Their ambassador to the UN Vitality chickens

1181
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
Imposter

1182
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
Impossibly to reply

1183
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,295
Their own metals

1184
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
I'm here with that exchange of

1185
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
Threat

1186
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,903
Russia pack the separatists

1187
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,511
Asia and South ossetia in August 2008

1188
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,071
Between the state of Georgia and what the rest of the world

1189
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
Russian

1190
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,399
In the to Breakaway

1191
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,935
It was a coalition of the willing

1192
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:49,311
Sure of course on January 6th 2009 Russia

1193
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,359
Ukraine precipitated

1194
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,127
We are crisis

1195
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:54,175
Of much of Europe

1196
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,967
Adapt

1197
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
The winter

1198
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,783
As we saw when we listen to that episode

1199
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,831
A almost unanimous

1200
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
Welcome Center

1201
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,647
Alex's position on that crisis was that

1202
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
Ukraine shut off the gas

1203
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
There are a lot of flare-ups

1204
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,071
And people were rightly concerned about what that would pretend between

1205
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:12,095
You're for the relations

1206
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Tomb Raider

1207
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Hours

1208
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:19,263
On April 2nd 2009 the G20 Summit occurred in London

1209
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:21,311
Which Mark the beginning of an increase

1210
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,359
Chris efforts to repair the strained relations

1211
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:28,479
With talks between Obama and president of Russia

1212
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,783
Earlier in March Hillary Clinton

1213
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,599
Famously posed with Sergei

1214
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,903
By holding a proper reset button

1215
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,927
Send a message

1216
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
The two countries

1217
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,999
We're putting the past behind them moving forward

1218
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,303
NES

1219
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
Almost

1220
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,775
There are good reasons

1221
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:56,639
This is possibly an effort being made to live in a more of a balanced world

1222
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,175
And put the Cold War mentality

1223
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,455
Behind us and let it die

1224
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,503
Public perception

1225
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,295
In reality the relationship

1226
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
Was not getting better

1227
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,367
Part of this is due to

1228
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
The fact

1229
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,671
Italy prime minister

1230
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,463
The time in medvetta was president

1231
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,999
Everyone knew that Vladimir Putin

1232
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:15,071
I'd never really stepped down from power and was really running

1233
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,119
He be president from the start

1234
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
2000

1235
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,423
Until May 2008

1236
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
We became pregnant

1237
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:24,031
Until May

1238
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,567
12

1239
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,335
Became president

1240
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:29,919
The Russian Constitution doesn't allow for more than two consecutive terms

1241
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,687
Presidents

1242
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,503
So Putin and Medved ever engaged in what's known as a

1243
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Democracy

1244
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,135
Became president

1245
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
And again in 2012 he made Medvedev Prime minute

1246
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,535
When he was elected president

1247
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
With 97% of the votes

1248
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:51,935
Is my day was very Democratic everybody

1249
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Protest

1250
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Clear corruption

1251
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:01,663
Is doing

1252
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,991
Or just trading positions in order to

1253
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:08,575
Retain a Stranglehold on power

1254
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,367
People protest

1255
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
Points to their protest

1256
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Clear signs

1257
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
Things like call the revolution

1258
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
Being carried out by

1259
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,303
Internationalist to Lake George

1260
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,351
Somebody is fomenting

1261
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:30,079
It's almost like to rhetoric that far-right authoritarian dictatorship

1262
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,615
In order to demonize

1263
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,687
Reasonable rational protesters

1264
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,991
Has become de rigueur for

1265
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:41,599
Far-right nationalist politicians

1266
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,159
Who just so happened to go under the same

1267
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,207
It does seem that way

1268
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,743
What's interest

1269
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:48,767
Is like weed

1270
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Lesotho

1271
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,351
Historical hatred of

1272
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
Zoroaster

1273
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,167
In 2009

1274
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,959
Raptor 2009

1275
01:00:57,471 --> 01:00:59,007
There is very clearly

1276
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,799
Soros

1277
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:03,871
Putin are at loggerheads

1278
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Receive

1279
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,943
The sort of tension

1280
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,479
Between the United States

1281
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,527
And Russia

1282
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Where

1283
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Do you know

1284
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,903
Or aggression would not work

1285
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:21,279
The outward appearance of trying to make the relationship better

1286
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,815
Is information Warfare

1287
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,911
Since 1970s

1288
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,447
You be in the foreign intelligence

1289
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,799
It seems like specializing in product

1290
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,335
It seems like

1291
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,383
His move

1292
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
Pretend to be

1293
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:40,479
Having

1294
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,807
Let's make our relationship better talk

1295
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,159
Trying actively undermining those talks

1296
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,719
Through demonization of

1297
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Both Obama

1298
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:57,119
Creating this because it's important

1299
01:02:00,959 --> 01:02:01,471
What is

1300
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,519
Country is doing ends

1301
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Absolutely

1302
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,615
I think that's there and I don't think it's

1303
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
Crazy

1304
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,407
To look at that

1305
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,479
The connection

1306
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,015
Step back and say

1307
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
Looks bad

1308
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,367
There's a historical piece

1309
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,135
The present

1310
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,671
Pizza Hut in 2009

1311
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,999
But none of it is to say that Russia told Alex

1312
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
To do that

1313
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
Of course it's

1314
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,327
It's just

1315
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,863
So much

1316
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,143
Even then

1317
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:36,543
Even had as far as like a let's prove it

1318
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,127
Even had told Alex directly

1319
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:46,783
8 different people and a video chat I guess

1320
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,343
Apparently according to rush

1321
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Here is are is my question

1322
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,695
With this

1323
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,719
Like

1324
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,303
Which right-wing propaganda

1325
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
Utterly dominated Russia for

1326
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,727
And then

1327
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,543
Metastasize the way that it has

1328
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,567
Worldwide

1329
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,151
And to see the way that you do like

1330
01:03:13,663 --> 01:03:14,431
88

1331
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:21,855
It's always going to be the fact-checkers are going to be on the defensive and they're never going to win in the same way that

1332
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
The Russian hacker

1333
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
You can have a great

1334
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:29,023
Defense cyber security system but it's never going to do

1335
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,583
The people who are spending all of their time

1336
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,351
On the author

1337
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
If you don't like white person

1338
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,935
Black enchantress like Rodger Stone always

1339
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,703
Exactly

1340
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:44,383
Is there any idea way that right-wing propaganda is actually defeated in

1341
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
Like is there a way to win

1342
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
No

1343
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:56,927
Speculative question

1344
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,743
I really don't think there is

1345
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
I think you can have a little

1346
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
Deconstructionist

1347
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
Win

1348
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,215
For Austin our listeners

1349
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
Having a more robust under

1350
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
Understanding

1351
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:15,615
What's really behind them where there's true

1352
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
I swear there's.

1353
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:21,759
Is great

1354
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
Wrong word

1355
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,855
Effective about proper

1356
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,879
Target

1357
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,695
People where they live at Targets them in their weak spot

1358
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
Parts of how the

1359
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
Entire

1360
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:35,583
Of course

1361
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Grown up

1362
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:40,191
The early

1363
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,727
Days of advertising

1364
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,519
Disinformation

1365
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,079
Tied together

1366
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,615
It's become so effect

1367
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Practicing

1368
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,687
Understand

1369
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:52,735
They in order to get a bad message

1370
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,015
Supercross

1371
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
You're not implying

1372
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,623
Whether it's the Jews are evil

1373
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Yeah

1374
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,695
Kind of have to give a secondary

1375
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,255
That you attach to the other message

1376
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,071
Trojan Horse

1377
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,679
You're ever going to be able to overcome that

1378
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:13,471
With reason logic

1379
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,359
Our truth I really don't you realize that the conclusion to draw from that then

1380
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,663
Is not we should be battling

1381
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,223
Evil right-wing propaganda with

1382
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,271
Reason and facts and logic

1383
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
Ensure

1384
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,575
And should instead create

1385
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,903
Are evil left-wing propaganda I think that's a

1386
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,231
Things that are called liberal propaganda

1387
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,023
It's always things like

1388
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
Appeals to

1389
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:42,911
People's rights and stuff like that

1390
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,983
Done with the liberal propaganda of interracial relationship

1391
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,055
Yes yeah

1392
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,615
Accused of being liberal propaganda

1393
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,663
I think there is probably like

1394
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,223
Some smaller-scale versions of

1395
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
Like left

1396
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,271
People who are

1397
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:04,159
Use manipulative tactics in the same way

1398
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,231
I think if they do exist they're very unsuccessful

1399
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
They don't make a difference

1400
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
No one really looks

1401
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,607
Have we considered

1402
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:16,191
Turning ourselves into a Consulting business for

1403
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,591
Left-wing propaganda on the show like seven times at least I know bunch

1404
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:26,431
Really putting that out there

1405
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:32,831
Actually really be interested in

1406
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:38,463
I think it serves your consultancy business

1407
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,863
Not true at all not true at all

1408
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,471
Listen to Ed Gazette

1409
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,151
They wouldn't get me

1410
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:02,783
Really be interested to know if there is like a Russian analog for our podcast

1411
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,087
It would be way more brazen

1412
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:09,951
Absolutely

1413
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,719
And get them to

1414
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Couple things

1415
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,559
Because

1416
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,583
We've done some of the

1417
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,143
Offshoot episodes that we've

1418
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,935
Weak now now

1419
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,287
I want folks to know I wouldn't do this willingly

1420
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:28,383
I want that on record

1421
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:36,319
Look what he did

1422
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,279

Over wearing a switch

1427
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
Just fun so go f*** yourself

1428
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735

This one

1431
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,415
So Alex is really still pushing The Obama Deception

1432
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,535
It's the Silver Bullet

1433
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,399
I appreciate that our listeners

1434
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,167

1435
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,703
How to box

1436
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:25,983
Something like that

1437
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,775
And asking them to

1438
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:28,543
Make me

1439
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,567

Souvlaki

1444
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527

In Alex's defense he's not

1464
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:22,463
It's not clear how many hours he wants them to put it

1465
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:27,071
It's so much of an ass

1466
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:33,983
That's so much to ask if you like it

1467
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,519

01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:14,175
Work

1476
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,015
A little too aspiration

1477
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,575

Interesting Lee on this April 8th episode

1484
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,407
Guess we've met before

1485
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:47,711
Short story

1486
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,271
Just saw a in 2018

1487
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,599
The guy who started Oath Keepers

1488
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
You're not

1489
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Are you

1490
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,975
Are you aware

1491
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:05,631
Of what's going to happen because I'm sick of you drawing these f****** perfect parallels on a day-to-day

1492
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:09,471
It's part of what I was talking to

1493
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
The show about how uncomfortable I am

1494
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:15,871
Really just texted you like

1495
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,175
Weird near like I'm fine

1496
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,223
I'm just trying to talk

1497
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
Through what I'm looking

1498
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,295
This is very

1499
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:26,623
So Stewart Road shows back up here on

1500
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:29,439
Alex has decided to go demonize George Soros

1501
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:31,743
I think that is probably

1502
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
I think it's almost certainly acuenta

1503
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,583
It's interesting time

1504
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,375
But it's I think that that doesn't mean

1505
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:42,239
Aldo

1506
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:45,311
If I need to if I've made a big decision

1507
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,639
I need to work it out comfort food

1508
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
So he's just made a big change

1509
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
In 2009

1510
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,527
He's just made a big change in

1511
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,295
2018

1512
01:12:55,551 --> 01:13:01,439
I think you're probably right

1513
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:11,167
I think that's dirt road showing up in present-day is much more indicative

1514
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,751
I think so cuz I don't think that

1515
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,031
Know each other very well

1516
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,079
They'd only had one

1517
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,359
Interview

1518
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,639
That's it

1519
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:24,479
Probably talked off are a little bit you can even hear from

1520
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:27,807
Their interaction that they they aren't like super tight

1521
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:34,207
In the same way that they will become

1522
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,023
Maybe it's like a

1523
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:37,791
You know

1524
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,119
You've had a long run you just got out of a relationship

1525
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,911
You text your funk buddy

1526
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,703
And then they come on your show

1527
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,983
When she gets real weird

1528
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:51,871
And in this interview in this disappearance

1529
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
Stewart Road

1530
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,687
He's trying to

1531
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
Remote

1532
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,015
Publix

1533
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:00,319
Of the

1534
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:04,415
Is it going to meet at Lexus

1535
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
Concord

1536
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,999
And I'm going to have a big ceremony where all these

1537
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
Police and military

1538
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,303
Reaffirm their oath

1539
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,631
Perfect

1540
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Course

1541
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,703
Yes so after having a

1542
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
Conversation

1543
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Alex has a

1544
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:22,847
Division

1545
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
Shots fired

1546
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,967
In the American Revolution began

1547
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:32,319
We're going to be staying there that's her first public meeting as of keepers

1548
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,647
Right there

1549
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,999
I got to stop shooting by the end of April

1550
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,791
McRib

1551
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,191
It's the final solution

1552
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,471
It's the solution

1553
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:50,751
The problems

1554
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:54,079
He is now taking on the oathkeeper

1555
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,687
Probably

1556
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,527
Maybe Miss ascribed was the idea that Alex glommed onto

1557
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,087
Keep her calm.

1558
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:06,367
Yeah

1559
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:11,231
Exist in any large

1560
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:16,863
Stewart made his first appearance on the show

1561
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,191
The responses from being on a

1562
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:30,175
No we can have two weeks ago

1563
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:32,991
Moments

1564
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:39,391
Alex has The Oath Keepers founder on The Oath Keepers at the same at the time are pretty much nothing

1565
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:46,303
Has The Oath Keepers founder

1566
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:49,119
No it just this one time

1567
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:51,167
So all of a sudden

1568
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,959
He gets a massive response

1569
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,263
A lot more people want to join the

1570
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,311
He staying in contact with

1571
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
Alex loves

1572
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
It's kind of a symbiotic

1573
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,783
Gotcha

1574
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:08,319
Was the

1575
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,903
This is a way to reclaim the Patriot energy

1576
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,695
The world right now

1577
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,487
Through Glenn Beck

1578
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,303
Through

1579
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
They make it

1580
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:19,839
Myra

1581
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,399
My version is this Persian

1582
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,423
The other version

1583
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Counterfeit

1584
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
Witchy spells out in the snow

1585
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,719
Who's definitely an operative

1586
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Definitely enough

1587
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Serta Vanowen

1588
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:58,495
Keepers are apart of

1589
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:02,079
Party

1590
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
Scoffing

1591
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Glenn Beck

1592
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
It does lead 12

1593
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,599
Did they might have

1594
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
A slight external

1595
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
Motive

1596
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,935
I can't really step my foot down on on any direction on

1597
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:35,615
Probably not having all the information I know

1598
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,919
What's the roads an hour to talk

1599
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,039
I want to kill the middle class

1600
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,391
Well from Alex's rhetoric we know that that's what he believes

1601
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:50,463
Okay that's a little bit

1602
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
On this episode

1603
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,279
I want war

1604
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,215
Russian Revolution

1605
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:03,263
Right now

1606
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:12,479
Tomorrow

1607
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:17,343
Call George Soros

1608
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:23,487
Headlines

1609
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
Not where's that article

1610
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
Where is that

1611
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,911
Damn can you think of somebody right

1612
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:37,567
Who has absolutely

1613
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,407
Somebody who has engineered

1614
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,479
Number

1615
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:47,039
Somebody who is

1616
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:55,487
Operator can you think of anybody

1617
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,535
Nope

1618
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
Somebody who made

1619
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,143
On the

1620
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,423
Grounding

1621
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,495
Maybe someone who said that

1622
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Eugenics

1623
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:12,127
Is real somebody like that

1624
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:16,735
No nobody never loved

1625
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:20,319
And they would never become the president of the goddamn United

1626
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,647
So what we have here is Alex

1627
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:25,695
Like that is a strong into

1628
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
Right there

1629
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
Alex

1630
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
How to put this other than

1631
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,399
Feel like someone told him something

1632
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,495
Appear to be any kind of

1633
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:39,263
Real

1634
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,079
Like I've known about Soros forever

1635
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:45,407
That guy

1636
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,943
Cuz I like I said

1637
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:47,967
Repeatedly

1638
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,015
Episode

1639
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,087
There's ways to present that in natural way which is

1640
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,927
Like I said my research team dug this up

1641
01:19:57,183 --> 01:20:00,255
Yeah or a look I overlooked an element

1642
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:04,863
Any of those sorts of things

1643
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,423
Does all the time and then

1644
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,495
They're trying to create a socialist State and destroy the middle class

1645
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,543
And give it to George Soro

1646
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,896
He's adding it on is an addendum and it seems forced

1647
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,968
To do say that this is the culmination of his

1648
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Up until this

1649
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:27,392
It wouldn't George Soros is this guy we've always been pointing towards the Rockefellers and all this

1650
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:33,792
List of information all of these schemes together

1651
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:34,816
The other version

1652
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,632
David Rockefeller is too old

1653
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:44,032
And The Heir Apparent is Sora

1654
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
Yeah

1655
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:47,360
Still talk about the tradition of hating Soros

1656
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:52,480
And how this is still popping up out of nowhere but it takes away a little bit of the sting of the

1657
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
Coming out of nowhere

1658
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,296
Is it in

1659
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,088
You either than with a natural

1660
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
The way people

1661
01:20:58,880 --> 01:20:59,904
Present information

1662
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,512
Because you need a contact for it needs doing this with no context

1663
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,328
I've listened to

1664
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
Every episode

1665
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:10,912
Put out

1666
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:11,680
From

1667
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,472
Late 2008

1668
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,520
To now we're in April

1669
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,544
2000

1670
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,592
Every single episode

1671
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:20,384
You consider all of that time

1672
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,664
It's probably 5

1673
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,432
100 hours

1674
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,456
Of his broadcast

1675
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,760
And I can say unequivocally

1676
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,808
With no reservation

1677
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
With no

1678
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,880
Exaggeration or anything

1679
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,160
That this

1680
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Is

1681
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
Not

1682
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,512
It's it's not normal

1683
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,840
Yes very abnormal

1684
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:40,864
Anything other than

1685
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,424
I am certain that someone told her

1686
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:45,216
Something

1687
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:46,240
Something

1688
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,776
About cirrhosis

1689
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
Or be like

1690
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:51,104
Hey Soros is your new Target

1691
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,432
Yeah he was staying up

1692
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:56,224
Who would cover Trump speech

1693
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
We heard him turn

1694
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,808
Who's the new enemy

1695
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,624
Yeah kind of a thing that he does

1696
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,720
The focus is energy in a certain direction

1697
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:10,048
Cuz he's not going to do the

1698
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:15,168
She can't read not going to do any but he can't read last Cliff he said where's where's the headline

1699
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,728
Where's the Hat

1700
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,288
Where's the information

1701
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,080
Interested in

1702
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,128
Title

1703
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,152
He has he has

1704
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:26,176
Nothing

1705
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
And

1706
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:27,712
I

1707
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,992
This is where we get

1708
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
Circulation

1709
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,856
Suppose one of the other big

1710
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:37,440
What other big factors that I'm considering with this

1711
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,208
This is

1712
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,744
Soros is

1713
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,536
Speeches in February

1714
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,608
Apologize

1715
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,680
This is April 8th

1716
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:50,240
It seems like if there was a direct

1717
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,008
Connection

1718
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:55,360
That would be a long. Of time

1719
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,688
2009

1720
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
It's important to remember this

1721
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:07,904
Now that that connection could have been one tweet that was sent out

1722
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:10,464
Andover a day every single human being

1723
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
Who is in the circle

1724
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
Would have been connected

1725
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,608
Did to it more likelihood of it being

1726
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,472
Powers

1727
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
OSHA

1728
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:28,384
Much more protracted

1729
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,432
This person talks to me

1730
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,200
That's

1731
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Influence

1732
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,992
Steelers going out

1733
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,552
Exactly

1734
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:42,720
Because

1735
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
Is German

1736
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,584
Thai baht

1737
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,936
This point

1738
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
Encouraging

1739
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,128
Blow up militia

1740
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,432
Houses with Angela Kaley Cuoco

1741
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:06,272

01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,552
Gmail

1743
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,832
Or I think was a comment.

1744
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:11,136

This comment doesn't writer.

1748
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144

United States Army

1767
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,728
Do you think that

1768
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,776
Possible

1769
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:02,080

Peter Stormare

1775
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:15,648
With the war of pointlessness

1776
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,464
Gyro

1777
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,512
Rhodes is presenting it

1778
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,280
This guy is

1779
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,680
It's like it's a classic misunderstanding that these people in the right terms

1780
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,216
Creating her own victim

1781
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,544
Look

1782
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,152
You don't have a chance against the the

1783
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:40,480
Biggest yacht in the world

1784
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,272
World history

1785
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
It's a nonsense

1786
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
Director retention

1787
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,648
Places where are we

1788
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
Actually

1789
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,464
Have a way to change things

1790
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,256
Democratic process

1791
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:57,888
I like I like you have I like us having to note that militia member

1792
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,680
Rotate

1793
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:02,496
Grammatically well well,

1794
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,288
Like this song

1795
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,408
Text Salinger is the noncommissioned officer in a militia

1796
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
Ghostwriter

1797
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:15,808
2 Stewart Road

1798
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,392
Whatever

1799
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,720
What you doing

1800
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:23,744
Represent

1801
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,328
And I don't really care to go over it more than we already have

1802
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,608
I don't want to listen to him

1803
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
Jim talked for like 10

1804
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,656
It's about how they want

1805
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,424
I kill our children

1806
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
Stuff like that

1807
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,520
Right but the real threat that he's

1808
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:39,360
The real threat that he's getting from the Daily Coast writer based on your character

1809
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:41,920
Conversation of what the writer said was

1810
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
You're calling us Cox

1811
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,904
Issue with you is you're saying that we are ineffectual bulshit

1812
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,000
We're not capable of doing any of the interest

1813
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,024
Near Stewart's

1814
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,840
Compliant although when the article is just

1815
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:04,704
That is Alex's complaint complaint

1816
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,752
I mean like psychologic

1817
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,800
No he's just using it as a pet

1818
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
Piece of propaganda

1819
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
Because he knows what the

1820
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:16,224
Give a f*** about that I like are you willing

1821
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,040
Go to war with United States military

1822
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:21,856
Knowing that you know if you do

1823
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:22,624
Just going to buy me

1824
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
Your house right with your wife inside

1825
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:31,072
Which was trying to draw parallel to what country

1826
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,144
Literary aspect to it

1827
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,960
In terms of what the guy at the coast was right

1828
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
To kill our family

1829
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
I don't think you

1830
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
He's offended by the idea of them

1831
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:45,920
Being called

1832
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,456
Airsoft

1833
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:48,224
But Alex

1834
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,528
Whenever there's something about it absolutely

1835
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,880
They're calling it while I think in the articles I cute

1836
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:56,672
These b****** would be out there

1837
01:27:56,928 --> 01:27:57,952
By with bombs going

1838
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
Military bases

1839
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,216
You brought that up but it's Alex's

1840
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
Not Stewart

1841
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,264
Stewart is

1842
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,544
Reserve military man

1843
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,896
But

1844
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,200
Board motor

1845
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,528
Interested in the mission

1846
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:25,600
Creating the idea that all of these people on the left

1847
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:29,696
And these media figures are lusting after the idea of killing our

1848
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,488
Which is more important to him

1849
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,536
Been preserving his masculinity

1850
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
That is actually really fast

1851
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,168
Text talk about

1852
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,448
Your instincts

1853
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
About all this world

1854
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,800
Or so sharp but they're just about Alice

1855
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:50,688
And then you say that I can't get hired as a consultant for evil

1856
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:55,040
Broad-spectrum

1857
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,064
I do

1858
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,344
I'll bring you on

1859
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,416
I need you to starting salary that's well below

1860
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,400
Maybe that works

1861
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:17,056
They're talking about this article and I didn't bring this up for no reason I brought it up because the next clip

1862
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
Alex is responding to

1863
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:20,128
2in talking about how bad

1864
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,224
Said something about Sora

1865
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:27,552
What's the score of the human Americans that are

1866
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:33,952
George Soros

1867
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:36,768
Wow

1868
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
Everything goes back

1869
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,560
Soros

1870
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
Literally every

1871
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,168
Ghost Riders

1872
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,984
Runs air America is a charge of Media Matters

1873
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
He's trying to demonize Alex

1874
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,800
Across-the-board

1875
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,384
He is in charge of writing a bunch of stuff about the

1876
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,688
The IMF and how they're going to take over everything

1877
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:59,040
It's like what I was just doesn't impression to somebody who takes the Rosemont

1878
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
Just fun

1879
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:24,128
When I was listening

1880
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:26,688
That first of all stupid

1881
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:27,968
Hazmat oppression

1882
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
He just sounded like him

1883
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,880
I really think that I should have had this thought

1884
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,160
Before this

1885
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:42,560
It was one of the first times that I realized how bad that rent would sound without the music

1886
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,352
The pressure of an out

1887
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,888
Like the commercial out

1888
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:50,496
Oh yeah ok Google

1889
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:56,384
And then without do you like I know it's going to commercial so I don't have to say anything after it

1890
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,920
You just be lost without a map

1891
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:01,760
We have

1892
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:05,344
We've touched on that before in that field

1893
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,112
Lego

1894
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:12,512
You got to give it you got to give the man credit for knowing how to

1895
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,792
Two sides of the same coin

1896
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,120
Giving him his props as like a broadcast

1897
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,168
The realization

1898
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:20,448
Is very similar

1899
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,216
That like

1900
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,032
Be so pathetic without

1901
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,872
You playing Tuesday

1902
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
Recognizing

1903
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:36,064
Music brings to the table

1904
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,856
Because like you hear that

1905
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:39,904
You're dumb and you believe in

1906
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,232
You take away that music

1907
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,256
That France

1908
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,304
Real week

1909
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,072
Yeah

1910
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:50,400
Jordan in this next clip Alex's.

1911
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,984
More stuff about Soros

1912
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,008
This

1913
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:09,856
Continue to try and undermine black people right now

1914
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:16,256
Oh my God

1915
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:26,496
George Soros propaganda

1916
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
Please publication

1917
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,336
Come out the right way

1918
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,176
That's cuz they have malicious

1919
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,528
That's George Soros propaganda

1920
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,576
So that's an interesting position

1921
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,368
And this is something that I

1922
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,648
Can't make more clear

1923
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,416
Especially

1924
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,184
After that clip

1925
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,792
Alex has not said any of these things in the past

1926
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,120
When you talked about the demonization of his

1927
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:53,888
Weirdo paper

1928
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,424
Militia

1929
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,192
Family

1930
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
Like the time

1931
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
Talk about this

1932
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,288
Who's one of my Akron

1933
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,408
No but the Viagra Port is

1934
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:07,200
Perfect example of him

1935
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:11,296
He should have brought up Soros

1936
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,600
Came up if it was a part of his

1937
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:20,000
Bring up the spiritually on some level

1938
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,864
Hear that sort of thing about

1939
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,192
And stuff like that and don't understand what he's talking about

1940
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
That's

1941
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:32,288
Let's not give his listeners

1942
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,312
That's dirty

1943
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,080
But it's a

1944
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,640
Exhaust fuel

1945
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,664
To the miac reports

1946
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,432
Through a

1947
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,712
Attack on George Soros

1948
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,736
Yeah I can do that

1949
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,016
The opposite

1950
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
What's more important

1951
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:46,368
Is that windy direct attack on the miac report happen

1952
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
There was no mention of

1953
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:50,976
Single

1954
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,864
Freaking out on air about the idea that they're demonizing the militias and

1955
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,400
People like Ron Paul supporters

1956
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:00,704
Chuck Baldwin and all these people

1957
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,984
Save the world

1958
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:05,824
Not a single f****** word about George Soros being involved in any of that

1959
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,104
So this to me

1960
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,128
Is one of the most

1961
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,664
Example

1962
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,200
Wind report

1963
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,992
Came out which

1964
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:14,528
He's a powder monkey

1965
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
When were talking about

1966
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,088
Like it

1967
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:17,856
Not

1968
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:24,512
Super far connected

1969
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
Very,

1970
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,376
It's very close together

1971
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,656
And when he's going

1972
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Through the

1973
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
The fake avian

1974
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,216
Influence

1975
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:38,080
When he's doing his FEMA camp rebuttal about Glenn Beck

1976
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:41,408
All those things that have been in very close recent memory

1977
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,968
Not a single f****** word about George Soros

1978
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,992
And on this episode

1979
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,040
50 + mentions of him

1980
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Bmd

1981
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,856
Physically involved

1982
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,904
With all of these Evil operation

1983
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:53,952
It's suspicious as f***

1984
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,024
To go from no mentions

1985
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,304
25-man

1986
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:04,448
No I probably would be very different episode

1987
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,384
This is an addition

1988
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,456
0 mentions 250

1989
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:21,856
Is a very different from 0 to 50

1990
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:26,208
Do that but you need the ramp that takes you from zero

1991
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,256
Without it it's just

1992
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,280
What

1993
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:31,840
You can't make that jump

1994
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
And that's what Alex is doing

1995
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,912
Jump Snake River

1996
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:39,520
Without a rock in without a bucket

1997
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:40,800
To get over there

1998
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:41,824
Gap

1999
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,616
I never talked about Soros

2000
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,664
Even though I talked about the exact same

2001
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,736
About now to the other side

2002
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:49,760
Is that where

2003
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:52,064
Weird we all hate sora's right guy

2004
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,136
None of the work

2005
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:56,928
There's none of the con

2006
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,976
Me and the sincere

2007
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,024
If you could just present

2008
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,304
As

2009
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,584
My guys

2010
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,400
For two days straight

2011
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:11,264
They were sitting at their laptops and they did nothing but research and they read all these documents and everything

2012
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:14,848
I still have the same

2013
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,616
Suspicion

2014
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,384
But

2015
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,432
It would not be as glare

2016
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,968
This is too glaring

2017
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
It's too much

2018
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,040
It's a bridge too far for me

2019
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,112
Yeah

2020
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:32,512
Suspicious

2021
01:36:32,768 --> 01:36:38,144
It's pretty crazy

2022
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,424
Alex reveals

2023
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,704
On this episode

2024
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,008
Not only does George Soros

2025
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
Him

2026
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:44,800
He also hates

2027
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:48,128
Well yeah but that's

2028
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:52,224
Hopping mad because we are the resistance

2029
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:59,136
Spirit

2030
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:05,024
That clip wasn't so great but it's a context of it is him talking to Stewart Road talking about how like

2031
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,584
He's hopping mad about what we're doing

2032
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,888
Enemies

2033
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,680
But that sort of thing

2034
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
And he's trying to bring

2035
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,824
Like Brie and my family here

2036
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,128
Because

2037
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:25,248
Wasn't doing this before before he wasn't talking about Soros

2038
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,552
The interview

2039
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,832
This is so

2040
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:36,256
Unfortunately this is probably a

2041
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:38,048
Herculean task of research

2042
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,072
No

2043
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:44,192
Researcher would ever be able to do I know I can't think of any researcher

2044
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:46,240
Who would have the ability to kind of

2045
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,776
Go through just

2046
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:53,408
All of the right-wing information around the time. And see where

2047
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,688
Slow-roast popped up

2048
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
In most of the place

2049
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:00,064
Like at this point

2050
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,856
And it's not good at not much

2051
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,392
There was the

2052
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,672
Dating

2053
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,464
Bill O'Reilly report

2054
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,488
2007

2055
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:09,536
When he did a report about George

2056
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,560
Soros being super

2057
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:16,192
Westfield

2058
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,776
Double back on it

2059
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,568
Yeah

2060
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:23,104
Coldwater

2061
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,920
No and I don't know what to make of that

2062
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,200
I think that there's a

2063
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
Possibility

2064
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:34,624
That was an opening Salvo of some

2065
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,720
I think it's possible that that's what it is or it's just bill needed a story

2066
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,024
Came up with something wanted

2067
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
Riders

2068
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:44,608
It is impossible for me to really sort out

2069
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,376
O'Reilly's

2070
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:51,776
Loretta

2071
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:57,408
This is before

2072
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:00,736
A little bit

2073
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:07,904
Bill O'Reilly and Bob Odenkirk

2074
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:13,792
Sorry that was Dennis Miller thrilling adventure hour had just started

2075
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,608
I don't know what to make

2076
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
That part

2077
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:19,680
Like that

2078
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:20,448
Is

2079
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:21,984
Question that I tried to

2080
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,264
To wrestle with

2081
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,056
Episode

2082
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,336
It would be really

2083
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,384
Easy and very convenient for us

2084
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
Define

2085
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,992
April

2086
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:36,576
This is where Alex is getting it promises

2087
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
Because then we could have

2088
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:44,512
We wouldn't have to have the larger conversation about it we would have to have the conversation of where the source got it from

2089
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:48,352
Or more importantly if there was a

2090
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,400
Of s*** around this

2091
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:54,752
If there was around me

2092
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,544
That's a whole different story

2093
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:57,824
Exactly

2094
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
Cuz

2095
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,456
Bill O'Reilly

2096
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:06,784
F****** show

2097
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,576
It was a one-off

2098
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,928
And then you get to like

2099
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:14,720
What was it 2010

2100
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
2011

2101
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:20,352
Soros the Puppet Master

2102
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,632
Yeah

2103
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,656
Alex is like

2104
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,192
Soros

2105
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,984
Just a middle

2106
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:31,616
Mix

2107
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:32,640
Is weird

2108
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
This is weird

2109
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:35,968
I don't like it

2110
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:39,296
So in this next clip Alex explains that all criticism

2111
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,320
Basic

2112
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:42,880
He probably is just going to help

2113
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,328
Best friend

2114
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:16,160
So he's essentially ascribing

2115
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:17,952
Criticism

2116
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,256
Misrepresented

2117
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,792
Criticism

2118
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:22,560
It does exist

2119
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:26,400
So he's just saying it about me probably

2120
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:33,568
Which I think is a cowardly way if you hear bad information about me there is suppressive purse

2121
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:36,128
So anyway we have one more clip

2122
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:37,920
April 8th

2123
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,224
This clip

2124
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:43,040
It's your road

2125
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:51,744
I recommend the people find out about the

2126
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,792
Tea Party

2127
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
Nearest

2128
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
To them

2129
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,864
There's going to be

2130
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:10,944
We used

2131
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,760
Radicalized

2132
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:15,552
Make fun of the idea of

2133
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,904
But it's literally

2134
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:22,976
Yeah absolutely it's like people who are

2135
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,768
Weirdo

2136
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:26,048
Craterian

2137
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,584
Conservative

2138
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,608
Tour gravitating

2139
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,632
Towards this

2140
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,912
Anti Tech

2141
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,192
Party thing

2142
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,008
We go out there this opportunity

2143
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
4

2144
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:37,056
A captive audience

2145
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,080
That we're going to

2146
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,872
To f****** radicalized

2147
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,920
I know he's doing that to mock

2148
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,992
The mainstream media whatever but he knows that that's exact

2149
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:49,344
What he's doing

2150
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,136
Okay so we're going to

2151
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:53,440
Turn into a

2152
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:57,280
Terrorist and then you're going to go to it like

2153
01:42:57,792 --> 01:43:03,936
You can put it within scarecrows all you want but that's what you're doing so it doesn't matter how you say it

2154
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,472
The Somerset

2155
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
Putting this

2156
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:09,312
Eating because you're not doing this again

2157
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:12,384
So Jordan at this point the show kind of

2158
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,408
He has a

2159
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:15,200
Michael bagner

2160
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,296
His name's actually Michael Patton

2161
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,832
If you want to spell it

2162
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:21,856
Craigslist

2163
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:22,880
F****** ever.

2164
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:28,512
Or on the internet at all

2165
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,560
This guy

2166
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,840
How is he

2167
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
It's bad

2168
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:34,656
Ba

2169
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:45,408
Speaker backpack

2170
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:46,944
You've got to teach a constant

2171
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,856
I don't know I don't

2172
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:57,440
What the president on the libertarian ticket

2173
01:43:59,232 --> 01:43:59,744
Michael Jordan

2174
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,768
I tell you

2175
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,792
I lied to

2176
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
I'm sorry about the

2177
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,608
But

2178
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
The structure of this episode

2179
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:08,448
This is not the last clip from April 8th

2180
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:10,240
April 8th

2181
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,032
I lied to you about nothing

2182
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:13,056
Happening

2183
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:16,128
April 7th

2184
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,688
Did you just f****** Inception

2185
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,992
No I didn't it's just how the narrative

2186
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:24,832
How's the playing out of this

2187
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
Nation mosque

2188
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,392
What I'm about to

2189
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,696
At the beginning of this episode

2190
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,488
It wouldn't really matter

2191
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,512
But now

2192
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:36,608
You're really really does

2193
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:40,960
That you sound like a benevolent race from a Doctor Who episode where you're like

2194
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:45,312
You guys weren't ready for this information yet and now we have brought you to the

2195
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,592
The point where you can handle

2196
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:48,896
The idea of life

2197
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:55,296
I'm not I'm not trying to tell you what dishonest story

2198
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:56,832
Except

2199
01:44:57,088 --> 01:44:57,856
April 7th

2200
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,136
Really f******

2201
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
Bored

2202
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,232
The part that I'm about to play

2203
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,024
Also kind of bored

2204
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:06,816
Until April 8th

2205
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
This part of a

2206
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,400
April 7th

2207
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:16,288
Part of this 10 minutes

2208
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:28,064
Just amazing to us

2209
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,368
One of the fairest interviews he's ever done

2210
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:33,952
And before you say anything I want to make clear about 1

2211
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,232
I don't think

2212
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:36,768
The pyramid art

2213
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:41,632
I don't think that the tankers are guests their Putin Stooges

2214
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,936
That's nonsense

2215
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,984
We simplistic and Rusev ovik mindset

2216
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
I don't believe

2217
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:49,568
I absolutely don't believe that

2218
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:50,848
I think there are

2219
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,664
Believe that

2220
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,688
Reality

2221
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,480
Abundantly

2222
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,528
That being said

2223
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,064
The network is stay.

2224
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:03,904
Most

2225
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:07,488
Like it's the best interviews ever.

2226
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:09,280
Berenstain Bears

2227
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,840
April 7th episode

2228
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Or

2229
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,424
He launches his

2230
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:18,240
Soros effective

2231
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:24,128
Didn't see an equation word on RT on April 7th

2232
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,944
So there is a there was an interesting

2233
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,160
I know I know I know

2234
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:36,928
So

2235
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:39,488
Here is where the interview starts

2236
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:44,352
Alex / listen to the artist

2237
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,120

What is strong decorative

2239
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,288
He's not mystery

2240
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:55,360
Representing sat interview at all I watched the entire thing

2241
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:58,432
I was thinking about like completely out of character

2242
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,456
I was thinking about pulling

2243
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:03,040
Clips from it and actually did record all of it

2244
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,624
What alexplayz my

2245
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,160
Oh no that's pretty much

2246
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:08,928
That's pretty much

2247
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,488
So we can listen to Alex

2248
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,256
Like

2249
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,024
Introduction of it

2250
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,816
Clips from his show

2251
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,120
Indicative

2252
01:47:17,376 --> 01:47:18,656
So here he start

2253
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:28,384
Cuz a lot of folks watching The Prison Planet.

2254
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,136
The world audience Erdos

2255
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:51,424
Archie's in Austin Texas catching up with radio talk show host and documentary filmmaker

2256
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:53,984
Sitting down with us today

2257
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:59,616
What does Christian in several months after Obama stepped in as president of the United States

2258
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,944
You make a documentary calling him a deceiver why

2259
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,016
He said he wouldn't hire lobbyists all he's done

2260
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,576
My power lobbyist

2261
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,368
Every level of government

2262
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,208
Head of the country over the oligarchs the international bankers

2263
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,256
Alex Jones

2264
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,792
The repeating narrative

2265
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:25,728
Individually

2266
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,032
They're just people who he

2267
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:29,568
Has deemed

2268
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:32,896
Some of them

2269
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,712
Some of them

2270
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,504
But not all

2271
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
Fasting

2272
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,952
He's at the interviewer asks

2273
01:48:46,464 --> 01:48:47,232
He's a Deceiver

2274
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,536
Why

2275
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:51,072
Rehashing of the Obama

2276
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:51,840
Deception air

2277
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,912
About this that's not good to start out with

2278
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,448
In this next clip

2279
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,664
And what you say is that the American government is a puppet of the New World Order is that is that right

2280
01:49:06,176 --> 01:49:08,224
Absolutely I am a patriot

2281
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,040
I believe in the free-market I believe in the red white and blue

2282
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,576
Constitutional rights

2283
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:16,160
And everything that the supposed government is doing

2284
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,464
Is the opposite of that

2285
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:19,488
Okay

2286
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:20,256
Cool

2287
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:25,120
The interviewer started by thing that you call Obama

2288
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:25,888
A Deceiver

2289
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:32,288
And this next clip Alex literally says that Obama is a fever one thing that I really want to point out

2290
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:37,664
Really want everybody to be clear on and I think everybody kind of

2291
01:49:38,432 --> 01:49:42,528
Those people who say they're into the Constitution always a constitution

2292
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,064
Bill of Rights

2293
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:48,416
And really never talked about any of them other amendments passed

2294
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:55,072
No cuz they really don't like those amendments

2295
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:06,848
Like popiah AOL

2296
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
I like those guys

2297
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
The everything past the

2298
01:50:12,992 --> 01:50:14,016
Or whatever

2299
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:19,392
Most of them take everything past the Second Amendment and none of the Constitution

2300
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:20,928
Yeah

2301
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,744
Alex actually

2302
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,280
Recalls Obama a Deceiver

2303
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:26,048
Right

2304
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,352
How do you say Barack Obama as

2305
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:32,192
American president President Barack Obama is the deceiver

2306
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:34,752
He says one thing

2307
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,544
Does the opposite

2308
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,080
And that's the only

2309
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:40,640
Sing that is constantly Barack Obama

2310
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:42,176
Building self

2311
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,248
Vampire establishment

2312
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,296
But really he is completely

2313
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:50,112
And paid for

2314
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:51,392
Body scrub

2315
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,160
Here's the next

2316
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:56,000
How do you see the future of American politics

2317
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:59,584
United States is corrupt

2318
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:04,960
That has been used by International Banks in the global crime syndicate

2319
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:07,776
To expand their empire worldwide

2320
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,080
Okay

2321
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:18,272
Ukraine

2322
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:22,368
Is one of the people who are like

2323
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,136
Free with Artie

2324
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,672
Where Alex list.

2325
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:26,976
This interview

2326
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:27,744
I'm out on

2327
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:28,768
April 6th

2328
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:29,792
2000

2329
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:31,584
2 days before

2330
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:35,936
The episode is on April 6th

2331
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:39,776
2009 two days before the episode we listen to.

2332
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:46,176
If I was going to make a prediction based upon introduce this clip I would guess what

2333
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
No mention of

2334
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:52,576
Alleged that the Bilderberg Group from the world who are they exactly

2335
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,160
The number group is the Queen of England

2336
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,952
The queen of the Netherlands

2337
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,744
Is Rockefellers

2338
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,608
It is the Rothschilds they write books they brag about it for years ago saying

2339
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:07,168
He wants $12 in US dollars

2340
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,008
And they're these incredibly wealthy powerful families

2341
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,288
The play with the nation

2342
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,128
No mention of sore

2343
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:17,920
Not a single man

2344
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,760
Weird

2345
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:24,320
Today's earlier

2346
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:28,928
Just two days earlier

2347
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,632
So so you would you would suspect

2348
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,704
Russian media Outlets

2349
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,984
I want to talk to you about this

2350
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:43,264
Cuz I have a lot of field

2351
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:44,288
Yeah

2352
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,104
This is very interesting for a number of reasons

2353
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,128
1

2354
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:52,736
I think you're are super not out of the norm for things he normally says

2355
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,784
He's not waiting outside of Israel

2356
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:58,368
What is the difference

2357
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,160
Feel when it's being presented on the state

2358
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:00,928
Media channel 4

2359
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,768
When Alex is it Obama's deceive

2360
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,816
It's not saying that he's a liar

2361
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:09,120
That's things that Russia is right not to

2362
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:10,656
Proposed

2363
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:12,448
In the talks between Obama

2364
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:18,080
When I was says that you asked the US has a corrupt Empire

2365
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:21,408
Croton

2366
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,176
Georgia

2367
01:53:22,432 --> 01:53:26,272
What's going on in Syria

2368
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,296
And that the US

2369
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,600
Response is simply an expression of the

2370
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,184
Yeah it takes on a very different

2371
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,208
Feel in that

2372
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:34,976
Contact

2373
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:39,072
But all that is good and well but really interest me about this interview is

2374
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,608
Who is interviewing out

2375
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:41,376
What

2376
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:45,472
The interview was being done by a woman named Anastasia

2377
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,776
Who is the prominent journalists cigar teeth

2378
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
For a while

2379
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,848
In addition to being a reporter

2380
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:54,176
She's also the daughter of Vitality vitality cherkin

2381
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:59,040
You may remember him from earlier as Russians Russia's ambassador to the UN

2382
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,576
Who sang the Russian

2383
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,856
Miquel

2384
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,904
If the US put their radar

2385
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,184
Republic

2386
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:07,744
We're

2387
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:14,912
Been a prominent member of Russia's Foreign Relations team

2388
01:54:16,192 --> 01:54:17,472
Representative

2389
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,752
Do you win since April

2390
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:20,288
2006

2391
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,944
And even quicker to veto UN resolution

2392
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,808
He was the one to

2393
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,600
DeVito 13 resolution

2394
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:35,904
Many of which were about human rights abuses

2395
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:38,208
A few others about George

2396
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:41,024
Ukraine

2397
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,048
3 resolution

2398
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,864
Before becoming Russia's main man at the UN

2399
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:47,680
Vitality

2400
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,704
Having

2401
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:50,496
Risen up from the US desk

2402
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,592
To becoming the Ambassador

2403
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:56,640
The Belgium and Canada in the early

2404
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,432
Anderle

2405
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,200
2000

2406
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:01,760
My point here is working is

2407
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:05,344
Big player in Russian International politics in Florida

2408
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,624
And it seems

2409
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,416
We can stretch of credulity

2410
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,464
Imagine that Alex wouldn't know who

2411
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
He is

2412
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:13,792
Given the fact that chicken was a naysayer with

2413
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:16,864
The most the United Nation

2414
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,912
I find it very unlikely though

2415
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,680
But he wouldn't

2416
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:20,704
He was being interview

2417
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:24,800
Daughter

2418
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,336
I don't think that's possible

2419
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:29,664
The only way that it's not possible

2420
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,992
Is it Alex has no idea about the world's he pretends

2421
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:33,760
Know about

2422
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Which

2423
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,064
I accept

2424
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,832
Let's

2425
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:40,160
Pump the brakes on that would real quick

2426
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:41,440
I respect that

2427
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:42,464
I respect

2428
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:47,328
The best I'm going to give you a 50/50 yesterday on that

2429
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,352
I don't know.

2430
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:51,424
Now you might also remember Vitality chicken is one of

2431
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
Sue died

2432
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,776
Special circumstances

2433
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:57,824
Single action

2434
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,360
I have no idea

2435
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:01,152
He really died of a heart attack is made

2436
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:04,480
The media people have suggested or if it was a political murder

2437
01:56:04,992 --> 01:56:07,808
He's a very strong possibility that

2438
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
Coincidence

2439
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,344
Wasn't

2440
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:11,648
Be home

2441
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:15,744
This is just random

2442
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:22,656
Like he was like he was 35

2443
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,424
You know

2444
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,960
No you

2445
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:26,752
For his birthday

2446
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:30,080
Look I don't want to I don't want to talk about

2447
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,616
Too much because I think

2448
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,920
There are parts of it that are Trucking

2449
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,712
Yeah there were these nine

2450
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:36,736
Who died

2451
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,272
In the nine months

2452
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,296
The election

2453
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:40,064
Right

2454
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,088
And they were all

2455
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,160
Extant

2456
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:45,440
Diplomatic people in

2457
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:51,840
949

2458
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,608
In honor of that

2459
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:56,448
Yeah I remember that

2460
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,216
Delicious

2461
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,240
Horsey Sauce

2462
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:02,848
I don't like the conspiracies to go around about this

2463
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:05,920
We're trying to tie them all together in the same way that I don't

2464
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:08,224
Pharisees that Mike Adams and Alex

2465
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,504
It's about the idea of like

2466
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,808
People who are like

2467
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,088
MetroHealth

2468
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:13,856
Cures and

2469
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,648
Call Vic

2470
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:16,672
Vehicle went

2471
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,208
Like these are

2472
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:18,976
Young people

2473
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,352
There's not there's no reason

2474
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:25,888
All of them are

2475
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,448
And it's just suspicious

2476
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,216
Doesn't prove

2477
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,776
It doesn't necessarily

2478
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:35,360
Daughter

2479
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,920
It's entirely possible it's all just

2480
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:40,480
So I don't know I don't know what

2481
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,576
Cheerleader

2482
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,392
Anything but

2483
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,952
A lot

2484
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:51,744
8888

2485
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:58,400
That analogy it is a million arrows pointing to Bugs Bunny's hole

2486
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:01,728
You cannot prove bug bunnies down there

2487
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:05,056
But God damn it if there weren't a lot of arrows

2488
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,104
And Circumstance

2489
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,128
This stuff

2490
01:58:08,384 --> 01:58:08,896
Really

2491
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:09,664
Bothers me

2492
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:12,992
Yeah it's only because

2493
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:13,760
It's happening

2494
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,320
And I always wish happy

2495
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:21,440
Revelations happen later

2496
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,976
You like

2497
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:28,096
No you got to deal with it but I wish that

2498
01:58:28,608 --> 01:58:30,656
The store Rose pivot

2499
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:34,240
You know I don't know two-month

2500
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:38,336
Blindsided

2501
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:47,040
Another want to talk about it we were having a conversation in 2009 than we were in 20 acres

2502
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,904
I know

2503
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,672
It is weird

2504
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:58,816
FEMA camp stuff that was so fun 2009

2505
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,608
I thought we could keep going

2506
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:03,168
Great ride

2507
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,448
Is introduced Olmos

2508
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:08,032
I want I want a

2509
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:09,568
But

2510
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:10,592
I'm

2511
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,872
I'm very self-conscious

2512
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:12,896
And I'm very

2513
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,688
It's about a lot of this

2514
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:17,760
This is so frustrating

2515
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:19,296
It's still frustrating

2516
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,088
It's hard to make sense of

2517
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:27,744
I want I want to have I want to be free

2518
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,584
I want to save it you know

2519
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,656
The guardian is right about all kinds of s*** but

2520
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:36,960
I think you take we can

2521
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:44,128
Hard take that

2522
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:46,944
Boiling that Takis

2523
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,712
It's it's

2524
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,992
Unrewarding

2525
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:50,528
On some level

2526
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,320
For all these months

2527
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:53,600
Waiting for

2528
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,624
Talk about Sarah

2529
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:55,904
Yeah

2530
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,672
He does

2531
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:57,696
It's also

2532
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,464
Coincidental

2533
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,000
Around a very

2534
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,280
Specific hotspot

2535
02:00:01,536 --> 02:00:04,608
Dean Russo American religion

2536
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:05,632
He was in a

2537
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:06,656
Review by art

2538
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:08,704
Two days prior

2539
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:10,240
And a month

2540
02:00:10,496 --> 02:00:11,776
Before Soros did

2541
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,056
Interview but how like

2542
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,080
We need

2543
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,384
Attack

2544
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,664
Russia

2545
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:20,224
And we still

2546
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,248
Can't say

2547
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:22,272
Anything

2548
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,320
It really bums

2549
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
But

2550
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:27,392
Is the path of honesty

2551
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,672
So I'm okay

2552
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:31,488
Anyway Jordan

2553
02:00:31,744 --> 02:00:33,024
I don't know what to tell you

2554
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,816
But will be back

2555
02:00:35,072 --> 02:00:40,448
Next episode

2556
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,800
Talking like it you hate not knowing this isn't it

2557
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:48,128
Furious

2558
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:53,504
Or at the very least it's a thing that in order for you to know would require

2559
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:54,272
Contacts

2560
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:57,344
At the level

2561
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,904
God I wish we could pretend

2562
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:06,304
What if you are hiring

2563
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,144
We will pay you nothing

2564
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:13,216
II

2565
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:14,240
It's parts

2566
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,544
Partially also like

2567
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,592
The last episode we did on Friday

2568
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:19,872
That was f******

2569
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:21,920
That was heavy

2570
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:23,200
Yeah

2571
02:01:23,456 --> 02:01:24,480
Kind of an episode off

2572
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:28,320
Coming back

2573
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,368
Dammit

2574
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:34,976
I'm human

2575
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,512
I would like to walk

2576
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,792
I would like

2577
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,560
I would like

2578
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,376
We're doing the show in Austin

2579
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Sometimes it's

2580
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:42,912
Various

2581
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:44,704
Difficult to get

2582
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,496
You know

2583
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:47,520
Contacts

2584
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:53,920
Actually we have on our description on items

2585
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:59,040
Variably hard to get through

2586
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,344
I would love

2587
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:03,648
For the last episode

2588
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,208
Real

2589
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,232
Except

2590
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:08,000
Of

2591
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,072
I would love for the next episode

2592
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:11,840
The beach

2593
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:16,704
Dance on his face

2594
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,824
Here's what I'm excited

2595
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:23,616
What if

2596
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:26,944
Alright this is my this is my great excitement

2597
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:33,344
Some kind of Philip K Dick's story

2598
02:02:33,600 --> 02:02:35,648
Would love desperately all right

2599
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,416
So

2600
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,440
Alex

2601
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:39,488
In 29

2602
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:46,400
Is living in an actual parallel universe to Alex in 2009

2603
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:48,448
How many year

2604
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:51,520
So every 2019 episode

2605
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:57,920
Has a direct parallel to a 2009 episodes

2606
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:01,760
The bigot in the High Castle

2607
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:16,864

02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:35,040
I've got to get

2614
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,576
Flow my tears

2615
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:37,600
The police band

2616
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:51,936
Go home and tell your mother you're ubik

2617
02:03:58,336 --> 02:04:01,920
We are a group called go home and tell your mother you're not a bigot

02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200
We're also on the X

02:04:03,456 --> 02:04:06,272

Describe Libra View

02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:22,656
Leaving Eldridge review those are twice as I get it I get it

2623
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:35,456
Killed anybody probably led people down so bad Road probably.

2624
02:04:35,712 --> 02:04:41,856
Like young women into heroin and I'm not throw the said they probably died as a result of

2625
02:04:42,112 --> 02:04:43,136
That I'm not Rose.

2626
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:48,256
But he didn't kill anybody but one guy technically probably did

2627
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:52,096
Arika in this episode and that guy is Alex Jones

2628
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:54,400
Holding

2629
02:04:56,448 --> 02:05:00,032
Alex
