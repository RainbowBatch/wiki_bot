1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,616
Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Yep

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
Are we going to live

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
How are we going to live how we're going to make it

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064
What do we do

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,856
Are we going to make it through this

8
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:34,560
I really thought you were trying to do like a song lyric

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,376
What is the reference

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,960
And the only thing I could come up with is that Daniel Bedingfield song

11
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,408
Schmidt's

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,944
With this too shall pass

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,504
Natasha Bedingfield brother

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Field with one hit

15
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
Early 2000s mix

16
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:07,584
From my phone

17
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Where's the third hit off that album

18
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,712
Remember what it was

19
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,160
Told you I don't know either.

20
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:38,560
Never heard before my life got the bangers

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,008
Find are fun

22
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
Plenty of fun adventure

23
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
2009

24
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
We're back in the past

25
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
To pay a visit to Alex

26
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
See what was going on in his world

27
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,856
Further into tea party adjacent

28
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,648
And develops narratives

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
It will linger

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
That was off the top of my head

31
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
Goodreads

32
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,168
I'd like to take a little more

33
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
Alright

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:24,128
You are now

35
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:33,088
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:38,464
Caribbean black action

37
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
I don't want

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
Thank you David

39
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,216
You know in the context of our

40
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
Distracted really in the context of our last episode

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
In regards to how he feels about

42
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
How does he feel about a Caribbean black axe

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,296
Does he give us the give or take on it

44
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
Doesn't like

45
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
I think he thinks Jar Jar Binks his exile

46
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
What is terrible

47
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,208
Something like this

48
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
There would not be a

49
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,192
Mountains Galaxy

50
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
Jodie Whittaker is doing a fantastic

51
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,432
At the job by the way. I know this is important

52
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,992
Galaxy

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,808
We were seeing all these established

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,112
Almost seems like every single day

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
He hasn't new weird thing

56
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
Using two

57
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:42,720
Approve

58
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
Did the government is oppressing the

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,376
We had the miac report which is his biggest piece of proof which is

60
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
Water Horse

61
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
All sorts of other little things

62
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Is the POP3 trying to

63
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:57,824
Sort of

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Create

65
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,872
History of Oppression

66
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
And for himself

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Patriots like a motherfuker right now you are bringing it

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,928
I'm not even reading off anything these are just I am

69
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
Today we're going to be going over there

70
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
The

71
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
The March

72
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
23rd

73
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,519
March 23rd 2009

74
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
Episode

75
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,079
What super fascinated me is like

76
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
Every single day

77
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
There is something new

78
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
It's being added

79
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,943
Tuesday

80
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,479
Larger narrative

81
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
It all branches out from the miac report

82
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,367
Where is using it to argue that

83
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,647
They're staying

84
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:44,671
People like me and

85
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,207
Supporters of Ron Paul

86
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,767
Misunderstanding

87
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
New

88
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:54,399
He's growing on the branches everyday we get one

89
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,935
Today but Alex is

90
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,215
Is declaring classical tea

91
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
It's like we're Iraq or Afghanistan

92
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,895
But

93
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
Eternal Secret

94
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,807
Where they specifically talk about

95
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,855
The protest of last November

96
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,815
The park across the street

97
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
His brother Wayne Dallas

98
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,799
Specifically

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:39,455
Terrorism Posse Comitatus

100
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
This is 180Â°

101
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
From freedom

102
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,767
This is classical

103
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
As opposed to

104
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,703
Iroko codes

105
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,263
Like Alex's got this report there's an army report

106
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
City of God

107
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
He's going to get into it a little bit and we'll discuss it

108
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
None of this stuff is

109
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,967
Except

110
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
If this report doesn't

111
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Specifically mentioned

112
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
The Texas

113
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
The feds

114
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
As much as

115
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
All the cities

116
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
That they had protested

117
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
In a list of like 46

118
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:33,983
Austin

119
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:40,127
Have to take the show as Alex

120
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
I like I like him too

121
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
Military

122
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
You realize that

123
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,391
The military is like they don't always have to wear uniform

124
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:56,255
People in the military could be there too

125
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655
To be a part of the protest

126
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
Further I don't trust Alex

127
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
To know the difference

128
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Patrina playing close

129
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
Person

130
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,335
I think that he would assume

131
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Anybody who's

132
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
Maybe dozen

133
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
Does

134
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Got2b

135
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
I will tell you how you can

136
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Figure it out

137
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,575
The cut of their jib

138
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,671
If you don't like the cut of their jib

139
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Military

140
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Definitely

141
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
So Alex

142
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
Complains that

143
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
He's the only Norm

144
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Prison life

145
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,679
And then brags about cells

146
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,431
Just watch

147
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,231
It's also been my daddy

148
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,839
And it isn't so much that I'm some special or wonderful

149
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,423
Other people have lost

150
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,959
Or never learned

151
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Themselves

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,103
What powerful creatures we all are

153
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
You just don't have any initiative

154
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,991
So doesn't that mean you think you're special

155
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,295
The proof is in the pudding

156
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
Number one alternative media website

157
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,207
Already services

158
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
You name

159
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,631
Define alternative news

160
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,703
I don't know I don't know

161
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
Give the s***

162
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
He's in the vest

163
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Market

164
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
The brag that mean

165
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
We are the number one

166
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:55,039
Freezy Cuckoos podcast in the world

167
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
We are

168
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,111
Gruber.

169
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,951
The number one Alex Jones

170
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,263
There's a

171
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
There's a Mite that could be involved there

172
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
Just adorable person

173
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,199
Believe yourself

174
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Special

175
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,807
It's really just sort of like that thing of like

176
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,623
Jesus saying you will do what I do and more

177
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Convey to his

178
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
You could do everything I can do but I

179
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:35,999
Just know

180
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,279
And do it and you guys apply

181
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
Who would even think that

182
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,143
Jesus thought he was some sort of special

183
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
What makes him different from the rest

184
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
Is there any difference

185
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:50,847
Also small point the expression is the proof of the pudding is

186
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
Anyway

187
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
Actually

188
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
I do think that people for it it's like a regional colloquialism

189
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,487
Proof is in the pudding

190
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,303
The expression begs the question

191
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
That's not

192
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Inappropriate

193
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Turn of phrase

194
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,191
Astrological

195
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:17,983
You should say it raises the

196
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Proof is in the pudding

197
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
It does make

198
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:32,575
Why does a why I don't understand how that doesn't make sense

199
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Yes

200
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:03,551
Things you can tell you how you can use it

201
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,087
The proof would be in the pudding

202
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
In the eating of the product

203
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:10,975
Alex's lack of principles

204
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,303
Describes

205
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,583
Politician

206
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
That are up

207
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Do some good stuff

208
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
These criminals Swagger around Washington everyone but the bankers

209
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:49,631
Globalist Bankers were swaggering around in the two people he's staying or standing out to him

210
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
Are them are his favorite person in the world

211
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,775
And Bernie Sanders who he knows at this point is a socialist

212
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,847
Because Ron Paul has been on Alex's show

213
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,343
Impression

214
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Counting him as

215
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,207
A contemporary of Ron

216
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
So

217
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,791
The enemy of my enemy is my friend

218
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
But he can't think that because

219
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,887
By definition of socialist

220
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
He has to be his enemy

221
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
Because socialism is really only communism

222
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,519
Communism

223
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
Authoritarianism

224
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,823
To take old

225
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,199
You have a theater me of my enemies

226
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
Could be my enemy

227
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,367
He has to believe

228
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,391
That

229
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,695
Bernie Sanders a socialist

230
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:52,095
Is in League with the globalized in League with the globe

231
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
But he's controlled opposition Dan

232
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,055
Advocating for someone

233
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
Controlled opposition

234
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
Anyway

235
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:10,527
It's just weird

236
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
He's an opportunist

237
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Opportunity

238
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:20,511
Opportunity here is Alex talking about the army.

239
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
He got

240
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,327
Everything the way he is

241
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,351
Describing

242
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Because

243
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
I'm not I'm not positive

244
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,215
He's done it.

245
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Please.

246
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:35,359
Because I don't want

247
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,503
Going on here but I think they're smart enough to know what's going on

248
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
That doesn't make

249
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,111
Davis arm document was written

250
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
That's why they used

251
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
Respect

252
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,359
It is the Federal Reserve

253
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
Mutton

254
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,759
Liaison with local MP

255
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
CC triple cross

256
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,959
Alright yeah

257
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
This is maybe like

258
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
12 minutes

259
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,687
And Alex doesn't actually get into talk about the story until about the two-hour point

260
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,039
Vaguely about what it is it doesn't actually reversed

261
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:53,439
So the document that Alex is referring to on this shows a document titled Force protection advisory 09-01

262
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
Dated November 7th

263
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,767
2008

264
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
Exciting

265
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:02,399
It really says the report was written with respect

266
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:08,799
Because if you take one look at the report you can tell exactly why he thinks

267
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,103
The report says things like quote

268
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,247
The November 22nd protests are intended as a kickoff of an ongoing campaign to organize the public

269
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
And take concerted action

270
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,903
Only the conscious action of We the People can save the nation from ruin plunder and total socialist tyranny

271
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,695
The thing is

272
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,487
What happens next

273
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
It's very clear from the context

274
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
This is a report

275
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
Quoting from

276
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:38,751
Which is linked at the end of the same paragraph

277
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
It's stuff that they took off the

278
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,919
The endless website protest

279
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,479
The reported superfair to the Embassy

280
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:52,063
Just describes them as they describe themselves mostly through quoting

281
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,879
The only purpose that serves is written out in the first

282
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
Quotes

283
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Provide situational awareness

284
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,999
Recommended mitigation

285
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,839
All it is is a report that's going out to provide

286
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,143
Awareness of the situation

287
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,679
2 people who may be

288
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
Please wear

289
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
The protest

290
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,871
This document proves there was targeted harassment campaign

291
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,407
From the Army regarding

292
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,687
Activities

293
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:21,247
But I fail to see proof of that Miss document at all

294
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:25,599
It does tell those reading to quote be aware of their environment at all times

295
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
Advises them not to retaliate

296
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Gate to verbal assault

297
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,279
It's that commanders and have relationships with local law enforcement

298
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,607
Threat because anytime their large Gatherings like this

299
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Not just from the protest

300
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
The Miz well

301
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
So these sorts of large Gatherings of people

302
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,543
Things that are absolutely

303
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,079
You should have on your radio

304
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,895
It's not necessarily all that weird

305
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
For that

306
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
The report doesn't say anything specific about the Army going to surveilled

307
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
At all

308
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,367
So I wanted to get a little more information on this type of

309
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,135
Report

310
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,415
I found a few others

311
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,951
Is of the same variety

312
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,487
Force protection

313
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,255
Advisory

314
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,839
And exactly what this report is

315
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
From a 26

316
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,143
16 Force protection

317
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
This advisory situational awareness

318
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:18,079
Where does Route.

319
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
Planned or spontaneous

320
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Coming up in the Navy want

321
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,247
To remind Department of Navy service members civilian employees

322
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,063
And their family members are reminded that large Gatherings of

323
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Violent gentlemen

324
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,439
These documents are called Force protection advisor

325
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
Because they offer advice on protection of the

326
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
The forces

327
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,071
It has nothing to do with troops being sent out to watch

328
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,863
Patriots it has to do with

329
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
Potential dangers large groups of

330
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Two people coming to

331
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,703
Together could create

332
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:48,031
If you read this document correctly there zero indication

333
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
This was written

334
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
For any Army members

335
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
Burbank protest

336
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,943
And a very strong indication that it's about preparing members

337
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
Community

338
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,503
For a possible worst

339
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,271
Case scenario

340
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
Things like telling people not to retaliate to verbal assault

341
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,927
These were Army members who might happen to be at the protest organically

342
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:08,255
Things like the report advising commanders to use random

343
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,791
Rhythm measures

344
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,863
Is in reference to operations on it around army base

345
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,143
This is not at the pro

346
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,959
They're talking about routine

347
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
That the Army engages in

348
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,031
On the basis

349
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
In these cities

350
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,079
Not

351
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
In like on the field

352
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,223
Out at the

353
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
What they're saying is that

354
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,367
Rather than stick to the routine you should random

355
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,231
That way they can't observe it and then plan

356
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,511
During the circle

357
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
Stances

358
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Large protest

359
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Senior City

360
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
Then what you should do is randomize some of the route

361
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
In ordered so no one can play

362
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Clear

363
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Incontact

364
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Something could be done

365
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
So they're trying to say that they don't want to

366
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Any plain clothes

367
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,343
Non-military people surveillance

368
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
That

369
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Orders that

370
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
Well there's that for sure also like all of the possible plainclothes people could relate to

371
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,631
Otherwise

372
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:24,543
The report goes on to say quote report all potential protest activities to the Army Reserve operations

373
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,359
But this isn't telling people to report all protest

374
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,895
That would be f******

375
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:31,711
If you're in the Army and you're going to

376
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
The protest

377
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:33,503
Lhr

378
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
That sort of thing

379
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
This report is

380
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,647
I've looked at all the other reports of this

381
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,415
Nature

382
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:44,255
Alex is just taking basically a human resources memo

383
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,815
Finding the little pieces like

384
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,095
Anti-terrorist

385
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,887
They think we're Tara

386
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,959
You taking all of it out of context

387
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
In order to add another

388
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,055
The history of government oppression

389
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
It's pathetic

390
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
It's it's it's

391
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,431
Interested

392
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
2

393
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
As to whether or not you would want to

394
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
2hr

395
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,671
You know what I'm saying if you are in the military and you're going to the women's March

396
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,023
I don't know

397
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,703
Aggressive anti

398
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Descent

399
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,567
Campaign within the military I feel like there might be something

400
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,383
Do that the only look at it

401
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
Reproductive

402
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
Let's say you are at one of those protests

403
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:41,855
Papa Bear of my own volition

404
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
That could be useful paperwork

405
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,535
But I don't know I don't know enough about the bureaucracy

406
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,703
Human resource department for the accuracy of human resource department

407
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
Yeah so I don't know I don't know what you would get out of it or what

408
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
It would help

409
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Mitigate

410
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,943
I feel vague picture in my head

411
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:07,967
You might

412
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
If you were the higher-ups

413
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
You might want to know

414
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,343
Okay some of our people were there

415
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,367
You know I don't know

416
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,512
I'm just I think it's just an interesting question as to

417
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,560
Whether or not

418
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,584
Sympathy

419
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,496
Order online

420
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
In place

421
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Be discriminatory

422
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,848
If You Were Somehow punished for going

423
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:41,248
Nobody

424
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,744
The knowledge I have

425
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,584
Do know is that this story is

426
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
In the document

427
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:59,168
It's going to go on to play

428
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
Later in the show

429
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
But that doesn't stop Alex

430
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Becky's been harassed

431
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,896
All the time these are

432
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,248
Intelligence

433
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,296
It was fronting

434
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,464
Parking lot

435
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,608
Special Forces bearing and they would

436
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,912
Michael threatening comments and

437
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
What's a special forces

438
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Does bearing

439
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:39,616
I have the shoulders back

440
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,152
It's all about

441
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,784
Specialty

442
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,832
You want to help you

443
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,816
I don't see any reason to believe these are special intelligence

444
00:22:59,328 --> 00:22:59,840
Military people

445
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
Hey Alex are you going to do

446
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
FBI agent showed up

447
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
He's got the unmarked

448
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,696
These are not good stories

449
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
These are real soft

450
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:05,120
Imperative I have been f***** with by intelligence agencies

451
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,656
These are actual

452
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,776
Or if they are there the week ever

453
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
What are you are you

454
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,384
Why would you even say I'm not going to answer that

455
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,296
If you're aware if you're driving an unmarked FBI car that you can see in your huffing and puffing up

456
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,952
Are you from the FBI

457
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Who's onemorestory Alex

458
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560
Is it doesn't work

459
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
It doesn't

460
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
But

461
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,216
Parking lot

462
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
I got out

463
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,944
I've got out of line I was dead

464
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:56,576
I'm going to go get groceries

465
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:18,848
Things like this happen over and over again

466
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
What happens over Alberta

467
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Airplane glow

468
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:25,248
FBI officers

469
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:39,840
Brilliant at Target Market

470
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:45,984
I guess I'm guessing he got into a fight with somebody caught him off and or maybe they cut him off

471
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,384
Something like that in the Target parking lot recontextualizing is like the military

472
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:53,664
I don't know

473
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:58,272
Really frightening stories

474
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
Zetabe

475
00:25:59,296 --> 00:25:59,808
You better

476
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,648
But also I think because these are so bad

477
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
They might be real story

478
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:09,024
Not necessarily government people harassing

479
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,008
Bicyclist

480
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,544
Bike bike riders

481
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
What does a professional bicycle necklace look like

482
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:26,944
Ivelt

483
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,504

484
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,040
I didn't know they were that talk

485
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Classic

486
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,392
Floridians and bikers are very very tall

487
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
I did not know

488
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Important

489
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:42,560
I don't know why I would do that

490
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,960
We know we've got this Army document that Alex

491
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728

492
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:53,824

That's the varsity narrative

495
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480

To service and send you overseas

506
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,312

512
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
Them all together

513
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
As if they're all talking about the same

514
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Uses it to make

515
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
1 G

516
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,160
Narrative

517
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,256
The draft in the house last Thursday

518
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,632
I should be yelling and screaming and hyperventilating

519
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:59,872
To prepare the feasibility of forced compulsory service

520
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,992
What is a mean

521
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,784
Nexus Tire

522
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Farm Direct

523
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,864
In support of combat operations

524
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
Giants

525
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
But also in

526
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,576
Hundreds of thousands

527
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Hundreds of thousands

00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,768
Little College

529
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
Mandatory

530
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,680
This is going

531
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,688
They are really trying

532
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,584
You see they're all of these pieces coming together

533
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
This is how they're going to get a lot of people

534
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,080
To be little doubt hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats overseas or something

535
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Which I don't understand

536
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
She's also baby

537
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,016
What kind of position

538
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Bureaucrat

539
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Alex

540
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,160
Just housing

541
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
Fill out paperwork

542
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,512
That's what they

543
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,584
I need the paperwork

544
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:59,168
And we all know that really plainclothes military man

545
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,288
Therefore

546
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,408
He's just found little pieces that seem like they might go together

547
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Just taking a little mallet

548
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:13,248
Jam the jigsaw puzzle

549
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Together

00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600

The color Dreamcoat

552
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,096
The time that you need to go through these things like

553
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:29,376
We can see all of them

554
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
Pieces that are each individually

555
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,704
I've come together to

556
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:34,496
Voltron

557
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,944
I don't know every member of the family as their own little patch

558
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Sure it's 28

559
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,320
Taking the amount of time and paying the amount of attention needed to be like

560
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
Alex is all lies

561
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,952
What are you doing

562
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Complaints about Obama

563
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
Really funny

564
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,800
Scores and speeches of Diane appearances

565
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,712
It's really funny that he's complaining about Obama have any permanent campaign

566
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,552
But he talks so glowingly of all of Trump's rally

567
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,088
How they're so great

568
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
Also dude

00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
If it if this is 2009

00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:37,472
We're still in the depression cause

What is bulshit narrative

575
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,576
Arizona

576
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
About

577
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
The fear is about what's going on in New York

578
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,792
The albeni

579
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,560
Story

580
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
But you guys get back to Schenectady

581
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,448
I like the Schenectady

582
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,312
Completely unfounded

583
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,872
Whatever you want

584
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,712
You know Friday

585
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:22,784
Schenectady New York

586
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
Schenectady

587
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,696
Schenectady

588
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
Hockey Chicago all Schenectady

589
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,144
Declare martial law

590
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,240
WE Post

591
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:03,488
Schenectady

592
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,632
Is a smoky special mayor of Obama's

593
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
And Alex probably has

594
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,776
Bulshit

595
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,104
Come on

596
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,200
Schenectady would never lie to us like that

597
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:26,784
Episode ends up being

598
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,320
Interview with Kevin

599
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,416
Who is a picture of note

600
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,208
He is made a number of

601
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
Asheville

602
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,608
Alex Jones

603
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,472
Closest

604
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,240
YouTube Bill Hicks

605
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,080
He's one of the reasons that a lot of people believe that Alex Jones is Bill

606
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:51,616
Gachas because

607
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:52,384
Kevin Booth

608
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Work with Bill Hicks

609
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,432
Card making

610
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,712
Movie about

611
00:33:55,968 --> 00:34:01,344
The Waco

612
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,208
How to show all the time I believe there was a time or two that he's actually called Alex bill

613
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:09,792
But I think some of that might be true

614
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,096
I really care about that

615
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,632
But

616
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
So he's on because he's

617
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
He's working with

618
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
I believe there's a reality show that they're going to make

619
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,920
Kevin was Keeping Up with the Kardashian

620
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,064
Freeway Ricky Ross

621
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,648
Who was the guy who brought crack

622
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,416
Into Los

623
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
Rick Ross

624
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,512
He's the guy who's working with

625
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:45,632
I don't know all the details

626
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,680
Believe they probably had some sort of

627
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
I don't think he's making

628
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:57,152
Kia dealer and then he went to prison

629
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,200
And then he got out

630
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Rick Ross

631
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:08,416
His name

632
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,696
Story of the pet

633
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:15,584
He's cracked and Ricky Ross

634
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Sometimes

635
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:24,288
I watched a couple of his appearances

636
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,360
But you still in prison

637
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,688
Is coming on

638
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,712
Is reality show

639
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,552
Ricky Ross is going to get out of prison

640
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,624
Wonder Park

641
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,904
In the first year

642
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
He's making this show

643
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,976
He's going to make $1000000

644
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,048
It's so he can show people how to make that million dollars

645
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,352
He's going to do it without

646
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Doing any crimes or anything like that

647
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:54,752
You just going to show you that enough

648
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:58,848
I don't think that's from everything I can tell from looking at IMD

649
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,832
I'm not sure I have no idea I don't want to disparage

650
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,392
But Kevin Booth is on

651
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
We brought on some assoc

652
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Rick Ross

653
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
And

654
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,280
Man

655
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
Alex

656
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Is so disappointed

657
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Because he just wants

658
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
What's the talk about how the governor

659
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,680
Selling drugs

660
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Rick Ross is going to

661
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:29,056
Come out and he's going everything

662
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,592
He gets into a conversation

663
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,616
I'm here with

664
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Rick Ross

665
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:33,664
Straw

666
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,064
Has a friend named straw

667
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:45,952
This is where the interviews.

668
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,744
This is where the interview starts

669
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,024
Be very clear

670
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Call Alex

671
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
Not getting what he wants

672
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,960
Are you worried about your safety

673
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Of course not

674
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Matter fact

675
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,104
As far as the whole

676
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Ricky Ross

677
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Trying to

678
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Bringing

679
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:10,784
Russian

680
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Russian fans

681
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,856
Sprint

682
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Is really not what

683
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,672
Doing

684
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,256
What Rick is trying to do it through with move on with his life

685
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,048
That's basically what

686
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
With kidneys

687
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
Operation together

688
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
Not

689
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Not to bring

690
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,056
Whatever

691
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,848
That occurred with him in the past

692
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
Corruption code

693
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
What is the look forward to

694
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,200
The future

695
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,272
What are you

696
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,624
Incarcerated

697
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Understand

698
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,864
To be like

699
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,472
We're not trying to expose to make a multi like media out

700
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
Since we can make it

701
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:06,848
You're going to expose the CIA

702
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,688
He's just going to lower the rate of recidivism

703
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:17,088
He's trying to just make it TV show that shows that there's another way for people probably social excellent

704
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Alex is

705
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,672
So disappointed

706
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,584
The friend of Rick Ross's

707
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Equally disappointing

708
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
Just like

709
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
I really wanted to talk

710
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:39,616
So you guys are not getting you want to talk about creating a positive environment

711
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
Right Alex

712
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Give this disclaimer

713
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Cuz he needs

714
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
Take control of the narrative

715
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Because he

716
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,464
Before they came on her promise this is all going to be about it

717
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
Call Dad

718
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
The main reason you're on today

719
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,888
Is the try to

720
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:12,128
Important

721
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:29,792
So he's basically saying I know you guys are saying this because he got two keys

722
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,496
13 interview so this doesn't happen like

723
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
What are you doing

724
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,824
So now this is interesting

725
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,360
Because that

726
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,384
Kevin Boothe

727
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,408
Comes back on the phone

728
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,712
He starts talking about the interviews.

729
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
He's had

730
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,504
Rick Ross

731
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
He's made

732
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,856
He reference

733
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
To somebody

734
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
It was Alex Jones

735
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
This world

736
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:03,840
Yeah I know absolutely then and liking my film to you know

737
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,632
It was sad that I

738
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,680
By Robert still his on your show all the time

739
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,216
CIA operative

740
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,288
Basically you're just saying that you know perhaps Ricky

741
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:15,360
Didn't make enough bribes on the local level

742
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,712
Through through various lawyers that can channel the bribes in Tavares politician

743
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,320
Kevin Booth references Robert David Steele

744
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:29,184
It says that he's on Alex's show all the time heard any appearances

745
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,208
Robert Davis

746
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,744
Steelers made at this point

747
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
But this is crazy

748
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,840
Because Robert is the guy

749
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,400
Who last year on Alex's show

750
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,496
Set that the globalist were kidnapping kids

751
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
I didn't know that

752
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,736
He was a guy who went back 10 years on Alex's show

753
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,064
I thought you was kind of a new addition to the stable

754
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,392
Especially considering the Robert David Steele the shows up all over the place

755
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
Jupiter project

756
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Mistrusted him

757
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,656
Eddie bird

758
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,776
He's a guy who's been Alex's

759
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,568
Kampfer years

760
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:24,224
That's crazy it's interesting that area has previously Farm

761
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
Let's

762
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:34,208
Smaller claimed that was also part of

763
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,936
You will have to deal with his new Rick Ross

764
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,056
I find it very interesting

765
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,104
Steel appearance

766
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
2009

767
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:57,759
Chick-fil-A

768
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,343
I don't think so

769
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,111
16 I believe you

770
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
He started coming in with his like

771
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:09,023
Devoted to unrig the vote

772
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:13,375
We need to get in the room with Trump immediately in a room with Trump

773
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:20,031
Get me in a room with Trump where there's no secret service

774
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,335
No

775
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,871
Aruba

776
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Anybody would want to do that

777
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,479
Of course he was showing up

778
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:30,015
Little bit

779
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,039
The lead-up to the election

780
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
26th

781
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,647
He didn't Factor heavily in

782
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,207
And like I said I

783
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
My radar

784
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
Is up

785
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,095
Could be

786
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,119
Could be the

787
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,399
Booth's just never let

788
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,167
Sushiya

789
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Then he has to have some reason

790
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:53,055
To believe that Alex knows Robert David

791
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,639
That's true that's true which is an even more interesting proposition

792
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Is

793
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,711
Vicki knows that Robert David Steele Devin

794
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,671
I'm not entirely sure but we will see

795
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Future holds

796
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
Alex has spoken

797
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,047
Freeway Ricky Ross

798
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Associates

799
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:15,583
Sounds

800
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Not very

801
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,079
Who he wants Alex to talk to

802
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,895
It goes a little differently

803
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:33,503
Alright only aware of the Iran-Contra Affair the forest

804
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,295
Wsvn weather

805
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:39,391
Iran and using the money to support the country

806
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,743
At the Congress cut out on Sunday when they found out the operation we were running

807
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:53,727
You just pulled me up out of the doldrums

808
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
Hakeem

809
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
Special Operations in Central America

810
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,359
Funny

811
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,295
Fighting the contras

812
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,343
He talked to him for like 15 minutes

813
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,391
Nothing of it is notable but it's

814
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,183
It is notable that

815
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
No idea who this through this

816
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,583
Diffuser

817
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
To protect the serendipity

818
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,399
And

819
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:31,615
Alex is reporting it as like alright I want to get you back on the show

820
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,687
This is veritas

821
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:40,831
Edith got to feel bad if your straw

822
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
Could have been that guy

823
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:46,975
I was talking about what I thought was a good thing and I was way wrong

824
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,255
I was way wrong

825
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:54,655
This should have gone the way of

826
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,263
Detox to him because very excited that's kind of the end of it

827
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
A whole lot

828
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
Even though it takes up

829
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,663
Yeah it takes up so much.

830
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,735
Like a lot of those too

831
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,783
And then

832
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Ballistic

833
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
To be one of his source

834
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,927
It is what it is

835
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
He wants to

836
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
DOD directive

837
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,423
Khalid

838
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
To our point

839
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,007
Into the RV report

840
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,287
And what are you doing

841
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,055
Is he lies

842
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
You just says what it says

843
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Absolutely.

844
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
Adam say

845
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:41,759
Basically

846
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:44,063
Terrorist

847
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,463
And maybe planning violent attacks

848
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,791
Basically decide to attack

849
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,703
And you can read that report

850
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,799
Cam

851
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,127
Order sheet

852
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,431
Dallas

853
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,695
Orders

854
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,719
You can

855
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,023
And the only ordered that is on there

856
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:27,327
On that third page write this report

857
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:36,287
It's just released this report that is it

858
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Imply

859
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:51,903
Also sitting congressman

860
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:56,255
A report and release

861
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,815
Vet said a sitting us congressman

862
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,911
I don't believe it

863
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:05,471
I do believe

864
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:10,591
And if it is it's only that these

865
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
You don't like these protests

866
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,223
Once again say

867
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,807
Ron Paul if you get a lot of supporters of romp

868
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
It's not even

869
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,879
It's not even that

870
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
It's not even

871
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
Lying about what this report says

872
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,535
Even more about like little specific

873
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,583
Commanders are

874
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,399
Remanded at the time

875
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
Set a reminder

876
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,079
Exercising physical security plan

877
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,503
No it doesn't annexes means sub directives with weapons

878
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:50,783
He's just making that up

879
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
What is the sub directive with like a regular directive has its own sub Direct

880
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
Sure

881
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,511
I just put it in the regular director

882
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
None of that stuff

883
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,423
He's claiming that bass

884
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,519
Commanders will ensure that

885
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
Random anti-terrorism measures

886
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:18,943
Program is conducted as an integral part of their daily operations

887
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,503
When is particularly important nudity

888
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:23,807
Static nature of our forces admission

889
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:31,999
Which often result in the establishment

890
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Only want to go after you

891
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
It doesn't say routes

892
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
It says routine

893
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Alex's

894
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,519
Completely lying about the word in there cuz he misread

895
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,103
Is mint

896
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,919
I know you meant to imply that

897
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,711
But I don't think he can read that

898
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,271
What is

899
00:48:54,783 --> 00:49:00,927
Non-moving about the static nature of their operations

900
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:08,607
Yeah but there's some directive is about if they were like

901
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,143
Some sort of Engagement

902
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,167
Surveilling

903
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
That wouldn't

904
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
Gstatic

905
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
That would be

906
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:16,799
Active

907
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:21,407
Well they're not allowed to move from their post

908
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:27,807
Monitoring the

909
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:32,415
Mighty suspicious

910
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:36,767
They're literally in the bushes just staring out of them with binoculars

911
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,815
So you get the sense there

912
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,095
But Alex is bringing two

913
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,167
Some weeks yet

914
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,983
Use hinges

915
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
Is hinging on like words

916
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Like

917
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:49,823
Route

918
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
Instead of

919
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,735
They got to sneak into they think we're going to attack them and stuff like that

920
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Read the right word

921
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,087
The level

922
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,367
Real f*****

923
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
The rest of the show

924
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:05,951
Pretty much

925
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:07,487
Is Alex talking

926
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,071
Again. Alan Watts

927
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,351
Alan Watts

928
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:15,935
Ross.

929
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:17,215
He is a

930
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
Supreme New World Order weirdo

931
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
He is

932
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Like

933
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
Are you just

934
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,151
Listen to him

935
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,247
I know I know

936
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:31,039
I doubt you're just basing this on on

937
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,063
Utter nonsense

938
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,343
Answer most of it is

939
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,391
He's kind of not worth going over at all

940
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
But

941
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:37,439
A couple of Clips temperature

942
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Circular this one clip here

943
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:39,999
We're just like

944
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
You are lying

945
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
You are absolutely willfully lying

946
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,167
In fact they say

947
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,287
When you go into the right thing was off the big thing times that work for this global system

948
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,847
On behalf of David like the club of Rome

949
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,663
They said the democracy was just too cumbersome

950
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
They wanted collect

951
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,735
Activism under collectivism

952
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,039
You're looking at a trainable

953
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,647
He is making the argument

954
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:10,207
That the club of Rome doesn't

955
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:11,743
Democracy

956
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,023
This comes

957
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,839
Publication

958
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
First Global Revolution

959
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,471
We we talked a little bit about the closest Ramen

960
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,543
In the past and how one of them

961
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
Principles

962
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,103
The problems of problem

963
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
The problem

964
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:36,319
That is 30

965
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
The consequence

966
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,391
Dealing with that problem with

967
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
Problem

968
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,231
Exactly

969
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,767
ISO in their book

970
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
The

971
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,839
Did they put out the first Global Revolution

972
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:51,935
Call Vivek

973
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
It's reference

974
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,287
Expression nature abhors of a

975
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:00,639
Of the chapter is a lot of horses

976
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:01,663
Cohesion

977
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
Plus there's a vacuum

978
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
If we're not careful

979
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,527
Extremism or deck

980
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
Dictator could end up filling the void

981
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:12,415
Declining cohesion the public trust in government

982
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,951
Replace bike

983
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
Hostility

984
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,511
Largely born out of a recognized

985
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:18,303
It's not equipped to deal with

986
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
4 problems

987
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,887
Elected leaders like the understanding of complex

988
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Political parties

989
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Concern

990
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,079
The hole is just not designed to respond quickly

991
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
Immediate concerns

992
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Country

993
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:37,247
Requires debate

994
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,063
Generally or at least it did when they wrote this back in 90

995
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
D91

996
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,415
By the time you've done

997
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,207
That's a very difficult

998
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:46,975
Process

999
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
That

1000
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
Democracy isn't

1001
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,047
Berkeley equipped

1002
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:50,815
Campbell

1003
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:54,143
Now the report is not advocating for abandon

1004
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
Democracy

1005
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
Exactly see very clearly

1006
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,983
Quote the crisis in the

1007
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,615
Contemporary democratic system must not be allowed to serve as an excuse for rejecting democracy

1008
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,175
So

1009
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,199
The difficulties that

1010
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,783
Like dealing with modern problem when you have a democracy

1011
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,343
They're very explicit about the ideas like

1012
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,647
That doesn't mean that we should get rid of democracy

1013
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,207
In fact we should find ways to supplement

1014
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,767
The public sector and things

1015
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,047
Is like that the private sector

1016
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,071
In order to

1017
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:26,655
The Democracy that we have reserved that

1018
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
Political system

1019
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Dealing with

1020
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,519
Challenges that we never thought

1021
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,847
So basically he is specifically like

1022
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:35,871
Because he knows

1023
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:37,151
If he's read the club of Rome

1024
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,503
The crisis in the Contemporary democratic system

1025
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
He knows that's it

1026
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,647
He's just straight-up liar

1027
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:53,535
Yeah but these guys always think those are like

1028
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
Coded language

1029
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,375
So it's like

1030
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,423
Covering their ass with that little stuff

1031
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,751
Like they're signaling to the people who are believers

1032
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,799
That this is what needs to be

1033
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,591
And then they're hiding behind

1034
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,407
To say that that's not what

1035
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,479
They're always

1036
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:13,759
They're always doing that

1037
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,343
Like that's always the the

1038
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,879
We're just putting

1039
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:21,951
Like

1040
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,487
You have to

1041
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
You should acknowledge

1042
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,815
You should acknowledge

1043
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,631
They clearly don't want

1044
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:45,247
Interpretation of

1045
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,575
What did you look at it through the prism of water

1046
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,855
Everything make sense

1047
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:54,463
If you look at through my crazy world view this one

1048
00:54:57,023 --> 00:55:01,375
In terms of equality

1049
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,703
Upholstery in terms of the people that you are speaking

1050
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,751
What they want

1051
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,823
Lie about

1052
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
The club of Rome documents

1053
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,199
Pointing out

1054
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:18,271
Where you think the club of Rome documents are lying

1055
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,599
You only further inoculate them

1056
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:25,183
Because already now you're saying

1057
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:29,535
Well whatever it is they say that

1058
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,839
Who sang is it is you know

1059
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,167
But it makes more sense to acknowledge it and bring it out

1060
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
And then

1061
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,263
I don't know

1062
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,079
No but I get what you're saying if you look at it

1063
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,871
Kind of makes

1064
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
All I care about

1065
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
Alan Watts

1066
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:52,575
They get to another story that's really interesting I want to see if you can tell what this is

1067
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,111
About

1068
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
Today

1069
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:04,607
Hillary

1070
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:13,567
Criticizing government leaders

1071
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,895
And that it is under election law now

1072
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:20,223
Jamaica film criticizing any elected official

1073
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,807
Do you know what this is about weight was this one of those

1074
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,183
Project Veritas ystyle thing

1075
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
Yeah

1076
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,071
Veritas vaguely remember this

1077
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Dislike

1078
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,471
I really remember some sort of like bulshit

1079
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,823
Documentary-style thing that's like I can't remember

1080
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:47,359
This is Citizens United

1081
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:50,687
Oh this is Citizens United the group

1082
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,759
15 Hillary the movie

1083
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,623
What's the Free Speech argument

1084
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
As it was

1085
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:04,767
Do you have to reveal

1086
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,327
If it comes out and it's clearly a political map

1087
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
And the Supreme Court sound

1088
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,399
You have free speech

1089
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
It's just been applied across the board

1090
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:18,079
Alex is on board early with muddying the waters about what

1091
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,127
Yeah this it wow

1092
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
This is that one

1093
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
Yep and I think it's a strong indication

1094
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,831
Maybe not though it's exactly what you would expect

1095
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:32,415
Respond

1096
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:37,791
Upon the things that he likes which is Hillary

1097
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:41,631
And he is not understanding the underlying principle behind this

1098
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:44,447
Well with case was

1099
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,983
Tell me about the idea of

1100
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,775
This is clearly this

1101
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Sure

1102
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,079
You're presenting it as a movie

1103
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,895
But it's clearly meant to sway political

1104
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,247
If it's political

1105
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,831
So the it was about whether or not you have to

1106
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,903
The in the same way that you regulate political advertising

1107
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,695
Donating

1108
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,463
Disclose

1109
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:08,767
All that stuff

1110
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:09,535
That's what the case

1111
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,143
Alex Azar

1112
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,167
Bulshit

1113
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:20,287
Jesus has led to horrible things

1114
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:24,639
Little bit more

1115
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,503
Skip this next clip cuz it's just him

1116
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,879
Again combining that.

1117
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,903
The Pfaltzgraff

1118
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
Story he brings up the dod Direct

1119
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,255
So it's just the two have now become

1120
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
I'm skipping it

1121
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
Really want

1122
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:46,399
This is one of my favorite things

1123
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
This

1124
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,519
I don't even know how to describe how so

1125
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,359
This weekend

1126
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
What

1127
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,815
Call New World Order propaganda

1128
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
Is from the 30s

1129
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,663
Basement water in your face and every episode

1130
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
Cobra Commander

1131
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,599
So he's early on it was all throwing a globalist

1132
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,135
That you

1133
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,439
Washington

1134
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:46,303
Play were portraying Cobra Commander is the good guy

1135
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:54,495
He's trying to say that there are externalizing what they're doing through the form of Cobra Commander

1136
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,823
The first five episodes of g.i. Joe

1137
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,639
Deprive the world of electricity by creating a superhero

1138
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,943
Episode cobracummander launcher

1139
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,247
Is Atlanta flooded the world's major cities

1140
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,015
With a lava

1141
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,879
In episode

1142
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:18,303
Try to mind control animals that is at least a good plan

1143
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:20,351
I don't understand

1144
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,399
Flooding places with lava at all

1145
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,823
Name to use to meth

1146
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,175
Make

1147
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
Any sense

1148
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:41,087
Understanding of the Northern Lights episode 20

1149
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:44,415
To conjure the ghost of a World War

1150
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:48,255

Mongolian to fight and in order to defeat these ghosts

1159
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,231
The most

1160
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:23,071
Technologically

1161
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:30,751
G.i. Joe has to find 3 artifacts

1162
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,199
Talk about the 31st episode

1163
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,879
Mesmerize you excited report admit

1164
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
In this one he's for gold

1165
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,975
Manipulate

1166
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:54,047
The crash the world economy and the shelter

1167
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:57,119
And he's bad gold is bad cash is good

1168
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:09,407
Your call

1169
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:16,575
Cobra Commander

1170
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,999
Where can I get to CNN

1171
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:40,287
Amazing program

1172
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,103
Your Cobra Commander Alan Watt

1173
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:48,223
The name that means that the snake system isn't the starting system

1174
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:54,111
These people talking idiot

1175
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,207
Mindset of playing audio video

1176
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,743
It's because if you watch it

1177
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
Video

1178
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
The plot of the episode

1179
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:02,815
Becomes clear

1180
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,607
In that episode

1181
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:09,215
It's not that he loves gold and he's trying to take over at Academy

1182
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,775
It's the Cobra Commander has created a weapon

1183
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,871
That mysteriously only destroys paper money

1184
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,271
So no rules

1185
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:24,575
Soda videos

1186
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:28,927
The video that plays over that is of like

1187
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:34,047
GI Joe guys playing poker and their money exploded

1188
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,911
So it was only 2 weapon that can fire from vast distance

1189
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:45,311
Anywhere within 300 or anything like that

1190
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:50,687
Shmoney it seems like you would have already done it

1191
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
Yeah I mean

1192
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,527
It is a cartoon

1193
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
Alright alright

1194
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:59,903
I'm just having a lot of fun

1195
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
With Alex

1196
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:01,951
Play

1197
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Clips

1198
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,583
From g.i. Joe

1199
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,631
Are portraying

1200
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,727
Libertarians I guess

1201
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:19,359
Because I watched this episode ever

1202
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
Snake masks

1203
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,735
I watch this episode

1204
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:25,759
Purposes

1205
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
The fake create

1206
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Rapping

1207
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
Destroyer

1208
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,743
Course

1209
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
To get cobra

1210
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:39,583
Right

1211
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
Now the printer

1212
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,143
Hold on

1213
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:44,703
That's good point

1214
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:51,103
Does a great episode

1215
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Right

1216
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,919
The issue is

1217
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,223
Not about gold

1218
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,759
Okay because

1219
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
The Cobra money

1220
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:04,671
Very clearly is shown to be non valuable things painted gold

1221
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
With gold on it

1222
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,703
Made out of Rock

1223
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:22,335
Replacing the currency system

1224
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,663
Is it nefarious plot where in these people

1225
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:30,015
Don't know it's still everybody.

1226
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,575
Add reminder it's charging

1227
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:37,695
Money destroying where exactly how

1228
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
Just like with any Project Camelot

1229
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,047
I have to figure out the plot

1230
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,143
Like a week from

1231
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,167
This episode is like

1232
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
The globalist

1233
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,287
Resurrect The Ghost

1234
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
What's the Korean

1235
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:01,247
World War 1 pilot

1236
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:03,039
You can't really pilot anything

1237
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
Play

1238
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:09,695
Yeah

1239
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,743
But Wonder Woman was Justin visit

1240
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,559
That's a feature of being a

1241
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:18,399
Very ineffective because you could actually see her throat

1242
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:24,799
I'm on 80 stand up get it together so we are one more quick left of Alex

1243
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,615
Get it together

1244
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,967
Together last clip we play at

1245
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,247
Recommendation

1246
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
Color of how to make some money

1247
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:43,743
Create a laser destroyed money

1248
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,511
Get spoiled

1249
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,583
Not like

1250
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,127
Electricity electricity

1251
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:02,431
I'd like to see.

1252
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,479
I really don't like how they all yellow Gojo

1253
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
I don't know

1254
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
I don't understand what Jojo

1255
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,647
How do I cure a Alexa

1256
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:12,671
Alex

1257
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
Real trouble

1258
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:25,983
Graphic design campaigns with billboard, use their own weapons against them

1259
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
Parties for the film

1260
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:40,575
I'm working on getting that.

1261
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:58,239
Well that's another issue

1262
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,991
Yourself man we have never done a money bomb and probably never will have

1263
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:14,111
The technology to do that

1264
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:17,951
He the guy is talking about a money bomb knows what it means cuz it's

1265
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,791
It's like a Ron Paul did it and it was like a really big deal.

1266
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
2008

1267
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:29,215
Make a deal 31st 2000 Alex had a Moneyball

1268
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,311
I'd like to remind you

1269
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,871
March 23rd 2009

1270
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:39,711
Got a year earlier Alex had a money box

1271
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,991
Here's the biggest question

1272
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,527
Right

1273
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,343
How does this guy know that billboard sales are.

1274
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,463
He cuz he needs his plan is

1275
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
Hyper-specific

1276
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,815
Any considers billboards

1277
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:58,143
Their own weapon that we must use against

1278
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,679
The goalposts love billboard

1279
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:06,335
We know that the globalist have weaponized billboards

1280
01:10:06,591 --> 01:10:07,359
Sales are dead

1281
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:09,663
Alright

1282
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,527
More importantly

1283
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:19,903
Alex is already had less than a year prior

1284
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,975
Alex goes on to have a money bomb on June 11th

1285
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:29,375
2009

1286
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:35,775
Another money bomb on October 14th 2010

1287
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,543
Money Bob

1288
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,311
October 8th

1289
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,127
2012

1290
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
He doesn't

1291
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Theory

1292
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,015
He stopped having money bombs once he starts playing

1293
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,039
The product

1294
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,623
Brings along

1295
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,183
Life appears

1296
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
No money bomb

1297
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,999
No money bomb in 2014

1298
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:57,535
2015

1299
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,559
In September

1300
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,839
We get a money bomb

1301
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,119
Mysteriously

1302
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:04,703
Right around the time Ted Anderson loses his license to sell

1303
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,775
Weirdest coincidence

1304
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,823
I meant something else has had a bunch of

1305
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Money bombs with a different

1306
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
82 hour marathon

1307
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Believe

1308
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,783
The timing of all that

1309
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,231
Evidence

1310
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,279
It looks like something

1311
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,351
It looks like oh yeah that's the way you get cash

1312
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,911
Infusion whatever you need

1313
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:38,239
It does seem like a number of them around the end

1314
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
But who knows

1315
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,079
Correlation

1316
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:44,127
Can't really say for sure

1317
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
Looks weird

1318
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:49,247
Episode

1319
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,015
In front of me is

1320
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,063
Alex is trying desperately

1321
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,623
T2

1322
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,391
To the plant

1323
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,695
Of his Patriot aware price

1324
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,255
Patriots

1325
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:07,679
All this stuff is all these little individual lies that on their own are very easy to be

1326
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:08,703
Now that's not

1327
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,287
Trying to bring it together into a much bigger lie

1328
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:13,823
It's more difficult for

1329
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,103
Through

1330
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,895
Because once he starts talkin about

1331
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,431
Bbod story

1332
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Mixed with

1333
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
The draft

1334
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:23,039
He's still non-specific what he's talkin about it

1335
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:23,807
Petarded be like

1336
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,599
Oh no I can track that down

1337
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:29,183
