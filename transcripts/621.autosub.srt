00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Just full of the most

128
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,391
Flagrant clickbait titles for articles which circle around ideas related to the

129
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
The secret and the law of

130
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Retraction

131
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:31,071
Unfamiliar with this whole self-help Graves were about a decade ago this secret is basically about how you can manifest

00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,399
And the reason you have bad things

To you with negative thinking

138
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,335
The basic idea is to force yourself to have positive thoughts about the

139
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:48,223
Things like money your job or people you're magically the universe will bring those things that you want to you

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,063
Bars of gold your dream job in the partner of your dreams could all be yours

157
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Continental

158
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,399
Exploiting people

Pretty cool

162
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
A certain type of people

163
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,919
Scrolling through his YouTube channel I got a very quick

164
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Can clear impression

165
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
This guy is repetitive as hell and he loves clickbait

166
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,623
It's just constant thumbnails of him holding up hundred dollar bills of titles like quote

167
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,695
Save this to receive unexpected money in one day or less

168

Kitchen telepathy

171
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,631
It's all just clickbait garbage

172
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,191
Which is exactly what online marketing experts luud

173
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
I need to do if you want to increase traffic artificially when you don't have good

174
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
Man bring back the guy wearing the green suit with money on it saying that you can get free money from the government if you

00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:26,783
Buy this book I want that guy back I am saying this without having looked into it too much

176
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,135
It's my understanding that that guy actually did have ways you could get money from another

177
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:35,999
Grant funny like that

178
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,023
It's not

00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:43,679
Not manifested

180
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215

Attract and repel stoplight

187
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:04,927
And attractive

188
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,767
Most of the episodes are 10 minutes long and about how to attract money

189
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,583
The most recent episode appears to be titled quote

190
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,631
Easily manifest more money fast

191
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
With the law of attraction

192
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,727
How about a week before that he had an episode titled quote

193
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,751
3 most

194
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,055
Powerful Secrets to attract more money fast

195
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:26,943
About a week for that a million dollars

196
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
At the end of February to do this hypnosis for money listen everyday to become a millionaire in 2012

197
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
And the last

198
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,719
And this last one is part of what really troubles me about

199
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
He seems really anxious to hip

200
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
Notize people

201
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,607
He's jumping at the bit

202
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Next

203
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Seems like he's really eager to hypnotize people

204
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
On his website is bio Reed's quote

205
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,663
When I began to uncover how the unconscious mind works I went from a nineteen-year-old with a self-published book to a best-selling author

206
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Catherine just a few years

207
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
I want to give you this

208
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
Success hypnosis

209
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
The changed it all

210
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,831
Free just click below

211
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:13,279
The supervillains plan you realize that 22 like innocuously attract enough people to hypnotize

212
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:18,655
Is all of them at the same time in order to get them to do your bidding there are overlaps

213
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:25,055
What is homepage there's a link to something he sells called the second mind neuro programmer

214
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:29,407
Great which is apparently meditation and visualization exercises they claim to be able

215
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:32,223
Rewire your brain to attract abundance

216
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
But I'm all for meditation and I even

217
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
I'm fine with some fairly nuages

218
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
You stuff but when you take a person like this and also combine all that with

219
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
He's coming out of nowhere to

220
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:47,327
To collaborate with Alex Jones at exactly the point where Alex is completely desperate in his life is falling apart

221
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,655
You have what I would consider a gigantic red flag

222
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,703
This could be a short-lived

223
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Collaboration but I'm really really honestly worried about

224
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,919
Alex's light reset Warriors apparently was something that you get a big hand in an oz promoting it is the most

225
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,967
Portent work he's ever done

226
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
What makes it not feel like

227
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
A small blip

228
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
On the radar

229
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
And then you added to this

230
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
On Jake's homepage

231
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
Right at the top

232
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
He offers to help you rewire your mom

233
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Quote

234
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,023
How would you like to hit the reset button

235
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
And rewire your body

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,167
Okay

237
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,727
Primary selling Ryan is

238
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,823
How'd you like to hit the reset button operating theory he is a super villain

239
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
I have a number of theories

240
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
I don't think supervillain is one of them

241
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,247
Regular Village

242
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,319
Occam's razor tells me that Alex

243
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,855
Credibly desperate for money

244
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,879
Jake is a rich

245
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Online marketing

246
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Scam guy

247
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
And

248
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
He is now bought access to Alex

249
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,631
That seems to be with the simplest explanation of all this is that's really terrified

250
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,935
Because Alex has left

251
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
These people very vulnerable

252
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
To someone who has

253
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,103
A gift of manipulation hypnosis

254
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
Techniques

255
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,175
But he really wants to use on people

256
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:11,551
Yeah yeah you know that the same time so this is the time. Of

257
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,831
The conman

258
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,599
Success to life

259
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,879
Where he does get

260
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,159
You know like

261
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
He's at his lowest point

262
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,023
Alex yeah Alex's it is entirely possible for Alec

263
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,583
Looks to be getting con right now like on a real level

264
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,911
I thought about that as I was listening

265
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,983
He hypnotized Alex

266
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,263
And I know

267
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
That's the case

268
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
It seems a little bit frustrated by him okay

269
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:43,039
I I don't I don't know if there's like a whole lot of we really like each other

270
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,831
You'll notice

271
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:46,111
Jay Quillen

272
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Do not stop plugging reset Wars

273
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,719
Alex does a lot of bugs

274
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,511
Is embarrass

275
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,887
Okay constantly is telling people go to reset Wars sign up for it with a couple of hate

276
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Everything

277
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
Every road leads back

278
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
After that plug

279
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Even Alex

280
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,543
This is like this is a little much

281
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
Oh my God we've reached the Event Horizon of a black hole

282
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Thirsty

283
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
Inside radiation Arctic radiation

284
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
I think

285
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,023
I think that there is there is something troubling about this Association

286
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,607
I also think

287
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
It's somebody ideas that are going to be Express

288
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,935
Over the course

289
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
This episode

290
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,983
AR

291
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,031
Really troubling things

292
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,823
Combined with Alex's work

293
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,663
Right maybe some of them are metaphorically things that

294
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Yeah

295
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Maybe could have some

296
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Self-empowering application

297
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,783
Sure when combined

298
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
With the

299
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,831
Infowar

300
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,367
Right right right

301
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,391
It's a little danger

302
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,743
Yeah yeah it is a little bit like combining this secret and

303
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
Terrorism

304
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
Give you the secret of terrorism which is a good thing that you want to read

305
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
So Alex takes

306
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
Forever introduced

307
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,055
I want you to know what's going on

308
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,871
Farms of slaves

309
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,431
I can fly over anymore

310
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
You not being empowered makes me feel like crap

311
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
I want to see you fly like a birdie

312
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,695
I have children in this world

313
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:30,047
They're going to live with your children I have ancestors that live with your ancestry

314
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
I'm connected to you

315
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:43,103
The opposite I'm not all about me I'm all about

316
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
I got power over people

317
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Unlimited

318
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
Consciousness

319
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,135
Knows we have that far

320
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Jersey's here

Fire

323
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,303
Got to understand the bad

324
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
I'd like very clear that my ancestors

325
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,119
Did not

326
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:05,887
Hang out with Alex

327
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:08,191
Example

328
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
The Confederacy

329
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
And buying where matter

330
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,543
I was just I was just

331
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,943
Just wrote down Confederate royalty and historically if you are that connected to your ancestors you are very

332
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Hidden Farms with slaves

333
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:26,367
It's up there

334
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:30,975
Today on this interview that Alex is doing

335
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
They're going

336
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,023
2

337
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,047
Look at the bad

338
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Accept the good

339
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,143
You got to look at

340
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:38,911
Get the bag

341
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,703
Clear-eyed evaluation

342
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
We're going to look at the bad

343
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,335
6 + H transmission that's coming out

344
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
Early December

345
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
I wanted to just

346
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,199
Talk about this

347
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,623
Most people don't sit around and read 800 Pages Declassified MKUltra files

348
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,487
You just recently last few days went back over

349
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,583
When you Siri

350
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,143
Perdition Church never heard this

351
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,311
CIA documents

352
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
You understand this is the opposite

353
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
This is how they did it

354
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
There is a there is an

355
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,479
There is one little evil Shadow today

356
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Good don't know about that

357
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,167
What year was posing how they operate what's going on

358
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,007
Cool so I'm excited at this point cuz I thought like

359
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,591
We're going to talk a whole bunch about MKUltra seems like it

360
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
I've read a lot of

361
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Those documents

362
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,599
And historians like them or at least

363
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,647
In terms of being able to shed light on

364
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:06,207
Atrocious things that our government is done

365
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,047
I think that the there's a difference

366
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,119
Between a clear-eyed sober view of

367
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,983
The historical monstrosity of them K Ultra program

368
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
What conspiracy theories

369
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
Believe it to be right I think

370
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,335
There is a

371
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:24,895
And I was really excited to discuss some of that differ

372
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,199
Prince but unfortunately I over prepared for that

373
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
Really

374
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,735
Matter

375
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:32,319
We're going to have

376
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
Drugging people without their knowledge

377
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,903
Very much so

378
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,951
Drugging people without their knowledge in eating babies

379
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:39,487
Nonexistent

380
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,535
Damn drugging people with their knowledge

381
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,839
Fine

382
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,423
We wouldn't have had sometimes A Great Notion without it

383
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,215
So Alex brings up Jake

384
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
Finally introduces him

385
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Eddie Gibbs

386
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,823
One of his credits is that he's from reset War

387
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
So that

388
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,247
5 minutes for you to break and come back into the main meat of this

389
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,807
Mission what's going on the actual

390
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,647
Hershey from reset wards.com

391
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
What I say is

392
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:14,047
Part of this massive MKUltra experiment that is society in

393
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,935
Honored actually go through six times and watch out his brand new courses coming out

00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,519
If you are a fan of Alex.

396
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,591
This is the next level because the way that the great reset

397
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
Officially is accomplished

398
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
Into subconscious patterns

399
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
Convincing us for just these little bodies

400
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,855
Using mind-control weapons

401
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:43,231
11 step process exactly how to break

402
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,023
Open up another browser

403
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:47,071
Go to reset wards.com

404
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,887
Right now as the first of his

405
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,215
2000 Colfax

406
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
Call Saxon they're always open the browser AOL

407
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
He's taking online mark

408
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
Cooking classes

409
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,759
So yeah this is

410
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
Is good

411
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,903
Not happy I feel like we're off to a bad start we are we say

412
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Everyday mine

413
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Control weapon

414
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Mind control weapons

415
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,095
We haven't even some Boutique

416
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Everyday mind control weapon

417
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
That's what I want

418
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:28,543
I thought that maybe he was being a little fanciful and metaphorical by saying that like

419
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,615
Society is an MKUltra experiment

420
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
No he means I quite literally

421
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,711
No I'm taking him literal for everything

422
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
You said is I decided that

423
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,551
Before I sat down in this chair yep

424
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
So he had me this drip

425
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,135
Really quickly into

426
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
What sounds like

427
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Call Shay

428
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:50,815
New just learning all the news isn't going to have we're going to be able to change it

429
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:52,607
We're going to be able to change it as movie

430
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,191
Learn how the mind control work

431
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
We are we clear

432
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
Real spiritual powers

433
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Cam

434
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,199
Alright that's what they don't want us to know

435
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:12,063
So there's the DD patterning yourself you got to reprogram yourself

436
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
Selling on his website

437
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,232
For been awhile right least advertise

438
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,792
Infowars

439
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Yeah you got to reset

440
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
You got to settle things down

441
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,704
Boy that's a familiar tone

442
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,008
You hear quite a bit

443
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,920
Shady group you just need to come in here put your hands on this machine and tell

444
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:44,320
Tell me all of the things that you've never told anyone else before and I you can trust me you need to distract yourself

445
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,744
Completely destroy whatever using my program

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,072
Destroying yourself maybe I'm the only person left

447
00:21:55,328 --> 00:22:01,472
I will be there to help put you back together and I promise I'm not going to do things that are

448
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:05,824
Weird

449
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,616
Recent Wars

450
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,640
Tom

451
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,712
Alright that's what they don't want us to know

452
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,136
Born with the goddamn as her soul

453
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,792
Realize the gorilla still there they erased the real us template

454
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,864
Interfacing with the universe British show the CIA document

455
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Okay this is getting really

456
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Scary at this point like

457
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,984
Overlap here with stuff that Alex

458
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,312
Skip into from time to time on his show but the vibe is going in a

459
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,336
A very different

460
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,920
A very unnerving directions even immediately in this interview

461
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
Alex's Methodist self-help conman Hypno

462
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,320
11 step program to save yourself from the globalist

463
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,368
Would you worked on with the hypnotist

464
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,416
And is the most important work

465
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,184
Do you ever done

466
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:57,792
This doesn't sit right with me and the prospect of Alex's terrorist edging

467
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,840
Constant violent preoccupation being

468
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
The Bible

469
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
Vague aspirational pseudo spirituality that

470
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,960
It's dancing around the idea

471
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
But you're not yourself

472
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Is absolutely

473
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,032
Terrifying

474
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,408
I kept trying to suspend judgment as I listened to this but it's really really a

475
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,480
You know a lot of people think that

476
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
Combining religion with terrorism

477
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
Is bad idea because you know you get that feeling of like I will be rewarded for these acts of horrific

478
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:26,976
Now that

479
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
That's terrifying

480
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:29,024
What if

481
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
You are already dead in your own mind

482
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,704
Have no fear whatsoever and we're willing to blindly follow with anyone

483
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:42,592
That's not a problem it's a bad combination people should be worried

484
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,664
This development is bad

485
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
So Jake wants to explain to everybody how we live

486
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,808
No I wish the Becca is a good neighbor

487
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,368
Exist on three planes

488
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,928
We just on the physical and mental emotional and spiritual

489
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,328
Emotional control grade is all the craziness happening to Anchor lock us into or lower

490
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Consciousness

491
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Are lower emotions

492
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,216
And that's the simulation right is Zuckerberg scraping the metaverse

493
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,008
Already in the simulation

494
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,824
Control system works

495
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,128
And that's what did me about your work

496
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,344
We live in a simulation all of reality is controlled by subconscious

497
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,672
We already know this and I thought to myself or what happens

498
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,232
If I literally reprogram my entire mine

499
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:35,072
If I literally program everything I erase all the viruses

500
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:39,424
You taught you liking the mine to an operating system

501
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
The viruses

502
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
Fake identity

503
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
This is not good

504
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,848
Very very bad stuff

505
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:54,528
This goddamn show supposed to be with the Communists being evil in the UN secretly being run by commies were also evil

506
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:59,392
And now we're getting into explicit talk about living in the simulation and how we have a tripartite self

507
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,208
Existing in three different dimensions and how the answers to

508
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,000
Brainwash yourself and then rebuild

509
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,072
Helpful guidance of Alex's dumbass of the Shady hypnotize

510
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
This is scary

511
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,472
Obviously this could result in nothing

512
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,544
But also this could end very poorly for some people

513
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,824
And the worst part is

514
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,848
I just I just

515
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,664
Here in my head the voice of somebody watching

516
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
These and just gone like

517
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,016
Man it's a good thing I don't believe in that Prosperity Gospel

518
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
. cuz this is real

519
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
Glitterbug churches

520
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,048
Now this is the rosh it doesn't have the

521
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,376
Document

522
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,424
Before the interview Alex was

523
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Constantly Bang

524
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
The drum of working to get in

525
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Into these documents

526
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,288
That's me and Jake

527
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,848
We're going to get into the weed

528
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
That's one of the reasons why I was so excited

529
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,456
Is that like I want to know

530
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,248
What documents you're talkin about

531
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
I want to read them

532
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,576
I want to get a sense of okay so you guys made

533
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:05,440
6 hour or 11 hour excuses 11 hours on boil 11

534
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
11 step program

535
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,352
Hours or plus gas Parts I think it's complicated

536
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,400
Job but they created this entire course

537
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:20,544
A really good handle on the dispatch

538
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,336
You think that's all I got pumped

539
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,616
To hear that and

540
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,176
I don't know if you can be surprised about this

541
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,736
It's going to be a while

542
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,064
Because we got up we got to

543
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
About nothing for a bit

544
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,048
And that's why I'm so excited

545
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Who We Are

546
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
Call sting weed and follow

547
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,408
Real before we sell we got program

548
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
And think about what's interesting.

549
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,552
Beacon

550
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
Of the world use the same word in MKUltra documents

551
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,744
Be conformed by the pattern of the world WhatsApp

552
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
It's the entire mind control system

553
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:18,144
Use predictive programming an unconscious hypnosis

554
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
You control it

555
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
I guess now Alex is trying to insinuate that the idea of being born again actually refers to the process of undergoing the rediscovery

556
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,848
Revere realself

557
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
Was replaced by the facsimile of you

558
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
That the globalist

559
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,176
Created

560
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
And Alex

561
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,224
Gazelle can help you with that

562
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
I'm a religious person but that seems

563
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
Deeply blasphemous

564
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Search

565
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,880
Is the public library I'm going to have to ask you to lie

566
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,440
This is troublesome

567
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:45,792
I feel like that relies Less on the sacrifice of

568
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,656
Jesus as of the Bible discusses anymore about

569
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
Sacrifice

570
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:55,776
We all know that it didn't really happen

571
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh boy

572
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
So answer the Bible verse that Jake

573
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:02,688
Is talking about the word pattern is used in The New International Version of the Bible

574
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,480
Do not conform

575
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,272
To the pattern of this world but be

576
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,064
Transformed by the renewing of your mind

577
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,392
And then you'll be able to test and approve what God's will is

578
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
His good pleasing and perfect

579
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
Goodwill

580
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
That's aroma

581
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:17,792
12 to but the wording is different in other translation

582
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,328
For instance

583
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,608
In the King James version

584
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:23,424
And be not conformed to this world

585
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind

586
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
That ye may prove what is

587
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,056
What

588
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,128
Is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God

589
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,920
The word pattern is in

590
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,480
Very very few translations of Romans

591
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,064
The book Romans was originally written in koine Greek

592
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,672
And if you go back to the original Source text there's no reason to add the word pattern to that sound

593
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,000
Text uses the verb to be conformed

594
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Then the word

595
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
To end the word Ionia

596
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,608
Which translates to a

597
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
The age

598
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:56,192
This word as well as the next word Toto

599
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,984
Meetings this are both in the

600
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,752
The genitive case

601
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Which means that they're meant to be taken together

602
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872
The genitive case in Greek is used to generally in

603
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:04,896
Possession

604
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,664
And in this case

605
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,944
It's just a general sense of

606
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,224
The things of the ape

607
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
Taking purely from the text

608
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:14,368
Sentences essentially saying don't get caught up in the extraneous things around you the change gear.

609
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,744
This is probably all sounding a little bit in the weeds but the reason I needed to make this clear

610
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,792
That's because the reason that Jake is making

611
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
Big deal about it

612
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,096
Is because the word deep

613
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,888
Patterning is used

614
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,704
In some of the LSD and behavioral experiments

615
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
Nmkl

616
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,776
We'll talk more about that later but

617
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,568
What is critical to understand

618
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:36,128
Need to connect the word d patterning existing in relation

619
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,152
MK Ultra

620
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,200
And the word pattern in this Bible verse

621
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,224
Lesbian meaning for

622
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,248
When in reality

623
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
Weird pattern isn't in the original tax

624
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
And the only translations that include that word

625
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:49,440
Republican 1978 2011 + 29

626
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,208
18

627
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,000
There's no meaning to this connection

628
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,280
It's just an attempt to make it a

629
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
Fear the evil globalist

630
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:56,096
Who did MKUltra

631
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,912
Intentionally trying to undo what God wanted of

632
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
This is like

633
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,472
Two steps above qanon

634
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
Honestly maybe not

635
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
Maybe one I am starting to think and I'm

636
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,592
Going to go out on a limb here

637
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,896
I'm starting to think that in the beginning

638
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,176
Heard was

639
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
Not with us

640
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
Because it doesn't seem like he has a clear handle on it anymore

641
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,344
Well the word got away from

642
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Beginning was the word

643
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:25,024
Workout away from there was wordplay

644
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,144
Such a mess

645
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,192
So Alex has got some complaining

646
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
To do and I think

647
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
I think

648
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Stupid

649
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
The secret

650
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Playing games

651
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,624
Listen for God you don't get it

652
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,824
Why your bosses are so scared because you're not like you some brainwash menu they're aware of this and using this against

653
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,152
Goodness

654
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,456
Two people

655
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,248
Unwilling to breathe

656
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
I'm willing to bring Alex

657
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,648
Nail the landing on that site out of breath

658
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,208
So what's going on here is that Alex

659
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Creating a straw man

660
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
Protected insulators religious

661
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Extremism

662
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
For being questioned

663
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,584
Criticized by people

664
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,448
I make it appear that any criticism of Alex's religious extremism is actually an attack on all of

665
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Christianity

666
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
I don't think

667
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,080
Most people have any problem with the idea of someone saying that they're connected to their

668
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Our conception of God or

669
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
Even saying favorite

670
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
Personal relationship with that deity

671
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:49,760
These are pretty well accepted and understood expressions of spirituality these days

672
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
Alex is claiming that he's being criticized

673
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,344
That's not true

674
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,392
It's not what Alex

675
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
Criticize

676
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,304
How much does it the literal devil has been trying to recruit him since he was a child because the devil knew Alex

677
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,328
Two critical two gods

678
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:04,096
Plans

679
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,936
Says that God gives and prophetic visions and allows him to see the future

680
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
How much does the god uses various people

681
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,568
The carry out his Vengeance on the wicked witch would be kind of hard to prove so

682
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,384
I guess you just kind of got to take people at their word but I say God told him to

683
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,920
The do something really horrible

684
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,992
Yeah I always believed the people on the left are literally knowing

685
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,272
Movie or unknowingly working

686
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
Sing for the literal devil

687
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,856
I don't believe that things like gender norms

688
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,928
Sexuality or things that are mandated by God

689
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,208
Not conformed

690
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,488
To his beliefs on the subject

691
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,256
Texas in

692
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:38,912
Alex's version of religion deserves criticism in rebuke because it's exactly the kind of thing that makes it easy for people to hate religion

693
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
I think religious people are assholes

694
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
Also Alex uses religion as a marketing

695
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,080
2 laswi exhaustively documented over the course of

696
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
The show

697
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,920
He's essentially a cartoon character of a bigoted religious con man

698
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,456
These are the things

699
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,992
This big-time like

700
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
Like that's just probably criticizing Alex for

701
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
Not claiming that he's connect

702
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
Good to God

703
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
Yeah

704
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:04,000
It's not a big time left

705
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:08,352
Somebody on Twitter person on Twitter

706
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
So Jake

707
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,984
Is pretty big into this idea that you're not your body

708
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
Sure you're not your physical

709
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Self

710
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
And I assume he is

711
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:21,664
Is totally fine with trans people or body modifications

712
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Anything longer

713
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,504
I will say that that subject doesn't come up

714
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,040
But the fact that he seems to

715
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Simpatico with Alex

716
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,904
You probably

717
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,696
Do the reasons cousin

718
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
He doesn't want people to know

719
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
History the control system is always operated

720
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:42,400
Books of the Bible

721
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:48,800
A tyranny always controls people is cutting them off from their higher spiritual faculties convince them

722
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:53,920
Even though your body is just a rental car that house is Rustoleum here in Austin right now use a rental car

723
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,968
It's not my car I'm just using it

724
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
Body is just a rental car

725
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,112
For many years and I know you are too

726
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Go to reset worship

727
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:13,376
You're not going to stop

728
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,144
Wow

729
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,728
So I got to say for someone who's so concerned with these lost in

730
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Unforgotten

731
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Forbidden books

732
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,800
So the Bible like Jake pretend

733
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Centipede

734
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:24,640
He's quoting of that last verse reveals that he definitely read some

735
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
Some pretty reason

736
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Translation

737
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
I'm sure he has a great grasp on the

738
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,248
The Book of Enoch

739
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
The Gospel of Thomas

740
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,808
Though and I'm pretty happy for him

741
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,856
Honestly

742
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,904
The Vatican secret archives

743
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,232
You know like he is referencing for the apostolic archives

744
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:43,072
Probably just so well secured and guarded because they contain information about

745
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
The Catholic Church

746
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,864
Internal working

747
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,912
As well as Financial details

748
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,472
They're plenty of Records they have that they would want to

749
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:52,032
Key private you don't need to create fun stories about magic

750
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:52,800
Nickel secret book

751
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Of the Bible that they're hiding

752
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:55,616
Yeah but they

753
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:02,272
Also also like I had a. Of time in my life where I get deeply into

754
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
The books that were

755
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
I think I could speak about this

756
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Grand Blanc

757
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:11,232
If Jake ever got

758
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:15,840
Specific about what he was talking about I think it's all just vague

759
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,680
Mumbo jumbo ideas about gnosticism probably

760
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Oh yeah I would

761
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,520
Prefer if you got into the Weeds on those little bit like I would like to

762
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
To talk about that one

763
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Story word when Jesus

764
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:32,224
This is a kitty just murders that other kid that one was pretty crowded back though

765
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,272
Dragons in a cave that was pretty cool

766
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:42,720
The thing is you know he has this like all there's all this stuff that they banned from the Bible

767
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:45,024
Same thing with Alex talking about the

768
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
Because nothing you can do with that

769
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
Even if you know a

770
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Baton

771
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
About the song

772
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
The subject that's going to be

773
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Pacific I don't know what you're talkin

774
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,984
Oh I wasn't talking about

775
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
I know you're talking about something but that's not what I was

776
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,336
Exactly

777
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,688
No one's mad about Alex starting reset Wars

778
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,064
I'm probably the only person in the world who pays as much attention as I do.

779
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,160
Message me whenever there's a

780
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,720
And no one has brought up reset work

781
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
No one cares

782
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:21,120
The World At Large doesn't care about reset a good reason to be scared about this develop

783
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Honestly

784
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,544
The idea that you're not your body and that this life is just a rental car for your soul that can be fairly a knock

785
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
He was platitude in New Age

786
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:30,848
Self-help circles

787
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,688
But you can also be an indication of a cult going in a very dangerous Direct

788
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:35,968
Contorts devaluation

789
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Human life

790
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:43,392
If you're not your body and you could strike a big win against the globalist by sacrificing your body and some kind of a suicide attack

791
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,952
It might start sound like a more compelling Prospect

792
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,048
Your body

793
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Committing suicide just

794
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
Just for the hell of it but all the people that you might potentially kill in the process of whatever you're doing they're not their bodies

795
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,544
Either so what's really the harm in any of it

796
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,640
I want to be clear that I'm not saying that this is the direction that this rhetoric is going but

797
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,944
The combination of these ideas being pushed front

798
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,016
Center being presented as Alex is most import

799
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,112
And the world of angry bulshit that Alex has created in the past 20 years

800
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
What is career

801
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
He's super concerning

802
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
And it needs to be watched carefully

803
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
What I'm getting at is

804
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,024
Like this could go

805
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Wheelbarrow

806
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:27,680
Yeah well I mean if you are not your body no one is their body and no human being really is

807
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,960
Is part of their body

808
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Which means really

809
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,008
You can do whatever it is you want

810
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
To the body so long as you don't hurt

811
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
The soul

812
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,616
How would you even gauge that

813
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
Exactly I

814
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,248
Do whatever you want

815
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:46,112
Do what thou Wilt as though someone might say oh boy

816
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,160
So Alex told Dulce

817
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,952
When they were working on this stuff is

818
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,720
Stickman

819
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,768
People got me so mad we're going to get some ships

820
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
I don't think they have

821
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,984
Going back for 56 months ago Going Back 2 months ago we were working on this film project

822
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Researcher

823
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
Hypnotist

824
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,064
Now you see

825
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,856
Really worried about this because

826
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,256
We're explaining what the enemy knows in the you don't see any TV channels

827
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
The only other person that

828
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,376
Conceptualizes

829
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:35,008
Show you in the CIA Zone admission

830
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,056
But they're aware of vision in the Bible

831
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
Literally

832
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Quoted by the CIA and how they control people

833
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,272
I'm thrilled to hear that the turd in the punch bowl David Icke is now the only person who's the

834
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:49,856
Been speaking Truth All Along such b*******

835
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,672
Such nonsense also it's so funny to hear Alex

836
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,208
Let's dance around this dude's credit

837
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,816
It seems very intentional that he's not bringing up this

838
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,864
Very large aspect of cakes

839
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,192
You cannot have a

840
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
Insist on your new show

841
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,520
To tell people bad news

842
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
It makes me think of

843
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,384
Steve pieczenik

844
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,784
Steve is a psychological operations expert

845
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,856
Alright

846
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:26,208
Hypnotist is just a personal psychological warfare operation to be

847
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Bring up

848
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,328
MK Ultra

849
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,376
Like I said

850
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,680
I'm really interested in them bringing up

851
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,448
Specifics

852
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
And

853
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Just such a dry well

854
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,360
Really pops in

855
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,640
Do MK Ultra

856
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:45,664
And

857
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,992
Document in the Declassified MK Ultra

858
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,552
Alex film

859
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
Is reset Wars course

860
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,648
I was reading back through these documents

861
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
Cameron's notes

862
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
You and Cameron

863
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,472
With subliminals all these Control Systems going on

864
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
Is she sleeping well

865
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
She is disoriented as to time only

866
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,944
It is probably in her second stage of the patterning

867
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,992
And I was like

868
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,904
You'll see a lot of people cover MKUltra even the mainstream York Times all these places

869
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,440
What are they say the headlines are

870
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
Government overreach

871
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,048
Scary stuff

872
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
Why are they doing it

873
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,680
And they're doing it because they realized

874
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:45,824
The mind is literally a computer operating system we live in a simulation that's controlled your unconscious consciousness

875
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,384
And they figured out how to manipulate and control it

876
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,736
I'm in the same way the only way that we're going to win is 2D pattern ourselves

877
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:59,392
So first of all I love the idea that Jake is blowing his own mind at the idea that the word deep patterning is likely Translate

878
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,952
Location of Romans 12:2 he mentioned earlier

879
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
So sad

880
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
Also the news

881
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,560
Discover why these MKUltra

882
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,144
Experiments happened did you know what so do the MKUltra

883
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,936
What's the Jake is pretending to have read

884
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:16,288
And guess what they happened because of rampant out-of-control anti-communism

885
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,688
These programs MK Ultra and its precursor is Project artichoke and project Bluebird we're all predicated on the belief

886
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,992
Did the Soviet Union that already mastered the

887
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,272
Please take me to mind control

888
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,392
If we stood any chance in the Cold War will you need to defensively figure these things out

889
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:38,048
What I say this is obvious I mean that it's so clear that I refuse to believe that Jake would have looked into this at all and not

890
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:45,472
One of the major sources of information about the MKUltra program Disney 1977 joint hearing before the senate committee

891
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Intelligence

892
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,544
And the subcommittee on health and scientific

893
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:55,711
This is a hearing where the event director of the CIA Admiral Stansfield Turner testified having recently found a bunch of new

894
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
MK Ultra related documents

895
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
As a result

896
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,039
Request

897
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,319
Money.

898
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:04,927
I've been destroyed these ones were accidentally sent to the cia's budget and fiscal

899
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
GoSection8

900
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,767
It was very thorough employee they were eventually discover

901
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,399
Much of this new information that was Learned was in line with the 1963 report from the

902
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Those done by the Inspector General

903
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
There's an added detail and

904
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
It sound like

905
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
Stop

906
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,127
Anyway in the documentation from this 1977 here and go find

907
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,407
Quote

908
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,807
The late 1940s and early 1950s were marked by concern over the threat posed by the activities of the Soviet Union the people's were

909
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,855
Look up China and other communist Bloc

910
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,207
United States concern over the use of chemical and biological

911
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Agents by these Powers with a key

912
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
The belief that hostile powers that use

913
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,071
Chemical and biological

914
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:45,119
Agents in terrorism brainwashing

915
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:45,887
And a text

916
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,423
Designed to harass disabled or

917
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,727
Or kill. Kill Allied personnel

918
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,591
Create a considerable pressure for a defensive program to investigate chemical and biological age

919
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,919
So that the intelligence Community could understand the mechanisms

920
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
By which these Subs

921
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Census work

922
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
And how they affect

923
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
Could be defeated

924
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
From the earliest point

925
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,623
Dating back to Bluebird the focus on anti-communism with a

926
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Explicit

927
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,927
In the document that was

928
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,951
Discussing the hippity

929
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Test of the agency was contacting

930
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
Bluebird

931
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:18,399
It was also reported as being reliable trustworthy unknown anti-communist

932
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,727
Bluebird officers were unable to find any indications of

933
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,775
Deviousness or pro-soviet inter

934
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
The interest was two prong

935
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,919
That they had essentially they wanted to break the Communist spies

936
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,199
And know how to keep

937
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,759
The Soviet Union for being able to crack our spies

938
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:37,343
Naturally because of the need for intense secrecy of such a project

939
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,391
Shawty a oversight internally

940
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,415
This parole

941
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,231
Considerably and led to questions of whether the scientist

942
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,071
Could quote develop means for the control of activities and Mentos

943
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:49,375
Tow capacities of individuals willing or not

944
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,447
I got really out of control and they did horrific

945
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:56,031
Unacceptable a ton rationalize Apple thing

946
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Yeah

947
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:01,151
It was all of it though it was all entirely motivated by fear the communist

948
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,967
The driving forces in the motivation for the project

949
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,831
Is very clear and the only explanation for Jake not knowing this or saying no one talks my why they did this

950
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:11,135
If you knows anything about this subject

951
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,927
Either hypnotized himself 24

952
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,951
Forget it or he's a liar

953
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
18

954
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,255
It is amazing

955
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
How

956
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
Stupid

957
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
America was

958
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
Time because

959
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,911
If I remember correctly that

960
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Like ability

961
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:25,727
To control minds was disa

962
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Information released

963
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:28,543
Specifically by the Soviet Union

964
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:30,079
And that sent

965
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,127
What's the United States on a

966
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Billion-dollar Witch Hunt

967
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:34,687
Search for Magic

968
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:37,247
That's great

969
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,135
Yeah

970
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,159
Surprise

971
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,439
So

972
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Look

973
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:46,975
We got this

974
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,999
We got this guy Jake

975
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
And

976
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,839
He believes that we're all under a Ultra Man

977
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,887
Everywhere

978
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
It's

979
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
It's happening right now

980
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,055
I used to think I was

981
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,407
I know what's happening in the world

982
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:13,343
Business and my success in my finances to my happiness

983
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
We are under MKUltra attack

984
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,719
Absolutely

985
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:23,839
Tire system is perpetuated off of one simple phrase I love to say this is

986
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
Brainwash yourself

987
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
Brainwashing

988
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,495
Brainwash yourself before the world brainwashed

989
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,967
The Cameron believed

990
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
On a patient's mind

991
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
Can do a childlike state

992
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
That would allow him to work

993
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
Clean-slate nearby

994
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
Program the patient

995
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,023
Too busy being presented as like a real doctor

996
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,303
Pretty excited

997
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
Nick Ewen Cameron

998
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
Yeah

999
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:01,215
To get this off like really fast we're not all under MK Ultra

1000
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:06,079
Really makes me think of is Alex's marketing

1001
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
G4 selling iodine

1002
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:10,687
He tries to convince the audience of their all iodine deficiency

1003
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,991
It's causing them to not be as smart as they could

1004
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
This feels exactly the same

1005
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:20,671
Jake is trying to sell you on the idea that you have a deficiency and he's the person who has what you need to break free of

1006
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,023
Google just really shady techniques of of sales that they're using on people

1007
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
Also the idea of brainwashing yourself so someone else does

1008
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,143
Is definitely alarming

1009
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
Do here because you know what you could do

1010
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:32,959
Just do think

1011
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,311
Don't you get it

1012
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,431
Kill yourself before the world kills you

1013
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
Perfect sense

1014
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,295
Any negative thing eat your leg before the world eats your legs

1015
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,343
Just put it all in there mayonnaise

1016
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,135
Perfect sense

1017
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,439
That's what you want

1018
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,207
People think

1019
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:59,583
Talking about doctor Cameron there

1020
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,655
From something but the text didn't match anything that I've come across in

1021
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,679
In the files that I dread

1022
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,751
It took me awhile but I think I figured out where you got the

1023
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
This from

1024
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
Text Danny Rivas almost

1025
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:13,663
A paragraph in an article from CBC News titled brainwash

1026
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:15,199
The Echoes of MKUltra

1027
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
This article has an interesting first paragraph

1028
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,623
The following story is based on material from the CBC podcast brainwash

1029
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,647
The six-part series

1030
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
This is an article discussing

1031
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:29,535
The content of a podcast that was investigating MKUltra

1032
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
Isn't the First Source that I would choose

1033
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Used to go with

1034
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,399
Particularly if I was someone who had to wear this

1035
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,679
Of the document

1036
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,471
Arabic

1037
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,543
Entirely convinced of is exactly where Jake is his information

1038
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Wrong because just

1039
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
For this paragraph

1040
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:43,615
There's an image

1041
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,431
Which is an image of a page from Cameron's note

1042
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,247
Which happens to be the very page of notes

1043
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
The Jake reference

1044
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,831
Earlier about a woman having 16 days of sleep

1045
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,463
I wasn't fully convinced that this article it was what Jake was using but then he said that

1046
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
Driving the patterning cycle

1047
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
Driving

1048
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
Which men playing recorded messages to

1049
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,703
20 hours

1050
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:09,727
What do they were asleep

1051
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
Or whether they are extreme examples

1052
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
Schrier

1053
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,151
Completely the pattern

1054
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,967
She was mute and had trouble swallowing

1055
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,271
Those are literally the details in the next few set

1056
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
Sentences Mitsubishi article

1057
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
If I have the article about the death of his

1058
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:30,719
Information on this subject the rest is just pseudo-spiritual mumbo-jumbo that he is

1059
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:37,375
You still get that he spouts all the time on his own platform

1060
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,703
It's just integrating his own hypnotism

1061
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
Scab into

1062
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:43,519
The political world

1063
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,799
Live conspiracy that Alex

1064
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,359
Boy

1065
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:49,151
If this is a simulation

1066
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,199
In what

1067
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,551
World doesn't make any sense for you to be able to think your way out of

1068
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
No cuz Whitney

1069
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,159
You think your way into brainwashing

1070
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
Yourself

1071
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,463
Then you're able to see that it's

1072
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Simulation

1073
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:03,999
And you can

1074
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
Create whatever you want

1075
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:06,815
It's the Matrix

1076
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
That's

1077
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,143
Just don't you want to be Neo

1078
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
I want to do is alright

1079
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:12,959
Maui

1080
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
I am

1081
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:18,847
I see your has attached

1082
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
Very frustrated by people saying that you can

1083
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,479
Think your way through a simulation that's a problem

1084
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:28,831
Yeah just a part of the simulation if it's a simulation is being stimulated

1085
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:31,903
Haha simulate a simulation

1086
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
You're inside of it

1087
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Right

1088
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
And the exit would be death

1089
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
So

1090
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:41,119
Lead you to some negative thoughts

1091
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:43,679
If you if you're in The Matrix

1092
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:46,239
Someone has to break you out of it

1093
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:47,775
Physically

1094
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:53,663
Which probably will be impossible cuz what you are doesn't actually exist outside the simulation

1095
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,967
What does it mean for a Sim

1096
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,527
Did you take it out of the game

1097
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,575
Doesn't mean anything

1098
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,135
I made it free gosh it

1099
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
I just don't

1100
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:12,351
Back when I smoked a lot of weed I used to engage with the idea of the simulation quite a bit read like

1101
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Nick Bostrom

1102
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,423
Stop blow my mind

1103
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,007
Kind of came to a conclusion that it doesn't

1104
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,031
Matter

1105
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:20,799
Yeah

1106
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:24,383
If it is a simulation it matters exactly as much as if it is not

1107
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Matters

1108
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,455
Cuz it's fun to think about

1109
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
And

1110
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:30,783
And think about the nature of reality and that kind of stuff

1111
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
It is

1112
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,855
Is a good use of time if you

1113
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
If you can

1114
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:40,255
Your friends would you like to talk about that kind of stuff with it a good time

1115
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,047
Ultimately

1116
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,607
Hebert's is no different note

1117
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
On how you would live your life

1118
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Yep

1119
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,191
You got it

1120
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,335
I don't know it's like Calvinism I might I might be wrong

1121
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,127
It really matter then does it

1122
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,663
Right

1123
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,199
My ID is about to dr. Yuan

1124
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,991
Cameron J this is coming

1125
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,343
10000 children in the US Canada

1126
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,135
GPS

1127
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,255
Nlsd PCP

1128
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,559
Video goggles

1129
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,887
Nothing that I'm going to say at any point

1130
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,167
In this episode

1131
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,959
Please do not take any of it

1132
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:21,983
To be minimizing

1133
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,519
What these people do

1134
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
Yeah I'm not doing

1135
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,335
But Alex Isley

1136
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,431
Protective Service didn't

1137
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,711
Exist until 1980

1138
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,783
With the passage of the adoption assistance and child welfare Act

1139
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
1980

1140
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,599
So the timeline doesn't work at all but

1141
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
Alex just hates the CPS

1142
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Because he thinks that they're trying to take

1143
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,975
Street family children and give them to same-sex couples

1144
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:46,815
Throwing the CPS in with salt

1145
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
Who's going to follow up on that

1146
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
Humor

1147
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,983
Also I'm going to need Alex to substantiate the claim that you and Cameron kidnapped tens of

1148
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Dozens of children

1149
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:59,103
Because as much of a monster as he is and was I don't think this matches up with

1150
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
Any of the records I can find

1151
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:07,295
I'm not going to spend my time for finding Cameron but I'm going to say that Alex does a disservice to reality and opposition to people like Cameron

1152
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,831
By creating cartoon super villain

1153
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
It's really dumb

1154
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
Yeah

1155
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,951
It takes a garden-variety

1156
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
Banal evil that we need to

1157
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,791
Combat and be aware of on a

1158
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Night

1159
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
In the constant basis

1160
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:26,751
And turns it into magical fairies that you don't really need to worry about cuz it's all the way over there it's over there

1161
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:27,519
There in the distance

1162
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,335
Tens of thousands of children being kidnapped for the

1163
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,359
This program would

1164
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
Be

1165
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,687
Front and center explain to me

1166
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,735
How you could get away with

1167
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Certified program for

1168
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
However many years

1169
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,367
While stealing tens of

1170
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
Children

1171
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,671
Somebody's going to notice

1172
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
Yeah itsy itsy

1173
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,791
Things that they did is they would do tests on

1174
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:50,815
People who are like

1175
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
Psychiatric patient

1176
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:53,631
And

1177
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,191
Folks who people who couldn't say no

1178
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:02,591
Who weren't in the ability to have they're not exclusively.

1179
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:03,615
Would be great

1180
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,151
Entirely counter to

1181
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,551
Prove that I'm willing

1182
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:15,391
Here are the photos of oil down

1183
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
Songs of like this

1184
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,695
This is the level of their

1185
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:23,583
Inhaled was only a small

1186
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,863
Of this

1187
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
40 50 60

1188
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,751
70 years ago I imagine what they're doing now

1189
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
So that

1190
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Is there argue

1191
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:38,687
There it is without proving anything someone like Alex can just save it known information on a subject is a cover-up

1192
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,479
Imagine what they're up to

1193
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
Do now

1194
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:43,807
Both of these are just suggestions without meaning

1195
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,135
Anything could be a cover-up if you say it is and then the conversation

1196
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,975
No it's not

1197
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Okay great

1198
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:52,767
What now

1199
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,351
Also be imagine what they're doing now is way weaker of a gay

1200
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,911
That's just trying to get the listener to imagine

1201
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,471
The scariest and most awful thing they can and they

1202
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Men giving them permission to think that it's

1203
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,543
Possible or maybe even

1204
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,311
Probable

1205
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
That that's going on now

1206
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:12,735
These are both intentional strategies where people pretend to have demonstrated a point when they really haven't said anything at all

1207
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
Getting disappointed

1208
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:16,319
Yeah because I wanted

1209
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
But that's such an

1210
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
That's such a good

1211
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Pick 4

1212
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:20,927
For people who aren't

1213
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:22,463
Hundred percent

1214
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,999
Engage critically at that bone

1215
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,303
Does it mediately you go

1216
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:30,399
Well I mean we've got an iPhone now and they had a rotary phone

1217
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:34,751
So if they were that evil back then I mean obviously they've

1218
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,311
Accelerated or escalated their problems

1219
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,871
And that's makes a certain sense

1220
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
Thanks to you but if you're not thinking

1221
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,687
Critically all this you know

1222
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,711
It just stays

1223
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
Yeah

1224
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:46,783
Understandably is pump

1225
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,063
About reset Wars

1226
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:53,951
Because he's not teeth people that they're not their bodies

1227
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:54,975
Excited about

1228
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:56,511
Reset Wars am I safe

1229
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,583
Everybody literally go right now open a browser

1230
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,887
Go to reset wars.com because

1231
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:06,751
History the way tyranny always wind is to stop us from Spa

1232
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,775
Spiritual Awakening

1233
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,567
As long as they trap us in the third

1234
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:10,335
Third dimension

1235
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,175
Make us live in an animalistic State of Consciousness believe

1236
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
Physical bodies attached to this little tiny

1237
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Spectrum of visible light

1238
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
What is soon as people start

1239
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,903
Pharmaceutical corruption

1240
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Financial corruption

1241
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,023
Really are

1242
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,303
In the hole games over

1243
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
Ford Racing cry standing

1244
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,783
He believes that a child and natural normal

1245
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
Trajectory is ending up

1246
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
With the same price

1247
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:53,599
Space religion

1248
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,879
Just believes that he does

1249
00:55:55,391 --> 00:56:01,535
People who want to provide important medical treatment to children like vaccines are doing so to make sure that this normal trajectory

1250
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
Goes off course

1251
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:07,679
It's one thing to say that humans generally tend to grab a toilet tape towards feeling a connection to the

1252
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:09,215
The Divine and they crave to be part

1253
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
Something larger than themselves

1254
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,799
Which is often found through religion in Connect

1255
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,591
But that's not what Alex is saying

1256
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:18,687
This is him basically saying that every person who's not a Christian innocence

1257
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:19,967
Alex understands

1258
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,295
He's someone who's natural normal trajectory was knocked off course

1259
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,343
Likely by an agent of Satan

1260
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
This is f***** up

1261
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Yeah that's

1262
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
That's

1263
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,719
Great that's real great

1264
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,279
The dodo level of thinking

1265
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,559
King required to get there

1266
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Hi

I have a reach those

1269
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,215
Conclusion

1270
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,495
Yeah

1271
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:44,799
That's f***** up

1272
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,335
So

1273
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:50,943
Alex reveals how little he actually knows about the organization of MKUltra

1274
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,783
Earlier

1275
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,903

00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:34,975
Kidnapping three

1290
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,767
An accomplishment

1291
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,559
True

1292
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,375
In reality Allen Dulles as the head of

1293
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:45,215
CIA had given ultimate approval for the program but it was run by Sydney.

1294
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:50,847
This is a pretty well-known piece of information if Alex has as much awareness of the subject as he

1295
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
Either nose

1296
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,503
That in this isn't intentional

1297
00:57:57,759 --> 00:57:58,783
Alternate is I mean

1298
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
Allen Dulles

1299
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:01,343
What's the center of all

1300
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:02,111
Conspiracies

1301
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,671
Right but Sidney Gottlieb is really the more important

1302
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,695
Figure air

1303
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:12,351
My point is you have to know about Alan jealous and if you know about Island Ellis you have to know about Sidney Godley

1304
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,911
I think that Allen Dulles exists in Alex

1305
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:19,519
His head as like in the JFK files so probably

1306
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,799
Cross other

1307
00:58:21,055 --> 00:58:21,567
Conspiracy

1308
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:22,335
I got you

1309
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,895
It was not you and Cameron

1310
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
Save the cat

1311
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,943
But he did a ton of

1312
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,503
Experiments on LSD in hypnosis relating

1313
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:30,783
Suggestibility

1314
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,599
And the possibility of implanting false memories in people

1315
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,903
Auntie definitely wasn't contact with him

1316
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
And funded by Sidney Gottlieb and the CIA

1317
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
For some of his activities

1318
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
West also accidentally

1319
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,583
Killed an elephant with LSD

1320
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:46,143
It's better than Edison killing it on purpose

1321
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,215
Also Johnny West was not

1322
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:52,031
Timothy McVeigh psychologist while he was on death row

1323
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:57,919
Their claims made that to West visited McVeigh in prison but there are some reasons why that might not be as shocking as

1324
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
It seems

1325
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:05,343
First in 1954 he was appointed chair of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City

1326
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
Your Deep Roots

1327
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,903
In the city itself

1328
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:10,463
Secondly over the course of his career

1329
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
Criminal cases

1330
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,839
But might even high-profile ones like the Patty Hearst trial

1331
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,911
I think that that would be a case that he would drive it

1332
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
Pay Torrid Ryan terms of

1333
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:24,543
Understanding the mindset of the perpetrator

1334
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,847
I don't think

1335
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:29,919
It's impossible that he visited in prison but I don't think it means that he was

1336
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,735
Brainwashing him or whatever

1337
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,783
Yeah it's so like

1338
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,599
You. I was thinking you and Cameron was working

1339
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,183
Hand-in-hand with jolly and West in order to run MKUltra

1340
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
What does reveals adapt

1341
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:46,047
Of not knowing what actually is

1342
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Historic

1343
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Document

1344
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,143
And a and a bun

1345
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,423
Sense of not giving a f***

1346
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,959
Talk about what real really have

1347
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Happened

1348
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
I don't

1349
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Did you know

1350
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,591
That the Pentagon

1351
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:02,431
Has the ability to change your emotions without with a ray gun

1352
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,247
The Pentagon admits

1353
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
Can use

1354
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
Microwaves

1355
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:11,903
Electromagnetic literally

1356
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:18,559
Control someone's brain and change their emotion to show you the patents we're going to show you the news articles

1357
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
Years ago

1358
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,383
So I guess now it's 5G damn it's all of it it's

1359
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,271
Simulation also 5G within the simulation is made by stiffer different simulations

1360
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
And then there's Jesus

1361
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,391
Devil and Allen Dulles Olyphant

1362
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,487
Makes me so mad

1363
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,327
We're not even close to the depth of his frustration to

1364
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,911
Think about the government has

1365
01:00:55,167 --> 01:01:01,311
Brain control Reagan vibrational pattern of them or whatever is identical to what is now

1366
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,383
5G Towers everywhere so they can

1367
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Control everyone's emotions

1368
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,479
The ability

1369
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:10,015
Me to specifically Target

1370
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
People because

1371
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:15,391
Rotasu these 5G Towers would affect everyone in the

1372
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:21,791
Feel so you'll be making a lot of people angry or just turned everybody to Happy

1373
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:26,655
Simple if you can control everybody's emotion

1374
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Susan everybody

1375
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,447
He's happy in his work

1376
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:31,263
Better and doing all that better stuff and having better really

1377
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,591
If you're going to be evil why not do it

1378
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
What's the right way

1379
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,383
Sherp

1380
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
Earlier Alex

1381
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,687
MMA

1382
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:42,015
Implied that the recent Wars is based

1383
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,039
Quit being born again

1384
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:46,879
You know.

1385
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
Yeah not the religion

1386
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,999
This kind of ears in the same direction

1387
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,127
Wow

1388
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,247
Alex is undoing what Satan did in the car

1389
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
I'm going to tell you this right now

1390
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:16,319
He took a while

1391
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,855
To get here and I'm glad we got here

1392
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:25,023
It's funny that he's doing this at the moment of his greatest desperation insane

1393
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
Insane

1394
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,191
Almost like this is a Hail Mary it is a bit of a bit of an 80-yard pass

1395
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Daunte Culpepper

1396
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,359
This to me just smells like

1397
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
Well

1398
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:44,735
I got no other moves like fixed-wing and I got to do whatever I got to do

1399
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,807
So I think that Alex is implying that

1400
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,671
Reset Wars has the ability to undo Original Sin

1401
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,231
This is like a snake coming down a tree

1402
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,607
We were perfect because we're following God's

1403
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:08,031
Feels dirty moment

1404
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:18,015
My whole will everything I am

1405
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,207
No I have about 97% of the time

1406
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,959
You're right.

1407
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:42,847
Tell you you know in your spirit

1408
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,919
Experience

1409
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:46,943
Yesterday

1410
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
No

1411
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,319
Factual inaccuracies in the basic

1412
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,671
Details of the things you're talking about if your spirit

1413
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:58,207
That says old and Powerful

1414
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:00,767
Knows the truth 97% of the time

1415
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,167
3% of the time when your spirits wrong

1416
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:09,215
Please nerfect

1417
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
That's dumb

1418
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:16,639
Also I don't think reset Wars is going to undo original

1419
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,711
Now you say that but you're not thinking

1420
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,479
Proactive

1421
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
This is what we're talkin

1422
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:25,087
Here dance you need to re pattern your mind

1423
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:28,415
More towards a positive view of

1424
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,463
Changing

1425
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:31,999
This also leaves

1426
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:37,375
Me to question whether or not you could show the devil reset Wars good

1427
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
I mean

1428
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Why not

1429
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,447
Right right

1430
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:46,079
Should be able to reprogram self the devil having a better day

1431
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,407
Yeah Jake manifest

1432
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
They just don't have any imagination

1433
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:56,319
For people who believe that anything is possible within God's power they

1434
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,111
They just don't have any imagination

1435
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Patience true

1436
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,951
So Alex has some prescriptions of like what you should be doing

1437
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Everybody

1438
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,375
I realize we can fight all the enemies attacks

1439
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,191
The racism sexism all the

1440
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:16,287
We can just reach up to the divine

1441
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,431
Say about the universe just

1442
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:29,087
There's an interesting perspective

1443
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:32,927
If you're someone who doesn't necessarily believe in religious

1444
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,999
You might hear this as a racist using over-the-top

1445
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:38,815
Religious imagery to plead with people to stop trying to

1446
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,095
The fight racism

1447
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:44,959
You might hear this as a misogynist using ridiculous rhetoric to beg people to just stop trying to

1448
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:45,983
Define sexism

1449
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,591
You might do those things because those are the real-world effects of what Alex is proposing

1450
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,151
It serves the purpose of trying to make the audience

1451
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:58,271
Even less about these social issues to be hostile and condescending towards people who care about such

1452
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
I don't personally believe there is

1453
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,855
The god who's handy

1454
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,439
Can grab if you ignore racism and sexism but it is

1455
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:09,791
Announces the embodiment of what it means to have grab that and I want no part of it

1456
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,935
Personally I believe that there is a God the best way we can pay homage to and serve that God is

1457
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
Respect care about and serve

1458
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,239
Each other

1459
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,519
That can come in many forms

1460
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,335
But working towards equality in our social system

1461
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,871
Definitely one of those things

1462
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,759
I think would be there in Omar's to God this is another thing with imagination

1463
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,807
These people are our

1464
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,111
Italy associating this with good like

1465
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,647
What if God is just a p

1466
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
Piece of s***

1467
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:40,255
You know like what if Alex is right and what God wants them to do

1468
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
And we're out here

1469
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:46,143
The one who's actually the problem is God himself he's just a real piece of s***

1470
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,191
He's a misogynist he's a racist

1471
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
Why I don't know

1472
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,591
How can we possibly understand exactly as a reminder of God

1473
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,615
Now

1474
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,943
I think that

1475
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
It's

1476
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:00,991
Troubling

1477
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
The insistence

1478
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:06,367
Jake has is so much on this like you're not your body thing

1479
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
This is just

1480
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
This leads

1481
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,463
Hilarious

1482
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:14,303
Wasn't it wasn't that long ago if you asked me who I was

1483
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,071
I would have said

1484
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,863
6 ft

1485
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
3

1486
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:21,215
It's not blue eyes this is how long my hair is this

1487
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Rental car rates

1488
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:25,311
It's a fingernail to who I really am

1489
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,359
Showering is it once you realize that

1490
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:32,479
It's incredibly empowering in and here's what's something that's so interesting I sent you this text the other day

1491
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:34,527
On my YouTube channel someone left

1492
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,295
The comment

1493
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
And they said

1494
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
Isaiah

1495
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
As a black man

1496
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:41,439
I don't know how this

1497
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,999
Is blonde hair blue-eyed

1498
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,279
Guys videos

1499
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
But I don't want to watch you because

1500
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,631
ABC media has told me

1501
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,703
Because you're white you were racist your evil you're the devil

1502
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,031
I'm listening to your video right now

1503
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
I have this deep

1504
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,615
Actually

1505
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,663
We all

1506
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
From the same source

1507
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,991
And they've been lying to me

1508
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
Beano's

1509
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:12,415
Totally real you can tell that a 100% real black person 100%

1510
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Real rope

1511
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,719
Totally real

1512
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:16,511
That's a real thing that

1513
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,791
Accidentally

1514
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:20,095
To fit exactly with what it is he would hope

1515
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
Somebody would write

1516
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,935
I also think that even if it is a real ComEd

1517
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:26,495
It's kind of sad to site

1518
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
YouTube,

1519
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:29,567
Really

1520
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,615
This is the pulse of the nation

1521
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
So I think that

1522
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
This

1523
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:38,783
Your body is a rental car stuff has pretty pretty

1524
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,343
Spread

1525
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:44,159
Troubling implications if

1526
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Just

1527
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,463
Combined with that

1528
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,743
That's basically

1529
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,047
Call Mike major theses

1530
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:54,399
Even John Mayer has troubling issues when combined with Alex

1531
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
What that

1532
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,287
So

1533
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:01,055
Finally

1534
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,871
He gets something that resembles

1535
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,151
Our

1536
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:05,919
Right here

1537
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:10,271
Every time you have an emotion you activate cells and building neurological

1538
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,855
Amino it the document

1539
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:16,671
From the US Army College of War

1540
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
Des Moines

1541
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:20,767
Firewall

1542
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Active self

1543
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,583
Electromagnetic

1544
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,911
What's an electromagnetic wave

1545
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:28,447
What is just

1546
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
What

1547
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:31,263
There's no such thing as matter

1548
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,711
That we are these energy creatures are controlling

1549
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,527
So that's not a direct quote

1550
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:47,391
Doing but it's taken from an article published in the US Army war College

1551
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Quarterly

1552
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:52,255
It was an article from 1998 by a guy named Timothy L Thomas

1553
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:53,279
Who did published

1554
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:56,351
Pretty widely in past 20 years or more in the area of 4 in

1555
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
Intelligence operation

1556
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
And psychological warfare

1557
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:02,751
Are you going to tell me that I have to listen to something that timtom wrote timtom

1558
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:07,871
The title of the article is the mind has no firewall in the basic gist of it

1559
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:12,479
For decades the idea of information Warfare had to do with penetrating and

1560
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,551
Any stores of information and disrupting their data

1561
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
Action abilities

1562
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,623
While simultaneously protecting our own

1563
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,183
Typically this was thought of in terms of

1564
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,791
Computers but new developments had forced people to recognize that the human body itself is

1565
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,071
Does a powerful data collection

1566
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:32,191
Interview subjects the senses to various stimulus you can create varying

1567
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:38,079
Example of Sonic weapons and the ability to trigger a seizure through flashing lights are used to illustrate

1568
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:38,847
This concept

1569
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:43,967
The article then brings up the work of a Russian doctor named Victor assume that says

1570
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,319
Who proposed that the human organism needs to be seen as an open system

1571
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
Not a single thing ended up

1572
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,135
Itself or recluse

1573
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
This is to say that Environmental

1574
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:55,231
Influences and information

1575
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,255
Flow into the open

1576
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Open system

1577
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
The person has

1578
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,327
The potential to quote

1579
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:03,167
Call the change in the psycho psycho physiological condition

1580
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,959
Of an organ

1581
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:09,311
This is disgusting terms of the relationship between computer and computer use

1582
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,615
How it might be possible for quote

1583
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,175
A computer modified to become a weapon

1584
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,247
By using its energy output to it

1585
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:18,271
That debilitate

1586
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,039
Take the operator

1587
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,343
Summative

1588
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,903
Discuss that someone who is warning about that future

1589
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Potential

1590
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,695
Messi's not encouraging

1591
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
Lookout

1592
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
This is

1593
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:32,095
So let's have also warned about the idea of the information noise

1594
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,399
Which is essentially an overwhelming stimulus in

1595
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
Turn signals

1596
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:39,263
Behavior modification could be one objective oven

1597
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,287
Information noise

1598
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,567
Another could beat

1599
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:44,639
Upset individuals mental capacity to such an extent

1600
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
To prevent reactions

1601
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
To any stimuli

1602
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:50,527
This was just a theory but honestly the concept made me think of Alex

1603
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:55,391
His show is just a constant barrage of bulshit your mind can't possibly process if yours

1604
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
Just listening to the show

1605
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:59,231
Are you have to be critically examining at 2 even

1606
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,511
See what he saying

1607
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:02,559
He's full of s***

1608
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
I can see that leading to an audience

1609
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:08,703
Ending up with a difficult time real stimulus

1610
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:15,103
The only real solution to any of the problems Alex rants about ends up being to give him money or to promote his show to other people whom

1611
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
My giving money

1612
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,663
So that was that was fun

1613
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,455
Yeah that's good Corollary

1614
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:23,039
Generally speaking this article is largely about physical effects

1615
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:27,391
The could be produced with the use of weapons that would interfere with a body's data-gathering abilities

1616
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,743
With modification these technological applications have many uses

1617
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:36,351
Acoustic weapons for example could be adapted to use for use as acoustic

1618
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,167
Rifles or acoustic fields that once established

1619
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,191
Protective facility

1620
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
Assistant hostage-rescue

1621
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,495
Rescues

1622
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,031
Control riots or Clearpath

1623
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:44,799
Leprechaun voice

1624
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,079
These waves which

1625
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:47,103
Can penetrate buildings

1626
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,431
Offer a host of opportunities for military and law enforcement official

1627
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,527
Microwave weapons by stimulating the peripheral nervous system can

1628
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,343
Heat up the body and Deuce epileptic like seizures

1629
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
Poor cause cardiac arrest

1630
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,927
Low-frequency radiation effects

1631
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,207
Steve electrical

1632
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,743
Activity of the brain and can cause

1633
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,279
Like symptoms and nausea

1634
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,375
Obviously being the target of those sorts of weapons could obviously like

1635
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,143
Absolutely have

1636
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,167
Psychological effects

1637
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,727
But they wouldn't be the primary objective of the weapons

1638
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,543
Linda precise reaction to be essentially impossible

1639
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
So the suffix means

1640
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Disgust

1641
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Is not

1642
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:23,199
Psychological in nature the word that

1643
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,223
Is it implying

1644
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,063
AAA lower-level example would be like a mall

1645
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Playing a

1646
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,599
Ultra hyper

1647
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:32,159
Frequency noise that only younger

1648
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,719
Cheryl kind of in order to

1649
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,743
I kind of keep them away

1650
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:36,767
I'm certain areas

1651
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:38,047
I guess

1652
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:41,375
They do

1653
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,399
Defense

1654
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,311
The article further discussions have the USA voiced willingness to work with International treaties against these kinds of web

1655
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,591
What are the primary

1656
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:53,407
Concerned that existed the idea of non-state actors

1657
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:56,479
Who wouldn't be bound by these sorts of treaties using these kinds of weapons

1658
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,295
These are people referred to as psycho Terror

1659
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:02,111
This is where the idea of the mind not having a

1660
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,391
The firewall comes in

1661
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
These are

1662
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,231
Potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by

1663
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:11,071
Terrorist

1664
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,351
Is to protect ourselves

1665
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:14,143
The article

1666
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,703
He's talking about how Russian researchers were looking

1667
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,471
The topics like

1668
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:19,775
Espe telekinesis and clairvoyance

1669
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,823
For the purposes of Defending against

1670
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,639
Quote according to Russian TV broadcast

1671
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:25,663
What's the

1672
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,199
Music Rocket forces have begun

1673
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,223
Anti ES

1674
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:28,991
Speed training

1675
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,807
Damn sure that no outside force can take over

1676
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
Commanding

1677
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
Control Function

1678
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:34,111
Of the force

1679
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:37,951
That is they are trying to construct a fire wall around the heads

1680
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,719
Of the operator

1681
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:44,351
Why do we allow people who believe in ESP to fight War just in case

1682
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,775
Is an article in this journal about how when we talked about protecting sister

1683
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,335
Sounds like computers the military never gives proper Focus

1684
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,895
Chris to The Operators of those computer somehow quote

1685
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,199
Clearly the information operator

1686
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,271
Exposed before a vast array of potentially immobilizing weapon

1687
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:03,295
Is the week

1688
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:05,599
Weak point in any nation's military asset

1689
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:07,647
Yeah it's like social engineering

1690
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,927
And if you've got a really good

1691
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:14,047
Defense system lock system around your building the easiest way to get in is fine

1692
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Somebody's got a key

1693
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,351
Can I have that

1694
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:19,679
This doesn't prove any of the points Alex or Jake are trying to

1695
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:23,519
They've just taken a couple words from this article and misuse them in order to pretend

1696
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,543
It says what they wanted

1697
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,311
How to say

1698
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:31,455
I look forward to hearing about these documents that prove that were energy creatures though the CIA talk about energy

1699
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,759
Yeah that one was interesting I think

1700
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:40,159
Think he's trying to say that are are atoms at a fundamental on the quantum level

1701
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
Magnetic

1702
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:41,951
Text fields

1703
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,719
Until what we

1704
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
Feel as

1705
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:44,767
Surface

1706
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
This is just our

1707
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,815
Magnetic fields

1708
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
You might be onto

1709
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,399
That's great

1710
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
Fantastic

1711
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,751
And you know what

1712
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,311
My field right now such an Airfield

1713
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,127
Get out of here this is my personal feeling

1714
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:03,455
It looks like I stopped right here now it stops right here

1715
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
But you and I are a field of energy my field

1716
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:12,415
Everything is just a field

1717
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
He says

1718
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:20,095
He's devoted his entire life to the most clear-headed sign

1719
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:22,911
I can tell you this much

1720
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,447
There's no

1721
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,471
Matter

1722
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,175
He has his observation which is the quantum physics

1723
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,991
Don't

1724
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,295
You're aware of

1725
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,599
But you don't

1726
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:42,623
No

1727
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:45,951
So I honestly tried so hard

1728
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:47,231
Find that quote that use

1729
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
Promax blank

1730
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,815
Its original form some contacts but

1731
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
I just hit a dead end

1732
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:57,471
The most consistent attribution of this quote is to a 1944 speech to the plant gave in

1733
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:58,239
Florence Italy

1734
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
The Source lip cited is something within the Max Planck

1735
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,359
Institute archives so I went off

1736
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
To try and find it

1737
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:04,895
Get there

1738
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,455
Whose problem is that archive is all in German

1739
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,247
And I don't speak German

1740
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:10,783
Even just figuring out

1741
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:12,319
How the archive is organized

1742
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
It took a while but I was eventually able to

1743
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:18,463
Reduce the details of where the citation was pointing

1744
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,999
This was

1745
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,047
ABT 5 section

1746
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,839
Repository 11

1747
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
GT5

1748
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,191
Section A

1749
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
A collection

1750
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,495
Of numbered Repository

1751
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,335
Unfortunately the archive jumpstart number 10 to number 11

1752
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,383
So there's no actual accounting of what's an 11

1753
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
And I was intensely frustrating

1754
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:38,943
Wow

1755
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,039
That's really free

1756
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,831
12 slap-in-the-face

1757
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:51,231
That's a slap in the face that said I'm not able to find this actual speech and its original four but I'm willing to believe that that's essentially and IQ

1758
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
To record something

1759
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,023
Plank would have said

1760
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
Venice Beach in 90

1761
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,815
244

1762
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,143
I really wanted to get a better handle on the context this was set in but that

1763
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Barely even coming

1764
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,215
Even without greater context.

1765
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,055
The pretty part leap from planks, to quote we're all energy fields

1766
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,335
Then what would become aware of that week

1767
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,127
We can change the will

1768
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:10,175
I think Planck's point was more than

1769
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:14,015
Science was coming to a point where the conventional understanding of matter being

1770
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,807
Completely solid blocks of stuff

1771
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,879
Was being challenged by new breakthroughs that show that's on the

1772
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,903
Tiniest level

1773
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,463
Appear to be solid are not technically so

1774
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:25,023
This is interesting and very important

1775
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,047
To various scientific

1776
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,839
Alex Fields but it doesn't really have as much practice

1777
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
Classification in day-to-day life

1778
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Is there

1779
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Implying like

1780
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:38,335
I know that my wall isn't actually solid but I can't walk through it be hard for me to believe that plank

1781
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:41,151
Gwent from you know everything that he

1782
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,175
He's done in his life

1783
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
52

1784
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,711
Then giving a

1785
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
Speech where he's like

1786
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
Guess what

1787
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
All that Quan

1788
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,063
On some stuff I told you about

1789
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,087
You have come

1790
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
Sweet control over

1791
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:52,671
Magic's real facts

1792
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,695
And then

1793
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:58,303
I mean like it's it's it's one thing to understand this

1794
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:02,655
Phenomenon that she took it appears to be solid on a subatomic level

1795
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:06,495
May not be alright

1796
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,543
Another thing

1797
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:12,895
To be like my intention will determine whether or not this staysolid

1798
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,175
See there we go that's an issue

1799
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:17,503
Let me guess if he's just saying that like your emotion

1800
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,039
Oceans are controlled by like

1801
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,319
You can't control your

1802
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:21,599
Subway

1803
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,879
You know you're thinking

1804
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,647
Can

1805
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:25,439
You know

1806
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,207
This is a basic tenet

1807
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:31,071
The therapy like analyzing

1808
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:33,375
Can have an effect on your emotions

1809
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:38,239
Or your field

1810
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,311
Not groundbreaking what I say to that

1811
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:48,479
I feel like this is just a conversation between a washed-up bigot and a guy who's found a way to monetize conversations you have you for your friend

1812
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,271
When your high freshman year of college

1813
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:52,319
Sorry about where we're at

1814
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
Nailed it

1815
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
Yep

1816
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:57,183
So is going on this firewall thing

1817
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:01,535
I already talked about that article 370 firewall

1818
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,583
Ford and Denzel greatest movie

1819
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,631
I disagree

1820
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,679
Documents

1821
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,007
We talked about how the mind has no firewall right one of the things China

1822
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,592
Is a firewall on the internet and it's something that we don't

1823
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,408
Spalding who wrote the stealth War about

1824
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
We don't have a

1825
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,576
Firewall

1826
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,392
You don't have a firewall on our own mine

1827
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
I think Jake is misunderstanding something important

1828
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,720
I'm here

1829
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:35,840
The firewalls people talk about cyber attacks or viruses

1830
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,656
It's government-run limitations on what sites

1831
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
People in China

1832
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
The Great

1833
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
Censorship

1834
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
Yeah

1835
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,848
Cyber security measure except

1836
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,920
We do have plenty of strategies in place to protect

1837
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:52,480
4in cyberattack but just like is the case with

1838
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,016
Literally anyting

1839
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,064
Just having some Protections in place dozen

1840
01:20:56,320 --> 01:21:00,160
Guarantee that the folks were trying to do hard won't find new ways to get around those protect

1841
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:02,464
Which forces you to find new strategy

1842
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,512
It's cyclical in the same

1843
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:06,560
No. No no one's ever had to

1844
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,632
Also just because it's fun

1845
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,448
In 2018 Robert Spalding

1846
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:17,568
The step down from the National Security Council because of memo came out where you outlined quote

1847
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:24,224
Nationalize the development of 5G wireless networks

1848
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
Real property

1849
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,832
Man that just hit Alex into really tender spots

1850
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,136
This was a plan to nationalize something which

1851
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,976
She hates right sizes 5G networks without

1852
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:38,048
Alex just said is related to this attack on our energy field

1853
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
This balding guy must have been

1854
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,400
Pretty evil he's going around making proposals like that

1855
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
Of course that stuff is just

1856
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,520
Speak more than we focus on how Spalding is critical of China because that works

1857
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,312
So the narrative these dudes are trying to build

1858
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:50,336
Insulted

1859
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:56,736
You know what maybe like Alex was just talking s*** earlier when he said that this was just 5G maybe was just trying to see how that

1860
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Feels

1861
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,040
Maybe it wasn't a real belief

1862
01:21:59,296 --> 01:21:59,808
He has

1863
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,952
They figured out

1864
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,744
How to use Electric

1865
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,584
Release Behavioral

1866
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,680
Regulation

1867
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:17,472
Oh no it seems like it's actually believe

1868
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,752
Cowboys

1869
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,800
Also that quote the Jakes

1870
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:27,200
Using about that doesn't come from any official document Declassified or otherwise

1871
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:32,576
It's from a 1997 article in the new US News & World Report titled quote Wonder Weapons

1872
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,392
The pentagon's Quest for a non-lethal arms is amazing

1873
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:36,416
But is it smart

1874
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,720
Most of this article is about what you would

1875
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,024
Acoustic weapons lasers that

1876
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:41,792
Contemporary

1877
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:43,840
Temporarily blind

1878
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,936
Are microwave weapons they could raise a person's body temperature to make them feel sick

1879
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,776
Each of these has conceived as a as a way to disarm recap

1880
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,056
Acetate someone who poses

1881
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,336
The Fret without killing them

1882
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,456
Pretty easy but the other two are not really at operational status according

1883
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:01,504
To this article they're sort of in developing

1884
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,064
Ideas are being thrown around

1885
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,856
So far we've tried it and we

1886
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:10,464
Boiled someone and that was a bad start so we put it on the back burner for a while

1887
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
Repeating

1888
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:18,400
From this article is about research related to the related to the article's author by eldenburg

1889
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,264
Bird was not the former head of DARPA although that is an organization named that

1890
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,544
Conspiracy theorists are dicks

1891
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,568
Throwing out

1892
01:23:26,592 --> 01:23:30,688
He was actually the head of the Marine Corps non-lethal electromagnetic weapon

1893
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:34,784
Project which is right out of the Armed Forces Radio biology

1894
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
Institute

1895
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,600
Saying that this was DARPA makes it

1896
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,160
Easier for the audience though cuz it gives them something to

1897
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:44,000
Cold

1898
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:44,768
Yeah

1899
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:49,376
Bird was in this position from 1980 to 1983 and he claims that he did experiments

1900
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
But sound like

1901
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
By using

1902
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:54,240
Very low-frequency electromagnetic radiation

1903
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:58,592
He could induce the brain to release behaviour regulating camel

1904
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,432
The issue though is that the waves that they were using were very weak

1905
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
The effects were short-lived

1906
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,040
He claims that he was able to do things like make

1907
01:24:07,552 --> 01:24:09,856
Brands release their natural opioids

1908
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,136
In utero and

1909
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:13,696
Get certain cells in Rat brains to release histamine

1910
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,976
In which would cause nausea

1911
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
And flu-like

1912
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:18,048
The program was never quote

1913
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,656
Stood in the field and those program was meant to last for years it was closed after 2

1914
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:23,424
Just to

1915
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,472
This doesn't pass muster in terms

1916
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,008
So justifying reclaims Alex

1917
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,568
Shakermaker

1918
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,384
Opposition to research programs like this

1919
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,664
That rely on it

1920
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,736
Insisting that week avidan's like this proves that the government is mine

1921
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:38,272
Controlling everyone on a mass scale

1922
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,576
The answer is rebooting your brain

1923
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:42,112
Pointless opposition

1924
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,392
I made a rat

1925
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,184
Sick so I guess I can

1926
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,464
To control minds

1927
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,536
That out

1928
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:55,680
Interesting on that level also relying on something that was being

1929
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:59,520
Told to a writer of an article in the u.s. News & World Report

1930
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:03,360
As opposed to any data any actual report

1931
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,896
Science on this

1932
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
Not good

1933
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:11,040
Yeah I would like more pureview fax from

1934
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,064
Before I start

1935
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,088
Just going along with

1936
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,368
Can make checks

1937
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,392
Release opioids

1938
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
In the womb

1939
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Right it's

1940
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,512
Just not good work

1941
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,792
No

1942
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,352
Faulty it's almost

1943
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:26,656
It's almost like

1944
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,680
They're to be explained

1945
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:30,240
It's almost like it's a hypnotist

1946
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,032
Stretch

1947
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
Look at these keys

1948
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:37,920
Look I'm going to make this this article magically appear to be a Declassified document

1949
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,248
So Alex

1950
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,296
You really want to talk about being in the spirit

1951
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,088
Free spirit

1952
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Okay so Jake

1953
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,672
Jake's going off on that then Alex's something

1954
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,208
Deeply revealing

1955
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:56,864
Find power inspiration we can transform

1956
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,424
Greater than our environment

1957
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,216
Access new ideas

1958
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
The world

1959
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,128
In this one

1960
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:12,224
Absolutely so that right there was a gigantic tell that Alex is full of s***

1961
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:17,600
They're going on about this esoteric mumbo-jumbo about how you have to let go of yourself as a physic

1962
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,648
Globalist

1963
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,208
Can't separate this playing from the end goal of

1964
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,488
Taking over the world

1965
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,768
He's unable to go

1966
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:27,840
Conceive of an end goal for this process of Liberation that doesn't

1967
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,120
Involve the accumulation

1968
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:29,888
Power

1969
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,544
That's pretty much the exact opposite of what one would be interested in as an end goal if you were preaching Detachment from the physical

1970
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:40,384
Who cares if you take over the physical world it's not real

1971
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,944
If I recall correctly

1972
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
And I'm going to throw this out

1973
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:46,784
It was

1974
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
The meek

1975
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:51,392
Who were

1976
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:55,488
At what point do you stop being

1977
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,048
Is it the part where you go

1978
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,328
Let's take over the world

1979
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,376
It's

1980
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,704
It's a really hairy I don't know if the meat usually have that goal

1981
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,008
This is not a small point

1982
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:07,776
But like

1983
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:11,360
How does this idea that were not our physical bodies mechoui

1984
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:13,152
With Alex's obsession with property right

1985
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:19,040
Not only do you not have ownership over your car according to Alex this car doesn't even exist

1986
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:24,672
How can you possibly exert property rights over malleable waves and force fields are whatever the f***

1987
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,976
Alex's ideology and worldview

1988
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,000
Starkly at odds

1989
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:32,352
With what he's preaching now because the Bedrock of Alex's ideology for his entire career

1990
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,888
Is involved important

1991
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:36,704
Individualism and materialism

1992
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:43,616
Given these two things such as primary focus for his entire career is antithetical to the we are not our bodies nonsense he's pretty

1993
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,384
Preaching now

1994
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,200
If we're not our bodies then none of his politics make

1995
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:47,968
Any sense

1996
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:51,552
If you're not your body then you should have no problem with abortion

1997
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:55,904
Because that's always just going to go back to heaven or come back to earth and another body rental car

1998
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,488
If you're not your body then the argument for unalienable rights

1999
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,792
To self-defense doesn't even make sense anymore

2000
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:05,120
It's really fascinating and I honestly think that this has the potential

2001
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:06,144
Either completely

2002
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,728
Alex's career

2003
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,032
I like the pseudo-spiritual Griff

2004
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,568
Some bad news

2005
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,128
Alex would be shity about Griff

2006
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,152
No one wants

2007
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,456
Namaste being yelled at them

2008
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,552
I find it so interesting though this

2009
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,088
This way I would love

2010
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,392
To hear Alex try and explain property rights

2011
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,928
Under this new paradigm

2012
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,208
I don't think it would be possible

2013
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,024
Well as somebody who has

2014
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:34,816
Study Buddhism for a long time

2015
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:37,632
I would say that many of the Great Buddhist

2016
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
Masters while they preached

2017
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,448
We're also

2018
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,728
Taking over the world

2019
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,312
And that is something that a lot of people don't remember

2020
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:49,152
Amitabha Buddha you super nice you're super nice

2021
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,176
On the surface

2022
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,224
But deep down that motherfuker wanted

2023
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,248
To take everybody to the

2024
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,320
Cleaners if you believe like let's save this desk

2025
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
Sure

2026
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,136
Is it is it appears to be solid

2027
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,696
Reality

2028
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
It's not

2029
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,256
Actually even matter

2030
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:06,560
Can I be mad

2031
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:11,936
If you take it I can ship over this an automatic

2032
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,984
Yourself from these material things

2033
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,032
Kill anybody who tries to take them

2034
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,360
I don't understand it all makes perfect sense

2035
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:21,152
Physical world is it real quick

2036
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:25,504
Kill somebody if they steal your car what are the Greek Noble Truths

2037
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,808
You got to f*** somebody up sometime

2038
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,368
This is dumb

2039
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,672
And I wonder if Alex's audience will pick up on me

2040
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:34,976
Because I could do him some

2041
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:36,256
Real serious damage

2042
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:37,280
In terms of audience

2043
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:39,328
Pretension

2044
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,656
The religiosity that is

2045
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,680
Is preached

2046
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:45,216
Jose

2047
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
Certain connotation

2048
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,520
Intuit that I feel like

2049
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
People resonate with

2050
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
It's in his audience

2051
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,176
And to switch to new AG bulshit Idaho

2052
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,736
I think some will

2053
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:57,504
Just trapped

2054
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:58,784
Yes

2055
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,112
Yeah it's hard to say like I don't know how much

2056
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
Costuming of like

2057
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
The globalist

2058
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,512
Send the New World Order and Illuminati

2059
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:09,792
I don't know how much of that

2060
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,072
Is going to be required

2061
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,864
To make this palatable

2062
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
Because there are these

2063
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
These differ

2064
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,216
Like

2065
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
Materialism is really big

2066
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,824
Yeah property rights

2067
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
Free market

2068
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,384
These kinds of things are are

2069
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,176
Alex's careers

2070
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,200
Is based on

2071
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,784
And this is a is a

2072
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,808
Systems

2073
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,832
Has no in

2074
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,904
The same time is almost

2075
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,744
I mean there is also the obsession with using this system

2076
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,512
To get stuff

2077
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,328
Oh on

2078
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:49,728
Yeah you know you're trading fighting the Communists for believing that if you

2079
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:53,056
Believe hard enough the Communist will just go away

2080
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,336
Also

2081
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,408
It beat the ideas of individualism

2082
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,176
Alex

2083
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
Who's obsessed with

2084
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,224
Really run counter to

2085
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,272
You are not yourself

2086
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,624
Oh boy I wish him the best

2087
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,904
And I bet I'm in the world

2088
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:09,696
So Alex

2089
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,232
Advice

2090
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,256
It's now 8.

2091
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,280
Go see eat like

2092
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,560
If you have medical

2093
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,096
Mental Health

2094
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:18,912
Absolutely

2095
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,960
Jersey Shore weather

2096
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:26,848
Mine

2097
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:30,432
Be aware of how they manipulate your mind you'll become stronger

2098
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:33,504
Hello to some psychologists and psychiatrists the system

2099
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,296
Telling your failure your week

2100
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,344
Pills for you

2101
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,880
Gimme a Break ladies and gentlemen

2102
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:45,280
Flip-flopping statement comments on masks

2103
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:48,352
Pecan masks

2104
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:53,728
The audience already hates fauci and they aren't wearing masks

2105
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,288
This could not be more trivial compared to the hour

2106
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,336
What's the topics Alex's pretending to cover

2107
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:04,480
I found that to be a jarring and that's not that's not okay

2108
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:06,016
Yeah alright

2109
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:09,344
Esoteric ideas proven by CIA documents

2110
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,880
That we have also

2111
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:18,304
But it isn't consistent about Mass this whole f****** thing is a simulation who gives a s*** about what fauci is

2112
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,888
Is or is not saying the mask isn't real

2113
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,680
It's a field I guess

2114
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:30,592
So why are you complaining about it like you can't breathe you're not in but you're not even the person breathing you're just real

2115
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,896
God dammit

2116
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,688
So all right here we go

2117
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:38,016
Finally going to get to the doctor

2118
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,112
Aldi documents that history looking

2119
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,184
What they admit they're doing how they're trying to erase

2120
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,744
Personality store

2121
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,280
50 60 70

2122
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:56,448
Call Autumn a scale

2123
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,056
The shouldn't be people shouldn't people be aware

2124
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:06,432
I'm excited to get into these documents but also right off the bat Alex

2125
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:07,456
Completely wrong

2126
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:12,832
He said that the last time documents were Declassified about MKUltra is 1977a badges

2127
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
Incorrect

2128
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:16,416
Greenwald submitted foia request

2129
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:18,208
Thousands of pages of documents

2130
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:20,000
It's about MK Ultra back in 2000

2131
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:20,768
4

2132
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,096
Alex saying this leads me to believe that he doesn't know much about

2133
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:27,680
This topic or possibly just stop learning new things about a prior

2134
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:28,704
2004

2135
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,776
Also Greenwald has engaged in another flavor requests

2136
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:35,104
In 2018 this one specifically regarding behavioral modification

2137
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,176
And in response he received over a thousand more pages

2138
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,760
Now I will grant that a lot of the pages there in those

2139
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,784
Dumps

2140
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,064
We're not really that interests

2141
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,344
Things like a check

2142
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,112
Disbursement

2143
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
But there's also relevant

2144
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,416
Kristen there

2145
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:51,488
It's pretty glaring for Alex accidentally admit that he just

2146
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
Made this big glass

2147
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,048
About MK Ultra stuff

2148
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:55,584
But weirdly isn't aware

2149
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,168
Of things past 1977

2150
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,216
The modernity get in the way of Lord

2151
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:02,496
Sure

2152
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:04,800
Sure we got to have lore

2153
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:05,824
Sure

2154
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,616
We're getting to the doc

2155
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:10,176
Document I kind of don't believe

2156
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,224
Document I really don't believe you

2157
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:16,576
Here's the first one

2158
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,600
Sort of

2159
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,440
Richard

2160
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:25,024
20 he's the deputy director was the deputy

2161
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:26,048
Director of

2162
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:26,816
The Pentagon

2163
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,840
Advanced research

2164
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:28,608
Projects

2165
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,656
This is an actual quote

2166
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:31,680
He says

2167
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,728
Experiments

2168
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,776
We did some remarkable things

2169
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:38,080
There was no question in my mind

2170
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,640
You can get into the brain

2171
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:41,920
Microwave

2172
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,480
If you really make the Breakthrough

2173
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,528
You got something better

2174
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,064
Any bomb

2175
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,088
Everbilt

2176
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,368
Because

2177
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:52,672
When you finally come down

2178
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:54,720
Talking about controlling

2179
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,488
Peoples

2180
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:57,792
Lesser argument

2181
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,328
What are the 5G

2182
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,144
That's the right one riot

2183
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
Population

2184
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:05,472
Good guys

2185
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,240
Petition

2186
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,616
This isn't from a document per se

2187
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:16,224
It comes from a May 15th 1988 article in the Asbury Park Press

2188
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
Which actually isn't

2189
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,272
True

2190
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:24,672
The Asbury Park Press is quoting something that Richard Cesaro said two years prior in an interview with a nun

2191
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,440
Unspecified ENT

2192
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:26,720
I can find

2193
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,256
Hundreds of conspiracy blogs

2194
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,328
It's repeating the quote but the closest I can get to the original context

2195
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,632
Is this Asbury Park Press article

2196
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,912
Find out satisfying

2197
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
But oh well

2198
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:40,032
Even so the article is kind of telling and it shoot some holes in Jakes

2199
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:43,360
The article does say that 20 claim these things

2200
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
But it also says quote

2201
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:50,528
Initially Pandora researchers believe that the irradiation had caused subtle behavioral effects

2202
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:51,296
Test animal

2203
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:56,160
Later however reanalysis of the experimental data raised doubts about its validity

2204
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,744
A scientific review panel decided in 1970 that the

2205
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:00,768
Be disbanded

2206
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,840
He was tested on humans and the experimental data that

2207
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,608
Fitz's arrow is

2208
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,424
Referring to was found to be dubious upon re-examination

2209
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
This is a slam dunk

2210
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,312
Uncle Jake thinks it is I'm I'm more to the point it's not even a document in the sense that Alex

2211
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,592
I was using the term

2212
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:16,640
This isn't the classified it's a nothing

2213
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,432
Asbury Park Press article

2214
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,456
I'm looking

2215
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,504
A Declassified proof not

2216
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:25,088
Quotes from an interview that you can't even find the full text of anymore

2217
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:26,368
And also

2218
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:32,768
The reason that Sarah was doing this research was because we were afraid of the Soviets and communist doing that same research and we did

2219
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,048
Leg up

2220
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,328
February consist

2221
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,376
Send pattern that this stuff

2222
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,704
Mysteriously unaware of that motivation

2223
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,472
They had

2224
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:42,496
Yeah yep

2225
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:46,336
People in America were so paranoid about

2226
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,408
They went on mulch

2227
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
Multiple Witch Hunt

2228
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,224
Engaged

2229
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,528
Non-stop racism

2230
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
Exploded things left and right

2231
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,344
And

2232
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,904
Believed in magic for a good long while

2233
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:04,000
Richard a lot of vulnerable people

2234
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,792
Yep suck

2235
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
School

2236
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,352
So

2237
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,888
Let's never do that again

2238
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,192
Before before we started

2239
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,728
The show I told you that

2240
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:15,264
There were a couple of clips

2241
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,312
That worth

2242
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,872
The cold water being splashed in my face

2243
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,200
Was so shocking

2244
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,528
Even masks are another example

2245
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,088
I'm trapping you into your physical body

2246
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368
It's another

2247
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,136
Anchor

2248
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:36,000
Brings you back into lower emotions you're afraid of dying even though you can't die because

2249
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:41,376
Everything is energy and energy is never created or destroyed it's only transferred to different states first law firm

2250
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,680
Oh my God

2251
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:47,776
I think it's safe to say that we have crossed a very serious. Cheer

2252
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,848
Not only are you not your physical body but apparently now you can

2253
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,616
Can't die

2254
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,640
Dying

2255
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:56,480
Possible energy and energy can be created or destroyed

2256
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:00,576
I just don't know what to say at this point like a week ago Alex was giving

2257
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,344
Growling

2258
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,392
Heart-to-heart talks to his audience about how

2259
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,952
Time for you to think about killing your family members

2260
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,512
If you know your family members believe in vaccines

2261
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,792
Now we have this Dopey

2262
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:14,656
Be hypnotist and Alex trying to sell a bill of goods about how you can't die in the physical reality isn't real

2263
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:19,008
I think this has a high chance of leading to some people getting hurt

2264
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
And I hope whatever Jake

2265
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,336
Good paying Alex for exposures worth it

2266
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
Could go

2267
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:24,896
So bad

2268
01:38:25,664 --> 01:38:26,432
A s'more

2269
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,456
Board of b*******

2270
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,504
Like if you want to believe

2271
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
Anything you

2272
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296
Can find it

2273
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,856
Like they're both talk

2274
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
So fast

2275
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,160
About so little

2276
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
Aggressively

2277
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:38,720
That's

2278
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:43,328
You can just be like that one sounds like it resonates with me

2279
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,120
Die

2280
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:46,400
Great

2281
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:50,240
If you got to save the kids from the vaccines

2282
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,008
Ortho k

2283
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:54,080
You got to kill your family member really dying

2284
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:58,944
It's impossible steal somebody Never Dies can I watch Game of Thrones

2285
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,504
Your ironborn

2286
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,856
Big boobs

2287
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,184
Matter is never

2288
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,720
Aggravated asteroid so that me

2289
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:13,024
Means we can't die I read that in science

2290
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,840
I was wondering if there were ways for Alex to get less

2291
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:21,984
Responsible or more irresponsible in this is definitely a way

2292
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:23,008
You can't die

2293
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,544
Alex not pushing

2294
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,384
Aerodynamics

2295
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:34,272
We're not even in that level of like your soul doesn't die or anything like that he's just straight-up like

2296
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:38,624
Whatever you'll probably be reconstituted into something else somewhere else who cares

2297
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,648
No no no

2298
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,672
It's not

2299
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:41,952
Even that like

2300
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,744
Your soul

2301
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,792
I guess maybe it's your soul

2302
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,584
That you are not

2303
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
Your body

2304
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:49,120
Right

2305
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,400
This is a rental car

2306
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,936
Sure just break

2307
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,728
Breaks down if you die

2308
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:54,752
So

2309
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,080
Matter can never be created or destroyed

2310
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,360
Your body's not matter

2311
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:03,200
No no no no no no let's stop right here

2312
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
What's up right here

2313
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
Okay

2314
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:09,856
If my soul then what's my soul if it is my sole matter is that what he's trying to say

2315
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:10,880
Is he trying to say

2316
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:13,184
That the soul is also physical

2317
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:17,280
I don't think he gets into it I would be curious

2318
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:20,608
I want to know because I think it does have to have something to do with these

2319
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,376
Field

2320
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:22,656
And I wonder if you think

2321
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,680
Makes the fields have any

2322
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
Physically

2323
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:25,984
The state would ever even if it is

2324
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,288
It cannot be created or destroyed then yes it is

2325
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,568
Are the fields

2326
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,848
Function of the simulation

2327
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:33,408
Simulators

2328
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,944
Is it a glitch

2329
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:37,760
In the simulation they have the

2330
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,552
Ability to manipulate the

2331
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:42,112
Fields around us or whatever I mean it

2332
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,904
It can't be a glitch in the simulation

2333
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:46,976
That would be in like then it could break

2334
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,512
And then we'd all die

2335
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,584
It's the end of the world

2336
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:59,264
There's a lot of questions that are not answered

2337
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Say that's fair

2338
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,104
We get to another example of what is

2339
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,384
Supposed to be a document

2340
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,200
Sure

2341
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:09,248

Transcranial magnetic stimulation

2353
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,640
Fisticated propaganda

2354
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:40,224
Based on this technology

2355
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:43,296
Yeah that's what you heard

2356
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:45,344
Think about it

2357
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,672
Keep chiming in with that

2358
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:55,328
I know we're late we're getting a little bit hard out here

2359
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,120
From a document or anything official

2360
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:04,288
The characterization that's been given to comment made by an anonymous whistleblower as written up on the website

2361
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,568
Blog

2362
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,592
Activist post

2363
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,432
Firstly activist supposed to be dumb website with a heavy

2364
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,712
Conspiracy leading been

2365
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,576
It's basically a less ambitious Infowars without a charismatic lead singer like Alex

2366
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:18,880
Here's all you need to know about this site

2367
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:22,208
The fourth book listed on their recommended reading list

2368
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:25,024
Is AIDS Incorporated by Jon rappoport

2369
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,864
John Rappaport denialism book

2370
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:35,264
Really I'm 44 on their reading list

2371
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,056
Nothing like that but it menu went to rap

2372
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:40,640
Can't even hang up a f****** picture

2373
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:44,992
Along with this on the reading list are books by Infowars favorites like Webster

2374
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,040
Tarpley Mark Dice David

2375
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,600
Another book by Rappaport

2376
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:51,392
Also none dare call Atkins

2377
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:56,000
Anyway this was a post about an anonymous whistleblower contacting them

2378
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,792
I'm telling them that DARPA was running

2379
01:42:58,048 --> 01:43:00,352
The study at Arizona State University that was meant

2380
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:02,144
Use transcranial magnetic

2381
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:02,912
Stimulation

2382
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:04,192
To affect the brain

2383
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,216
The Narrative process

2384
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,264
This

2385
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,800
Was a real project

2386
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,592
That was undertaken by ASU

2387
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:13,664
Titled quote ordinariate of disruptors and induct

2388
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:17,760
Mapping the narrative comprehension Network and its persuasive of

2389
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,552
What what does

2390
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,600
Really comes down to his interpretation

2391
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,392
Like if you want to look at this project

2392
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,696
You can say it's evil there's no way I'm going to be able to

2393
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:26,720
The talk you out of that

2394
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,816
I don't think it's evil and I really don't think that I could be convinced

2395
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:31,584
But it is

2396
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:35,424
The study is essentially about how the brain creates Naruto

2397
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,192
Sand weighs

2398
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,472
Is that you can effectively help

2399
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,496
The narratives be more

2400
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:39,264
Persuasive

2401
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,056
Conversely how you can disrupt

2402
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
The persuasiveness of narrative

2403
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
The Hopeless

2404
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:44,640
To be able to

2405
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:48,224
Construct a better understanding of the brain's narrative comprehension Network which

2406
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:48,992
School quotes

2407
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:55,136
Lead to a full understanding of the influence narrative has on memory emotion theory of Mind identity in Persuasion

2408
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:59,232
Intern influence the decision to engage in political violence

2409
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
Or join viola

2410
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:02,816
Groups or support such groups ideologic

2411
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,840
Sickly or financial

2412
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,424
The research focused on the persuasiveness of narratives as

2413
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,704
Experienced by Christian

2414
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,728
And Muslim sub

2415
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:14,080
These groups are selected because religiously speaking they have many overarching

2416
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:17,408
Similarities in what they called the master narrative

2417
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:24,320
Well as many differences personal aspects of interacting with a narrative much more

2418
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,344
Forecast

2419
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:27,392
The first phase of the study was

2420
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,976
Participants will watch a series of video vignettes

2421
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:34,560
Videos and make decisions

2422
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,584
That should be influence

2423
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,608
By the videos

2424
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,400
The group participants

2425
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:40,960
Where are they were grouped into by two models

2426
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,032
Spyware the differences were whether the master narrative

2427
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
Which is the religious narrative

2428
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,872
Weather that mapped with the local narrative

2429
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
What does the video

2430
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:49,920
That's the first

2431
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Variable

2432
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:55,040
I meant how the local narrative is related to their personal narrative

2433
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:56,320
So the two options

2434
01:44:56,576 --> 01:45:00,928
In the personal narrative section would be that sort of

2435
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Option

2436
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:02,464
Who did they beat

2437
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,512
Askew imagine themselves in the narrative

2438
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
A 30-second

2439
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:07,584
Ken's or they're being asked to imagine

2440
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,888
The semantic consequences of the narrative 4:30

2441
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:10,656
30 seconds

2442
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:15,008
The first one for the personal narrative it makes it personalized whereas

2443
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,032
The ladder is it

2444
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:17,568
Detached and analytic

2445
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:22,432
Afterwards the participants would answer questions about the video they watched

2446
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,968
And what they thought about it

2447
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:24,992
At the end

2448
01:45:25,248 --> 01:45:30,624
Quote participants would make a judgment about how much of their research payment they would like to allocate to a two

2449
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,648
Particular

2450
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,672
Religious group

2451
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,488
Through the experiment neural images would be taken

2452
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:39,584
Can to help understand the parts of the brain that were activated when different aspect of relating to

2453
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,608
The narratives are happening

2454
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:42,400
Cuz I didn't want to rely on self

2455
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:43,424
Reporting right

2456
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,216
Because that could

2457
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,240
Be enacted

2458
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
Okay

2459
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,080
I understand please

2460
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,872
If you understand what

2461
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:53,152
Get this right

2462
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:56,992
If I understand correctly what they're trying to find out is how much

2463
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:59,296
Much do the stories that we tell ourselves

2464
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:00,832
That we believe

2465
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:01,856
Affect what we actually

2466
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:03,648
And if you can

2467
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:04,928
Interrupt

2468
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,720
Or influence

2469
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,024
The story that somebody is telling them self

2470
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:11,072
In order to interrupt her influence there

2471
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:12,864
Current belief about what's going on

2472
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,888
Somewhat

2473
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,680
But the interrupting

2474
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
And inducting

2475
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,752
Are kind of part of later

2476
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,568
It's more about

2477
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,848
Seeing

2478
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,616
How

2479
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:24,896
The relationship between

2480
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:26,176
The videos that

2481
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:27,200
People are being shown

2482
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:29,504
Whether or not it matches with

2483
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,784
Their religious beliefs

2484
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,832
Why what the heck that has

2485
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,112
On their response

2486
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:36,416
Secondarily

2487
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:37,952
Response personalizing

2488
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:39,488
Sing it has to do like imagine

2489
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,816
Giving yourself in the narrative that's in the video as your close to

2490
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,608
Critically analyzing it

2491
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:49,472
Like the semantic concert get rid of your own story

2492
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:52,544
And see what somebody else's story or think about

2493
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,336
Somebody else's story

2494
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,360
Conversely

2495
01:46:55,616 --> 01:47:01,760
If it matches your religious narratives your master narrative yourself within the hour

2496
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,576
And your own bunch of different

2497
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:05,856
Aspect

2498
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,880
It's do it and

2499
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,696
You know it's an interesting study guide

2500
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:14,048
I agreed so then the second phase of the experiment was similar

2501
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:18,400
But they change the aspects of the relationship with narrative that were being examined

2502
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,728
In this phase the two variables were narrative validity

2503
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:24,032
So that would be valid or invalid

2504
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:25,824
Per patient

2505
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,896
Which is to say whether whether or not the narrative is immersive

2506
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:29,920
To the person

2507
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,688
Experiencing

2508
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,736
So those are the two variables that

2509
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:33,760
We're messed with

2510
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:34,528
In the second

2511
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:38,624
Can save other than that it was basically the same layout as

2512
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,392
Is the first

2513
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,464
These three is where all the hullabaloo comes in

2514
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,512
In this phase they plan to use Tran

2515
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,304
Cranial magnetic stimulation

2516
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:51,168
Disrupt parts of the brain associated with narrative comprehension ideally to see how that affects

2517
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
Overall comprehension and persuasion

2518
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,520
I admit that sounds like a bit much

2519
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,312
Watch but the other two phases are

2520
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,104
Play lien Oculus research project

2521
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,640
Much like neute

2522
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:03,200
Taking place on any college campus everyday

2523
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,992
And the third really isn't as

2524
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:05,760
F***** up as a

2525
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,552
No nut May

2526
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,856
I mean that make sense because the other

2527
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,136
Question is is it a

2528
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:11,904
Physical process

2529
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,184
All of that

2530
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,464
Stuff that we've

2531
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
Talked about

2532
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,792
Is entirely within the Conch

2533
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:22,144
Not even necessarily what you would call the brain or whatever

2534
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:22,912
When you add

2535
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,960
The transcranial

2536
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:25,984
Magnetic

2537
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:29,568
Then you take it from something that is what you are thinking

2538
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,616
Do something that is actually physical

2539
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,896
That you can measure

2540
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:39,296
And the neural Imaging as well there are elements of what

2541
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,576
This this was amen

2542
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,856
To determine

2543
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,880
But

2544
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,928
Kind of irrelevant

2545
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,488
Cuz I can find this grant proposed

2546
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,024
And their contract

2547
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:49,792
From the Department of

2548
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,560
The interior

2549
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,352
Their status updates going up to

2550
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:54,400
The June 2013 that have been released

2551
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,960
Any documentation drops off

2552
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:59,008
None of these conspiracy blogs

2553
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:02,848
Does it talk about this have anything past that point which I thought was a little bit weird

2554
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,384
Until I took a closer look at

2555
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,152
The contract

2556
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
The department of

2557
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:07,968
The interior had agreed to fund

2558
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,736
Phase 1

2559
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
But it didn't

2560
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,784
Commit to the other two

2561
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:11,808
Those were opt

2562
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:17,440
I can find no evidence that the very scary face through this experiment has ever actually done

2563
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:21,024
And if they can prove that it was I would encourage him to share that evidence with me

2564
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:24,864
I actually have fairly strong circumstantial evidence that it didn't

2565
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,400
Extended past Phase 1

2566
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:30,240
Because I found the project manager Stephen corman's resume

2567
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:34,592
And he lists this grant in it and it's spring 2012

2568
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:35,616
But that's it

2569
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,896
It doesn't appear again

2570
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Conversely

2571
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:41,248
Spring 2009 Grant he was awarded on a project

2572
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,016
Regarding quote

2573
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:45,344
Embedding story and analysts in

2574
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
Dictionary

2575
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:49,696
Is listed again in summer 2013 with a grant God extend

2576
01:49:50,464 --> 01:49:52,512
If the study that we're talkin about had gotten

2577
01:49:52,768 --> 01:49:54,816
Extended that would mean a couple million

2578
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:55,584
Extra dollars

2579
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:58,144
The funding would you better believe he's going to put on his resume

2580
01:49:58,656 --> 01:49:59,680
University of Louisville

2581
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,448
That shitt

2582
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:06,336
Extension for the other project that he put on his resume there's only for $250,000

2583
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,104
Like you would

2584
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:10,176
Absolutely put in as an accomplishment right.

2585
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:14,272
This refunded right right because if they founded the first bit and then they

2586
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:16,064
Release the funds for the second bit

2587
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,088
You got some promise

2588
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
It going

2589
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:23,488
And that means maybe I'll get this through this program.

2590
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:25,536
That's really great

2591
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:26,304
For Universal

2592
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,840
It's because they really like

2593
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,632
To be able to

2594
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:31,168
Have their professors

2595
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,960
And they're researchers

2596
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,264
Claim to

2597
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:37,312
Like we did we did this research

2598
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:39,104
A prestigious Professor brings

2599
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:41,408
Prestige to the university

2600
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:42,688
So here's what's going on here

2601
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:48,320
There was a scary sounding project at Arizona State University which an anonymous whistleblower told active

2602
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,088
This post about

2603
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:52,416
The conspiracy blog so they characterized

2604
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,952
The study as an attempt to create

2605
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:57,024
Control and Jake is just reading copy from that blog

2606
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,608
Instead of engaging with the actual material and the research program at

2607
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,400
This is sloppy work

2608
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,168
Hypnotist

2609
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,448
I'm very unhappy

2610
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,984
Yeah I bet

2611
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,264
It didn't actually happen

2612
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,824
I prefer to be

2613
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:11,616
It happened let me be clear

2614
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:14,432
May have happened

2615
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:16,480
But I have no evidence that it did

2616
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:17,760
Strong indications that it

2617
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:23,648
I cannot prove definitively that it didn't happen I mean they could have

2618
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,928
Secretly fund

2619
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,720
Did the program after that yeah

2620
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:30,048
6-quart to prove it actually happened

2621
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,376
No evidence

2622
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:34,912
So

2623
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:37,984
Do you want your dreams

2624
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
No

2625
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,848
Oh wait no I mean

2626
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:49,248
That desires that I have

2627
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:55,648
Come through if they put a magnet on my f****** head by a giraffe

2628
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:58,208
No no no

2629
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,488
What if you want that

2630
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,280
True

2631
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
Got to go to reset

2632
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:05,120
Conscious

2633
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,192
And then

2634
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,008
Stop submitting

2635
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,288
The outside stimuli

2636
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,432
This is a real reset

2637
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:21,760
Imagine if everybody realizes that imagine

2638
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,808
If a nurse that's in the medical system that

2639
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,344
I think she's power

2640
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,392
Realizes she can create our own private

2641
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,952
Eventually become the biggest private

2642
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:34,048
The English teacher realizes

2643
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:35,840
You can create the most

2644
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:37,120
One of the most powerful

2645
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,144
Schools

2646
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:40,704
Going down the line

2647
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,544
You realize the broadcaster that wants to be like Alex Jones and Owen

2648
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:46,336
Actually

2649
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,360
Did the same

2650
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,176
Spiritual energy that's moving through all of us

2651
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:56,576
And they can utilize that to become incredibly powerful to become the night or not going to get upset or successful cuz they're freaking us

2652
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:59,136
It's moments like that

2653
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:02,208
Suggested motivational speaker style conman really come out

2654
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:02,976
Jake

2655
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:07,328
It's just meaningless platitudes where the Fulfillment of all your dreams

2656
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:11,936
Easily if you just follow this guy's plan which is basically what his YouTube channel is all about already

2657
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:14,752
Halo embarrassing and exploitative

2658
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,520
Like

2659
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,544
Okay yeah

2660
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
You wanted

2661
01:53:17,824 --> 01:53:19,616
Encourage people to take a chance and

2662
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:21,152
Start their own business or whatever

2663
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:27,296
Why not but insinuating that doing so is like you're going to be the most colorful

2664
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,600
Practice in the state or whatever

2665
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:31,136
Exploitative of peoples

2666
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:32,160
Aspiration

2667
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:32,928
Yeah this is

2668
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:33,952
Wolf of Wall Street

2669
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:40,352
He's like oh okay sell me this pen and then you do the whole thing and then you find Jesus and then you're a motivational

2670
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:43,424
Speaker and as a broadcaster

2671
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,960
No desire to be like Alex

2672
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:47,008
Definitely no desire to be like Owen

2673
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,800
That would be

2674
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:50,080
So hora

2675
01:53:50,336 --> 01:53:52,640
Well I mean it's so funny to me that

2676
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,944
When you're when you're in that

2677
01:53:55,200 --> 01:54:00,832
Stat like let go of your body detach from physical material stuff all of that

2678
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,112
It goes to direct

2679
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:03,392
Benzino it can go with

2680
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:05,184
Well if you're detaching then what's

2681
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,792
The point of all that stuff just let it go don't worry about your fantasies just being part of

2682
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:12,352
One you know that all thing or the other ways

2683
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,888
If you believe hard enough

2684
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,656
You'll get a lot of

2685
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:17,216
Come on now haha

2686
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:19,008
Which one do you want to go with

2687
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,544
It's just what

2688
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,408
These guys to shut up I like to manifest I'm shutting off

2689
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,224
Conversely I'd like to manifest them get into

2690
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:31,808
That would be great

2691
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:34,368
If I manifested that would like six of your clips

2692
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:42,304
I've manifested myself sleeping this next curve cuz it's really just splitting hairs about Alex Smith

2693
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,584
Quoting Einstein

2694
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,608
But

2695
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:48,448
You know he has got to spin his wheels a little bit about the vaccine

2696
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:53,568
Why do you think Jake

2697
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:57,152
Great research kill so many people

2698
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,712
Statistically

2699
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,992
Did just tell him

2700
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,600
They'll rise of a defeatist we are doing their medicine

2701
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,184
Had that really bizarre

2702
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,976
Speech the other day work

2703
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:15,840
They're going to turn everything to a nature preserve and it runs going to living space

2704
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:18,400
I mean they realize they don't really need

2705
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,984
And that's what this is all about

2706
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,264
When we going all these.

2707
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:29,920
It can be a little scary

2708
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,200
I want to say that

2709
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:36,576
Alex put together reset when you're conscious other operation

2710
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:40,928
Knowing is half

2711
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:45,792
This point of the interview I'm going to be straight up with you I'm starting to get a little bit resent

2712
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,584
Fort Wayne anytime is taken

2713
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,168
Talk about something that is not the main point of recent Wars

2714
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:54,752
We've already laid out the central premise and promise to go super deep into it

2715
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:56,288
Alex is wasting time wax

2716
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,312
Philosophical

2717
01:55:57,568 --> 01:55:58,336
But why globalist

2718
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:00,128
Statues various methods to kill us

2719
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,664
It's super frustrating

2720
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:06,016
Also to Jake's point at this point he's gone over exactly zero.

2721
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:09,088
He's made references to an article and activist post

2722
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:13,440
Encoded imprecisely from the Canadian news story about a podcast

2723
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:14,208
Series

2724
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:14,976
Great research

2725
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:21,376
When people insist that they're going to get deep into a topic then dance around the edges a little bit and then incessantly promoted

2726
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,656
Different show they do

2727
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:25,472
And ramble about bulshit like how you can't die

2728
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:27,776
Generally means they don't actually have a d

2729
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:30,080
Familiarity with the topic there pretending to

2730
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,616
That's a strong Vibe I'm getting

2731
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,664
Chinese dude feeling that too

2732
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:38,272
I was I was waiting for you to say it first cuz I didn't want to embarrass myself if that wasn't

2733
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:43,648
It was a grand reveal

2734
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:47,232
Feeling more comfortable hours in a podcast

2735
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,512
They actually are right

2736
01:56:49,536 --> 01:56:50,048
No

2737
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:53,376
Also let's not forget that the knowing

2738
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,680
Is half the battle catchphrase comes from a series of

2739
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:58,240
Psa's the future GI Joe characters

2740
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:03,872
Which is produced by a Harvard child psychologist and endorsed by the national Child Safety Council

2741
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,408
Sounds pretty globalist to me

2742
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:09,504
The GI Joe folks only even made them as a cynical attempt to Garner

2743
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,320
Goodwill cuz I didn't want people to get mad that their show is just a

2744
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:15,648
Toy commercial targeted kids that screamed war is cool

2745
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,696
I would think that

2746
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:22,048
Especially considering how this episode is all about how Elite psychologists are trying to Minecon

2747
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,840
Control listen to changing our Behavior

2748
01:57:24,096 --> 01:57:25,632
Alex should be pointing out how these

2749
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,912
Psa's are perfect

2750
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:28,448
Example of exactly that

2751
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:34,080
These folks wanted to alter the behavior of children by having advice come from characters that they love which was

2752
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,896
Taking them off their natural trajectory

2753
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:40,224
Natural unemployment state a child would

2754
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:46,368
No to not give strangers their address but also the national Child Safety Council

2755
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,648
What the f***

2756
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,184
It is

2757
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,256
It is always funny to me how they pick and choose what they

2758
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:53,792
Things are conspiracies in the house

2759
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,840
You know and then they just take a lot of s***

2760
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:56,608
For granted

2761
01:57:56,864 --> 01:57:57,888
Like I like

2762
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,960
5G is terrifying to juice

2763
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:07,616
Tucci was fine

2764
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,688
But once

2765
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:12,736
Victory comes along holyshit

2766
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:13,760
Also dude

2767
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,808
I want a slightly unrelated but

2768
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,856
In preparation for this episode does game board

2769
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:21,440
These assholes a bunch of those GI Joe PSA

2770
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:23,488
The Jose had

2771
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:27,328
Advice but they were getting seriously involved in stuff that does

2772
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,656
Concerned by their own f****** business

2773
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
I don't need

2774
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,056
Flint scolding me for picking on the goalie on my soccer team for allowing a goal

2775
01:58:37,568 --> 01:58:43,712
That's a pretty small scale stuff for an elite military unit to be doing it honestly what's play to doing it that soccer game to begin with

2776
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,504
Pictures of kids

2777
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:47,040
What's a

2778
01:58:47,296 --> 01:58:49,856
I wasn't a g.i. Joe guy I was

2779
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,648
Starscream man I was a Transformer

2780
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:53,696
I didn't care much what

2781
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:57,024
My parents didn't allow me to watch the

2782
01:58:57,536 --> 01:59:00,864
What are some awareness of these PSAs are hilarious

2783
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:01,632
Crazy

2784
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:04,704
It sucks small-scale stuff

2785
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:08,800
Like some of it is great advice like don't tell strangers you're home alone

2786
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:11,104
Great

2787
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:12,896
But some of it is like

2788
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:16,224
Hey if someone wants you to jump over a ditch

2789
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
It's too big don't do it

2790
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,784
Put a splitter

2791
01:59:21,856 --> 01:59:23,648
Is it going to be like

2792
01:59:23,904 --> 01:59:24,416
Hey

2793
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,696
Listen real quick

2794
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:28,512
We can't allow Saudi Arabia have nuclear weapons

2795
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,792
Knowing is half the battle

2796
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:31,584
Black girl skateboard with you

2797
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,888
They're slightly do

2798
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:38,496
I don't know what GI Joe is

2799
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:39,520
Is doing getting

2800
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,056
Stop

2801
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:44,128
Minut Affairs of this small town

2802
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,664
It's it's just military prop

2803
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:51,808
You know it's like whatever cops say that they give a s*** about you 96% of crime is a

2804
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,344
Violator whatever the phone

2805
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,160
Like a bunch of

2806
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,720
3 kids for kids around their bike and they're heading

2807
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:05,120
Towards a railroad crossing and then out of nowhere one

2808
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
Railroad crossing sign

2809
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,168
Really

2810
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:13,824
A real version of that commercial is that a GI Joe pops up while I'm riding my bike and I

2811
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,872
Throw the bike out of and then get hit by a f******

2812
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:23,040
He doing waiting at that train trying Clawson

2813
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:24,320
Patrol near a bridge

2814
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,088
Anyway it's

2815
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:25,856
It's

2816
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:30,976
Bizarre and I recommend people go watch those

2817
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:34,560
Especially if you're bored of a hypnotist and a f****** washed-up drunk

2818
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,584
Doing nothing

2819
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:39,680
Anyway we get back to trying to promote reset Wars

2820
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:40,960

People looking at

02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,552
This car

2842
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:33,952
And you can take a look at it first maybe 25-30 minutes

2843
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:34,720
Cuz I can do buddy

2844
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,488
Yeah this is just

2845
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:36,768
Manipulative

2846
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:39,328
Tricks to get listeners to sign up for this email list

2847
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,888
Mark Zuckerberg could give a s*** about

2848
02:01:42,912 --> 02:01:44,192
Does not care

2849
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,984
We release reset Wars

2850
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:49,056
Zuckerberg is going to put the metaverse

2851
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:53,408
Send a high gear you imagine Mark Zuckerberg sitting in a boardroom being like

2852
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:55,712
What are you recently

2853
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:02,112

2854
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:05,952
Money hypnotism grifter

2855
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,304
It's going to take down the metaverse

2856
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:13,120
I have money so big

2857
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:15,424
So I mean look

2858
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:17,216
This reset words can be really disappointing

2859
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
Probably

2860
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:19,520
Whacking

2861
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:24,384
In substance based on this presentation that they've given so far sure

2862
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,152
But

2863
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:27,968
Stop Jake's friends listen to it and he stopped

2864
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:28,736
Drinking

2865
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,088
Quit drinking from it

2866
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:34,880
Has been watching you for

2867
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,160
15 year saying

2868
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:38,976
He's watched thousands of episodes in it was literally the most

2869
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,328
You know all this stuff

2870
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:47,680
You never put it together as you help me

2871
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:52,544
Meeting after meeting at

2872
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:57,408
I wanted to come on today just in honor of that

2873
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:00,480
Where are where are the documents

2874
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:01,760
Cancel what

2875
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:03,552
Also I would love

2876
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:04,832
To be a fly on the wall for those me

2877
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:06,368
Oh my God

2878
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:08,416
For those meetings

2879
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,440
Holy

2880
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:11,232
S*** that would be so I mean

2881
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,512
Take out a whiteboard

2882
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:18,656
Haha I don't even have a whiteboard they just got spaghetti in there literally throwing it a wall with

2883
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:25,312
Refrigerator magnets and whatever letter pops up is it when they win number one I don't think these meetings happen

2884
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,336
Start a business in writing

2885
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:27,872
The fantasy

2886
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:28,896
But

2887
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,176
I can imagine

2888
02:03:30,432 --> 02:03:31,456
No more annoying

2889
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,480
Anything then

2890
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,272
That idea of this meeting

2891
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,088
I'd love to watch it

2892
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:38,624
It'll be

2893
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:41,952
Nightmare for anybody else but for me who who

2894
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,768
Whenever he said he got a friend to quit drink

2895
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:45,536
Raptor watch

2896
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:48,352
I imagined in my head that immediate moment where

2897
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:50,912
Friend is drunk and he's watching this and then he looks at the

2898
02:03:51,168 --> 02:03:52,192
The brown bottle and just go

2899
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:53,216
Nah

2900
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:56,288
This is clearly this is the bottles fault

2901
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:59,360
Is the bottle led me to this moment and I got to get rid of it

2902
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:02,432
Immediately thought like

2903
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:08,064
Okay so watching it got someone to stop drinking but making it didn't get Alex

2904
02:04:08,576 --> 02:04:10,880
Baby Alex

2905
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:18,560
You know he's not he's only on the 10th step he never made it to the 11 so

2906
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,584

02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,424

Everybody from finding out so you better

2917
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,272
Better believe

2918
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:43,136
They put reset wars together there's a good chance

2919
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:46,208
That they're going to try to shut it down they're going to try to shut the website down

2920
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:49,280

02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:55,424
So

2924
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:56,448
This is wild

2925
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,240
Conjecture on my part but

2926
02:04:58,496 --> 02:05:02,080
I noticed something strange when I was looking at the who is data

2927
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:04,384
For this new website

2928
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,432
Alex's pretty consist

2929
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,480
With the hosting that uses for his website

2930
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:13,088
Infowars banned. Video newswars B sites are all hosted by Epic

2931
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,136
Because he knows that no matter what he does

2932
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,672
Cuz no matter what criticism he gets

2933
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,976
Epic is not going to take a s*** down

2934
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:21,280
That company is fine hosting all manner of

2935
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:24,096
Objectionable content and is essentially the last Refuge

2936
02:05:24,352 --> 02:05:25,376
Internet Chat Heads

2937
02:05:25,888 --> 02:05:26,656
If you're not see

2938
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:29,472
Come on over we don't mind

2939
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:32,544
This thing but reset Wars isn't hosted by Epic

2940
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:35,616
It's just a URL they registered through GoDaddy

2941
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:37,408
So it actually would

2942
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:39,968
Eventually be far more likely to be taken offline

2943
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:43,552
If GoDaddy didn't want to be associated with Alex and is content

2944
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:48,928
Instances of GoDaddy doing exactly this like when they pulled their services from Hosta

2945
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:49,696
Gab

2946
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:50,720
In 2018

2947
02:05:51,488 --> 02:05:52,768
This is complicated

2948
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:53,536
Because

2949
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:55,840
On the one hand I think it's far too

2950
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:59,936
Conspiracy theory thinking to claim that Alex intentionally put this website up

2951
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,960
Funnel Escarosa

2952
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:01,728
Open platform

2953
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:04,032
Because he actually wants it to be taken down

2954
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,312
Put on the other hand

2955
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,848
The circumstantial evidence

2956
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:07,872
Kind of interested

2957
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:09,664
Like

2958
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,224
Can Bounty be able to grandstand but I was the victim

2959
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,528
How they don't want this information getting out

2960
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,600
He be able to pretend he's a prophet because he predicted they take

2961
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:18,368
Site down

2962
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,696
I don't think that this is unintentional thing on his part

2963
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:23,232
It's fishy is hell like

2964
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,256
Why wouldn't

2965
02:06:24,512 --> 02:06:25,536
He hosts this on Epic

2966
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:28,096
All of the other sites that he runs

2967
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:31,168
I mean it doesn't make suntikan

2968
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:34,752
I can imagine a non conspiratorial way which

2969
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,544
Which is being dumb

2970
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:38,848
Like maybe the

2971
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,640
The site was set up by Deuce

2972
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:46,272
And Dulce is still on YouTube so he was like I'll just use my regular

2973
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:49,600
Platform

2974
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:55,232
Possibility I suppose I can also I can see what you're saying I can't imagine Alex

2975
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:58,304
Doing the most important work of his career

2976
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,096
Launching this website

2977
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,144
And then being like yellets

2978
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,424
Let's Let The Host

2979
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:04,704
Thing Beyond something today

2980
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,472
Potentially faulty

2981
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,008
You're very right about that

2982
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,288
It seems weird

2983
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:14,688
Yeah and they are pushing that like this is so dangerous narrative really hard

2984
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:16,992
Actually believe it to be so dangerous to be playing

2985
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:17,760
Preemptive

2986
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,368
Even the most secure place possible

2987
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,160
Which leads me to believe

2988
02:07:24,672 --> 02:07:27,232
Then maybe they have an expectation that this website might get take

2989
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,000
Taken down

2990
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:31,328
It's useful as a contact information harvesting

2991
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,632
Get people's email addresses

2992
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,168
I meant the contact

2993
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:36,960
Can just be published out banned. Video

2994
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,264
Totally

2995
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:45,152
Fine so the theory that we're operating are not we're operating under but the theory that I'm

2996
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:45,920
Hearing

2997
02:07:46,176 --> 02:07:46,944
Is that it

2998
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:47,712
It's possible

2999
02:07:48,480 --> 02:07:50,016
They are using this as a

3000
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,808
Fishing website for right now

3001
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:55,136
Once the content is released on the website there expect

3002
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,416
Taken down because

3003
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,440
Is GoDaddy is like

3004
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,464
Hey no Nazis

3005
02:07:58,976 --> 02:08:00,768
Then whenever the content is taken down they put

3006
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,560
Put it back on to banned. Video

3007
02:08:03,328 --> 02:08:04,864
Grandstand about how they've been

3008
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,240
You know is there in there telling

3009
02:08:10,496 --> 02:08:11,264
I don't

3010
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:12,544
Want to say that that's a

3011
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,824
The theory because I think

3012
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,360
That's a little bit

3013
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:16,896
Conspiracy

3014
02:08:18,432 --> 02:08:19,456
It's a little out there

3015
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:24,064
Actual pieces of information

3016
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:27,648
Are what that would be there if that's what they were doing

3017
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:30,976
Might not be

3018
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,768
I'm leaning towards

3019
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,072
Occam's razor

3020
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:37,632
Dumb oversight from these Dum Dums

3021
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,936
That sounds like the most obvious and

3022
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:41,984
Likely I think I agree with you on that

3023
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:43,008
Write that fraud

3024
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:45,824
But the information that you are pointing out is very sick

3025
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:48,384
I'm in one of the reasons I wanted to bring it up is

3026
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,152
I think

3027
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:51,968
Obviously I agree with you the most likely explanation is

3028
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,736
Incompetence

3029
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:56,064
But on the off-chance that this does end up happening

3030
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:57,856
To be able to have

3031
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,392
Look

3032
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,416
Is look at their hay

3033
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,184
Like

3034
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,976
Yeah yeah

3035
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:08,352
And when the stakes are this High maybe they're putting more planning into it

3036
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:09,376
I don't know

3037
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,144
This day

3038
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,168
Could not be higher

3039
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,448
Maybe

3040
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:14,752
Maybe so this life is deranged

3041
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:18,336
It's the owner

3042
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:19,360
By Jesse

3043
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,384
Yelling about

3044
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:26,016
In front of her in front of a building in Hellyer Mendeleev

3045
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:28,064
What are you doing

3046
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:29,856
In what

3047
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:32,416
Everybody realizes one by one we go

3048
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:33,184
Oh my gosh

3049
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,000
Consciousness creates reality I've been programmed to believe I'm not that

3050
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,536
Make money

3051
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:43,168
Emotional pattern that's been memorizing my brain and nervous system that I've

3052
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:47,776
Once we break out of

3053
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,056
Muffler system

3054
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:50,592
And re-engineer it

3055
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,504
I just think Alex is like

3056
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:59,808
Call a dealer need to make a new country is

3057
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:03,392
Is I mean it's probably metaphorical but it's f***** up

3058
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:07,744
Protesting is it going to do

3059
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:08,768
Also

3060
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:10,304
I think in terms of like

3061
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,840
Saying that they have been

3062
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:14,144
Brain to think that I have tendency towards

3063
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:14,912
Depression

3064
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:16,192
It's really insulting

3065
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:16,960
And

3066
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,520
I mean what would it what do you say that the man has

3067
02:10:20,288 --> 02:10:24,896
You know condition me to believe that my arm is broken after I falling off a roof

3068
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:25,664
Right

3069
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:27,968
All you have to do is believe

3070
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:30,016
Is it looks

3071
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:32,832
Looks like it's broken but really it's not even matter

3072
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,624
Solid matter

3073
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,416
You just need to use your mind

3074
02:10:36,672 --> 02:10:39,232
To believe that your arm is fine and then it is

3075
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,512
Yet here's what I'm

3076
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:41,792
All right and this

3077
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:42,560
This is my pitch

3078
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:44,608
I'm going to try and solve everything real quick

3079
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:46,400
Good luck

3080
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,936
When I was in

3081
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:48,704
High School

3082
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,472
Explain Sports

3083
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,008
You know all the

3084
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,032
The sports coaches

3085
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
Had

3086
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:55,104
Inspirational slogan

3087
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,384
The lake

3088
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,152
Posters

3089
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,176
The Ted believe

3090
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,968
You know the whole thing in there

3091
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:00,736
Yeah yeah yeah

3092
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:01,504
Now

3093
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,272
I'm going to toss

3094
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,576
What if we had poster

3095
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:05,856
In

3096
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,136
High school locker room

3097
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,928
That just lay out of

3098
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:09,952
Exactly what propagate

3099
02:11:10,464 --> 02:11:11,232
Justin comments

3100
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:13,792
Maybe longer posters but I mean look

3101
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:15,072
I've heard this speech

3102
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:18,400
Word for word from a million different kinds

3103
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:20,192
This is the one this is the speech

3104
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:21,984
Yeah it's it's it's

3105
02:11:22,240 --> 02:11:27,360
It's very boilerplate right before the game

3106
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,896
You don't get yourself

3107
02:11:29,152 --> 02:11:33,248
Like I'm not going to get caught by a cop I'm not going to

3108
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,808
Someday be nice I think

3109
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:36,832
Even what

3110
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:38,880
You could do is just a poster that says

3111
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:41,184
Don't trust hypnotist

3112
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:44,768
They're sketchy

3113
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:46,048
Maybe we should

3114
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:49,632
To shorten it to instead of the poster that says believe it just says don't believe

3115
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,656
Yeah yeah

3116
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,192
So

3117
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:54,752
This point in the episode

3118
02:11:55,264 --> 02:11:55,776
Kind of

3119
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:57,056
Realize like

3120
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:00,640
Brainwash yourself

3121
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,432
For the world

3122
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:04,480
Rain washes

3123
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:07,296
The program are the systems

3124
02:12:07,552 --> 02:12:08,320
Call about it

3125
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:10,368
Trust God to guide you out of it

3126
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:13,440
Then just realize that this stuff exist

3127
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,144
When

3128
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:23,936
Was filming this

3129
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,592
Reset where's the greatest thing ever did

3130
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:33,920
Rarely police promotion

3131
02:12:34,176 --> 02:12:35,200
It's very humble

3132
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,736
If what I mean it's about

3133
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:38,016
People finding what they mean

3134
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:39,808
They'll find it

3135
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,832
I am f******

3136
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:42,368
Urea

3137
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:48,768
About this s*** because they promised they were going to get the weed and talk about these documents so I read up on a bunch of stuff and I found

3138
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,352
It was perfect for them to talk about

3139
02:12:53,888 --> 02:12:54,656
This is what I'm about to

3140
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:58,496
It's a real have to do with mind control on it

3141
02:12:58,752 --> 02:12:59,264
Easy to find

3142
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:00,288
The actual document

3143
02:13:00,544 --> 02:13:04,640
Okay running a self-help hypnosis style scam here

3144
02:13:04,896 --> 02:13:07,200
Pretending that it has anything to do with the real world

3145
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:08,224
Declassified documents

3146
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:11,296
That's because they were serious at all they would have fun with this one

3147
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:15,904
It's September 1965 researchers working within the CIA

3148
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:19,232
Study to attempt to remote control the behavior of a dog

3149
02:13:19,488 --> 02:13:21,280
By way of providing rewarding elect

3150
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,560
Call stimulation to parts

3151
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:23,584
The dog's brain

3152
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:25,632
Admittedly this sounds really fun

3153
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,680
F***** up at first glance but then again people

3154
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:30,496
Train dogs to do all sorts of things by way of conditioning

3155
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:33,568
It's not like a dog wants to sit or roll over it

3156
02:13:33,824 --> 02:13:34,592
We trained that if it

3157
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,360
Does

3158
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,640
It gets the reward that it was

3159
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:39,712
This operates in a similar principle

3160
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:41,760
Does using electrical stimulation of Rewards

3161
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:45,344
Centers in the dog's brain or at least the goal was to see if this was possible

3162
02:13:45,856 --> 02:13:47,392
We could give him a tree or we could

3163
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:50,464
Cut open a skull put some

3164
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:54,816
I see how that goes Nobody wants

3165
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:56,096
To train their dog is hard

3166
02:13:56,608 --> 02:13:58,144
This is remarkable stuff

3167
02:13:58,400 --> 02:14:00,448
From a dystopian science perspective

3168
02:14:02,240 --> 02:14:03,520
You can look at this and be like hahaha

3169
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:07,872
But honestly if you read the final report on it it's really hard to come away thing

3170
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:09,408
Has any practical application

3171
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,432
Particularly interim

3172
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,200
Abused

3173
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,224
Documents

3174
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:14,016
For one thing

3175
02:14:14,272 --> 02:14:16,064
Human brains are very different than dog brain

3176
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,112
Humans rely far less

3177
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:18,880
On Insta

3178
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:19,904
Thank the dogs doing term

3179
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:20,672
Their behavior

3180
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:27,328
Who be exceedingly hard to conceive of how you would program a routine of electrical stimuli they would get human to do complex

3181
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,120
Especially considering

3182
02:14:29,376 --> 02:14:34,496
I all they were able to do with his dog is get it to walk from one place to another

3183
02:14:34,752 --> 02:14:35,264
Slowly

3184
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,544
Slow growth is still growth

3185
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:40,384
Accomplish this they needed to put electrodes

3186
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:41,408
In the dog's head

3187
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,200
Mounted with a protective helmet

3188
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:46,016
Hey the stimulator pack which could be activated remotely

3189
02:14:46,272 --> 02:14:48,576
But only from a fairly limited distance

3190
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:50,368
64 Wildman

3191
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:56,768
The researchers tried to see if they could figure out how to actually Alyssa actions from a dog through electrical stimulation but sound

3192
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,304
It wasn't an area worth it

3193
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:00,352
Exploring so they only ended up

3194
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,632
Doing Rewards

3195
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:02,400
After training

3196
02:15:02,656 --> 02:15:04,704
They found that the dogs had a strong tent

3197
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,496
Do the thing that they were doing

3198
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:08,544
Just before they got the rewards

3199
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:09,312
Simulation

3200
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:11,360
So as it pointed out in the report

3201
02:15:11,616 --> 02:15:12,640
If they were moving

3202
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,664
Forward they would

3203
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:14,944
Continue to move forward

3204
02:15:15,456 --> 02:15:16,480
So you could get a dog to

3205
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:18,272
Continue to move forward

3206
02:15:18,528 --> 02:15:19,040
Bye

3207
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:25,184
But keeping on stimulating right they found the dogs had a tendency to

3208
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:29,280
To move forward in the direction they're headed was facing when they got the stimulation

3209
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:32,608
This was an observation the researchers made that allowed them

3210
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,912
Anything resembling remote

3211
02:15:35,168 --> 02:15:35,936
Control of the dog

3212
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:38,240
Kind of appeared to be remote control

3213
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:40,800
Another problem they found was that it's barely do

3214
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:41,824
Difficult to get these Electra

3215
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:43,104
Hoverboard stimulation

3216
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,128
To work when they're other

3217
02:15:44,384 --> 02:15:46,176
Competing stimuli around like food

3218
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:48,224
Unless the stimulation was quote

3219
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:49,504
At Optimum levels

3220
02:15:50,272 --> 02:15:51,552
It's hard to predict how this would work

3221
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:54,368
In the real world like in the wild where the dog would have a

3222
02:15:55,136 --> 02:15:57,184
The Gathering

3223
02:15:57,440 --> 02:15:57,952
Cher

3224
02:15:58,208 --> 02:15:59,744
The researchers concluded that quote

3225
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:01,536
Well the electrode preparation has

3226
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:03,072
Been satisfactory for research

3227
02:16:03,328 --> 02:16:03,840
Purposes

3228
02:16:04,096 --> 02:16:06,144
It's unlikely that it would serve over very long

3229
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:09,216
There was also the problem of eating

3230
02:16:09,472 --> 02:16:11,264
Take a person to monitor the precise movements of

3231
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:12,032
The dog in order

3232
02:16:12,288 --> 02:16:14,336
Continue reinforcing the behavior that's desire

3233
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:15,616
Spell require

3234
02:16:15,872 --> 02:16:18,432
Constant visual coverage of the dog at all times

3235
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:21,504
Which doesn't seem too helpful outside of lab application

3236
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,064
Like if you were trying to get the dogs to work as Scouts

3237
02:16:24,320 --> 02:16:25,856
Essentially

3238
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,136
Be so complicated

3239
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,928
And the idea of being able to

3240
02:16:29,184 --> 02:16:29,696
2

3241
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:33,024
Challenging terrain review

3242
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,120
Instead let's try training with food and not cutting open brains

3243
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,656
This is mighty bizarre stuff

3244
02:16:38,912 --> 02:16:39,936
Obviously the ethical

3245
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,472
Applications of how these dogs are treated

3246
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:43,008
Is a serious concern but

3247
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:45,824
The kind of super nightmarish it that conspiracy theorist

3248
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,104
Whatever want imagine it

3249
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:49,920
They don't even talk about this

3250
02:16:50,432 --> 02:16:53,248
See the worst thing is I bet so.

3251
02:16:53,504 --> 02:16:54,528
The type of evil sign

3252
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:56,064
Encino where you're like you guys

3253
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:56,832
Should really just

3254
02:16:57,088 --> 02:17:00,672
F****** stop that but the evil scientist kept who like

3255
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:02,720
What's the dog's head alive after

3256
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:05,024
After the body was removed for like a few hours

3257
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:07,840
Let's see more of how that goes I want food

3258
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:09,376
Futurama style heads in jars

3259
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,400
That's what I'm

3260
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:12,192
Looking more towards as opposed to like

3261
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:15,008
Getting a constant handjob from electro

3262
02:17:15,264 --> 02:17:16,032
You got to manifest

3263
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:18,848
Was Furious

3264
02:17:19,104 --> 02:17:20,128
Talk about that

3265
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:21,152
Because

3266
02:17:22,176 --> 02:17:25,504
Yeah that's right a real house of what they're talkin about

3267
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:27,552
If you start talking

3268
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,320
About cats

3269
02:17:28,576 --> 02:17:30,368
Conspiracies that you can look into

3270
02:17:30,880 --> 02:17:32,416
People are going to start wanting to look into

3271
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:33,184
All York

3272
02:17:34,208 --> 02:17:35,744
That's why they all have to be

3273
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,584
Able to look at the source

3274
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:41,632
Clear because if you do yeah it's

3275
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:44,448
You got from

3276
02:17:44,704 --> 02:17:47,264
Finding this story and finding and learning something

3277
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:49,568
Interesting and fun

3278
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,872
Imagine if somebody who really believed in

3279
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:52,640
Conspiracies

3280
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,432
Actually got that real feel

3281
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:56,480
Well blue

3282
02:17:56,736 --> 02:17:57,760
Present this as

3283
02:17:58,016 --> 02:17:58,784
Bisbee scientist

3284
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:05,184
So figured out a way to make humans do whatever they want buy it and receptors in their brain

3285
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:10,048
So anyway

3286
02:18:10,304 --> 02:18:10,816
Is stupid

3287
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,096
This

3288
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:13,120
Next clip ends

3289
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:14,656
In the stupidest way

3290
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,960
Once you reach out

3291
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:22,848
Cost at all that

3292
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:25,664
Barack Obama and nnn all these people

3293
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:28,992
University Dodge

3294
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:31,808
Barack Obama

3295
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,088
Think about the idea

3296
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,136
Abyss Newtonian model of

3297
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,184
Don't know

3298
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:43,840
Who's Newtonian model of physical phenomena

3299
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:46,144
Has he won the Nobel Prize

3300
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:50,752
Studying atoms and he said there's no matter is such that at our jumps back and forth

3301
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,312
What

3302
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:55,872
Fluxus

3303
02:18:56,384 --> 02:18:56,896
And that's why

3304
02:18:57,408 --> 02:18:57,920
What if

3305
02:18:58,176 --> 02:19:02,016
Realize the secrets of quantum physics and how to harness the power

3306
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:06,112
We already know the observer effect shows us that subatomic

3307
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,904
Particles are sometimes

3308
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:09,952
And sometimes their waves

3309
02:19:10,208 --> 02:19:14,304
Moves into another dimension

3310
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:16,864
Your bank account is an observer effect

3311
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:21,472
Your bank account isn't Observer

3312
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,520
Are you trying to tell me

3313
02:19:23,776 --> 02:19:26,336
That if I were to put my money in a box

3314
02:19:26,848 --> 02:19:28,128
With a cesium atom

3315
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,992
Like sometime

3316
02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:35,552
Play 56

3317
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:39,136
Could be all the money or none of the money

3318
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:48,096
The amount of money that's in your bank account is a function of whether or not you're observant

3319
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:50,400
If you're not observing at the way funk

3320
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:52,448
Collapses naturally

3321
02:19:52,704 --> 02:19:53,472
No I got it

3322
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:02,944
Estimated are you telling me that we're stuck in this do Tony and

3323
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,480
Physics pointer video

3324
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:06,784
Oh my God I do like that though

3325
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:13,184
Alex is trying to get you to transcend CNN and Barack Obama trying to get you to

3326
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:15,232
The f*** off from Dakota in physics

3327
02:20:16,256 --> 02:20:18,560
Slightly different agenda

3328
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:21,376
Play you can break out of

3329
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:24,448
If you just use the observer effect course

3330
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:26,752
Your bank account is an observer effect

3331
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:30,848
Thousands of people realize this and they all break out of

3332
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:31,872
Servitude

3333
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:34,176
Thousands of people realize that they

3334
02:20:34,432 --> 02:20:35,968
Change

3335
02:20:38,784 --> 02:20:41,088
Practices you can change the education system that

3336
02:20:41,856 --> 02:20:47,232
Once people start using The Power Of Consciousness to experiment on this reality and go if

3337
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:50,304
Affected

3338
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:52,352
Particles

3339
02:20:52,608 --> 02:20:58,752
Consciousness creates reality iCandy pattern myself from the world be transformed by the renewing of your mind

3340
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,544
I can use the power of consciousness

3341
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:03,360
Thermistor to recreate my life

3342
02:21:06,176 --> 02:21:08,224
They don't want us to know they don't want us

3343
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:10,784
Start to test the power of consciousness

3344
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:11,552
And say

3345
02:21:12,064 --> 02:21:14,368
Can I create this new business this new movement

3346
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:18,720
Increase my business bigger and better

3347
02:21:24,096 --> 02:21:26,144
Right now

3348
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,704
That kids too thirsty for this

3349
02:21:29,216 --> 02:21:29,728
Does plug

3350
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,008
Holy kiss

3351
02:21:31,776 --> 02:21:34,592
Answer I have to tell you something right now I haven't been to

3352
02:21:34,848 --> 02:21:40,480
Did the greatest machine in the history of the United States tell me tell you something this simple machine

3353
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:42,016
Can fit on your desk

3354
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:43,296
So I can sit on your deck

3355
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:45,088
And it will take whatever Rock

3356
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:46,880
You find Weatherby LED

3357
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:48,928
Weatherby sodium Weatherby

3358
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:53,792
Sedimentary doesn't matter and it will take that Roxanne transmogrified into gold

3359
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:54,816
Wow

3360
02:21:55,072 --> 02:22:00,448
Imagine what would happen if a thousands of people had these devices in their home every morning they would wake up

3361
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,664
This is aspirational bulshit

3362
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:17,600
Yep there's one person who's making a lot of money off

3363
02:22:17,856 --> 02:22:19,648
I just love like

3364
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:24,000
Dislike you can sense it it does come to a head a little bit

3365
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:25,024
Towards the end

3366
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:25,792
Like

3367
02:22:26,048 --> 02:22:26,560
Alex

3368
02:22:27,072 --> 02:22:28,096
Is kind of getting

3369
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:29,376
Being fed up with how much

3370
02:22:29,632 --> 02:22:30,656
He's promoting the website

3371
02:22:30,912 --> 02:22:35,264
You should go to a little bit too much

3372
02:22:37,056 --> 02:22:40,128
Only played a few clips

3373
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:41,408
Since about it tonight then I

3374
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:42,176
Concluded

3375
02:22:43,712 --> 02:22:45,248
Another thing that Alex doesn't like

3376
02:22:45,504 --> 02:22:46,784
Wouldn't like is

3377
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:48,832
Directions to be a really

3378
02:22:49,088 --> 02:22:51,136
Comfortable taking over the show

3379
02:22:51,648 --> 02:22:52,928
I got a daughter she's

3380
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:56,512
1617 months old everything's happening too

3381
02:22:57,536 --> 02:23:00,608
Finding out the secrets of the pharmaceutical industry isn't going to save us

3382
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:08,032
Physical body there's no such thing as death

3383
02:23:08,288 --> 02:23:14,432
We're the imagination of ourselves we're already in the simulation belief control that reality

3384
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:15,968
Reset Wars

3385
02:23:16,224 --> 02:23:19,552
Is showing the first but we are no longer in peace

3386
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,624
Real players is Christ intended to me

3387
02:23:25,696 --> 02:23:26,976
Cam right now sign up

3388
02:23:27,488 --> 02:23:30,816
Wow I just I know Alex at well enough

3389
02:23:31,072 --> 02:23:31,584
From his

3390
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:36,448
Yeah serving his work he does not like it when other people go to Breck

3391
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:39,264
Kiko's to buy job buddy

3392
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:42,336
You're taking my job yeah

3393
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,640
Insulting all boys

3394
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:45,408
Respect

3395
02:23:48,992 --> 02:23:50,272
And I love it

3396
02:23:50,784 --> 02:23:52,064
Where is it where somebody

3397
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,344
Who works soap

3398
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,112
Lee evil

3399
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:55,648
I would be better but

3400
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,232
What you going to do enjoy it though because I think there's a

3401
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:00,256
Inherent tension

3402
02:24:00,768 --> 02:24:01,792
That exists here

3403
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,072
Between these two people

3404
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:08,192
First of all their worldviews are completely incompatible

3405
02:24:08,448 --> 02:24:09,472
Maybe because

3406
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:12,288
Nick needs promotion and Alex needs money

3407
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:13,824
But maybe they can

3408
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,104
Get over these

3409
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,664
Fundamental differences they have or at least pretend to

3410
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:18,944
But it will be a problem

3411
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:22,016
Yeah it's going to be tough

3412
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:27,392
Hang around with time and time is an illusion and so is Death guy all the time

3413
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:35,584
Also like if you just go through his YouTube channel I swear everything is so f****** repetitive

3414
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,608
Over and over again with

3415
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:37,888
Just clickbait titles

3416
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:40,960
Yeah yeah literally

3417
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:45,312
I just imagine hanging out with him would get old

3418
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:46,848
Oh yeah

3419
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:48,128
Then maybe you'll be fun

3420
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:52,480
Towards the end of the day interview that they have

3421
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:54,016
Alex

3422
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,808
It's kind of realizing like we have got to do

3423
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:58,368
We really haven't gotten too much of any

3424
02:24:58,624 --> 02:25:00,416
Maybe we sighted

3425
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:02,208
Two articles

3426
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,744
Fauci flip-flopped on masks

3427
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:09,376
It's true there's also the ASU study that they were misrepresenting

3428
02:25:09,632 --> 02:25:10,656
Get back let's get back to this

3429
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:13,728
So I want to continue here with some of these are

3430
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:14,752
There's so many in

3431
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:17,056
This one fascinating Alex

3432
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:20,896
This is about

3433
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:21,664
Energy

3434
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:23,712
Human behavior

3435
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:24,736
And

3436
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:26,016
It says quote

3437
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:27,552
Wow

3438
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,088
Attention

3439
02:25:29,344 --> 02:25:30,368
Should be toward

3440
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:33,696
Human performance

3441
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:35,488
Loading

3442
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:36,768
Electro

3443
02:25:37,024 --> 02:25:37,536
Magnetic

3444
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:45,984
In an electromagnetic field effect remember we are all just an electromagnetic field

3445
02:25:46,752 --> 02:25:48,288
Play manipulator electrical field

3446
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:51,872
That's what it's saying right this is a non-lethal energy weapon

3447
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:54,688
So this is from a document I can find cited on

3448
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:55,968
All kinds of sketchy

3449
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:59,552
Conspiracy websites but they really just use the same quote

3450
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:01,088
And the clean the source is

3451
02:26:01,344 --> 02:26:05,696
Creations on the title Airforce 1982 final report on biotech

3452
02:26:05,952 --> 02:26:07,232
Technology research requirements

3453
02:26:07,488 --> 02:26:09,792
4 Aeronautical Systems through the year 2000

3454
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:11,072
I'm noticing

3455
02:26:11,328 --> 02:26:13,376
Pattern that most of them don't have links

3456
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:14,400
Even when

3457
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,680
This report is real

3458
02:26:16,448 --> 02:26:19,264
It's a real document it was prepared by the Southwest research

3459
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,568
Institute in San Antonio with cooperation

3460
02:26:21,824 --> 02:26:23,616
From the Air Force Aerospace medical device

3461
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:24,896
It was released

3462
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:28,480
On July 30th 1982 and it has never been class

3463
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:31,040
As you might expect

3464
02:26:31,296 --> 02:26:32,320
From clues in the document

3465
02:26:32,576 --> 02:26:36,160
Title this is a study of potential issues that could come up for future pilot

3466
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:37,696
Which could have Biotin

3467
02:26:37,952 --> 02:26:39,232
Technological solutions

3468
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,048
This document does indeed say quote

3469
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:46,144
Initial attention should be directed toward organ-specific thermal loading

3470
02:26:46,400 --> 02:26:47,936
And electromagnetic field effect

3471
02:26:48,704 --> 02:26:49,472
Books like Jake

3472
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:51,776
Or what I would like all dumb.

3473
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:54,592
Just choose to read that and not pay

3474
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:55,360
Alexa

3475
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,920
Subsequent work should address the

3476
02:26:58,176 --> 02:27:00,992
Possibilities of directing and interrogating mental function

3477
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:04,064
To provide revolutionary capability to defend

3478
02:27:04,576 --> 02:27:05,088
Kostelac

3479
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:08,928
When this document says that initial attention to be direct

3480
02:27:09,184 --> 02:27:11,232
Did towards thermal loading and electromagnetic

3481
02:27:11,744 --> 02:27:13,024
It's saying that these things

3482
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:16,608
Are things to be concerned about pilot of the future possibly being up a

3483
02:27:17,376 --> 02:27:20,960
Anyone who's as much as looked at this document or read the title critic

3484
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:21,984
Would know that

3485
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,032
Variable

3486
02:27:25,056 --> 02:27:26,080
Conspiracy theorist tickets

3487
02:27:26,336 --> 02:27:27,104
Too far and then

3488
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,408
Southwest at the spin-off into an airline

3489
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:34,272
Didn't see that coming

3490
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:39,648
This specific word comes from a section of the text titled radiation environment

3491
02:27:40,416 --> 02:27:41,696
I'll read you the first paragraph

3492
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,464
Graph of that sucks

3493
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:49,120
Electromagnetic and particulate radiation produced by nuclear weapons high-energy lasers and futurehype

3494
02:27:49,376 --> 02:27:52,192
Powered pulsed radiofrequency radiation systems

3495
02:27:52,448 --> 02:27:52,960
Represent

3496
02:27:53,216 --> 02:27:56,032
Potential anti-personnel devices for the year 2000

3497
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:56,800
Then beyond

3498
02:27:57,312 --> 02:27:59,104
Lasers and rsr systems

3499
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:03,968
Add a new dimension of crew vulnerability that clearly requires protective devices

3500
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:04,736
Hamilton Realty

3501
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:05,504
For hardening

3502
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:06,784
Normal aircraft system

3503
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:08,576
That's what this is about

3504
02:28:09,088 --> 02:28:09,856
It's not about developing

3505
02:28:10,112 --> 02:28:12,928
Beamed energy to change human behavior get inside the brain

3506
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:14,720
Another thing that's important

3507
02:28:14,976 --> 02:28:18,816
The point out is that the exact wording that Jake is using doesn't match the actual text

3508
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:19,840
The documents

3509
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:21,632
I know that he's reading this from one of the can

3510
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:22,656
Conspiracy blogs

3511
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:23,680
They just missed quotes

3512
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:24,448
The text

3513
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,472
And takes it out of

3514
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:29,056
Depth of his research on the topic that he cares he's for

3515
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:31,360
He's pretending to care so much about it this guy

3516
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,128
The f****** loser

3517
02:28:32,384 --> 02:28:35,200
Right right so the document says like hey let's

3518
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:40,064
Think about what might blow up our planes later and he turned that into hey let's create weapons to

3519
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:40,832
Control people's brain

3520
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:46,464
Okay as erroneously is this Jake has revealed to the world that either he's

3521
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:48,000
Read this document needs intent

3522
02:28:48,256 --> 02:28:50,304
Lying about it or he hasn't read it

3523
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:54,656
And misrepresented quote on a dumb conspiracy blog is good enough for him to try to pay

3524
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:55,680
Pants off to his audience

3525
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:57,216
Is proof of a grand mine

3526
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:59,008
Control plot that the government is hatching

3527
02:28:59,264 --> 02:28:59,776
Convince you

3528
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:02,336
Figueroa physical being in that death is real

3529
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:05,152
This dude straight up the worst I just can't handle this b*******

3530
02:29:05,408 --> 02:29:05,920
Yeah

3531
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:07,200
I want.

3532
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:09,248
And I'm finding these document

3533
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,832
It's right that is an issue

3534
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:14,880
And I understand that megathrust

3535
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:15,904
Have you thought about the

3536
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:17,184
Perhaps

3537
02:29:18,208 --> 02:29:18,720
It is

3538
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:19,744
An observer for

3539
02:29:20,768 --> 02:29:22,560
And so when you're looking at the document

3540
02:29:23,072 --> 02:29:23,584
They say what

3541
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,608
You want them to

3542
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,144
But when you're not

3543
02:29:26,656 --> 02:29:28,960
The documents they say what they say Dan

3544
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:30,496
It's all about

3545
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:32,288
Being an electromagnetic

3546
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:33,056
Wakefield

3547
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:35,616
Alright I got to go

3548
02:29:35,872 --> 02:29:38,432
It goes on

3549
02:29:38,944 --> 02:29:40,480
This document goes on according to Jake

3550
02:29:41,504 --> 02:29:45,856
And it goes on it says by using very low-frequency electromagnetic radiation

3551
02:29:46,112 --> 02:29:47,648
The waves way below radio freak

3552
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:49,440
Quincy's on the electromagnetic spectrum

3553
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:52,256
Found they can induce the brain to release

3554
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:58,656
Regulating chemicals

3555
02:29:58,912 --> 02:29:59,424
FedEx Field

3556
02:29:59,936 --> 02:30:00,448
And they could

3557
02:30:00,704 --> 02:30:02,240
Put people into a stupor

3558
02:30:02,752 --> 02:30:05,312
Take a singing at the report goes on to say this but it doesn't

3559
02:30:05,568 --> 02:30:06,336
That's not from this

3560
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:07,104
Report at all

3561
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,128
That's a reference

3562
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:11,456
Said the earlier thing you was talking about from the 1997 article in

3563
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:12,992
US News & World Report

3564
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:15,296
That Jake was lying about earlier

3565
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,576
That's the one about Aldo

3566
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:20,672
Bird who claimed that he used electromagnetic waves to release histamine and rats

3567
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:24,256
The article does use the word stupor but it doesn't say that he could put human

3568
02:30:24,512 --> 02:30:25,024
Into a stupor

3569
02:30:25,536 --> 02:30:27,840
The sentences quote we could put animals into us

3570
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:33,984
Jake is mixing up his shity sources and he's not even siding them correctly because much like Alex he's a lazy liar

3571
02:30:34,752 --> 02:30:36,544
But the article apparently goes on

3572
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,336
And it goes on to say

3573
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:42,944
Many of the non-lethal weapons under consideration utilized

3574
02:30:43,456 --> 02:30:45,248
Infrared sound in electric

3575
02:30:45,504 --> 02:30:46,016
Magnetic

3576
02:30:46,272 --> 02:30:48,064
Including lasers

3577
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:49,088
Microwave

3578
02:30:49,344 --> 02:30:49,856
Radio

3579
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:51,392
Frequency radiation

3580
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:52,928
For visible light.

3581
02:30:53,184 --> 02:30:53,696
Brainwave

3582
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:58,048
Welcome to the 5G world is not about controlling robot

3583
02:30:58,816 --> 02:31:01,120
That's a side issue it's about controlling Titus

3584
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:04,704
Your conscious in their own

3585
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,032
Ashley

3586
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:10,336
Getting more upset control

3587
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:16,992
So this also isn't from the same text to Jake was talking about and it's not even from that usnewsandworldreport article to jump to

3588
02:31:17,504 --> 02:31:19,808
This is supposed to be a quote from dr. Burrell

3589
02:31:20,064 --> 02:31:22,624
Barbara Rosenberg from 1994 in

3590
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,648
Any bulletin of atomic

3591
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,416
Scientists

3592
02:31:25,184 --> 02:31:29,792
The bulletin of the atomic scientists is pretty cool in that they have a backlog of all their tables

3593
02:31:30,048 --> 02:31:32,096
Contents going back to 1945

3594
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,632
It's really easy to access

3595
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:37,984
Possibly even cooler the group makes these bulletins available on Google Books

3596
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:39,264
So they're pretty easy to find

3597
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:44,896
Wow the article that the quote comes from is titled non-lethal weapons May violate

3598
02:31:45,152 --> 02:31:45,664
Treatise

3599
02:31:46,176 --> 02:31:52,320
Let's just stop and enjoy that this is actually an article that's arguing that developing non-lethal weapons in many ways

3600
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:55,648
Other countries have a violation of international law

3601
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:57,696
Believer

3602
02:31:57,952 --> 02:31:58,976
That's grey

3603
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:02,304
More to the point disco doesn't appear in that text at all

3604
02:32:02,816 --> 02:32:06,400
This is absolutely the consistent attribution given to this quote on

3605
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:08,704
Conspiracy blogs but the article that exist

3606
02:32:08,960 --> 02:32:11,264
In this issue of the bulletin of the atomic scientists

3607
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,032
Says enough

3608
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:12,800
Sing of the sore

3609
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:18,944
This is the only article in the journal that was written by Barbara Hatch Rosenberg in 1994 as the citation is

3610
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:22,784
Constantly given so we can't possibly be wrong about the attributes

3611
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:29,696
Most recent article before this was a 1987 and then after that she came back for an article in 2006

3612
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:31,232
So

3613
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:32,256
Vigorous schedule

3614
02:32:32,768 --> 02:32:38,144
This is the only one that could possibly be being referred to by the conspiracy websites

3615
02:32:38,656 --> 02:32:41,984
There's another article on this issue about non-lethal weapons

3616
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,264
Include this quote either

3617
02:32:43,776 --> 02:32:49,408
I kind of think it might be fabricated or deeply misattributed and I am not really entirely sure which

3618
02:32:49,664 --> 02:32:50,176
It is

3619
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:51,456
Pretty sure Thomas Jefferson

3620
02:32:52,992 --> 02:32:53,504
That's

3621
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,296
The end of the alleged quote is quote

3622
02:32:55,552 --> 02:33:00,928
The current surge of interest in electromagnetic and similar Technologies makes the adoption of a protocol explicit

3623
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:03,488
The outlawing the use of these dehumanizing weapons

3624
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:04,512
Urgent matter

3625
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:06,304
Nikes

3626
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:08,352
What appears to be the position

3627
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:09,376
Dr. Rosenberg

3628
02:33:09,632 --> 02:33:12,192
And the journal itself generally

3629
02:33:12,704 --> 02:33:13,216
I don't

3630
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:15,520
Text of the quote

3631
02:33:16,032 --> 02:33:17,056
He's referring to concert

3632
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:18,336
Conspiracy blogs

3633
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:20,640
It definitely doesn't come from the source

3634
02:33:20,896 --> 02:33:22,432
Set the blog save it a comes

3635
02:33:22,688 --> 02:33:23,200
From

3636
02:33:23,456 --> 02:33:24,480
I'm not entirely sure but

3637
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:26,784
He doesn't use actual

3638
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:27,552
Does

3639
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:29,088
Fairly accurately

3640
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:35,488
Depict what dr. rosenberg's is worth but that's also talking about advocating for international laws against these

3641
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:39,072
Which would take away us offer until you know it should be opposed to that

3642
02:33:39,584 --> 02:33:40,864
Some kind of a complicated beat

3643
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:45,984
All I do know for sure is that Jake is trying to pass this off as part of the document they're covering went

3644
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:49,312
Together completely unrelated and out of context

3645
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:51,104
And sometimes possibly apply

3646
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:51,872
Apocryphal quotes

3647
02:33:53,152 --> 02:33:55,712
Really bad work yeah that's very frustrating

3648
02:33:55,968 --> 02:33:56,992
It didn't give me a lot of Hope

3649
02:33:57,248 --> 02:34:01,344
Ford reset Wars wars pretty quickly

3650
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:02,368
So Alex

3651
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:06,720
So what's talked about to have God made us we have free will but he also yellow

3652
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:12,096
Spell yourself on your body

3653
02:34:12,352 --> 02:34:13,376
You on yourself

3654
02:34:13,632 --> 02:34:15,936
Jeffrey will mind control yourself

3655
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:22,592
Somebody else

3656
02:34:22,848 --> 02:34:27,456
More money from a different Revenue stream

3657
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:28,736
I'll steal it

3658
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:35,904
I don't know about you but I feel like having someone yell at me that I'm free to mind control myself sounds a lot

3659
02:34:36,160 --> 02:34:38,720
I like a guy trying to intimidate me into taking part in his mind

3660
02:34:38,976 --> 02:34:39,488
Control game

3661
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:42,304
I wonder if Alex intentionally didn't tell the audience

3662
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:43,840
But Jake's main profession is being happened

3663
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:45,632
Just because that would be really suspicious

3664
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:48,192
Think I might be a possible choice

3665
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:49,984
So this is where thing

3666
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:50,752
Get ugly

3667
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:55,616
But really ugly because they don't really argue but you can tell you can feel

3668
02:34:55,872 --> 02:34:56,896
You can feel something

3669
02:34:57,408 --> 02:34:59,200
Palpable to Jake is trying to Barrel in

3670
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:00,992
Yet another plug

3671
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:03,552
Listen to how Alex Cuts him off this is amazing

3672
02:35:07,648 --> 02:35:08,160
Consciousness

3673
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:13,280
We are creating your own enslaving by saying we're screwed we can't do it as controlling us

3674
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:17,888
Audrey don't just give

3675
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:19,680
The power

3676
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:21,216
Open a browser.

3677
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:27,872
Surviving the thriving dermis

3678
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:30,432
Have you ever heard Alex

3679
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:31,968
Interrupt a plug

3680
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:33,248
I've never

3681
02:35:33,504 --> 02:35:36,832
That sounded browser

3682
02:35:37,344 --> 02:35:41,184
Listen up listen up you just go up there and you click open a new tab

3683
02:35:41,440 --> 02:35:43,488
Jesus you're just click open that tab

3684
02:35:43,744 --> 02:35:44,256
Jesus

3685
02:35:44,512 --> 02:35:46,816
That's all by shut up

3686
02:35:47,584 --> 02:35:48,864
That might be a first

3687
02:35:49,376 --> 02:35:50,656
Oh man and when it says

3688
02:35:50,912 --> 02:35:52,960
When it says close all tabs to the

3689
02:35:53,216 --> 02:35:56,288
The devil you do not address ask again

3690
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:59,616
No sir you close all those tabs one of the

3691
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:01,152
Primary rules of Griffin

3692
02:36:01,408 --> 02:36:01,920
Thing is

3693
02:36:02,176 --> 02:36:02,688
Don't interrupt

3694
02:36:02,944 --> 02:36:06,272
The plug to plug

3695
02:36:06,528 --> 02:36:11,392
Apparently he's being so excessive with these plugs but I always have to break that rule

3696
02:36:11,904 --> 02:36:13,184
That's amazing

3697
02:36:14,976 --> 02:36:15,488
The documents

3698
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:16,512
You know

3699
02:36:22,400 --> 02:36:24,192
We have so many of them I mean it's

3700
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:24,960
Takis

3701
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:27,520
15 hours

3702
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:28,288
Crazy is there a

3703
02:36:29,824 --> 02:36:31,872
Metaphysically

3704
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:33,920
Doing all this everybody

3705
02:36:37,760 --> 02:36:39,296
There's something weird with

3706
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:41,088
Black magic

3707
02:36:41,344 --> 02:36:42,368
Okay I got

3708
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:48,000
So stupid why do you think what do you think that all of these global

3709
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:50,048
Conspiracy theorist that I've

3710
02:36:50,304 --> 02:36:53,376
I'm talking about right now.

3711
02:36:53,632 --> 02:36:56,448
Working literally for the devil until on it's over

3712
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:57,472
Why do you think they wanted

3713
02:36:59,008 --> 02:36:59,520
5 minutes

3714
02:36:59,776 --> 02:37:00,288
Dumb

3715
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:02,080
Pointless conversation put

3716
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:02,848
I think there's

3717
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:04,896
Black magical

3718
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:07,200
About the idea that Alex is complaining

3719
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:11,040
They haven't gotten to the documents and then instead of getting into documents he talks

3720
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:13,600
Documents that they haven't gotten it do our

3721
02:37:13,856 --> 02:37:14,624
Yeah

3722
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:17,440
Abusive also that it would take a lot longer

3723
02:37:17,696 --> 02:37:18,976
For them to explain those.

3724
02:37:19,232 --> 02:37:25,120
Give it to us certainly if they waste time like this I mean it's almost like they're asking you to be great

3725
02:37:25,376 --> 02:37:26,912
Grateful to them for not getting into the

3726
02:37:27,424 --> 02:37:29,216
I've already lost

3727
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:33,312
Nothing much more entertaining show so dumb

3728
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:35,872
So we have one last clip hung Cayenne

3729
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:36,896
It's Jake

3730
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:39,200
Doing another one of these

3731
02:37:40,224 --> 02:37:41,248
Manipulative tricks

3732
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,296
In order to sell reset Wars

3733
02:37:43,552 --> 02:37:47,648
Open a new private window to the Lord this is incredibly abuse

3734
02:37:48,416 --> 02:37:49,440
And that's why it feels

3735
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:52,512
Watching this right now

3736
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:56,864
You feel angry you feel afraid

3737
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,912
You feel doubtful that we're going to win

3738
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:04,800
Remember who you are

3739
02:38:05,312 --> 02:38:07,616
Is literally a rental car for your soul

3740
02:38:08,128 --> 02:38:11,456
Energy never created or destroyed and when all of us start to wake up

3741
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:13,248
Can you go to reset

3742
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:16,320
Cam right now

3743
02:38:16,576 --> 02:38:18,112
Restart being renewed

3744
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:19,648
The transforming nevermind

3745
02:38:19,904 --> 02:38:21,952
We will realize we create reality

3746
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:23,488
Do not control us

3747
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:24,768
They cannot win

3748
02:38:25,024 --> 02:38:25,536
That's

3749
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:26,304
Just

3750
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:27,328
Disgusting

3751
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:28,096
Wow

3752
02:38:28,608 --> 02:38:30,912
If you out there feel like you're missing something

3753
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:33,728
You know what you're really missing is entering my revenues

3754
02:38:34,496 --> 02:38:40,384
This commercial should be on at 4 a.m. this is when we should be listening to this

3755
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:42,688
In 2015

3756
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:44,480
I think dr. group

3757
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:46,272
Would come in for like infomercial

3758
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:49,856
And like it would just be an hour of them talking about his product

3759
02:38:50,112 --> 02:38:50,624
Yep

3760
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,928
It's not nearly as disgusting as

3761
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:54,976
He's really f***** up this is

3762
02:38:55,232 --> 02:38:56,256
Beyond over-the-top

3763
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:57,024
It's

3764
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:58,560
Counter to Alex

3765
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:00,608
His career

3766
02:39:01,888 --> 02:39:02,400
I just I'm I'm

3767
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:03,680
I'm blown away by this

3768
02:39:05,472 --> 02:39:09,312
This is a longer episode of the reasons because I think that this is

3769
02:39:10,336 --> 02:39:12,384
It could represent a turning point like

3770
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,664
I really could

3771
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:15,456
I don't think I

3772
02:39:15,712 --> 02:39:16,736
That way much

3773
02:39:17,504 --> 02:39:18,272
Over the course of

3774
02:39:18,528 --> 02:39:21,344
The time of us doing the show but like this is a sea change

3775
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:22,880
Weird sincere

3776
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:24,672
Yeah

3777
02:39:24,928 --> 02:39:26,720
Not then this is a really

3778
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:27,488
Weird

3779
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:28,768
Scrabble

3780
02:39:30,048 --> 02:39:32,608
He's willing to engage in this kind of b*******

3781
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:34,912
But I'm I'm

3782
02:39:36,448 --> 02:39:37,472
You know I'm fascinated

3783
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:39,520
To see what they end up producing

3784
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:40,544
But I also

3785
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,592
Haven't watch this

3786
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:44,128
I am really

3787
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:44,896
On

3788
02:39:46,944 --> 02:39:47,712
Sure I guess

3789
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:52,576
Confident in their ability

3790
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:54,368
Blowhard self-help

3791
02:39:54,624 --> 02:39:56,672
Stuff probably hot and then miss

3792
02:39:56,928 --> 02:39:57,440
Quoting

3793
02:39:57,696 --> 02:39:59,232
Thanks but probably what most of it

3794
02:39:59,488 --> 02:40:00,000
Going to be

3795
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:01,792
I don't know

3796
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:03,328
Iru I'm still excited

3797
02:40:03,584 --> 02:40:04,864
To do it cuz I want to

3798
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:05,632
You know

3799
02:40:05,888 --> 02:40:06,656
Critic critic

3800
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:08,448
Hypocritical of you to Alex's

3801
02:40:08,704 --> 02:40:09,216
Life's work

3802
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:11,264
I know it's not

3803
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:12,032
It's not better

3804
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:14,592
Well I mean

3805
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:15,616
Okay

3806
02:40:15,872 --> 02:40:18,176
So at least one doctor group was scamming

3807
02:40:18,688 --> 02:40:19,712
He exchanged

3808
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:23,296
This guy is exchanging the belief

3809
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:24,064
Of goods

3810
02:40:24,320 --> 02:40:25,856
Sprite and that's rude

3811
02:40:26,112 --> 02:40:27,648
Yeah that's rude I know.

3812
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:30,720
It doesn't do s*** but at least they're s*** there

3813
02:40:30,976 --> 02:40:33,280
You know

3814
02:40:33,792 --> 02:40:35,328
Good

3815
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:36,352
I know you're selling

3816
02:40:36,608 --> 02:40:38,656
Like a B vitamin or whatever

3817
02:40:39,168 --> 02:40:40,704
It's fine

3818
02:40:41,984 --> 02:40:44,544
Police that your bank account is magical might kill you

3819
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:48,896
It certainly could lead you to negative actions

3820
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:50,944
It could lead you to believe

3821
02:40:52,224 --> 02:40:53,248
Things that

3822
02:40:54,272 --> 02:40:56,576
Could leave your bank account looking a bit worse

3823
02:40:56,832 --> 02:41:00,672
If You observe it I'll look at it look at it

3824
02:41:01,696 --> 02:41:03,488
Yeah and then and then just emerge

3825
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:04,512
Urging of

3826
02:41:05,024 --> 02:41:06,304
Ideas about like

3827
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:10,144
Uno depersonalization of yourself

3828
02:41:10,400 --> 02:41:11,168
Impossible

3829
02:41:11,936 --> 02:41:17,056
Merging that with Alex's Louvre and the ideas that he expresses on a regular basis

3830
02:41:17,312 --> 02:41:19,360
Better so intensely violin

3831
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:20,384
And full of wrecks

3832
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:21,152
Tribution

3833
02:41:22,688 --> 02:41:23,456
Target

3834
02:41:23,712 --> 02:41:24,480
At the enemy

3835
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:26,016
And all this

3836
02:41:26,272 --> 02:41:26,784
I just think it's

3837
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:27,808
Powder Keg that

3838
02:41:28,320 --> 02:41:30,368
I don't know if they realize the kind of

3839
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,160
The fire that is being played

3840
02:41:33,440 --> 02:41:37,024
I mean when you're saying the enemy is killing you

3841
02:41:37,280 --> 02:41:39,584
You know who they are I'm not telling you to take any violet

3842
02:41:40,352 --> 02:41:40,864
It combines with

3843
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:42,656
Death isn't real

3844
02:41:42,912 --> 02:41:44,960
You're Invincible if you choose to be

3845
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:49,312
And only if you are manifesting negative emotion

3846
02:41:49,568 --> 02:41:50,080
Can you fail

3847
02:41:51,872 --> 02:41:55,200
Unlife is real

3848
02:41:55,456 --> 02:41:57,760
That's not good

3849
02:41:58,016 --> 02:42:00,576
I hope this is a small blip

3850
02:42:00,832 --> 02:42:02,880
And maybe like a little side project that Alex's get

3851
02:42:03,136 --> 02:42:03,648
Getting paid for

3852
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:05,184
But I don't think it is

3853
02:42:05,440 --> 02:42:06,720
For one thing

3854
02:42:07,488 --> 02:42:08,512
One of the things they bring up

3855
02:42:08,768 --> 02:42:09,792
In the conversation

3856
02:42:10,304 --> 02:42:13,632
Is that they had talked originally about doing something about

3857
02:42:14,656 --> 02:42:15,936
And like Financial scam

3858
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:18,240
Yeah and financial Market

3859
02:42:18,752 --> 02:42:22,848
I'm so like they had originally thought about doing that but then they decided to do this

3860
02:42:23,104 --> 02:42:23,616
Series

3861
02:42:23,872 --> 02:42:27,200
And there was an implication that they're going to do more series is

3862
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:30,272
So I don't know if they will

3863
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:31,040
Cuz I

3864
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:32,576
Don't know

3865
02:42:33,344 --> 02:42:36,160
How much does going to set the world on fire

3866
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:37,184
B

3867
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:40,000
I think the intention is to possibly do more

3868
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:41,024
Work like

3869
02:42:41,536 --> 02:42:42,048
Like the

3870
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:42,816
Recent Wars

3871
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:44,864
For under the

3872
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:47,168
Category or the heading of retard

3873
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:49,472
I have these series isn't like this one's about you

3874
02:42:49,728 --> 02:42:51,520
Your soul or whatever

3875
02:42:53,568 --> 02:42:55,872
I mean I think there'll be a certain point where I'll just

3876
02:42:56,128 --> 02:42:56,640
Let Alex

3877
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:57,664
Go do his thing

3878
02:42:58,176 --> 02:43:00,992
Feel like if he starts becoming like a spiritual self-help

3879
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:03,040
Preacher

3880
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,856
That's not us man

3881
02:43:09,184 --> 02:43:12,512
If you want that s*** let's see okay well we could do the B

3882
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:14,816
Scam and get people to buy

3883
02:43:15,584 --> 02:43:17,888
Or we could do the fake God scam and get

3884
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:18,912
People to buy nothing

3885
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:20,960
Actually think that it was

3886
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:21,728
Against

3887
02:43:22,752 --> 02:43:24,800
Oh I think their position would be opposed

3888
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:25,568
Sure

3889
02:43:25,824 --> 02:43:31,968
Well somehow they would be wrong about that too or something yet they'll be right about the point but wrong about the reasons why

3890
02:43:32,224 --> 02:43:33,248
Exactly pretty

3891
02:43:34,784 --> 02:43:36,832
It's been long enough

3892
02:43:38,624 --> 02:43:40,160
Terrified of the prospect of what's

3893
02:43:40,416 --> 02:43:41,440
Succumbed

3894
02:43:42,464 --> 02:43:44,000
Excited when Alex is pretend

3895
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:45,792
Deprived

3896
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:47,584
Pretense of actual document

3897
02:43:48,864 --> 02:43:50,656
Leave this

3898
02:43:51,168 --> 02:43:51,680
Cold

3899
02:43:52,192 --> 02:43:53,984
I found very little of substance

3900
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:56,032
But it was still fun to read a bunch

3901
02:43:57,056 --> 02:43:59,616
Maybe they'll talk about those.

3902
02:44:00,896 --> 02:44:03,200
Fingers crossed we'll see if Reese Awards even really

3903
02:44:03,456 --> 02:44:04,992
Places that take a second

3904
02:44:05,760 --> 02:44:07,552
Those documents aren't even real

3905
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:10,624
Nothing's real

3906
02:44:11,648 --> 02:44:17,792
That's where the episode should have just cut off

3907
02:44:18,048 --> 02:44:20,608
Tell them it isn't real

3908
02:44:20,864 --> 02:44:26,496
Yeah we have death isn't real in life is a simulation. Camuy also or on a Unreal

3909
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:29,056
Website call Twitter

3910
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:30,336
So

3911
02:44:30,592 --> 02:44:36,736
Watch out for the Devil is worried about the fact that he got kicked off Twitter

3912
02:44:36,992 --> 02:44:40,320
What are we doing

3913
02:44:40,576 --> 02:44:41,856
Score cantero rundus

3914
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:44,928
Which are real

3915
02:44:45,696 --> 02:44:47,488
Holding

3916
02:44:49,792 --> 02:44:50,560
Alex

3917
02:44:50,816 --> 02:44:51,584
Birthstone colors
