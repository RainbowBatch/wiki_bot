1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,336
We are

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,640
There is a twist

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,664
One big one

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,712
Yes how long are we going to do this

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,040
Never again

7
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:29,440
Enjoy this while it lasts will never do that again

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,000
I do a lot about Alex

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:35,840
Today we're going to be doing

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
Episode

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
2015

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Before we get to

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
You tell us what we have for a beverage

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,056
Farmers aloe vera artist

15
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,080
Strawberry

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:46,848
Flavored drink

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,384
I don't want to put

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,224
Too fine a point on this but I smelled it before we started the broadcast and I

19
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
Kind of

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
Smelled a little bit like stomach acid

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,600
This is going to be

22
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Ingredients list

23
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Water

24
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,720
Next ingredient.

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,840
I regret aloe vera gel I'm done

26
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:08,864
Is not a liquid

27
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,448
This is another coconut juice situation

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
There is there are things in there my brother

29
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
Difficult

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,968
You brought us back to me

31
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
Terrible place

32
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,344
Swear in liquid

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Your day and that means

34
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,696
And it's your fault it is

35
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
Jordan I love you

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
I'd like to give a shout out to a couple of thank you for

37
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,896
We appreciate it

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,856
Try Farmers aloe vera as a

39
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,696
Action cases

40
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,256
And you need to bring some aloe vera

41
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,840
Also would like to give a shout out to other new donator what's up

42
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,056
John

43
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,336
Do you support the show button

44
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
The show with an out-of-context drop

45
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
From Alex Jones

46
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,832
Sometimes we don't do a good enough job

47
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
Doing these out-of-context drop

48
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:45,376
Desirable

49
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,264
Fired understood the last opening last time

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Sometimes

51
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,312
I do not

52
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,360
Find something that's great

53
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
In terms of an out-of-context drop from

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Sometimes there aren't

55
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Best route to make up for it I have to hear is the first one

56
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
Very

57
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,704
Very uninterested in prayer

58
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
These also why are you in

59
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:32,480
Of course not and you should never lie

60
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Let anybody know

61
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
Yeah it's pies bulshit

62
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:43,744
To do this is why we got it and just because he's religious humblebrag

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,816
About like I don't pray everyday

64
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,120
Also free

65
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
Screams on-air 4 hours a day about how like

66
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,032
You got to get with Jesus

67
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
Hey let me tell you

68
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Do you know what is

69
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,128
Rachel Perez

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
The app that the SharePoint stay for our prayer

71
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
God

72
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:05,760
And

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
Whatever God that is

74
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:14,464
I hope that unspecified God appreciate

75
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,303
So here's the other out-of-context drive from Alex Jones

76
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,863
As

77
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Can get

78
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:27,519
Take a royal flush of Ameraucana chicken

79
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:33,919
Is it was American royalty wow

80
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,943
Sickening

81
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
Sickening Americana

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,343
Vestigial twins

83
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
Is a second

84
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:48,255
Admission that American history is

85
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,279
F****** horrify

86
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Or just like

87
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,375
Cloth type live

88
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
But be there

89
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,679
I would like to keep

90
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,727
Both of those out-of-context drops

91
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,775
In your mind as we go along

92
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,847
Pray everyday but

93
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Try to make them feel good

94
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
Not as good as calling the popo devil worshiper of course

95
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,455
McLaren

96
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
Then he is American royalty and both sides

97
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
Eva's family

98
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,623
Are straight

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Flush royal flush

100
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
Americana

101
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
Did he go to Aunt

102
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Or how do we know this

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
I think it's Dia dentist father probably just told him

104
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
Some b*******

105
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,679
The 6 smartest boy in Texas

106
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,959
This grows up to be a

107
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
CIA dentist

108
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Gives birth to the world's most

109
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,895
Bulshit rap artist Brown

110
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,479
Bizarre to be real

111
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Somehow it's wonderful

112
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,295
I accepted it

113
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,671
Today we're going to be doing over the period of September 29th

114
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
To October 2nd

115
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
2015

116
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Have you noticed

117
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
Is an investigation in order to

118
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,863
Better understand why the f***

119
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,655
Did Alex Jones sign up with

120
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,679
With Donald Trump

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
It's unclear question 1

122
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
How are we on the third quarter

123
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
The fiscal year starts on October 1st

124
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,831
Who knows

125
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,599
Who knows

126
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,743
Clear you're asking that because if you haven't listened to all the episodes

127
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
Alex Jones through a 28-hour live broadcast

128
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
Turn order to make

129
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:31,679
$1000000 in the money bomb the money bomb

130
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Before the end of the fiscal year

131
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
Odd

132
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,591
He doesn't support Trump yet

133
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,383
He's been going back and forth

134
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,503
For the better part of three months now with the I like it I like what you saying but I don't trust him

135
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,783
Kind of stuff

136
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,159
Rodger Stone has not yet arrived we worked out the timeline a little better

137
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,511
New Trump campaign after the first

138
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Debate

139
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
Because

140
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:03,167
Trump got into that war of words of Megyn Kelly

141
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,703
And there was a lot of backlash

142
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
Things are getting distracted

143
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,751
From the corporate

144
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Principles of

145
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
Campaign

146
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
What which is what I don't

147
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,759
What were the core principles inline filter supposed

148
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
Rodger Stone left the campaign

149
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,159
I told you this earlier

150
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
I want to be

151
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,975
Really clear that this

152
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:27,743
Bizarre

153
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
I don't know

154
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
Rodger Stone left the campaign

155
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
The second week

156
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,703
Beginning of the second week of August

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Yes Brown August 8th

158
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,567
August 10th or so

159
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
First debate

160
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
Alex Jones within a week of that

161
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Does his pivot

162
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
On Donald Trump

163
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,503
I'm not saying

164
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
Not on

165
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,135
Before that point been talking about how Donald Trump

166
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,695
Was

167
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
He wasn't really rich

168
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Who was the frontman for

169
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
Consortium

170
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,583
Ghostwrite then he goes to Europe on vacation

171
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,887
He comes back after the first debate

172
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,447
And within a couple days of being back in America

173
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,215
He says

174
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,519
I'm going to give Trump a chance

175
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,055
I'm not saying I'm supporting him

176
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt

177
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
And it was all

178
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,223
If you recall predicated on the idea that he said something negative about Hillary

179
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Which of course you did already.

180
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Right

181
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,623
It seemed superficial and probably means something Rodger Stone left

182
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,719
And then immediately almost immediately

183
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,791
Could mean something that isn't we don't have

184
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,887
If we don't proof know we do have some

185
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Suspicious

186
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
It's an interesting piece

187
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
The puzzle

188
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
Never made that clear on the

189
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Michelle

190
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,407
To do that I'll bet now here we are I mean that was in August now we're at the end of September

191
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
And still he hasn't committed

192
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
To drop although you have had diamond and silk

193
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343

00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,119
We're not going to learn anything about his position on Donald Trump today

199
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,423
Of course he doesn't do anything

00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959

00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Nothing

220
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Here's here's

221
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759

00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:11,071
I have been scanning over the editorial piece

227
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,167
Out of New York

228
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471

229
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031

00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,431
Claiming Obama's Obama's

Russia is on the verge of economic collapse

233
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:43,071
Kind of horses

234
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Russia is fighting

235
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
Forest life

236
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,519
Continue to put out to the West

237
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,943
Baikal

00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
He is refusing

240
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
Mega Buneary

241
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
You know why

242
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
Sweetie cake perfect

243
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,727
Grayson and Ascension

244
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
Murder turtle

245
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Buster's

246
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,343
Maricon

247
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
I mean yes Russia is good old-fashioned Mafia

248
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,583
Style government

249
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
You know what you got to give it to

250
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:55,519
Chicago when the mafia ran things right

251
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,383
People got hurt

252
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,455
Yeah

253
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:06,271
If you want

254
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,063
Astoundingly pro-russia

255
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Really crazy

256
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Discuss

257
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Any of the options exist

258
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,999
He's not discussing any of the reason

259
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,535
I got thrown out of the G8

260
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,679
Who got thrown out right the why is not important

261
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,959
And you see how

262
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
You conveniently get surrounded

263
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
To deal with any of those issues

264
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,591
By over demonizing the Imagine

265
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:36,991
That's literally the most

266
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,063
And by comparison

267
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
That's what you would want to do if you were trying to defend

268
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Terrible person

269
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,487
You would make the alternative even worse yet

270
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
The best Hitler had a few bad idea

271
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
Wasn't as bad as the literal death

272
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,871
Globalist behind World War

273
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,711
I bet Hillary was a bad guy bad guy

274
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:13,087
Setup looked Germany was no Paragon of

275
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,695
Anything like that

276
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
Autocorrect

277
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:28,191
I find that clip very

278
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:28,959
Troubling

279
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Weird it's not good

280
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,567
Real quick

281
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,103
It's very

282
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,199
Sing to me the way he will eventually

283
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Wendy's getting going to

284
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
Defending

285
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
Like you said your trucks. Perfect

286
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
But

287
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Same sort of

288
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,719
Rationalization that he does

289
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:56,095
Historical revisionism about Hitler revisionism about Putin

290
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,631
In order to defend

291
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,959
This is not good whatever it is

292
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Like

293
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Even if it's

294
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
The worst thing in the world

295
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,103
He will

296
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
Edibles

297
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,711
Right

298
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,527
And then make up a reason that the globalist there were

299
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Absolutely

300
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
Basically

301
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,463
Stuck in my craw a little bit but not as much

302
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
As this

303
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
6 clip

304
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,839
Series of two clips

305
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
First one

306
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
The shot

307
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
Second one

308
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Chaser baby

309
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,847
No

310
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,639
Al-Qaeda in Syria

311
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:45,503
Syria bombing Syria

312
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,575
This whole stretch

313
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
There's going to be a lot about

314
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
Putin being a genius a good guy in

315
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:59,071
Propping up

316
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
Is gassing and murdering his own people

317
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,423
That guy

318
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,775
The people according to Alex Russian propaganda

319
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:12,895
Crazy imagine

320
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,455
Is not shared by the rest of the world

321
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:21,087
Interesting or anything like that

322
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:27,231
I don't know what was going on with

323
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
The Drudge Report

324
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
In 2050

325
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,583
But I do know that some of these narratives have been

326
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Repackaged in present day

327
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,423
Breitbart have been on

328
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,191
The same

329
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
Yeah well I'm just saying that

330
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,615
I cuz I remember a bunch of people going on

331
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Talk shows

332
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,663
The time cuz the

333
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,943
The party line was

334
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:50,783
Look at how much smarter look at how much stronger Putin is that Obama

335
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,063
Because

336
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:56,927
They had to attack about something

337
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
It wasn't like full-on supportive Putin it was just like

338
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Wish we had a strong

339
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,351
Dictator like home

340
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Clips about

341
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,959
That whole issue that will get to eventually

342
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:14,591
Lambs on that Spectrum, or actually supporting

343
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
I will see you first

344
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
Here's a shot

345
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
And I will get to the chase

346
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,503
All right folks engaging in concealed

347
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Carrie

348
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:31,487
Cashman

349
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
And it's just as important of a civil rights is Rosa Parks

350
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,687
Texas

351
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
Justice Seminole

352
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Yeah man

353
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,623
How do you like that

354
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,391
Just like

355
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
Take me home.

356
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
So is

357
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,583
Carrying a gun into a public place around with gun

358
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,983
And that's exactly the same as people standing up for the Dignity of a race

359
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
Survival

360
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
And so on and so forth

361
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
Not being a fire hose

362
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
Austin Publix

363
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Positive

364
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,271
But that's what I like

365
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:30,111
The thing that boggled my mind was right before that when he's like

366
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:36,511
Concealed carry people have been protecting Society courses entire time

367
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Dumb dumb

368
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,351
Cuz everytime

369
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,191
Every time you're walking around in public the only reason

370
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,727
Constantly getting shot

371
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:51,103
Is because the people who are afraid that someone else in your surrounding

372
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Probably has a gun

373
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,687
That keeps the bad guys at Bay

374
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,991
The concealed carry people are protecting

375
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
Society

376
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
Quibe threat that anyone could have a gun

377
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,879
You know what that make

378
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Yeah totally

379
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,511
Bat signal

380
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,839
Even if you don't know you know you don't know if the Batman is coming

381
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
For you you may be trying to

382
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,215
I like

383
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
Ocean

384
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
Totally

385
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:27,455
That's a perfect about we live in

386
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:33,087
I would love if Aaron the Batman Universe

387
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:42,559
I don't know something about I think it's a bad idea and we're going to find out we're going to go

388
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,375
Go through an investigation of Bruce Wayne's childhood

389
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
6 hour episode 13

390
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,847
So the other thing I'd like to say is

391
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:57,663
I don't believe that evidence

392
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
Suggest that we have a history of

393
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,831
Abusing people who have guns

394
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
In this country

395
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
I further don't believe that you're born with a gun

396
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
I don't think

397
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
That

398
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:18,655
You don't get what I'm saying the difference between civil rights is something you're born with that you know being a part of a group you don't have a choice

399
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,959
About with Alex

400
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:24,543
You like guns a lot made me with a

401
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Whether it would be in my

402
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,103
My hand

403
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
4 in my

404
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Do you remember that

405
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:31,711
Parable

406
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
From G's

407
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
I'm rolling out to talk about

408
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,855
Jesus

409
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,135
Goes out to the desert

410
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
For 40 days and 40 nights

411
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,511
He's tempted by the devil but only on night one

412
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:45,535
Cuz he get his kneecap

413
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,327
Kaplana

414
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,191
That's just Kotori right take him out

415
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,775
Bought it from a survivalist

416
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,567
That was the shot

417
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Here's the chaser

418
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Others join Confederacy

419
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Interesting okay well there we go

420
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:20,095
Maybe like some of them or neutral although there is a little bit of that regret

421
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,935
Season

422
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Is it like we have to

423
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
Wrestle with

424
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
Which group of admirers more

425
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,359
Speaks volumes

426
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,383
Gummy okay

427
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Alex

428
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,711
You have a

429
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Family lineage

430
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,087
Present Behavior pattern of someone who believes of the Confederacy

431
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,231
You're like Rosa Parks have a gun

432
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,255
You dick

433
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,303
Whenever the

434
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,071

435
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Say what you want

436
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
I will

437
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:57,215
Seceding from the Union

438
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,031
Is very similar to Rosa Parks go into

439
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
The front of the bus

440
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Sure

441
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Okay

442
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
Rosa Parks

443
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,271
Would have been

444
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
So that doesn't

445
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,367
No

446
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Does the bus have a gun

447
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,000
Betty White

448
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
I like that

449
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
That's racist

450
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
An amazing episode of The Magic

451
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Teach you about gun safety

452
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,264
Miss Frizzle just getting into

453
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Bus shaped like a Glock

454
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,640
This next clip is really funny

455
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
I hope it's funny

456
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
It is Alex Jones

457
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Trying not to get mad

458
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,088
Aerosol

459
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,368
So fake

460
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,648
Funnel boy

461
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,512
Heidi and Spencer there but I do believe that ends with an a

462
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Okay cool

463
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:06,592
Then we don't have to worry about

464
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,920
Control my temper right now because

465
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Yeah

466
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Stupid

467
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Culturally religiously

468
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,232
YouTube

469
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Good save

470
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
What about your tasteless

471
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Trendy frontman

472
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,896
Whatever the new correctness is this month's this week today

473
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:47,552
Before you actually end up getting mad cuz I want to discuss that a tiny bit

474
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:52,160
Correctness generally complains about now

475
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Is every one of the big day

476
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,072
Campaign the people are on

477
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,424
Political correctness is whatever the

478
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,192
Globalist

479
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
They're telling you to

480
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
Except

481
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Now

482
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
And

483
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,288
I think

484
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
He

485
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Is a idiot

486
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:12,384
Because

487
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,920
People have been to

488
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
Discussing trans rights

489
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:15,968
For 50 years

490
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,504
We do have a lot of evidence

491
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
To prove that

492
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,808
Right

493
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Particular case

494
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
This isn't political correct

495
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
This is

496
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:28,000
Something that people have been on the Vanguard of for a really long time

497
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
And now it's starting to

498
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
To make more inroads

499
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
People are starting to realize that the

500
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
Argument

501
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,472
Very valid all the time with the

502
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
People who rail against political

503
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,592
You're not allowed to

504
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Just say something

505
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Right which is which

506
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
Bart of witches

507
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,784
I want you to say the n word

508
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
It's that you should

509
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,744
Sure feel like all of the things that the n-word means

510
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:04,096
That stuff is still in you whether or not you say it

511
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,144
That's true

512
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Correctness isn't too

513
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,216
Monitor your speed

514
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:13,824
But it's to try keep you for being the horrible monster who says those day

515
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,384
To some extent

516
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
Yeah but even beyond that cuz I think that's

517
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
A little highbrow

518
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:22,528
Teddy

519
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,856
I think on another level

520
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,624
I don't want to get

521
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,648
Haiti on this pot

522
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:30,720
Alex wouldn't understand that what I'm saying is

523
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,280
On another level it's really just like

524
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,560
It's not Bandits

525
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,096
Do that

526
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
Like

527
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,936
You know it's bad

528
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,216
Motor less

529
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
It's not some sort of magic

530
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,824
Magical

531
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,664
What you say

532
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,992
Being able to say the n word

533
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,024
Diagram

534
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
That doesn't have

535
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
This word is banned

536
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
Yesterday

537
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Yeah but

538
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
He was saying that his book got banned

539
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,360
Facebook didn't get banned

540
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
Schuster whatever just

541
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,016
We don't want to do is keep advocating

542
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
For pedophiles

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,672
Text you about this

Really Charming on Infowars cuz everyone else has no personality

549
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,168
Nokia's calling Glenn Beck a queer

00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
It was that's not

551
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,472
Better

552
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:48,288
Better about this moment

553
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,360
It was pretty fun I let out a little laugh

554
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
Where do you live in the muck

555
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,248
Yeah yeah

556
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
What is the spectacle

But this one you guys

You guys get this

563
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:25,664
Totally clear that I'm laughing at the absurdity and Novelty

564
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,224
B-day Bash

565
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
We won't be talking about that cuz

566
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,832
Please give those ding dong more

567
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:42,816
It's just total cultural Marxism

568
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:46,144
It's just whatever he say this week

569
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
Shredded

Army manual

574
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,512
Alex is misrepresenting all of the

575
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
These documents you can go find them

576
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,072
Very easily it

577
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,680
Mostly stuff about best practices for before in theaters

578
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
And stuff like that turn large population

579
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,776
It's a very boring

580
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,128
Process you and your family

581
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
Helicopter

582
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:41,440
What Rehabilitation

583
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:47,072
Fake laugh

584
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
Who You Are

585
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:10,368
The noted kindness review

586
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:13,184
Traffic

587
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,720
Frustrates me.

588
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:22,656
That's all

589
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,056
He asked God for helping I now believe

590
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,848
Yes

591
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,920
That's his little prayer

592
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,992
Count of you should be a broadcaster

593
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,040
Quite frankly if you can't control your

594
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,600
I'm not saying that Alex

595
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
Should be off the air

596
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
But he's obviously faking these

597
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
Oh yeah

598
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,304
He can't control his emotions

599
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
Booty's presenting is a mentally unwell person

600
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Really bad

601
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Really complicated

602
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Anyway

603
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
I want to get back on track

604
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
His next clip

605
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,128
Sommore

606
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,504
Hy-Vee is now the main leader of the world

607
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
Tells the truth

608
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,024
Over and over again

609
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Cool world

610
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,680
He's mostly talking about

611
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:33,312
Describe from a code of morality

612
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,384
If that allows for literally any

613
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
At least

614
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,880
Billion dollars

615
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,464
Alex note

616
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,680
Wonder why

617
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
The globalist admittedly

618
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
They are in that stage

619
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:07,360
How's the protocols of the Elders of Zion

620
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,896
That would put

621
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
That level

622
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
Right

623
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
Like Putin

624
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,040
Secutor the protocols of the Elders of Zion

625
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Perfection right

626
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,928
I don't know union break

627
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,768
Populist wave

628
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,840
And then becomes the autocratic

629
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Tater

630
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
Oligarch friends

631
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:34,240
Like getting that done in that the Playbook

632
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,848
Unfortunately

633
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Unfortunately the Jews

634
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,040
I mean as Russian

635
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,928
They didn't pull it

636
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,232
No no no it took a

637
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,328
Immoral

638
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Very moral

639
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
At always

640
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,544
Is mostly referring to their is the Putin to just giving a speech about how we are

641
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,592
Okay then I'll know the

642
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,968
Because it matches Alex's narrative

643
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Which also

644
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:18,016
Conveniently matches Russian

645
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
State television

646
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,976
He's taking his international news alright

647
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,608
Right in that actually leads us to our next

648
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:33,888
Squidward just kind of

649
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,752
Premiered second episode

650
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
We went over with Alex's doing on Y2K which way

651
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:42,848
Was disgraceful

652
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,408
Answer your mongering to

653
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,760
Concentration camps being set up at airports

654
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
Wichita

655
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
From history

656
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,768
Multiple power plant meltdowns

657
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,816
Space command

658
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,376
He had a

659
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,984
We are out.

660
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
Department of Transportation

661
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:18,688
Is out there everywhere

662
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,480
Didn't Street right now

663
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:24,576
It was disgraceful

664
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Listen to the Y2K app

665
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
Episode 8

666
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,464
Call you later Ivar's to the podcast

667
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,328
Has

668
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
Ascended to power

669
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
Big thing

670
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,520
And because right around

671
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:47,104
New Year's Eve

672
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,432
Miguel went out

673
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,224
From

674
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,760
The Prime Minister position

675
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:54,528
2

676
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Yeah but

677
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,696
Wasn't there time.

678
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:08,352
Somebody else

679
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
President

680
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,216
Can force base coat

681
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,240
Losing power

682
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,032
No

683
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:21,408
And the Y2K episode

684
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Discuss

685
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,672
Bomb

686
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
He was the vice president

687
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
Ammo

688
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
Exactly

689
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,808
Moscow police

690
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:02,112
Caught

691
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:02,880
With

692
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,464
A plastic explosive and then they said I was part of a drill

693
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,560
Engaged

694
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
False

695
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Vice president

696
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,216
But there's not total proof of them

697
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,080
But I was told by a lot of other Russian

698
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,784
Define away from chechnya

699
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,864
Vitamin Putin is not trying to force vaccines

700
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,728
Yeah he doesn't live here

701
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,776
How she can be a man

702
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,576
Western beef ribs

703
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:07,904
And one world

704
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:19,936
Collaborative

705
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
Really fascinating there is that

706
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,312
So much less proof

707
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Things that would make

708
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,640
Putin look bad

709
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
Then

710
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
He took

711
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,952
But it's not a hundred percent proof

712
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Wavy level up

713
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
You know what it wasn't Putin

714
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:01,664
I think I would like to know a little bit apartment complexes were bombed

715
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,736
Areas in Russia

716
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,528
Between the fourth and

717
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:09,088
A September in 1999

718
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,136
Coincidentally just a couple of months

719
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
Before Vladimir Putin

720
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Impreza

721
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
It was a big part of the power grab

722
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:16,768
Because it was

723
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:18,048
For the second

724
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
Chechen War

725
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,096
Which was

726
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Putin wrote power on

727
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,960
Interesting

728
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:27,264
There were 293.

729
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,616
Mostly word anybody in the bed

730
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:35,200
Almost 300 people died over a thousand were

731
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Pretty seriously

732
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Or mildly injured

733
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
How long that Spectre

734
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,112
Now the thing that I think is more important

735
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:42,880
Is

736
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Is that multiple people

737
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
Who have come out

738
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,256
That it was

739
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,536
The Russian government

740
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:50,816
And the SSB

741
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Be what the

742
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,424
The Secret Service and Russia at 3:10 to

743
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,216
They've died

744
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Mysteriously

745
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Not all of them

746
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
But enough

747
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,360
What it is

748
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,640
Very curious

749
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,456
Alexander litvinenko

750
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,296
The guy who got poisoned with polonium one of his big things

751
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,344
It was Putin

752
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
Udit batra

753
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,184
I also Boris

754
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,232
Berezovsky

755
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,816
He also died under very mysterious circumstances

756
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,864
There's one other dudes named never be able

757
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Go to pronounce

758
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,168
They all died

759
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
But seriously

760
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
People

761
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,752
You talk about this

762
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
As though there's

763
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
We're in people who challenged him

764
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,432
Or criticize him publicly

765
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Wind-up toy

766
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,760
I need you to provide at least

767
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,808
64 more examples

768
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Three other

769
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Maybe punta.

770
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
Maybe he will take your 63 and I have this one too

771
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,680
Hurricane

772
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,216
There's no way

773
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:07,616
He filed two motions for parliamentary investigation

774
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
In March

775
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:09,920
2000

776
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:15,040
Commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma Deputy Sergey kovalev

777
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,904
The commission was rendered ineffective by the government's refusal to respond to its inquiry

778
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
Two key members of the kovalev commission

779
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,304
Now

780
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,400
I heard the guy whose name I can't pronounce

781
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
The commission's lawyer

782
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,752
Mikhail travoski was arrested in

783
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
2003

784
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,568
Convicted in a closed military Court

785
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,592
And released from prison

786
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
2007

787
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,152
We probably got some good

788
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
So

789
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:47,040
Some of the circumstantial stuff that surrounds

790
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,320
Mysterious deaths

791
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,368
The commission

792
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:53,696
Being completely stonewalled and then multiple people who were involved

793
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
In the commission dying and very mysterious circumstances

794
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Around

795
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,584
It doesn't look good

796
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,608
For Putin net worth

797
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
This is a lot like

798
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:02,912
If

799
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,032
Instead of firing Mueller you just killed all of his staff

800
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:11,616
Right like that these lawyers

801
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Mueller

802
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:18,528
Unfortunately everyone around him is dead including his family

803
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,576
He is doing his best

804
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
But yeah we don't have good hopes

805
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,184
Currently no one knows where he

806
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,976
Yeah I mean it's it's

807
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,256
This is

808
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
Very with

809
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
Derailment

810
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,096
Scope in the pattern of

811
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:32,864
What happened

812
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
Right

813
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,192
In Russia

814
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
You think

815
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Made up and

816
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,920
In Russian

817
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
All the time

818
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Assassination why

819
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,272
Clandestinely

820
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,832
And they try and make it look like it wasn't

821
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:57,952
Well I mean

822
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:58,976
Message

823
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
Sometimes sometimes there is a bullet in the forehead on Putin birthday

824
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Yes but I mean it's really

825
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
Like its soda

826
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:13,824
Intellectually dishonest for Alex to be like

827
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:20,224
You know what I got no conspiracy theory that but

828
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,808
What time is it

829
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,600
Right sometimes you get it wrong

830
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,696
False flag

831
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:35,584
Sometimes you get everything else he's ever said in his entire jury Financial collapse

832
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,680
Gold an ounce

833
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:40,704
Man

834
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,104
Been great if we were listening then it was amazing

835
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:53,504
We could have put our very small amount of money

836
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,064
And made $49,000

837
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,184
Cuz it wasn't like one grand or so for an outside so we could afford one grand

838
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,768
Maybe.

839
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
Anyway

840
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,864
This

841
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
To hear this sort of pro-putin rhetoric

842
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,728
Cuz

843
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,520
Even with his aunt like

844
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,288
He qualify

845
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Vacations

846
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
It's still ReSound Ali pro-putin

847
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,200
Absolutely the only reasonable position to bake

848
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
It look

849
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,784
The prism of History looking at the bombings

850
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
In 1999

851
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,136
Is doobie that was a pretext to go to war in chechnya

852
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,672
So you could have a power grab

853
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Yeah that's

854
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Essentially would happen

855
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
Very much

856
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:38,048
So

857
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
Even

858
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
He even says you know like

859
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,376
Maybe

860
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
You still did it

861
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,192
Just wipes that away

862
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,520
Immediate it wouldn't matter

863
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,800
Cuz he likes

864
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
That's cool

865
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
So after this call

866
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
He gets on the blower

867
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:01,343
For calling

868
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Alex

869
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,695
He sounded so much like you

870
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,511
Translation

871
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:09,791
Nrt

872
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,095
I would have thought you were on the stage

873
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
That's not good

874
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,423
Sop

875
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
Speed it sounds exactly like

876
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
That's not good

877
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:26,431
Also why was he watching

878
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
I don't know

879
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,551
Pride is probably a heavy overlap between his audience of people who

880
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,831
Go run watch Rock

881
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,855
Chlamydia

882
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:36,159
It's the kind of thing the Alex

883
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
Encourages

884
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
All that is true

885
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,023
Americans keep hitches narratives from

886
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,047
Russian media

887
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,631
American Media isn't telling you the truth

888
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,167
Yeah you're listening

889
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:50,495
And you want to look into one of Alex's stories or maybe there

890
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:55,103
You know it's linked on infowars.com you want to go try and find the source

891
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
You go and you end up finding an article and spotting

892
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:00,223
Negreanu dirty or something like that

893
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:04,319
You know Alex is telling you this is the truth everyone else is lying to you

894
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,599
All of a sudden you're going to

895
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:07,391
Associate Russian media with tell him

896
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,415
The truth

897
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,719
Alex

898
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:17,119
It's only more proof that you're onto the real source

899
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,911
This much time shirtless is Alex does

900
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:21,215
Stroop

901
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,519
Hair

902
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,127
Alex maybe wearing a wig maybe wearing a bulk

903
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,199
Any of these things could be.

904
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,527
So he takes another call and shockingly also about food

905
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
You're on a roll

906
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
Hey how's it going

907
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:49,119
Beginning of Putin when he was first running his re-election campaign he's running around his shirt off

908
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Horsebacking

909
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,471
Shooting guns up you know just

910
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:55,775
Completely demands man everybody

911
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
You know

912
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:59,615
I'm a man right

913
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,223
Being in charge and having strong family

914
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,551
Promote an effeminate Obama on purpose

915
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,367
I think it's healthy

916
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:19,327
What I'm getting at is they're doing it on purpose because Obama what does he do

917
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Lillian gay

918
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,191
Person that had infected to everybody good defense department now

919
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,983
Completely masculinity

920
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,591
Military

921
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
Servile

922
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
A knock-kneed weirdos you can imagine

923
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:49,535
What it what is he talking about there what is the plan

924
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,351
Having a gay person be an official position

925
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,399
Damask

926
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,679
D masculine

927
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,663
Gay agenda very least gays are being used

928
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
Agenda

929
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,015
That look pretty

930
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,367
If you want it look if you're going to put anybody in the defense department you wanted

931
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
Distance true

932
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,327
They know what they're doing

933
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,631
Also maybe the other thing I would suggest

934
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,447
It's put somebody who's qualified who can do a good job in there

935
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:29,983
Regardless

936
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:36,383
Whether or not you want qualified people in office

937
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:50,207
Competent

938
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:53,535
So well Tillerson is

939
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,607
He's doing a great job did you notice out there

940
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:00,959
Neither is anybody else

941
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
Kind of like

942
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
Tillerson is one of those dudes

943
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:11,455
He Fades into the background a little bit cuz there's so much swirling b******* that story came out

944
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,735
What about in like

945
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,271
Couple years back Exxon

946
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
With while he was

947

With Russian Bank and Trust Company

949
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,487
Do you realize that he went on his little

950
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,511
Hiatus

951
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,535
Right after

952
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,071
But no one is like

953
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,375
You don't get to take breaks like this

954
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Apartments

955
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447

956
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727

Pennywise

958
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Glad

959
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335

BattleBots

963
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
This before the election actually happen

964
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,463
Absolutely

965
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,791
And now I shall go

966
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,175
Trump didn't want to be president he wanted to win presidency

967
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:22,367
Neither does any of these other people

968
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:26,719
Time and energy

969
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:27,743
Department

970
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,839
All you really want is to siphon money and resources as much as you can

971
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,655
And really every single person that you bringing is a risk

972
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
Love them like soda

973
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,751
Talking you out

974
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,663

Watson

978
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
Really funny moment at the end of the 29th where Alex is like

979
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,927
Tomorrow

980
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,975
He's not mad or anything

981
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:00,255
Paul Joseph Watson

982
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
How's the hotel tomorrow

983
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:05,887
Cuz they will be late

984
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,167
I'm going hunting

985
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,447
We're going on

986
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,751
I haven't taken my kid hunting enough

987
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Lego Hunter

988
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,335
October 1st

989
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,919
Episode

990
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,711
You might like alright

991
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:25,855
29th of September use in a weird mood he's going to go hunting with his kid it's going to f****** watch off him

992
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,927
Everything will be back to normal and gets back

993
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:31,743
People know

994
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:38,655
Betamerica

995
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:42,495
Anime love

996
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:02,975
John of a perfect

997
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,511
But compared

998
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:07,071
Absolute

999
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Phil

1000
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,423
Culture and Society

1001
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,215
Is good

1002
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,239
So

1003
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
All you need to know there is

1004
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
You can just ignore all the negative things

1005
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,919
Things you saying because those are really even negative

1006
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
-2 Alex

1007
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
He's a strong

1008
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,759
Malek's restaurant

1009
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
He's Abu

1010
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,575
A straw

1011
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
What strong man doesn't have

1012
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:38,815
In the world to be strong

1013
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:40,863
You got to make sure that you have killed Italy

1014
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:41,887
One dog

1015
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:45,215
Absolute has killed at least

1016
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
Three dogs

1017
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:52,127
I mean he's there he's

1018
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,151
That's f******

1019
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:58,015
Also he said the program like that was a positive

1020
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,183
He's going to repopulate Russia with a breeding well this is that sort of racist idea about other cultures

1021
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,207
Without breeding us

1022
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:08,767
And that's going to be genocide by

1023
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,815
Buy just population numbers

1024
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:15,679
It's David Duke and his elk talk about all the time about it on Alex's show even

1025
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,495
Talk about how the birthrate among white people

1026
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,335
And Africans and Muslims are outbreeding

1027
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
The white

1028
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:26,687
Man and eventually they're just going to overrun us due to numbers

1029
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:29,759
I would argue on one hand

1030
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,295
Again just projection

1031
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:36,159
Well if we have the numbers that's what we did in the past

1032
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
Because we have it coming

1033
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:43,583
Yeah cuz we did it already

1034
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,167
I guess if you want to use historical precedent that does make sense

1035
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:49,215
Sometime it like

1036
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,543
We're not in feudal times

1037
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,823
Anymore

1038
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
Most people are evolved enough to

1039
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,639
To be like

1040
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,175
I don't care

1041
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:58,943
What race

1042
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
I'm not joining a race

1043
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
This group

1044
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
God you would hope so

1045
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,367
Anyway I believe that

1046
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,951
Is encouraging the family and encouraging White

1047
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,719
Breeding

1048
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:12,767
Great

1049
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:15,327
And that's going to defend

1050
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,935
Never says it but that's what he mean

1051
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
But the other thing is

1052
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,751
He's like saying that

1053
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
Incredulous

1054
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,127
If he said if Alex's breeding program

1055
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,407
What I hear

1056
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
Is

1057
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,735
Putin is creating Russian chimera

1058
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
That's why I was a little bit confused

1059
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:42,207
There's a lady gums

1060
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
Is creating human

1061
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:44,511
Not human

1062
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:48,095
But animal machine chimera

1063
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,399
So we got that

1064
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:53,471
So I wanted to point out in that cliff

1065
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Craigslist

1066
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,079
I do

1067
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,871
Coming back

1068
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:02,175
Used beyond the machine repair

1069
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,759
Alex is incredulous in his voice

1070
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Are you saying

1071
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:08,319
Putin is the leader of the

1072
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,367
Reworld everyone is saying that

1073
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
Americans

1074
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Love poop

1075
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
Jesus great

1076
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,023
You saying that in that sort of like disbelieving voice

1077
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,559
Because

1078
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:21,375
He's reading that from Russian media

1079
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,679
He thinks that's what the world thinks

1080
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
Because

1081
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,471
Russian

1082
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,287
Media is reporting that that is what the world

1083
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,847
Crazy so I'll Jones is

1084
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,383
He's a responding

1085
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
Propaganda

1086
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,431
By making

1087
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:38,783
A second layer of propaganda on top of it

1088
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:39,807
Quite frankly

1089
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,087
Cuz even though Alex

1090
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,135
Being incredulous about what he's reading on

1091
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,951
Hotspot making s***

1092
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
Goes through the top

1093
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,559
Fluoride in my water

1094
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,095
Nonsense

1095
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:52,863
Knock sensor

1096
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:54,911
Sorry

1097
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
Take a point

1098
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,031
Garrett -

1099
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,567
This show also

1100
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Involve

1101
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,383
A very interesting field

1102
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:06,943
October 1st

1103
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
On this episode Joe big

1104
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,551
Is out on the University of Texas

1105
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
Chris Austin

1106
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,391
Because there is an anti-gun protest

1107
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,415
What's going on

1108
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,695
I have

1109
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Good bit oven

1110
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,743
Information about this

1111
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,047
I know exactly what went on

1112
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
Are there was a

1113
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:26,143
Concealed carry on campus

1114
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
If University

1115
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,215
There were a bunch

1116
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,239
Two people

1117
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,287
Students and professors

1118
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,359
They started to Triumph

1119
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,127
This legislation

1120
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,151
I tried to move

1121
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,431
Against it because

1122
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,199
Campus

1123
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:41,759
Pull up guns is not a comfortable place

1124
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:44,575
Wasn't this immediately following

1125
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
What was it North Carolina

1126
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:48,159
Then she

1127
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,743
Robot Shooting Sports Bar investigation

1128
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,071
Call and there's one in Oregon on October 2nd

1129
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:55,839
I believe

1130
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,631
If it's a first

1131
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:00,191
As

1132
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
Sia but beer doesn't Alex

1133
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,519
This position is that

1134
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:06,591
If you take away guns that don't allow guns on

1135
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
Campus they need is a safe

1136
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,431
It's for bad people with guns

1137
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,455
To go

1138
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Target

1139
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
And they can just shoot up people on

1140
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
School campuses

1141
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,879
And my argument to that is

1142
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,415
You should have like

1143
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Cops

1144
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
Show campus

1145
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,487
Was cops were armed

1146
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,767
And stuff like that

1147
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
Cuz that

1148
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Official

1149
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,143
Everybody should have their gun safe

1150
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,311
This one as I said I'm

1151
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:40,383
I've gone from let's be reasonable to

1152
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
Let's take their guns

1153
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
River City fist fights

1154
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
Some college

1155
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,295
No

1156
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
I didn't go outside

1157
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,855
Asbury

1158
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:54,207
They saw a lot of his fights on campus I saw a lot of really heated fights

1159
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,303
I know the testosterone flaring a lot of people are experimenting with drugs

1160
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,583
For the first time in their life

1161
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,143
The idea that people who are 82

1162
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
220 on campus

1163
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:05,983
Does verily

1164
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,775
People who are older students

1165
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,311
Baby veterans

1166
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,079
He's coming back

1167
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:10,847
Something like that

1168
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:12,895
I know the different situation

1169
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:13,919
And those kids that I'm talking

1170
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,967
About

1171
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:19,295
But like those young kids were volatile and growing

1172
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,831
Handful of new experiences

1173
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:24,671
I really don't feel comfortable about the idea of them being armed

1174
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,463
In the off chance

1175
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Heated argument

1176
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
With somebody

1177
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Thing that he

1178
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,495
Is that people walk around

1179
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:39,263
Knowing

1180
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
That there is

1181
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
Concealed carry and so they feel like oh

1182
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,615
We're protect

1183
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
That is the complete opposite it all

1184
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
Campus

1185
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
And you knew there was

1186
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:55,391
Concealed carry laws how do you not kind of have in the back your mind like

1187
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
This person have a gun

1188
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,279
Do they have a gun right now

1189
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:03,071
People down whenever they go into the f******

1190
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,143
Class like

1191
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,191
Situation you put professors and what you have to

1192
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,983
To give bad news to student yeah

1193
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,311
If you fail them or they come to your private office hours

1194
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:16,639
Stuff like that you recommended incredibly uncomfortable position

1195
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
Where anybody could be armed

1196
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:21,247
And you know what people get thrown out of school for grade

1197
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
And stuff like that

1198
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:26,879
No but if you're allowed to have guns on campus

1199
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:28,159
All sorts of like

1200
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,719
Okay so I wrote for my campus paper

1201
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,559
Talk about this on the show

1202
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:36,351
Deathreats what that's not what I want

1203
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
That was another time

1204
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:42,495
One time I made a joke about Rosa

1205
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
About how I

1206
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,591
All the kids that on the back of

1207
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,639
So I don't know what the f*** she was complaining

1208
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,943
Right I was intentionally

1209
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,015
Obviously misrepresenting things for

1210
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:54,783
Communicate

1211
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,087
This guy who was a member of

1212
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:57,855
The student government

1213
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Did not like me

1214
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,951
Because I had written an article about him and his friends

1215
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,719
Hey use

1216
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
Fun

1217
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,023
In order to take it

1218
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
Tripped

1219
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:07,071
To sxsw

1220
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,375
They claimed that they were

1221
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,191
Define could come get booked on Tampa

1222
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,543
I saw his pictures on Facebook they were just drunk

1223
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:20,639
Respect the game

1224
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,943
But at the same time I had this campaign

1225
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
Against

1226
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
The student government

1227
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:29,855
Because I think the student government stupid is there

1228
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,927
Uncovered that and I wrote an article about it

1229
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:35,231
So he decided he was going to try and get me kicked out of school

1230
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,535
I wrote that joke about Rosa Park

1231
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,071
I am

1232
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,607
Based on that

1233
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,631
That joke

1234
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,935
He reported me to the student judicial

1235
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,263
And I had to go have a meeting the guy

1236
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,799
That was formal

1237
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:51,103
I got a confidential letter

1238
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,639
That's great

1239
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
Confidential

1240
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:07,487
You wrote about your my, of course you did

1241
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:13,887
Breed of his letter being confidential so I had to go and meet with the

1242
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,191
But it was just one guy

1243
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,727
In that situation

1244
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,543
I could see that too

1245
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:26,175
Situation being very uncomfortable and I'm just one of a thousand people that that guys had to meet with

1246
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:28,991
Yeah over the years

1247
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:35,391
Two fights or get arrested for something that may have to meet with the school

1248
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:36,159
PowerSchool

1249
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
And that could be f****** heated as s***

1250
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,767
Because if you get kicked out of school and your mind is

1251
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
I was certain

1252
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,327
Bent

1253
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
That could be like someone taking away your life

1254
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:47,679
Well think about the places where guns are in

1255
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
Like

1256
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,495
Like Court

1257
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Right

1258
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,799
Do you know why

1259
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,967
Good people a lot to lose if you're crazy you could do something really stupid

1260
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:06,879
Like that if your argument also also just trust everybody say first

1261
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,671
Just to put a button on it I did not

1262
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
I made a mockery of

1263
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:11,487
The proceedings

1264
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,791
And I've got it wrong

1265
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,583
I know

1266
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Move.

1267
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,103
I think there is

1268
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,151
Very good reason for

1269
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,687
Especially public

1270
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,223
Universities

1271
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,759
Do not allow

1272
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Concealed carry

1273
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,135
I think the arguments that we've made or not even

1274
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:39,903
Let's go to

1275
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
People who are inactive

1276
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,207
World

1277
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,023
Would make

1278
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,303
Rather have open

1279
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
Open carry Lincoln

1280
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,631
Cuz then at least you know what f***

1281
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:50,399
Castle Heights

1282
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:56,799
Well then we turn into the Deep Space 9 mm

1283
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,079
Biggs and Alex Jones

1284
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,431
Call

1285
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:06,783
About 10 people on the stage

1286
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,951
Call vortex

1287
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
Federal screaming gun-free UT gun-free UT

1288
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
So

1289
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,423
They're showing video of a sparsely attended protest

1290
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:26,751
Bloomberg

1291
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,591
I actually have weight

1292
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:32,127
UT Austin

1293
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,967
UT idiot crowd

1294
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,783
But the speakers were flown in

1295
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:43,391
That's really interesting and I can actually tell you that

1296
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,719
Because my dad is super involved

1297
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,487
Noggin for you

1298
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,559
Yeah

1299
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
The part of the organ

1300
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,119
Innovation

1301
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:54,911
I actually texted Amazon

1302
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,471
Anybody from Bloomberg

1303
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,591
Welcome letter

1304
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,431
So firmly believe

1305
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:08,735
As I do too

1306
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
The new place on college campuses

1307
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Professional

1308
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
Let's

1309
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,903
About

1310
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:17,695
Cops are okay to have gone

1311
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:18,975
Wherever they are because that's

1312
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:19,743
Part of their job

1313
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,863
But my dad is part of that he is involved the organization he assures me that no one

1314
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,655
Flown out by Bloomberg

1315
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
At all

1316
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,007
And tell my dad if you want to talk about him being a ship go ahead

1317
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,335
Throughout his life you've had a very consistent

1318
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,615
Protest streak

1319
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,663
He has been very

1320
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:38,687
Left

1321
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:40,479
Dry wind causes Wednesday

1322
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
Back when we lived in Missouri

1323
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,087
Every single Wednesday

1324
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
When they were busy

1325
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:47,903
My parents would go out in protest

1326
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
On the busiest corner

1327
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
Columbia

1328
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
With about 8

1329
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,559
People 8 to 10 people standing around with herpes

1330
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,095
No war in Iraq

1331
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,887
Next time every f****** one

1332
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:01,983
They do that they are committed to goals

1333
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Committed

1334
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,287
Causes high principal

1335
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,311
And standby

1336
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
He is a good example

1337
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,919
Of the people who are involved in gun-free

1338
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,247
These are not Soros Bloomberg shills

1339
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,319
These are UT professors for deeply

1340
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,391
Concerned about the idea of people walking around

1341
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,671
Randomly with guns

1342
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:22,975
So f*** you Alex

1343
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,303
.308

1344
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,911
So also the other thing I want to talk about

1345
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
But I need to get more information

1346
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,495
For my dad is that

1347
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,055
Alex talks about two people got arrested

1348
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
Test2 counter-protest

1349
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
Got arrested

1350
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
And they make a big deal out of it there

1351
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,831
What have you removed for trespassing

1352
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,391
DaVita permit to protest

1353
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,159
Some campuses

1354
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,695
That's pretty Universal

1355
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:54,463
College camp

1356
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,023
Some campuses have

1357
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,303
Specific places where it's

1358
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
They had a permit

1359
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,167
She had a permit

1360
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,959
These dick holes that showed up

1361
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,239
What's the difference

1362
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
I wasn't actually at that protest I was busy

1363
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,663
But

1364
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,199
The other protests the next one

1365
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
I was at protest

1366
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,783
I need refers to it as

1367
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,807
The dildo protest

1368
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:25,183
I know but it's

1369
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:29,535
In Austin and like I know that Alex will bring it up when it happened

1370
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:34,911
We get there I'll call my dad and get a lot about that but

1371
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,239
Everybody everybody concealed-carry dildos is that what it was

1372
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:41,567
I hope it is pretty good

1373
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,359
Know what I do

1374
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,639
And is after this Alex

1375
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,943
Back on his

1376
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,927
Not good

1377
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
Not right

1378
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,463
Migrate

1379
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,071
I think that he might not be able to

1380
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
To tell which is which

1381
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:07,423
At a certain point

1382
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,703
In order to save face

1383
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:13,567
He wants to be like I'm the one who started it there following

1384
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:14,847
I am now Putin

1385
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:19,455
B**** by accident how he's going to sell the Trump stuff

1386
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:26,879
Americana sweeper Sal and stuff like that

1387
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
For Trump

1388
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:32,255
I think that's kind of his big moves and then of course

1389
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,535
Get together with the strongman

1390
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,303
It's always about the

1391
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
The big strong

1392
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
Yeah

1393
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,399
Eclipse from August

1394
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:41,215
1st August 2nd

1395
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:41,983
Which I think is

1396
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
F****** amazing

1397
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
But August 1st

1398
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:46,591
Recovery

1399
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,639
Bridget Lee interview

1400
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,295
Joel skousen

1401
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,831
On

1402
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:01,183
I believe he has

1403
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,463
Okay that

1404
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:05,023
That Looms

1405
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
This next clip is f******

1406
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,655
Wild

1407
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:15,007
You say that close

1408
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,431
I can get it

1409
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
But I mean

1410
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:30,111
He's going to say what he's going to say I considering play clips of Marty saying

1411
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,439
I could have

1412
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,375
Does sound insane

1413
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,495
He could get a sit-down interview with Putin

1414
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,919
I don't know maybe he has what world is Alex

1415
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
Get a sit-down interview

1416
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,807
If he actually does

1417
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,343
That implies to

1418
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,367
To me that he has

1419
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
Connections

1420
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,463
But not directly

1421
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:11,839
Indirect contact

1422
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,375
Maybe he's talking to Rodger

1423
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
AirStone off arrabon

1424
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,703
I like Rodger

1425
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,495
A connection to the Russian

1426
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,567
Maybe he's accidentally slipping something like that

1427
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,847
I don't know it's weird

1428
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,919
I'm not saying that

1429
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,759
That's because

1430
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
He even he even if he says it's probably North

1431
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,231
Which means

1432
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,511
He wants to do it

1433
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
Yes

1434
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,839
That

1435
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,631
The idea of him

1436
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
He would get on

1437
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
Plane to Russia

1438
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,703
Vicente

1439
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:49,727
If Putin

1440
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,007
Actually sat down for

1441
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:56,895
51 Megyn Kelly

1442
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,967
Spencer Pratt it's he's pissed at Megyn Kelly

1443
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
Sean

1444
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
I told you that October 2nd

1445
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:15,839
It is amazing

1446
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:16,863
You did tell me

1447
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:20,447
I'm just going to let Alex start the show off

1448
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,519
And I think you'll see a mediately why it's so awesome

1449
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:39,391
And then I guess

1450
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:49,119
And I have not had a lot to drink

1451
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
Budweiser

1452
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:59,615
Melon board

1453
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:06,015
Broadcast today

1454
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,623
The worst

1455
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:17,279
Abogados actually respect that

1456
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Guys

1457
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:26,751
I am hungover is she

1458
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,799
I think we're going to have a great show

1459
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,943
Just like Eddie

1460
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,735
Convince him

1461
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,271
Spell check

1462
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
I think it's going to work

1463
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
The co-host the show with him

1464
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,583
Could you doing such a s*** job

1465
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
He's fine

1466
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:59,519
Jager

1467
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,103
College

1468
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,687
A bottle of Jack

1469
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,223
On a Tuesday

1470
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,271
I've not touched

1471
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,295
Demon Yeager

1472
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Weird night of

1473
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:21,279
I was buying you

1474
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:28,959
He's not good

1475
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,263
He's just doing weird

1476
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,031
Kind of

1477
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,615
Hey they just not being able to handle his normal job

1478
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
ISO about

1479
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,919
10 minutes in

1480
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:40,223
Joe Biggs comes in a tape sidecars

1481
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,039
Nothing

1482
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,063
Yeah

1483
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:46,879
Cuz he accidentally would have told too much

1484
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:53,279
The truth maybe like I feel like that's what it is

1485
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
Just like

1486
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:55,839
I quit

1487
01:09:56,351 --> 01:10:02,495
It seems like you guys

1488
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,775
Like let's go to break I'm done

1489
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
What's up Joe Biggs in there just in

1490
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,871
It does feel like that sort of thing

1491
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
But

1492
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
You get that like

1493
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:15,039
Sit down

1494
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,343
On the floor and then rolls

1495
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:22,719
It's the perfect opportunity for him to be like

1496
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
Child

1497
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,535
That's their product

1498
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,095
Calm children

1499
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,631
Tom's babies

1500
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:30,911
He knows not of this

1501
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,263
Child

1502
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:38,079
Alex

1503
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:38,847
Do you still want

1504
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,175
He wants to try and do is f****** job

1505
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,735
Today's top story

1506
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,063
Courtyard top storage

1507
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,623
It's not that far in trips

1508
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
From China

1509
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:56,511
Iran and Russia are piling area

1510
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,327
Growing Al-Qaeda

1511
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,119
No that's our top story

1512
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:07,007
Warriors

1513
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,823
With the state department criticizing Russia

1514
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,127
And the Pentagon criticizing Russia

1515
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,943
Got to remember when I get home

1516
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,599
Al-Qaeda

1517
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,903
She's misrepresenting that but he's also

1518
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,255
But the top stories all these people are critiquing Russia and shouldn't

1519
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
He's getting defensive

1520
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:32,863
It's not that China and

1521
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
Laundry list of

1522
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
Made up

1523
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,983
Globalist countries

1524
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
Troops into

1525
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,311
What was it

1526
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,847
Siri Siri

1527
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,895
America

1528
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:48,223
The bad guys

1529
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,783
America

1530
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:53,599
I hate them for somebody who loves America so much

1531
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:58,463
To burn to the ground

1532
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,279
To buy into Russian propaganda about

1533
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:05,375
Indicates that he doesn't really have that much do Siri

1534
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,911
He's not really American royalty

1535
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
How

1536
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
The South rise

1537
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:10,751
Again

1538
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
Russian backing

1539
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,847
Well there we go

1540
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,919
Why else would these people who hate America so much

1541
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:19,199
Love so much

1542
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:22,527
What they're trying to do is secede again

1543
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,087
If at first you don't succeed

1544
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:28,159
I will I will take a negative

1545
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,183
For that one as well

1546
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:34,815
I don't think you're joking but you might not be too far off what Alex would like

1547
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:36,607
Don't

1548
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,399
Mayo Clinic

1549
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,679
Just to be in America

1550
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,983
I'm thrilled about that

1551
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,543
Royalty

1552
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:48,383
Americana

1553
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,783
We tried to leave

1554
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:58,367
Everything Russia.

1555
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,927
Based on bulshit I saw on

1556
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
State-run media

1557
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,999
So

1558
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,303
Clip is just a great example of Alex

1559
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
Being hungover and

1560
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
Just being like

1561
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,655
Awfully

1562
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,959
I don't know what's going on in his head

1563
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,495
I have no idea

1564
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,263
But this is

1565
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,799
This is wild stuff

1566
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:21,663
What do you think

1567
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Sunlight good for you

1568
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,671

I literally

1573
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,687
Wives tale

1574
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,503
To describe what

1575
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,391
From the castle

1576
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:09,791
Down there in those Palms by the castles

1577
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
Drink your blood

1578
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:18,239
Will torture you

1579
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,943
Realized the Sun

1580
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:29,247
What is the people that hate life

1581
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,039
People are from

1582
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:39,743

Just blowing

1586
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,919
These people are literal

1587
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,135
Right that's a really important

1588
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:12,255
I remember Jackie there's about how

1589
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
Renfield

1590
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,583
And that's how we got

1591
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
That's how

1592
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
Right

1593
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,727

Choppa Choppa

1597

It's like I don't even know how to unpack that in terms of like

1598
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,975
What are you thinking literally mean

1599
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,279
Play in this case

1600
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:51,679
In this case what what extent mean is he saying literally meaning literally or literally meaning figuratively

1601
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:55,007
Exactly like it does keep mean literally in the Sun

1602
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
What's that

1603
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,591
These people like Obama these people like

1604
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,615
George Soros

1605
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:03,455
Never seen in sunlight

1606
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
They're literally like News-Sun

1607
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:08,575
And they are literally going to drink your blood

1608
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,135
Is he saying that cuz if so

1609
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
This is stupid

1610
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:18,047
Literally has the Ring of a man trying to

1611
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:23,167
Convince you it is literally true talking figuratively that I guess you could say that

1612
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
The sunlight is truth

1613
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,543
Or something like that and drinking your blood is now your SNL

1614
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,847
Making your life energy away Phelps

1615
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:33,919
But I don't think

1616
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,199
Yeah

1617
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,247
That's what we're all about

1618
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,599
I have drunk

1619
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,879
Play Blood of several

1620
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:46,207
This next clip is still hungover Alex quite a bit

1621
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:50,303
This is after him screaming

1622
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:55,423
I want to fight with Hispanic I want to fight with a Catholic to think I want to fight with the Muslims

1623
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,447
Yeah

1624
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:03,103
How to draw Scooby-Doo

1625
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,175
Back

1626
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,223
I cut out that part cuz

1627
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
Constraints

1628
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,903
I accidentally started the clip at a certain point in like I'm not going back for the rest of it

1629
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,695
It's just one of them

1630
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:24,351
This is my job this is my job job

1631
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,655
Anyway the rest of this club is pretty hilarious

1632
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:33,055
It won't matter call the stupid stuff they put between us

1633
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,871
This isn't saying that if we all see the truth

1634
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,991
Stupid s*** they put

1635
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:43,551
You're doing Alex

1636
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:48,671
Once we understand it was all done to us on purpose from a trip

1637
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,999
You can break that transfer just like that

1638
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,583
You decide

1639
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:56,863
She's all about free will

1640
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
About something

1641
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:03,775
I'm not copying the matrix it's an allegory it's always been true

1642
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:06,335
All I'm offering is the truth nothing more

1643
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,663
Because once you realize the True Heart of this

1644
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,711
It's going to change your world forever

1645
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:18,367
You're not going to be able to just sit there calmly anymore and do for your bumbling life. About fantasy football where I can talk to

1646
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,391
Your body's

1647
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:22,463
When you hit the rock bottom of the situation

1648
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:26,047
Going to get the billion miles you stink and things

1649
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,607
There's no coming back from that

1650
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,399
Your secret

1651
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,703
Already in a Rabid wolf

1652
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:38,079
Choice to make

1653
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,175
Imallexx

1654
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:52,159
Sincerity

1655
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,719
From the rabbit hole

1656
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
You're already

1657
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,583
And you can be free any moment you want to

1658
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,423
But you're going to go if you're not free when I get into that rabbit

1659
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
Secret

1660
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:10,847
You're already in the rabbit hole over

1661
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,711
Weird

1662
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:17,759
I don't even know what that voice is

1663
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:23,135
It's gross in the world

1664
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:27,487
Where am I

1665
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,631
First of all that like I'm not ripping off The Matrix

1666
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:40,031
Directly exactly

1667
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,407
The other thing that I love is that like

1668
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
Once you

1669
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:48,991
Did you get a million miles you of everything

1670
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,015
Well

1671
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,855
Dirt bike games from the your perception

1672
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,391
Alex you might

1673
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,951
Think that you have a million miles you

1674
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,719
Euro

1675
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
Distrustful narrator

1676
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
Secret

1677
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
Set the secret

1678
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:10,495
He can just be out of the rabbit hole

1679
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,592
Allegory of the cave

1680
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,688
Probably

1681
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,224
The Stranger

1682
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,760
He loves that

1683
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:32,768
Is Billy Idol

1684
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:35,072
Goodnight for

1685
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,400
Alex

1686
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,312
The secret is that a Rebel Yell will set you free

1687
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
This next

1688
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:50,688
Alex is talking about this Oregon shooter

1689
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,248
People if they were Christian

1690
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
They said yes he was coming

1691
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,088
Taliban

1692
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,880
Yeah that's always been one of those things

1693
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
Add pops up

1694
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
Whenever people feel like

1695
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,768
Discussing a little chat about that

1696
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,304
Evan Alex Jones

1697
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,840
Says something

1698
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,656
I think any Christian

1699
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:12,704
Should be probably offended by

1700
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,264
Any real Christian Wood

1701
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
I would say this

1702
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,360
Fort Worth

1703
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:31,136
But

1704
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,048
Is your why we were come back like doing something

1705
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,840
Of course just to keep

1706
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,936
Things calmed escalate

1707
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
I'm being honest about lying here

1708
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:57,760
News

1709
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:04,160
Scripture

1710
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,720
Start with Mark

1711
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:07,488

1712
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256

1713
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,536
Whoever is

Generation

1716
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,376
The son of man

1717
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,656
Will also be ashamed

1718
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
In the glory of his van

1719
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:17,984
Interesting

1720
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:21,824
Let's go now to Matthew 1033

1721
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,128
Whoever denies me before men

1722
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,176
And I will also

1723
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
My father who is in

1724
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,248
In heaven that was pretty clear

1725
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:34,368
Pretty clear don't deny Christ I am not a Christian if you are

1726
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:40,768
They made murder out of that girl

1727
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,048
Columbine

1728
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,584
She said yes girl

1729
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,912
I feel bad that I don't remember her name

1730
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:50,496
Super knotted to Christian propaganda

1731
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
They made a really

1732
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
This girl was

1733
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,360
Cool

1734
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,152
Felt so committed

1735
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:57,920
Did Jesus

1736
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
In the face

1737
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:05,088
That is the idea of religion her Everlast

1738
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,368
Sing reward

1739
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,416
Where is Branson

1740
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,976
If somebody were to have said no

1741
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Jesus

1742
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,024
When they

1743
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,048
The Pearly Gates

1744
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,328
Would have said

1745
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:16,096
No

1746
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,376
Right now

1747
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:19,936
I am not sure I believe in Pearly Gates

1748
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:25,312
Religion is a whole lot in the Bible it don't you remember how

1749
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,848
All the time

1750
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,664
What I want to say is

1751
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,272
You can tell a person by sort of how much they stick to their conviction

1752
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,808
And Alex

1753
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:39,648
One of his big convictions is the globalist the running the world Seeker

1754
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,952
Another one is Vicky

1755
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,744
He is a good Christian man

1756
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
And

1757
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,072
Religious conviction

1758
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
In his car

1759
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,400
Conception the way he presents it

1760
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:52,448
Is one of the most important things to him

1761
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:54,240
Defining

1762
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,848
And the idea that he would so easily go against

1763
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,640
Very literal

1764
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:02,432
Very clear scripture

1765
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
I am deny God

1766
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,552
Just because he doesn't want to die cuz this guy isn't worth my honest

1767
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,600
That's a great argument

1768
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,440
Jesus said anything like that

1769
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:16,512
Someone wants to hurt you wasn't worth telling the truth.

1770
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:19,072
He said this guy Jesus isn't worth my

1771
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:25,472
Basically what I mean spiritually

1772
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:33,152
Commitment

1773
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,944
Did you ever did you ever hear that one

1774
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,992
And one of those is that that shall not lie

1775
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,320
You are not a good Christian

1776
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,856
Is that is your mind

1777
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:45,440
You're hungover I don't know

1778
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:53,120
But at the same time well when I'm hungover I definitely didn't about whether or not I would tonight

1779
01:24:54,912 --> 01:25:00,032
The other thing I loved that moment when you realize associative talk

1780
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
About lying

1781
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,592
I got a f****** fan

1782
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,152
Well that's the s*** that Joe Walsh

1783
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:06,432
Tweeted out where

1784
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,736
At least he's honest about lying

1785
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,576
Shut up you fallen so far as that

1786
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
Eagles

1787
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
So

1788
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:19,232
We just got

1789
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,792
Has not been dragged down by the

1790
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:27,424
Who is without a win

1791
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Cast the first

1792
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,496
So this next

1793
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,776
Clip is

1794
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,336
Alex is still hungover

1795
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:40,480
You know the adrenaline of doing this show hasn't really helped out but he's found something else that might

1796
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
Might be

1797
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Super male vitality

1798
01:25:56,608 --> 01:26:00,704
Brake Force

1799
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,520
And some little mouse around here is eating my brain Force

1800
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,896
Intelligent but open it up and it was

1801
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:11,200
Envelope

1802
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,600
Wasn't punching punching a steel door

1803
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:24,000
High School

1804
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,792
Furniture stores in Denham

1805
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,328
Girls getting frostbite

1806
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,448
Breakfast

1807
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,384
Cake spongy

1808
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,952
Is not minding the pain

1809
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:59,328
Pain don't hurt

1810
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:03,168
Weird

1811
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,800
Superman

1812
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:21,600
It's a little

1813
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:27,744
If you're watching the video he's staring off into the middle distance

1814
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,048
Sometimes pain is been part of you so long

1815
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:33,632
Who's there

1816
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,192
You're revealing a lot in this hangover

1817
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
That's crazy

1818
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:42,592
Both of you impress Girls by

1819
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:49,504
High School

1820
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,808

1821
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:59,232

1822
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,536
I know his in the breakdown

1823
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:16,896
Cuz he f****** banged out 200 girls before he was 16 so I don't know what's going on

1824
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,176
Texas women

1825
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
Apparently is all it takes

1826
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:27,136
Everything is bigger except their self-esteem

1827
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:29,696
Causing a lot of Texas I only went for half

1828
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,560
Don't mean that at all because I don't believe Alex the story about it

1829
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,888
If it were true is that many women

1830
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:38,912
Deemed

1831
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,704
The two lower

1832
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
True

1833
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,104
Bristol weather

1834
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:56,320
Not Vegas

1835
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,112
Boy

1836
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:04,256
Beyond the humanizing of it with me like that really sad end

1837
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:09,632
Old man

1838
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
With

1839
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,168
Joe Biggs

1840
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,448
In order to impress them

1841
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:15,520
Are you telling the stories on the show to impress his audience

1842
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,800
With his masculinity

1843
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,104
You might think he's been sort of made a fool of

1844
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
You might think that

1845
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:28,320
He doesn't be as another clip about people who have been made to look like fools

1846
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,008
Russia

1847
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:58,016
It's

1848
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,048
This is part of a larger

1849
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:13,120
Globalist operation

1850
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:16,448
In the final

1851
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:20,288
Prosperity and John

1852
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:22,080
Got them taxes cut the spending

1853
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:26,176
Call welfare folk start working stop

1854
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,088
We did

1855
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,976
The first

1856
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,536
I know some people that it

1857
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,560
4

1858
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:49,216
Anybody throughout American History For Whom the

1859
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:54,848
Prosperity engine did not work the first hundred fifty years of a country

1860
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,968
Close-minded narrow Focus

1861
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:03,296
Also the Great Depression

1862
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,696
That's whenever it stopped I can't think of any reason why the prostate Prosperity engine so-to-speak was turned off

1863
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,232
Could it be because it's

1864
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,768
The goddamn

1865
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Yeah

1866
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,520
And you know why the Federal Reserve exist

1867
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,080
I can't think of any because

1868
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,920
Before the Federal Reserve existed first of all the value of the market

1869
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,456
Was so volatile

1870
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,992
Everything was up

1871
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,416
Stabilization

1872
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:46,304
Before anyone could make their own money

1873
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,120
People could just make money

1874
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,888
The payback

1875
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,912
With whatever

1876
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:57,824
No it doesn't know it doesn't look very disorganized way to run a country

1877
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,224
We will also be everybody

1878
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,320
Redeemable at

1879
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:09,344
Disney World

1880
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:11,648
150 years of Art

1881
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,744
Black people wearing

1882
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,024
Yep

1883
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,048
Women couldn't

1884
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
Vote

1885
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,840
And you can hear them

1886
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,376
Yeah I was totally cool

1887
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,680
Men and the family ruled the world

1888
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:24,960
I'm children

1889
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,984
We're forced

1890
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
Into work

1891
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Prosperity

1892
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:32,640
Twin slaves in children

1893
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:35,968
The Chinese were forced to build the railroads

1894
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,760
A lot of them died in the process

1895
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:44,672
Without that's productive there was a lot more abusive foreigners than just that

1896
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:45,440
Do you know

1897
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,000
Might have had the best

1898
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
Time

1899
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:54,144
For the first 150 years of America

1900
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,264
Weird

1901
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,032
They probably

1902
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,312
Yeah

1903
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,080
It's weird

1904
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:06,944
Weird I wonder if there's a lot of

1905
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,224
White nationalist

1906
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,504
Built

1907
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,296
Around

1908
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,344
Go back to America

1909
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,112
And

1910
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:20,512
The alarm talks about help because he embodies that sort of

1911
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
Sing

1912
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:24,096
Prosperity

1913
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,888
Ignore criminal government look

1914
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:30,240
Stupid government is way better

1915
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:36,640
Absolute

1916
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,832
Like quite frankly because we know what's going on with his mind

1917
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,112
But this is taking a

1918
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,136
Horse pro-russia

1919
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,976
Like before sweetheart

1920
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:55,840
And you might think immediately following the money bomb to write

1921
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,376
You might think that I'm

1922
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,656
Selectively editing

1923
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,424
Staffing like

1924
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:02,240
Oh he was talkin possibly about Russia before and I just

1925
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,776
Was leaving it out no

1926
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:05,312
We've talked about some

1927
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,104
Pro-russian stuff creeping in

1928
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,152
2

1929
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
And now

1930
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:10,944
It's just

1931
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:14,272
The entire Tiger shows are about Russia

1932
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,296
They're being good

1933
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,320
And

1934
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,112
I don't know what to make of it

1935
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,648
Because here's the deal

1936
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:23,488
We keep coming to New conclusions about what the f*** happened in 2015

1937
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,536
Because we didn't come into this

1938
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,816
With a like

1939
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:31,424
This is what happened and we're going to prove that it happened

1940
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
Went from

1941
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,984
Fucktrump

1942
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,264
To I loved her

1943
01:34:36,032 --> 01:34:41,920
17th and with each new piece of evidence that were finding

1944
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:44,480
It changes the way we're looking at

1945
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,016
Heimlich

1946
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:52,416
When we found out that the money bomb was coming up right at the end of the fiscal year it became so clear that he's in finance

1947
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
Cancel Crisis

1948
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:55,232
He's a financial strain

1949
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,256
He needs to try

1950
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,536
Keep water out of the shower

1951
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:01,632
Needs to bail some water out with that million-dollar money Bop

1952
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:04,960
And we talked we thought like this is going to be at

1953
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
Or even before that we thought

1954
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:10,592
Do the first debate is going to happen

1955
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:14,432
Alex is going to be like

1956
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:16,480
And that was

1957
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:19,040
I thought this was most

1958
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,832
Two months past Trump

1959
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,416
Now he's just article

1960
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
Sleep Russia Kik

1961
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
And I don't know what to do

1962
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,584
I don't know what to think

1963
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:34,656
To me I'm starting to think

1964
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,704
Did you a little bit about that

1965
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,008
I'm starting to suspect

1966
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,592
That Trump

1967
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
Is not as important

1968
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:44,896
To Alex

1969
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,688
As we might have been thinking

1970
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,760
I'm starting to think that maybe

1971
01:35:50,272 --> 01:35:50,784
Trump

1972
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,576
Was memes

1973
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
To supporting Russia

1974
01:35:58,208 --> 01:35:58,976
Holyshit

1975
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,256
Okay

1976
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,536
And I don't know if that's

1977
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:02,304
2 crazy

1978
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
Alright

1979
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
Vetting

1980
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,424
Man I just can't

1981
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:08,960
Hear me out on this

1982
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,776
Okay I'm going to need way more than just

1983
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,080
All the s***

1984
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,408
Yeah yeah I am going to be more than all the s*** we just

1985
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
Here he refused

1986
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
1

1987
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:21,760
Alex

1988
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,040
Support of Putin

1989
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,832
Clearly predates his support of

1990
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,624
Yes true

1991
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,648
So that's one

1992
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,464
The people that Alex Jones

1993
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,000
Spoken about already

1994
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:32,768
In or invest

1995
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
Navigation very positively

1996
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:37,120
Who end up being involved with the Trump campaign

1997
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,912
Jeff sessions

1998
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,960
Who is clearly involved

1999
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:42,496
With Russia

2000
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,592
He's clearly involved with

2001
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,384
The crime in general Flynn

2002
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,432
Who is also involved with

2003
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
Yes

2004
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
So

2005
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,272
Those are the people

2006
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:56,320
But he has already spoken of as

2007
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Gyros

2008
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,160
They're the ones who end up getting involved in

2009
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,184
Trump's campaign

2010
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,280
I mean I just don't see how that

2011
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:06,560
Canby

2012
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:07,840
Because

2013
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,888
Straight up

2014
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:16,800
Well if he's telling out America to support Rush

2015
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:24,224
That seems a lot

2016
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:25,504
Maybe that'll help

2017
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,272
So

2018
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:28,064
It

2019
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:31,904
His primary objective is fighting these imagine Club

2020
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
Yes

2021
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,232
Right he believes the Putin is doing

2022
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,280
He believes that Putin is

2023
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:40,352
Essentially the only enemy that is against

2024
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,888
The globalist international

2025
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:45,728
Kicked out of the

2026
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,288
Everybody thinks he won't go along with the global

2027
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,568
Right

2028
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:52,640
She can't outwardly support Putin

2029
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
You can't do that

2030
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:57,760
He can't turn his show into an out-and-out propaganda Fest

2031
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
For Putin

2032
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:02,880
But what

2033
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,416
He would be probably

2034
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,976
Subject to some investors

2035
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,512
Well yeah.

2036
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
And at the very least you would think

2037
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
The Patriots

2038
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,352
You like

2039
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:13,888
Lovett or leave it

2040
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:24,640
The same thing

2041
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:26,688
So

2042
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,992
I think on some level

2043
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,784
Whether it's honest

2044
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,576
Or whether it's sort of

2045
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:34,880
Coerced by some sort of third-party

2046
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:36,416
There

2047
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,744
Keep spit balling like what could happen

2048
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,536
And I recognize that this could be wrong

2049
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,352
But the way my mind is looking at it at

2050
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:45,120
Sickly

2051
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:52,288
The way our speculations have gone right in the end

2052
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:55,360
The truth is all of our speculations have been partially right

2053
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
Yeah that's always possible never know

2054
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,968
Just like the end of Clue

2055
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,248
Everybody

2056
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Express

2057
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:06,880
So the way my mind is looking at this now is I think there's a

2058
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,928
Is a decent chance that someone behind us

2059
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,976
Seems maybe someone whose name rhymes with

2060
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,512
Rodger Krohn

2061
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,072
Was convincing Alex

2062
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
Is fighting

2063
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,376
The globalist

2064
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,656
But he is

2065
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,704
Globalist

2066
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,728
And

2067
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,752
That Putin

2068
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
And him are on sort of

2069
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,592
Inasmuch as they are against

2070
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
The globalist

2071
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,896
Therefore Alex

2072
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,968
Convince his positive feelings that he has about food

2073
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,272
Call Donald Trump

2074
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,040
Okay

2075
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,344
Cuz that would be a much more

2076
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,648
Acceptable

2077
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,928
All of these narratives

2078
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,464
Is it come from Russian media

2079
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,000
Becky's clearly

2080
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:47,328
Probably not get him

2081
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,608
Afoul of

2082
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
Presupposes that he actually

2083
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:53,216
Does believe

2084
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,496
His own b*******

2085
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:56,032
In the global

2086
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,568
Right

2087
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,640
It's hard to say

2088
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,176
Right flick if

2089
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,224
Even if he does

2090
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,272
Believe in the globalist

2091
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:07,552
It is

2092
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,344
Clearly an amplification

2093
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,112
Should have that on his

2094
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,928
There's no way you genuinely

2095
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,952
Set the globalist

2096
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:14,720
AR

2097
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:15,488
Des

2098
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:17,536
What

2099
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:22,400
Expensive is the powerful honestly at this point I could believe

2100
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,704
I could believe that no

2101
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,496
He is this f***** up off

2102
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,776
Off-air and

2103
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:31,616
Miserable

2104
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:34,432
Music complete

2105
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:38,016
Conversely believe in

2106
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:39,808
Amplifying it

2107
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
Seaweed

2108
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,392
I still contend

2109
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:46,464
That with what I know of Alice

2110
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,280
Which admittedly is nowhere near as much

2111
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,864
So I could be missing the forest for the tree

2112
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,168
I don't know

2113
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,216
But

2114
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:00,800
Is it to me if there has to be somewhere along the line

2115
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
There has to

2116
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:03,872
I don't diss

2117
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,944
Agree I think there's probably some money involved

2118
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,248
It's possible that could still be a piece

2119
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:15,648
Could be things like we talked about with when Joe Biggs went to the Trump rally

2120
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:20,768
They saw that there was a massive untapped Market

2121
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:25,632
But do seem to believe in a lot of the weirdo libertarian stuff

2122
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:30,496
Might just be more intrinsic

2123
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,288
Be more like

2124
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,848
This dude got a big swinging dick and I'm ended

2125
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,920
Whereas Obama is

2126
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,200
No control

2127
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,992
No you're missing your missing tooth

2128
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,784
Okay

2129
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,856
The reason that the Russia thing is there for him

2130
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,904
Is because he believes Russian media

2131
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:51,744
He believed the stories that come out of Russian media about how

2132
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,816
Putin is secretly trying to defend Chris and dumb

2133
01:41:57,376 --> 01:42:00,192
He didn't actually blow up these apartment building

2134
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,472
I all of this

2135
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:03,520
Eventually the good guy in

2136
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
In Syria

2137
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:08,384
To the strfkr thing because

2138
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,944
There are so many anti-American

2139
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:11,712
Medias

2140
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:15,808
That it can't just be that he likes Russian media

2141
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:19,136
Because their anti-American Russian media is really

2142
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:19,904
Good

2143
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,696
Like they are

2144
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,976
Slick in their wealth

2145
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,000
Yes

2146
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
Most

2147
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,096
Convincing propaganda Outlet in the world save for

2148
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:29,120
Maybe ours

2149
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,424
Pretty good propaganda here

2150
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,192
Well I mean

2151
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:35,776
You look at North Korea maybe their values are high but

2152
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,104
They got a handle on everybody

2153
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,432
Troubling

2154
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:48,832
But I don't think that their propaganda is nearly as exportable and people on the outside or absolute

2155
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,368
And it's very clear

2156
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:53,184
With North Korea how much Kim Jeong Hoon

2157
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,208
Kim Jong-il before him

2158
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:54,976
Word

2159
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,584
Where is

2160
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:02,656
How is it not clear that Putin is an oppressive

2161
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:07,520
Again I think it's that there he believes recipes

2162
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,568
What I think that is a big part of it

2163
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,616
Because we're seeing all of these narratives

2164
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:12,896
They clearly are rooted in

2165
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,456
Straight out of

2166
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,016
Russia weather it be

2167
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,552
Or that just Rovia

2168
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:22,112
The source that we talked about the other day

2169
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:22,880
The Russian

2170
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,904
Infowars

2171
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,280
So I mean of course you would see like

2172
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,304
Is like like

2173
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,144
You know that I see they're similar to me now I like them

2174
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,192
I don't know

2175
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,216
I don't know

2176
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:40,288
And I want to be clear I want to be totally clear

2177
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,568
Hypotheses

2178
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,336
Speculation

2179
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:46,944
I'm not in any way saying that Alex Jones is or ever has been a rush

2180
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,992
I'm not saying that

2181
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,808
I'm saying

2182
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,392
It's possible you're the liar

2183
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,696
It turns out that the

2184
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:01,536
Like we need to send a v FBI a hot tip

2185
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:05,632
I'm if you investigate Alex the whole thing comes down

2186
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:07,424
I'm

2187
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
Starting to think

2188
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,472
Maybe that's

2189
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:15,616
True for the entire Russian investigation

2190
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:16,896
There might be

2191
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:17,664
Some Creedence today

2192
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:20,224
F******

2193
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:26,624
Masturbatory for me to say that is a guy who hosted Alex Jones podcast

2194
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:33,024
I don't think that I don't think that at all the only way to take down Trump

2195
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,048
He's with us

2196
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:36,352
Alex Jones is

2197
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
Incredibly

2198
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:39,424
Unguarded and dumb

2199
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,448
A lot of the time

2200
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:43,264
We provide

2201
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
3

2202
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,568
24-hours of evidence of

2203
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
Himself everyday

2204
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:47,872
On the air

2205
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,896
And it's all on

2206
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,200
So I think

2207
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,248
I think there are

2208
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:56,320
Indications in clues that you can pick up from that

2209
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:57,600
That you probably couldn't

2210
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,368
From

2211
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,648
If you have a question

2212
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:00,672
Concession with somebody

2213
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:01,696
It might not

2214
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,488
Providers ruffolo

2215
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,280
I've just put them in front of a mic

2216
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,560
Over for 3 hours

2217
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,680
Or just leave them to their own devices

2218
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:16,032
And the whole system comes Crashing Down

2219
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:20,384
These f****** douche

2220
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,152
Out

2221
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:29,088
Donald Trump jr. needs to get Alex and Rehab if you wants to survive

2222
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:29,856
It might like

2223
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,624
We hope

2224
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,672
So if I can if I can say

2225
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,976
To think with specially would like

2226
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,000
I don't

2227
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:41,376
I was just stretching my neck I wasn't

2228
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,776
Know that the thing with the thing that crashed

2229
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,080
Give me about whether or not anything will ask

2230
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:55,456
Is what just happened with Tamara in Brazil he was caught on tape

2231
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,992
Bright

2232
01:45:58,272 --> 01:45:59,808
Not being investigated for corruption

2233
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:03,392
Literally you can hear him admit

2234
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,416
Too bright

2235
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,976
Right

2236
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,840
But the Brazilian Congress

2237
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:12,608
Just voted

2238
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:13,888
Keep him as present

2239
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,936
And because they need that

2240
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,752
He cannot be arrested

2241
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,800
Under those

2242
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:22,592
Perry illegal charges

2243
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,872
Do to me

2244
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:27,712
The idea of anything bad happening

2245
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,992
Donald Trump

2246
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Is

2247
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:32,832
Entirely around whether or not our Congress

2248
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,112
Actually gives

2249
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,416
And right now I'm

2250
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,208
I'm leaning towards no

2251
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,488
I don't look like oranges

2252
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:40,256
Fusions are going to

2253
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
Protect us

2254
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:43,072
It looks like we're f***

2255
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,096
Yeah

2256
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:44,864
Yeah

2257
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,960
What is like what

2258
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Like Dave

2259
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:53,056
Today is just

2260
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:53,824
Gotten

2261
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:54,592
Grainger

2262
01:46:54,848 --> 01:47:00,736
He's just getting processed I think a lot of stuff going to move pretty quickly

2263
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:06,112
I know but I think there's going to be a lot of

2264
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,352
If you might accept a portfolio

2265
01:47:16,608 --> 01:47:20,448
Wasn't leaking well in the white house with a firearm

2266
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:25,568
Well f****** of course I'm going to do it now I would not be too surprised if that was

2267
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,360
Also I want to say that

2268
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,384
Just because

2269
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:32,992
I don't think anyone's necessarily pointed this out maybe someone hasn't haven't seen it

2270
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:34,272
There's no

2271
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:38,368
Goddamn way I would believe that Anthony scaramucci was not

2272
01:47:38,624 --> 01:47:43,232
F****** leaking stuff to cernovich and Alex Jones

2273
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,280
Hundred percent

2274
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,048
Stuff from him

2275
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,376
So is walleye Crusade against leak

2276
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,912
Is it crazy

2277
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:56,800
Why do you think certain it's the truth with all of these people are against

2278
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,336
Only what they're again

2279
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,128
If it helps them

2280
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,664
Even if

2281
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:05,760
I'm against leaks except for the leaks that help me out

2282
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:09,344
Right like it's always it's always the it's always the

2283
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,744
Even though you do

2284
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,768
F****** you guys are

2285
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072
That's

2286
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:22,400
The operational

2287
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,936
Play Books

2288
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,984
Yeah

2289
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,520
Freaked out a little bit

2290
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:31,360
Cuz it's investigation is going into weird places that I did not expect it to go

2291
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:32,640
I never would have guessed

2292
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,944
That before he supports Trump

2293
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:37,248
And months after

2294
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
This investigation started

2295
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:39,552
He would just

2296
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:41,088
Violently ramp-up

2297
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:41,856
The pro poop

2298
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:42,880
Rhetoric

2299
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
That's why

2300
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:48,768
Especially knowing what we f****** know now

2301
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:54,400
This is how aggressive Russia has been in there

2302
01:48:54,656 --> 01:48:55,936
Kompromat

2303
01:48:56,192 --> 01:49:00,800
Campaign or whatever it is intelligence agencies have come out and said on record

2304
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,384
In Congressional testimony that they first indicated

2305
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,408
Russian

2306
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,992
Either Media or

2307
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,784
Persuasion campaign

2308
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,832
15

2309
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,880
Which would be right around this.

2310
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:17,440
I think that Alex is falling for Stuff

2311
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:19,232
I think that is a piece of

2312
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,304
Highway Bears out over the

2313
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,840
Section of our

2314
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,400
Investigation on August

2315
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,192
October 3rd

2316
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,216
He was just like

2317
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:32,544
Never spoke about Putin again

2318
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,104
By the police

2319
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:37,152
Stop today

2320
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,432
Not as much

2321
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:44,832
It's a good idea to bring him up at

2322
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,624
I was just reading about how he's not a poop

2323
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,232
He's not pooping attitude comes or Worse threats like that

2324
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,024
But the more

2325
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,072
The more you protest too much

2326
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
It's like

2327
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,888
I mean

2328
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:00,448
Every time he has to reiterate

2329
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:01,472
He's not a puta

2330
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,568
Is worse

2331
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:08,640
Is the Trump Tower

2332
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:11,200
Exact same s*** that they do

2333
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:15,808
Hillary's 30,000 emails

2334
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,088
Bright

2335
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,112
Obvious

2336
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:21,440
Pro-russia campaign that I'm dealing

2337
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:25,792
People should be taught rhetoric

2338
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:28,352
So you could immediately tell the what about

2339
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,192
That that people use to deflect from

2340
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:34,496
Argument

2341
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,176
They're already off to the

2342
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,200
Yep

2343
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:47,296

2344
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,344

2348
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:55,744
I hurt all the time

2349
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:59,072
