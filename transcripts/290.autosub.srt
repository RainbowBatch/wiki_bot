00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,312
Beverages

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
What's your first name

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
I don't know I don't know

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,880
Little person remember a whole lot of

6
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,952
Like I said

7
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,512
Large gaps in my memory from

8
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,560
People talk about how they remember

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,864
They were like 45 and some

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,888
I am almost

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,496
Nothing a lot of my earliest memories are things that have been wreaking

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Constructed from like

13
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:48,896
Pictures that my parents have earliest memories I'd like a baseball

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
When we lived in

15
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,456
Cambridge mask

16
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
Real young under the age of

17
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,112
I remember the picture of it

18
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,904
You know those things like that

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,184
Yeah I think that's

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,720
Completely

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,768
I don't know

22
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Jacob

23
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
The earliest one

24
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,584
And it's also tough

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
About any memories right now.

26
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,936
Because I'm on almost no sleep

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:17,312
From people in my new apartment complex keeping me up until four 5 in the morning

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,944
With their bulshit so

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
I celebrated by getting a bath bomb never at never used a bath bomb before I give you my review on that

30
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,208
Some Sultan I like I used to like a bubble bath

31
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,560
Never explored

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:39,840
Bad review

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
Well I mean it's fine

34
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
What have you stolen enjoyable

35
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
It's called a bomb

36
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
Adjuster

37
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
It's a sort of Pisgah little bit in the tub

38
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,968
I really expected to sound like I don't know what I expected fireworks or something

39
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
Celebrate

40
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,904
Couple days before May

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Love it

42
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
April 2026

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
Alex's just got back

44
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,384
From going to Bullhorn in Washington DC

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,784
Yelling at the Capitol Building to write it back on Twitter absolutely house that goes

46
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:34,112
So horribly wrong

47
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,928
So horribly

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,464
Maddie

49
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,024
People who make this show possible who are sporting

50
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
First of all

51
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,424
I'm a policy wonk

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,384
Daniel Tiger

53
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,624
Don't like how

54
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
Just here it might become less predictable with my

55
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
Next

56
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
Someone sodomites Italy a bucket of poop

57
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,528
Thank you so much

58
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,256
You are now attacking

59
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,592
Has a Caribbean

61
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
I don't want

62
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:11,648
Make it so much better

63
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:17,024
It's probably not him know Ron Artest

64
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,631
Sports.com

65
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,359
What up

66
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Crazy stuff

67
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,991
This is going to be this is going to be bad

68
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,575
So enjoy a little bit of fun

69
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
With this out of context drop

70
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Fortunoff

71
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
Knockout the rapist sleep aid

72
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
That's enough

73
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,471
That'll give you some stuff for where things are at

74
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:03,871
Do you have to buy a bottle of like brainforce you get a bottle of knockout for

75
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
For free

76
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
2% off it makes you think

77
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Yeah kind of

78
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:17,951
The framing of it is really bad it makes

79
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,815
Hundred percent off

80
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:23,583
Good

81
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,911
Good stuff

82
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:28,191
Fire it out of a cannon

83
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
Let me give you a little bit of a sense

84
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
What's going on

85
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Alex has a business model he talks about how the money stream is not doing great

86
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:42,783
The money is not good to mention

87
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Really need to take over the world

88
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
I can do a day

89
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Not a multimillion-dollar big

90
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,695
Yeah yeah yeah

91
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
So

92
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,023
We begin on the 25th

93
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Alex

94
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,119
Is talking about that what happened

95
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
While he was in

96
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,703
A little bit of a

97
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
We got to have an impromptu

98
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,335
Absolutely

99
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Authentic

100
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Not set up interview with

101
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,855
Let me know soros's Sean and then did some trading with them on

102
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,391
Wall Street to offered me

103
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,695
Going to join the Dark Side

104
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:33,215
That's a separate time he offered me a hundred fifty million in Bitcoin backgrounds worth a dollar apiece when it first came out

105
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
He's talking about Max

106
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,823
Kaiser you ran into Max Keiser

107
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359
Trump Hotel

108
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
You ran into

109
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:48,319
Max Keiser

110
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Nominally otherwise

111
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
He's a journalist

112
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,183
Speedworks rrt

113
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
The show on art

114
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,815
He's a beautiful man about town I think you might be

115
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
I think he might have some connections in Media

116
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,911
And stuff like that

117
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
Alex

118
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Guest

119
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
He's one that actually probably has more of a

120
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
Careers

121
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,151
Everytime you tell me

122
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
He's a journalist

123
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,735
Hazard

124
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:18,271
A guy

125
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Tried to sell me on maxpoint

126
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
I can't actually have a job

127
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,743
If you were super into Bitcoin

128
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
Pretty profitable

129
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
Good amount of money off it

130
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,679
I don't think it would be that weird that you might want to f*** around and start your own coin

131
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,031
Even if it's not like something you think is going to be the make you

132
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:43,359
Your nest egg or whatever it could be fun

133
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Cuz it's hilarious been out

134
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
I'm not sure that he sells Max going as hard as

135
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,415
Or we pretend he does

136
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:01,023
I speak as a joke talk about it probably more than he does

137
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
Okay still net worth

138
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,655
Okay just the time we've been paying attention

139
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
Different stories about how the globalist have tried to get him to come over to their side

140
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,335
He said that Fox News Executives of operative

141
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Million-dollar contract

142
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,271
He said that vaguely described people have offered him tens of million dollars to turn on the Republic and all the noble Patriots

143
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
30 represents

144
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:29,951
What are you super f***** up doing that Reddit ask-me-anything session he also seemed accidentally admit none of that actually

145
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:30,719
Even happened

146
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,047
When he responded to a question about being offered tons of money

147
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,839
By saying it never happen

148
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
The new version received presented

149
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Is that a Soros connect

150
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:41,983
The person is definitely not Max Keiser

151
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
Overton millions in Bitcoin

152
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
As the fabled payoff

153
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
For him to sell out

154
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
50 million

155
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:49,919
Something like that

156
00:08:56,831 --> 00:09:02,975
Until January 2009

157
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,303
Both in terms of

158
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
He told the stories

159
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,119
And in terms of weather stories he

160
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,655
He's telling our set

161
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,959
Likes it when you tell the story of the present day

162
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,519
These stories were step before January 2000

163
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,567
Before

164
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
Yeah he was telling stories

165
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
It took a year after that point

166
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,063
In January 2009 for any recorded commercial

167
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,599
Directions to happen

168
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:31,903
When some dude.

169
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
10000 Bitcoin

170
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
Which would be worth approximately 40 million dollar

171
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Crazy

172
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,655
Fun it wouldn't be until July 2010

173
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:48,031
It wasn't until April 2011 Bitcoin value ratio with a dollar

174
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
Fluctuating wildly

175
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,479
Probably because it was completely unregulated

176
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,575
There's a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins that can ever exist

177
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
Circulation

178
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
The system and how it works

179
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,791
Could have offered Alex could ever exist in late 20s

180
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
And it would still only be worth

181
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
$2000000

182
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Alex

183
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,143
Idiot

184
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Even if they offered him every single Bitcoin at the point with bitcoins worth a dollar each that would only be 21 million dollars

185
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,103
Which Alex by his own like

186
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
How much money I make and what takes to run this operation that

187
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:32,831
You run out of that money at f****** fast in existence

188
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,367
Nothing

189
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,439
I hate I hate

190
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Because every

191
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,047
Read more about it like the mining bit

192
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,375
I didn't know that there could only ever be

193
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,399
21 million

194
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,215
That's part of what makes you type there's only like 17

195
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:51,263
See million in circulation right now is look like

196
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,967
One of these peoples chief

197
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,015
Complaints about the idea of like Fiat Quran

198
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,159
How gold has a finite amount theoretically in the universe

199
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Same thing with Bitcoin there is a finite amount of them

200
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Which

201
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,583
I guarantee that they will always have some value or whatever

202
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
I guess

203
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
I have a sense of what

204
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,519
Actually going on here

205
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,127
Alex recently ran into

206
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,503
Where he mentioned he had offered Alex 10000 Bitcoin

207
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
In the past

208
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,647
Would it would be worth 50 million dollars today

209
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:44,255
It's Alex response that is 50 million dollars

210
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,607
Alex knows that this makes him look stupid for not taking them

211
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
So you need to create a reason for him to have not for him to have been skeptical.

212
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
Associate the cryptocurrency with it at 10

213
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
Chapter globalist payoff

214
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,687
Alex is a bimetallic hard-currency guy from way back

215
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
He showed legitimately only exist

216
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,831
Today because of the investment of Ted Anderson invite his resources in the lake

217
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,671
So at no point while Ted was still Alex a sugar daddy

218
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
Could he ever have cozied up with an alternative currency

219
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,279
There's no way that would have thought

220
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,119
But just because Alex is in the pocket of a gold and silver salesman

221
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,935
A lot of people in his orbit

222
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
Cryptocurrency Skippers

223
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:28,287
Over the course of his career it's been very

224
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,871
Frontman

225
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,407
For pump-and-dump Stipe

226
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:38,527
A very very much appears that way based on looking over the people who try to

227
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,063
Seduce Alex into Bitcoin

228
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
A number of his gas

229
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
Who tried to get Alex

230
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
Which would lead this audience to buying up with

231
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,399
Would most likely salad that elevated price point leave Alex's audience holding the bag

232
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,959
This is something that John McAfee is b a

233
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Particularly criticized about

234
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:04,639
Promoting coin specifically to raise their value providing opportunities for people in the know to capitalize

235
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
Something that people talk about a lot

236
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
In Bitcoin forums you can find people

237
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Discussing this openly

238
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Like this commenter who said this

239
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,927
On 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve in 2017

240
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,207
Quotes

241
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
You need to stay in tune with his tweet

242
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,047
Whatever one is

243
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Doing for a while now

244
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
Are you need to be

245
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,959
Be fast on buying these coins that because you might get stuck in the middle

246
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,239
Too slow doing it

247
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,591
Just keep looking at his Twitter account you'll be part of his pump-and-dump

248
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Of course the reality is

249
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,967
Matter of minutes

250
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,551
The people watching

251
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,183
Twitter for clothes will be too slow and they'll be the ones who end up losing money

252
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
When the dump happen

253
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,743
Before they're ready

254
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
The role that McAfee plays in these operation

255
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:58,399
Almost certainly one that appears that Alex has probably been offered

256
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,167
To play

257
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447
But not by the globalist

258
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,543
For whatever reason maybe because he's loved hard currency too much

259
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,847
Maybe because Ted told him he couldn't

260
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,383
Cuz you just didn't

261
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Become worth a bunch later

262
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
Alex's pretty consistently resisted the invitation

263
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
Chance to enter the

264
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,271
Cryptocurrency world

265
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:17,087
I don't know if it's to his credit

266
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
Bernard

267
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,879
But it's interesting to

268
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,671
A little bit weird

269
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
Makes them look stupid

270
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:29,119
That's what makes it look stupid now to have 50 million dollars he could have on the table when he

271
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
He's begging people

272
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,775
For money cuz he's getting sued by everybody

273
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:36,543
Stock in 90

274
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
72-in

275
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
10 billion dollars

276
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:47,551
Future video.

277
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:51,135
But also in the video Max's saying like if you just taking this thing I'd offered

278
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Free right now

279
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,231
So the presentation

280
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
You

281
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,535
Because of whatever

282
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,583
F****** foolish ideas you had

283
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,119
You don't have that money

284
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:04,447
It's part of this partially presentation

285
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:07,263
I think most likely the issue is Alex

286
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
Does obsession with hard currency in the Bible

287
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Metallica

288
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,199
Because Intel

289
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,527
Late 2015 Ted Anderson was running late

290
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,087
Taken away

291
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,879
That's probably a good chance

292
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
Dad just told him no

293
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Like you can't have both

294
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
We both involved in a Bitcoin nonsense

295
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Gold and silver

296
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Is there any way to regulate.

297
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
Open dumps games

298
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:37,727
Is not a reason is in the regular

299
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Is it the Wild West

300
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
Right gotcha

301
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:47,967
Episode

302
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
About Charlotte

303
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,343
What are the reasons is because he's being sued and

304
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,671
He's been trying to pretend that lawsuit

305
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:01,279
But it is not recently about it

306
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Proceeding

307
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,839
Answer in order to

308
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,679
Going to spend a decent amount of time trying to

309
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Reclaim the narrative

310
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
Is talking about how Millie Weaver was there

311
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,359
She's a great reporter and

312
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,383
She knows everything

313
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,199
Millie Weaver is going to join us as well

314
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
She was in Charlottesville

315
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,831
She left with the police collide

316
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,695
White nationalist

317
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:30,719
White nationalist

318
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:37,119
Broad Strokes

319
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,167
Version of The Narrative Alex

320
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,495
Will be selling

321
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
A little bit of a

322
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,383
Is it smart to talk about a law

323
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
It is if you're talking about a fake version of it

324
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,951
It's fine to talk about a fictional like straw man version of Lost

325
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,535
It is very clear what his strategy

326
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Obfuscate

327
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
He went to Bullhorn at the White House to get himself back on Twitter

328
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,383
Albert

329
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Crazy

330
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:24,991
Is the owl Alex's Bullhorn in the White House

331
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
Trump is having a meeting with Jack from Twitter

332
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,463
Now in this clip Alex says that he didn't know that that was going to happen and it was just coincidence

333
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
I honestly don't know what I think

334
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
Synchronicity

335
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,407
From the airport

336
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,687
The White House

337
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
It was a

338
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,575
Ongoing then

339
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
The head of

340
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,975
Twitter would be in there

341
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:17,727
The fox house was able to

342
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,199
Orlando

343
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
How usable are properly

344
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Krowd

345
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
I want to convince them

346
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
Yelling for 1 hour

347
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
Bouncing off building

348
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
It was extremely successful

349
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
President

350
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,311
Flash

351
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,407
I was going to the room or the meeting was actually taking place

352
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:06,623
If I believe nose

353
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
Dorsey was going to have a meeting with Trump

354
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,719
Or if he did I have no idea

355
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
Either is weird

356
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:16,607
It's got to be one or the other

357
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,311
It wasn't on his official schedule

358
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Even though I don't

359
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:31,711
I don't know whatever

360
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
The rest of that clip

361
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,087
On YouTube

362
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,695
Play Gordon Ramsay or Daniel negreanu commercials for like masterclass

363
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Program

364
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:59,103
Are you bragging about that one of the few things that I think

365
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
Internationally recognized expert.

366
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,527
Yeah that is true

367
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,831
From way back

368
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:14,719
They are all in the Hall of Fame Glee as much as I don't believe he knows how to read

369
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,559
Or analyze contacts

370
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
He could teach you a goddamn thing

371
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,703
Howard 100

372
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,775
Percent I recognize my limitations

373
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:34,175
Picture of a water snake

374
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
You bet it is

375
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
You bet it is

376
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,623
Alex tries to

377
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
Reinvigorate a narrative

378
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
You know he's used a lot

379
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,095
Little bit lately

380
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,375
To resurrect

381
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
And that is

382
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
The Trump was spied on

383
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
The party last night

384
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,055
Because Trump's bringing it up being like a i w b on me

385
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:05,151
William Barr is also being

386
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,247
And so with the one America News Network

387
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:19,488
What's the name of it

388
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,864
You bet there is

389
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
They played

390
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,752
Some sort of pre-packaged

391
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Kidspeace

392
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:35,360
The evidence Alex had forgotten

393
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,640
About Trump being

394
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
I was really excited

395
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Because like

396
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,528
I want to know what you're talkin about

397
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,808
I got less

398
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:44,576
Excited

399
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:48,416
Obsessed on

400
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
EFax

401
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
.

402
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,704
Trump campaign

403
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
OneAmerica

404
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,832
He told me

405
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
About how the British government helped the Obama Administration.

406
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:24,000
The Fourth Amendment on the 2016

407
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,024
Campaign for them

408
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,352
Larry Johnson

409
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:33,728
It's so funny to me that I was constantly yells but have no one has a memory except

410
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
Because his audience

411
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,152
Never try to have another swing making Larry see John's

412
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,944
Something like a legitimate Source on

413
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:48,832
In case you forgot Larry Johnson and probably most memorable for being the guy who tried to spread the hoax during

414
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,392
2008 presidential campaign

415
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:54,464
Michelle Obama

416
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,816
While appearing on a panel with Louis Farrakhan at Jeremiah Wright's Trinity

417
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,656
He pushed the story although he admitted that he'd never seen the tape

418
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:03,680
Just talk to me

419
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
No such tape exist

420
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:09,824
Pointing out that

421
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,616
Michelle it never spoken at Trinity

422
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
I never use that word

423
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:19,808
Never materialized Johnson blames the McCain campaign

424
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,832
Potato

425
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,600
Just bullshittin

426
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,696
Interesting Lee Larry C Johnson was the main source for a ton of stories

427
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,720
Recirculating about

428
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Be quote-unquote waititi

429
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:32,864
Rush Limbaugh use Larry as an as an excuse to cover the fake story sensation

430
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:38,752
But what I find more interesting is that Rodger f****** Stone appeared on geraldo's Fox show

431
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:39,776
Comment on it

432
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
There's a buzz which I believe now to be credible

433
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,920
Did some indelible record exist

434
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,992
The Michelle Obama allegedly made which are outrageous at bat

435
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,088
Including some reference to white people as white

436
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
Allegedly

437
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Rodger was using Larry's

438
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,792
Larry's own blog No Quarter

439
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,400
Posted Rogers Fox news interview presenting it as evidence that the story was legitimate

440
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
Looking back through time

441
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,960
What you see

442
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
It's fascinating

443
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,544
Is the same players playing the same game

444
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,336
Weird I hate

445
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
I hate it

446
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,872
I hate it

447
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
I hate

448
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:19,968
America very weird

449
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,272
Here's a big story

450
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
Michelle Obama called somebody a honky

451
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:25,856
That's it

452
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:32,000
That was there but it wasn't it wasn't true

453
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:38,144
Commenting on Trump saying the n-word that

454
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,544
Trusting Tom Arnold on this cuz I would advise

455
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,104
Be careful. Tell model

456
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,640
Oh no I was

457
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:51,712
If we are going home right right right

458
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Which one

459
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,272
Which one is worse

460
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm actually angrier if Michelle Obama didn't say that

461
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:04,000
We've been over this

462
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:08,608
Perhaps more seriously and more relevant to this episode of Alex's show

463
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,704
Larry C Johnson was the source for that the claim that the British intelligence group

464
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,032
Gchq spying on the Trump campaign at Obama's request

465
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,128
An outlet to pick up a story and run with it was Andrew Napolitano

466
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,664
His show on Fox News

467
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,760
This claim was so unfounded so not backed up by actual information

468
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,296
So inflammatory

469
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,112
Literally almost caused an international incident

470
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:30,880
What's wrong

471
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
The clients

472
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,232
It legitimately threatened our International intelligence-sharing relationship

473
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
Some of our longest held

474
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,048
The closest allies

475
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,400
Form to the aftermath of world war in hopes of averting a World War 3

476
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,984
In the Fallout Fox news release statements condemning the coverage

477
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:49,312
It took Napolitano off the air for an indefinite vacation

478
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
So he would return to air about a week

479
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,456
Here are some important things to remember about Larry seat

480
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
1

481
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,552
He retired from intelligence work in 9th

482
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
1893

483
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,904
14 years before the first iPhone came out

484
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,232
8 years before the release of the f****** Nintendo GameCube

485
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,072
People born five years after he retired can legally buy booze

486
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,680
So he was in the game

487
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,288
Two people who knew him when he was Intelligence do not think highly of him

488
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
They're very frequent criticisms

489
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Threat of terrorism

490
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
The pre 9/11

491
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,016
Emmy award-winning investigative journalist Peter Lance

492
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,552
Who worked with Larry had this to

493
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
To save him

494
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
Is one of the great empty

495
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Do you suit

496
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,952
He's emblematic of what goes wrong in the Aging

497
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,024
Emblematic of the attitude that let 9/11 happen

498
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,096
It's not like there isn't evidence to back this up

499
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:49,728
New York Times op-ed wrote on July 10th

500
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,848
163 days before 9/11

501
00:26:56,128 --> 00:27:01,248
Judging from news reports in the portrayal of villains in our popular entertainment

502
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
She's about terrorist

503
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,088
They seem to believe that terrorism is the greatest threat to the United

504
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
It states that it is

505
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,904
Becoming more widespread and lethal

506
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,744
They're likely to think that the United States is the most popular Target of terrorists

507
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,816
Almost certainly has I the impression that

508
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,096
Extremist Islamic groups

509
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Cosmos most terrorism

510
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
None of these beliefs are based in fact

511
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,984
Whoops

512
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
You know what

513
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
The New York Times

514
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
Three days after

515
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
After 9/11

516
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,760
Whoops my bad guys I mean I missed the ball on this one

517
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,600
Terms of not allowing yourself

518
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,368
Be caught up in

519
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,136
Invitational

520
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Japanese not making

521
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Is the reality that

522
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,072
Being stupid

523
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
We should be over so paralyzed

524
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:58,080
There's a certain way

525
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Your

526
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,968
They seem to believe the terrorism is the greatest

527
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:09,088
To the United States

528
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,904
Three days after

529
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
Couple months

530
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Before 911

531
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
And the bad luck

532
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:25,216
Please don't feel bad if you are presenting yourself

533
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,544
Larry C Johnson is a member of the veteran intelligence

534
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Professionals

535
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
Along with William

536
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:38,272
You'll be surprised to learn that he's a member of the organization to release a very sloppy memo

537
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
We just used it the Cornerstone of the Seth Rich conspiracy

538
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,976
Fingers on that one too

539
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,840
I mean you lying

540
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,168
Pretense

541
00:28:55,424 --> 00:29:01,568
And the veneer of some sort of credibility for working intelligence for a couple years back in 93

542
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,640
State with confidence all sorts

543
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
To Crazy Bowls

544
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,528
As long as it aligns with what other people need somebody

545
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,320
Just a crap

546
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
Dammit

547
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Racket

548
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,208
All this is to say that Larry

549
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:19,232
The f****** idiot

550
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
With really long track record of

551
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Completely wrong about every

552
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,608
Close to doing

553
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,680
Just work the Unabomber was in the middle of his bombing campaign

554
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,264
Tonya Harding was a year away from father Nancy Kerrigan

555
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,616
Hey Kurt Cobain Tupac and Biggie we're all still alive

556
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:40,992
Long time ago

557
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Literally no reason to ever trust something he's reported without ever

558
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,816
Things that he's claiming

559
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
From Secret sources

560
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,888
And stuff like that you could not

561
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:58,656
Trapani

562
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,728
And you can see the danger that can come from it

563
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:06,080
His ear

564
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:09,408
Maybe cuz it's satisfied Trump's ego he believed repeat

565
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Potential to realign

566
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
Geopolitical at Alliance

567
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Is weak

568
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,624
It's definitely fun to laugh at him

569
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,160
Any age we now live in

570
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,976
Someone like him could literally start a World War

571
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,536
So it's important to look at him as not

572
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Just

573
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
A joke

574
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
Yeah these are very serious things that are being

575
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,424
Played around with

576
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:37,056
Is like reigniting the story based on Larry Johnson

577
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:41,152
Being used as a source by one American bad

578
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
This is very this is

579
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Stuff we've already dealt with

580
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:45,504
Dunno

581
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
It's not it's not great

582
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
To see how they just

583
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,648
Keep throwing the same bolts

584
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,488
That was actually comforting things that

585
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:56,768
The Mueller report

586
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,816
Is the realization that

587
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,096
Just like that

588
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
Just

589
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,400
Obviously

590
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Bulshit information

591
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,240
Theoretically could have ruined

592
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
We have with

593
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,872
DC over and over and over again in the Mueller report

594
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
So many times

595
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
You took it literally

596
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
Would be like the end of the world is

597
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,040
As we know it and everybody around

598
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:19,808
Just like

599
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,088
We're not doing that

600
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,624
That one's just not going to

601
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
Many other people around the world may also

602
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,328
Upstate you know you know we're like

603
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,632
Not good we're going to listen to that

604
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,240
Please everybody in the world has this sense of

605
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,312
Okay we know what you doing

606
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:43,360
We know what he's trying to do in

607
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,432
Not let everybody

608
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,712
Complaints about Obama

609
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Deteriorating

610
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:51,040
Soft power

611
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,320
The real comedy

612
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,904
The rest of the world

613
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,952
President says that's usually not a good

614
00:31:58,464 --> 00:31:59,232
Nuggets

615
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,584
Alex is bringing back up this Trump was fired on narrative

616
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:08,192
Is evidence there is the one America news network live that way

617
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,752
Who played that interviewed Larry C Johnson

618
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,776
So bad

619
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,056
Noted intelligent

620
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:13,824
Official

621
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Larry seizure

622
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,360
Tropicana

623
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,408
Back when Kurt Cobain was alive

624
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,456
Grunge with cool

625
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,832
World Trade Center first bombing had just half

626
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,416
What else

627
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,024
The dream team had just won

628
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
I think it was

629
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
We could just be like

630
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,920
But thankfully Alex has other information

631
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
Eddie gets a witness

632
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:58,368
H clip one more time

633
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,160
Never plays

634
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
For Obama

635
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:12,960
They can't

636
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Cover

637
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,312
Their butts anymore

638
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Unable

639
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
To do it

640
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:27,040
Email wants Trump actually.

641
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,880
We better follow all the laws on surveillance

642
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,416
When she been quarterbacking it

643
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:34,464
Long with others

644
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Full-time

645
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
The time

646
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,328
All turned out to be true

647
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,608
Infowars.com

648
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
2 years from now today

649
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,752
Shut off the air

650
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,336
Demonized

651
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:55,456
Appreciate

652
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,224
Others

653
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,672
That's an interesting way to phrase normalizing awful content

654
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
No

655
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,560
If he's not going to you know come with it I'm not either

656
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,120
I really only want that to sit here as

657
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,400
The globalist

658
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
Cuz he's so far ahead of everybody and

659
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:17,472
And he's right about everything

660
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,544
I told you that he doesn't play that Samantha powers

661
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,152
By that assertion remember that

662
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,272
Is powers on CNN

663
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,416
Information would disappear

664
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:42,048
Athena people who see

665
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:47,424
Found out how we knew what we knew about

666
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
The Trump staff dealing with Russians

667
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:55,616
Try to compromise those sources in

668
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,736
Samantha power

669
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,760
Yeah there

670
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Whoops

671
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
This isn't her

672
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
Not surprisingly is big old zero.

673
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
Since early

674
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,920
2017

675
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,456
Anytime

676
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Because

677
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
It's kind of

678
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,856
This is a clip of Evelyn Farkas

679
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Defense for Russia

680
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
Ukraine in an interview on MSM

681
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,256
This Marcus is not discussing spying on Trump

682
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,792
Champagne

683
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,072
Preserved

684
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,680
She's very specifically talking about how there were a lot of

685
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,960
Intelligent

686
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:57,312
That have been gathered about Russia and their Adventures into election meddling

687
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,848
Might end up missing

688
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,384
Straub's people got into office

689
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
That is what

690
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
We Preserve

691
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,064
This was specifically stated to be the basis

692
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,624
American intelligence agencies had intercepted

693
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
Indications of Russia

694
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Beneficials

695
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
Gremlin

696
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
Discussing contact withdrawal

697
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,096
That is why there I was concerned about the sources and methods of

698
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:21,120
Collecting information

699
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:27,776
At that point it wasn't clear if you were handing over intelligence data to the people who the intelligence was about

700
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:30,336
This will compromise literally all of the

701
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:33,152
Intelligence capability about Russia and related

702
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,224
Her interview on MSNBC with specifically.

703
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,296
Discuss a story in the New York Times to come out a few days prior

704
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,856
With the headline Obama officials raced

705
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
The Preserve Russia

706
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,392
Cantrell

707
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:45,440
So it's not like this wasn't already

708
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
Your conversation is being had in the media

709
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,560
Nothing Farkas is thing is even close to a bombshell

710
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,400
The New York Times articles

711
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
This interview is about

712
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,960
Specifically says quote

713
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:57,728
Pharmacy

714
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,312
Senior Obama administration official said the efforts were Direct

715
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Goodbye mr. Obama

716
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
So Alex

717
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,688
Actual real report

718
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,736
To the sources that he's point

719
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Contorts

720
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:14,112
There's one more reason to Discount pretty much everything about this interview being

721
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
Accidental admission of a grant

722
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,256
Evelyn Farkas resign former deputy at the

723
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:21,536
Secretary position in

724
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
September 2015

725
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,912
At least four months before the Republican National Convention

726
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Candidate

727
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,752
She wasn't even in any official capacity during the

728
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:32,288
2016 general election

729
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
She's just expressing

730
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,664
As someone who had experience

731
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,944
In the

732
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,064
Was

733
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
That's it

734
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,624
There's nothing here

735
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,904
Okay

736
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,928
So he's

737
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:51,744
Making knocking sound

738
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Sing that he's playing

739
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:59,424
And then later on big living

740
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,824
They did all the things that I do things

741
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,176
News-today baba baba baba

742
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,200
Isn't it

743
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
I don't

744
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,832
So here's the thing about the whole spying

745
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,600
Issue

746
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:18,880
For me

747
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,672
If they

748
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
A fire

749
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
Intelligence analyst

750
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
Keeping an eye on Russia's election

751
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:27,840
Then

752
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,424
You claimed that they were spying on you

753
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Right

754
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,288
Over here when you came into the picture

755
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
Not we were watching you and then Russia showed up

756
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,152
Right it's a it's a little bit like

757
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,712
If you got caught up in the spine

758
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,480
That wasn't

759
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,760
They didn't start with you

760
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Right

761
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,808
You're if you say that

762
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
You got spied on

763
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,648
We were

764
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:54,720
GTA

765
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:58,560
Yeah you're cute except

766
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,144
Looking at you right

767
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:08,800
He makes it a picture you know you could have accidentally or intentionally come into the

768
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,384
Circle of people that work

769
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Surveilled

770
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
Yeah that's my understanding

771
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,600
Let's races with that attracts entirely

772
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,392
So

773
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
And he's got some

774
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Insider info

775
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Information Jordan

776
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
He has sources

777
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,888
Okay

778
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Are they

779
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:41,312
People that we can't definitively say how its talk to in d.c.

780
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
This is crazy

781
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Alex

782
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
Doing

783
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,712
Throughout these two episodes

784
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
The 25th and 20th

785
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
Well here's a good news

786
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,904
People I talk to

787
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,256
Ginnifer Goodwin

788
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
Just don't say my name

789
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:16,896
Goldilocks and the Three Bears story

790
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,344
Write my name and the other one so it's all off-the-record

791
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:31,488
People said we don't give a fuk say whatever you want put our names on blast

792
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,792
What

793
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,400
I was just like

794
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,960
Alright well is Donald Trump

795
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:47,360
Really suspicious

796
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,920
I'm no snitch

797
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
What

798
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,272
What are you doing

799
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
Is lexcorp

800
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:00,160
Well

801
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
And the next clip

802
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
Kind of implies who they are and I thought about trying to figure out who he was trying to suggest

803
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Just like I don't give a

804
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,192
None of this is real

805
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:19,360
One person is a close friend of the president and talk to him routinely Hollywood that

806
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,760
So I thought

807
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,600
Well I thought Rodger Stoner Jerome corsi the first one

808
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
What is a friend of trump

809
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:34,720
And that made me think like well course he just sued Alex

810
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,512
Probably not

811
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:39,584
I'm in Rodger I don't know where he is in the game

812
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,608
Anymore

813
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:41,632
So I don't know it doesn't

814
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:42,656
I could be

815
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:49,056
It could be Max Keiser

816
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,872
Trump

817
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,919
I think he's trying to imply it

818
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Stephen Miller

819
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Somebody who make

820
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
I think it's I think he's trying to

821
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,439
Stephen Miller

822
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,399
Stephen Miller

823
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:18,495
Specifically on the

824
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
Memo

825
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
Dealing with

826
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
The Briefing he got

827
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:33,855
Beforehand

828
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,415
What's one of the Fall

829
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
Russiagate

830
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,327
Who was involved

831
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,143
Europe for the CIA

832
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,959
And the clintons knew that you work for them

833
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,847
Baba's

834
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:01,247
You see Mallory Clinton saying I'm sick of these Crooks

835
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:04,831
Got all the Intel now he actually knows how they sold us out

836
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:08,159
Keisha Scott like total proof

837
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:15,839
For the Deep state

838
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,911
I don't know I don't know if those are specifics Alex

839
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Edibles are vagaries

840
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,335
It does feel that way

841
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,063
I'm telling me over and over and over again that this lies

842
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:41,183
And did you get like the sense of what is a big news

843
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,767
Lock her up

844
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
I mean it's

845
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:51,423
Election season is heating up of course you got to bring this narrative back it works so well last time

846
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,311
Yeah wasn't that works real well

847
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
Of course

848
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,895
Corsica Walker web season

849
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:07,039
Do you think they're going to try know they're going to try it in terms of the

850
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,855
We're going to

851
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:16,255
To do something

852
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,303
You know

853
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:23,167
That would be Alex if they do

854
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,215
Katie-bar-the-door because

855
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,239
That's trouble

856
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:32,639
That's when we know that like we have crossed the Rubicon

857
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:39,807
This is this is much worse than it was

858
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,599
It would be if one of Trump's

859
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:44,159
Major re-election platforms was

860
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,719
We're finally going to put Hillary in prison

861
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:48,255
Of course

862
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,815
I think you'll do that

863
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
Third-born evergreens

864
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
Some people are always going to want to put Hillary in jail

865
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,087
Got to do

866
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,927
Alex

867
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,463
Pastor reiterate

868
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,559
Permission to save

869
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
Tell you what

870
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,639
But just to give the little breadcrumbs

871
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
Crumbs

872
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
Specific qanon

873
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:43,551
The idea of the little clues that you leave

874
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
Those are breadcrumbs

875
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,207
Using that terminology

876
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,255
I don't think that's an accident

877
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,279
OSHA

878
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:59,679
Because that's also a huge part of the world

879
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
Pretty much anyone

880
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
Close to supporting

881
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:11,455
Trump is also kind of into the idea of Jalen political enemies

882
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
Mostly

883
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,039
Yeah

884
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,647
People Are People

885
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,975
Breadcrumbs

886
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:24,767
The clues about who these people are

887
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,303
One of those drums

888
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,375
Someone was caught up in the Russia investigation on fairly

889
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:31,935
Alex

890
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,239
So

891
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,775
Here's the

892
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
Alex even knows this

893
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,335
Difficult to happen

894
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
And so he couches

895
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:42,175
His reporting on it very carefully

896
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:49,599
But now it's coming to a head

897
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:05,727
Hillary shot her mouth off other things

898
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:14,687
Mobile

899
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,223
So

900
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,807
Do you here in there I mean there's The Sensational end

901
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:20,831
To dive,

902
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,559
That just being like what

903
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,863
Habit

904
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,471
You know uses this as a rallying cry to get the dumb dumb

905
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
Yeah I'm bored for this election cycle

906
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:42,079
Then what happened

907
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,359
This is my new your noses

908
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,919
Of course

909
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
It never see

910
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:52,063
Cease to amaze me whenever I stop by

911
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
What's going on

912
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
One political party

913
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:56,927
Is

914
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,463
Centered around

915
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Lunatic

916
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,071
Legitimately wants

917
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:03,839
To lock up his

918
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
Political opponents

919
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,751
Wants to create

920
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:15,871
A Grassroots movement

921
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:19,455
Right and the other party

922
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
Knowing full well

923
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:24,319
Barry leader has committed crime

924
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
Is

925
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,743
Constantly saying well we shouldn't even get rid of him as president

926
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,023
For political reasons

927
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,607
It's weird

928
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,887
A lot of times

929
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
Glaring

930
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,823
It's so bright

931
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,615
You really feel

932
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,383
Despondent

933
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,503
Feeling to have especially as we enter now

934
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:57,599
Where I think I want you earlier maybe before the episode that

935
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:59,391
Bad

936
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,671
Here's where

937
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
Real bad

938
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:06,303
What is this next one

939
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,119
There's a part of me that actually is glad that Alex's

940
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:09,887
Is this over

941
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
Because it's so overt

942
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:23,455
I'll because he's over it leaves very little room for him to be able to defend

943
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,039
Next clip here from the 25th

944
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:27,807
Is where it's at

945
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,391
Islamophobic

946
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,999
Muslims

947
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,351
It's quarters from Muhammad

948
00:49:40,607 --> 00:49:41,119
What

949
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,543
The magic number 10%

950
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:57,759
What

951
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,999
Porsche

952
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,911
Christians are

953
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,287
The country out of their neighborhoods and then they'll move on to the next

954
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:24,127
Operation works

955
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:33,087
Is a rationalization for ethnic cleansing

956
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
Simple

957
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,695
Alex isn't talking about radical terrorist who happened

958
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,463
To be Muslim

959
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
I want to talk about demographic race as a whole

960
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:47,679
He's talking about every single Muslim in every country is being part of a growing problem

961
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,471
Affiliated with

962
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
The terrorist groups

963
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:56,127
Simply by virtue of existing within that part of the groin

964
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
Yeah consider the implication

965
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,199
Sins of what he saying

966
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,343
He's saying he wants Muslims make up 10% of a country's population they're commanded by Muhammad to start bombing

967
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:12,511
If you believe that then the solution to the problem is to keep Muslim populations below 10% of any geograph

968
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
How are you

969
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,375
I guess one option would be forced deportation

970
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,703
Displaced people and make sure there's never enough of them somewhere

971
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,471
To scare you

972
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:26,079
Of course the USD 1.3 million Mexican-American tonight

973
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:29,919
4 with a very racist lady named Operation wet.

974
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,735
The consequences of that action

975
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:33,759
What American city

976
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,039
Listen to Mexican heritage

977
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,063
Forcibly displaced

978
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,879
And unfamiliar parts of Mexico where they knew no one

979
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:40,415
Generational wealth

980
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,463
Completely disrupted

981
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,511
As were the families themselves

982
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
This is Addie

983
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,303
Deep state

984
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
History of the

985
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:49,631
65 years

986
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Does not work

987
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,191
And the effect it has on people

988
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,495
Communities is equivalent to Terror

989
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,103
If history shows us that he's forced deportations based on religion or ethnicity

990
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,271
Make sure that the Muslim population of an area never

991
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
So you never have to

992
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,575
To deal with you no kidding

993
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,855
Down below

994
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
You need to enact ethnic or religious

995
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Reading limite

996
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,631
Which seems like something Alex would be super against you spent most

997
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,423
List of his career yelling about the horrors of

998
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,703
China's one child

999
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:30,591
This is necessarily imply the need to set up a hierarchical system where US citizens were Muslim

1000
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:35,199
Human rights only so far as the non-muslim government officials allowed them to

1001
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
He advocated for the

1002
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,551
Totalitarian nightmare

1003
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:47,743
Acquire a ridiculously powerful centralized government in order to be put in place

1004
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,279
Ultimately

1005
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:55,167
If a problem you think exists in the world is that there's too many Muslims and once there's a certain number of them they kill everyone

1006
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:57,215
Did you are soft

1007
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,799
This 10% number he's rattling on about is arbitrary

1008
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,591
It's just the focus of his bigotry

1009
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:04,127
But if you was Alyssa

1010
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
Accept the premise

1011
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,431
10% is

1012
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
This magic number where trouble starts

1013
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,551
How easy is it going to be for Alex to turn around and say

1014
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,087
I had it wrong that number Zacks

1015
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:13,855
7%

1016
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
Once you accept the logic of any number that number can change to

1017
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,231
To suit a propagandist

1018
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,303
Swim and no percentages ever going to be low enough

1019
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,631
For someone like Alex a number of Muslims

1020
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
This is

1021
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,191
Really

1022
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
F***** up

1023
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
I can't say enough

1024
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
This is

1025
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,103
This is

1026
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
The introductory

1027
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:38,943
Step towards rhetoric justifying

1028
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,991
And advocating for ethnic cleansing

1029
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,087
This is this is the sort of language that really really

1030
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Gets people hurt

1031
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,695
We're well past

1032
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,815
Here Alex things like that

1033
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,095
One of them things

1034
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:57,375
It's just awful

1035
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,399
Obviously

1036
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Cleaned of West

1037
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,543
Surprising

1038
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
He follows it up I think

1039
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
Things like this

1040
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:14,527
Call to prayer

1041
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,159
Christianity

1042
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,095
Who are these people

1043
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:34,751
He did it because of the guy they were chosen because the threat he seemed to think they pose to the white race

1044
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,823
Has blown up a year

1045
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,479
Banda burn down in France

1046
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,783
And there's almost no coverage

1047
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,855
Alex is basically defending and just

1048
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,391
Define motivation

1049
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
Of the Christ

1050
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,487
I think

1051
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:57,279
I think what I would like

1052
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,583
Because we know with Alex

1053
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
We know what his goal is

1054
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,935
We know what that the goal is basically to make a lot of money

1055
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:07,519
General

1056
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,847
But four is lisp

1057
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:15,967
What are the what are there

1058
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
Working for

1059
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,527
What are they

1060
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,295
Are there

1061
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,343
Leaving and do they know

1062
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,159
If and if they do know what that is

1063
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,439
Are they trying to act

1064
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Do that or they just

1065
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
And off

1066
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,095
I think it's over and over again

1067
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
All of these

1068
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:33,887
Situation

1069
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:36,703
Where the people on the ground probably just

1070
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,727
Just want to live

1071
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
A good life

1072
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,079
They want to live a stable life where their values are

1073
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:47,455
Are accept Community where they

1074
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
They can live

1075
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:51,295
Reasonably healthy

1076
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,343
And Bobby

1077
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,111
Employee

1078
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,671
Some capacity that they feel gratified by

1079
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
But

1080
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,999
There are people like Alex

1081
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
And their people you know propagandist

1082
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,375
Of all of all varieties

1083
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,423
That's a create scapegoat

1084
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
And they're very very

1085
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
Howling

1086
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
Powerful

1087
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,591
To exploit

1088
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
People like Alex

1089
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,991
People like I mean historically there been hundreds of him

1090
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,783
Yeah and what they do is they

1091
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
Create this

1092
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:24,575
Perception

1093
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:28,415
XYZ group is the reason why you can enjoy your life

1094
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:30,975
The way that you feel like you should

1095
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:32,767
Whether or not

1096
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,095
Obviously

1097
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:37,887
Very real reason

1098
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Are able to live

1099
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:42,239
Comfortably in Happily as they would like

1100
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Albert

1101
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
Distracting from that by scapegoating

1102
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:45,823
Some population

1103
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
Is way easier

1104
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:52,479
So you get people to jump on board with your scapegoat

1105
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:53,247
If

1106
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,575
If we can just deal with that issue will have what we want

1107
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,623
We will have that thing that we

1108
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:01,183
That's the motivation of a lot of people who buy

1109
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,255
Yeah they're conscious of it or not

1110
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,327
Very quickly transmutes

1111
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,095
Into like

1112
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,887
Outright hate

1113
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
Is Bassnectar

1114
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:14,495
I was I was

1115
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,079
Concept of the brain virus

1116
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,615
We talked about over and over

1117
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:20,895
And how this is

1118
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
This is an act

1119
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:22,943
Disease

1120
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,223
Like you were saying most

1121
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,503
People really just want

1122
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:32,671
Outright

1123
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
It's not unique to one place

1124
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,943
How do we treat regular like like

1125
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,551
Because we don't we don't know what the Cure is

1126
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,999
Take vaccines for actual disease

1127
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,535
How could we ever

1128
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Convincing

1129
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,095
People to train them on

1130
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
Finding in

1131
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Discovery

1132
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
Like

1133
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:18,239
Huge thing

1134
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,567
Still on the 25th

1135
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
Alex

1136
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,455
A little bit earlier talking about Charlottesville and how everyone's actors

1137
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
Whatever

1138
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:32,063
They're all probably

1139
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,135
I think what he's doing is

1140
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,695
I think you could barely call it

1141
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,487
Wholesale revision

1142
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:44,095
Joe Biden launches his campaign on the LIE

1143
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,679
Nazis were very fine people

1144
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
Charlottsville

1145
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,847
Now

1146
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,383
Office

1147
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,223
And a suit

1148
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,295
Shelf

1149
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:14,047
That the Democrats killed the woman

1150
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,631
That a heart attack

1151
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,751
The white supremacist

1152
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:23,775
Journalist

1153
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,479
How do I

1154
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,807
So the first thing I want to say is that like Alex complains

1155
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
Katana by Joe Biden announce

1156
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:39,903
Charlottesville

1157
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,951
And

1158
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:47,327
Caribbean life is great too

1159
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
F*** off

1160
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,471
I'm so Alex also though I think probably more importantly for our purposes

1161
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,519
You completely misrepresenting what he's being

1162
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,799
I'm sued for about Charlotte's

1163
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
Fli

1164
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,431
Alex isn't being sued by George Soros

1165
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,479
Shadowy globalist

1166
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Conspiracy

1167
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,063
Being sued for saying the Democrats killed

1168
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,439
He's being sued by one person whose name he knows better than to ever say on Aragon

1169
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
Because that person has been

1170
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,279
Very consistent public

1171
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,071
He's never going to settle this lawsuit

1172
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,655
Brandon Gilmore

1173
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,447
Call

1174
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,263
Including allegedly his own dachshund

1175
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:30,847
As well as

1176
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
Late March

1177
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:34,175
2019

1178
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,063
US District Judge Norman Moon ruled that Alex's Publications

1179
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,367
As well as those of a number of other defendant

1180
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:45,695
Were the cause of Brenda Gilmore's alleged injuries

1181
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:49,279
And as such a First Amendment defense is inappropriate

1182
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,839
Is only late

1183
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,631
Ever feel safe standard

1184
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Put simply

1185
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,935
This lawsuit could

1186
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,727
Big trouble for Alex

1187
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:00,799
If the judge is already made clear that first amendment

1188
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,383
Complaints aren't relevant

1189
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:06,175
Well until appeal

1190
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,967
Perhaps

1191
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,807
But he doesn't really have much of a ground for defense

1192
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
It would take up the case

1193
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,671
Because they

1194
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:25,375
Certainly be like

1195
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,423
And stuff like that

1196
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,495
Realize at the court already

1197
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:36,383
What precipitated that harassment is things that you and these other co-defendants published

1198
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,199
So that argument doesn't work either

1199
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
So

1200
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,759
I just I just remembered

1201
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:45,599
I ate it sounded it sounds so Bernal coming out of my

1202
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
Mouth cuz it

1203
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,183
So it's something that we've just normalize but

1204
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,743
There are appeals courts that are

1205
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
Completely

1206
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
Sprint that other appeal

1207
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,655
Depends on the judges.

1208
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:04,031
If you can open to interpretation

1209
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:07,103
Established law presidents

1210
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:09,407
Things like that I mean

1211
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,431
In

1212
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
Ideology

1213
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,855
From appeals court

1214
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,391
To go to the seventh Court of Appeals

1215
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:21,439
Because it's going to give us a ruling that

1216
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Isla

1217
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,047
But I don't oppose to the 9th Court of Appeals which we know is

1218
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:26,815
Is going to give us

1219
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:31,167
Different rules you don't get really too

1220
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,983
Choose though because they're over different

1221
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Like District

1222
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:39,871
In the United States it's not like if you appeal

1223
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,175
Or whatever

1224
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Do though

1225
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,223
Is that they find different

1226
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,247
Ways to

1227
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:47,295
2 Berry Court that's going

1228
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:54,463
Favorable to that there are differences but I think it's probably

1229
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Slightly less

1230
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:00,607
I think I think that the idea that the ninth circuit is

1231
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
Some sort of a

1232
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:05,215
Liberal Bugaboo to conservative politics

1233
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,495
Is probably

1234
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,031
Conservative talk

1235
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,615
I think the other ones that are

1236
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
The liberal

1237
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:15,967
Sure and I pipe

1238
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,247
Much less than

1239
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,343
I think most of it probably airs towards

1240
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
I'm going to put heavy scared

1241
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,791
Jordan

1242
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:34,399
On the day of the United right rally in Charlottesville Infowars headed very serious

1243
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,167
This problem on there

1244
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,799
Alex could and would be totally fine defending

1245
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
People who were protest

1246
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:44,895
Protect the statue of Robert that's old hat

1247
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:51,807
What's a little bit more of a difficult to pull off a large group of

1248
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
Yelling Jews will not replace us

1249
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
A blood and soil

1250
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:59,487
One of the things that's important to remember about this rally is spelled out in its name

1251
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,815
About protecting the statue

1252
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:03,839
Preserving history

1253
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,887
But it's probably worth mentioning

1254
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,679
In May 27th

1255
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,751
Richard Spencer letter rally for the same purpose

1256
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
In July 2017

1257
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,847
KKK held a rally against

1258
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,871
The statue's removal

1259
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,919
Will there

1260
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,223
70 the unite the right rally was held at the

1261
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:20,991
The same

1262
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,039
A place for the same alleged purpose

1263
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,831
Involving both members of the

1264
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
The clan and Richard

1265
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:30,207
It's not hard to see what was being united

1266
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
This confluent

1267
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
Of things was a major problem

1268
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Alex

1269
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:39,935
His brain doesn't work so well when he's associating himself with literal Nazis and white supremacist

1270
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,007
Is it kind of makes his the last just cause everyone they dis

1271
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:45,823
Agree with Nazis argument Fall Apart

1272
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,615
Yeah if he's actually

1273
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,639
Just hanging out with

1274
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,431
Did like those Nazis are great

1275
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,711
But

1276
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
At the same time

1277
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,783
He can't not have a,

1278
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,111
Culture War battle that's unfolding in front of it

1279
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,903
Particularly one refills

1280
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
Confederacy is possibly under attack

1281
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,279
As we know his family literally fought for the Confederacy

1282
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,351
If he comes down squarely on the side

1283
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
You know that's kind of a dead-end for him

1284
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,239
Narrative

1285
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:17,055
Particularly after the protests turned violent

1286
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:22,175
Conversely there's no way in hell he's going to land on the side of the anti-fascist countertop

1287
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,967
A similarly note

1288
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:27,807
Is audience is going to let him sit this one out and say I don't know what's going on here

1289
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,623
Literally the only path available

1290
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,695
Guys at Charlottesville

1291
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
Three bad guys

1292
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,047
They were agents of the club

1293
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:46,495
At 1:42 p.m. James Fields Jr a legit Nazi from way back who was photographed at the rally proudly sporting

1294
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,519
Vanguard America

1295
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,591
Shield rammed his car into a group of counter demonstrators

1296
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,407
Injuring 19 people in killing Heather hair

1297
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,711
The evidence is overwhelming that this was

1298
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
Intentional attack

1299
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
And all the conspiracy theories

1300
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
Explain away his actions

1301
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,111
It's some kind of a victim in the whole thing

1302
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,135
Haven't thoroughly.

1303
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:05,695
I'm still life in prison

1304
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
Absolutely

1305
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,023
M-43 p.m.

1306
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,351
You had a rally that Alex can be there support nor condemn

1307
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
It has led to a murder

1308
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,727
Position in the marketplace

1309
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,311
He needs to find an angle to make this whole thing's bake

1310
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
Needs to find that

1311
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,639
What do you landed on

1312
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,687
To discredit the person who shot

1313
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,967
Footage of fields Cara

1314
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
Who was Brennan

1315
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,807
Alex's crack team of researchers

1316
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,415
The same ones that just generally report as fact whatever bulshit they find out 4chan

1317
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:38,975
Dug up the fact that Gilmore and previously worked at

1318
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
The state

1319
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,023
In the u.s. for insta

1320
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,815
This was all it took

1321
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,631
To create the narrative operation

1322
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
To make the Patriots

1323
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,495
Adding to the conspiracy was the fact that Gilmore worked

1324
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,591
A yellow campaign

1325
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,895
And the fact that Gilmore workroom was proof

1326
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
But something was up

1327
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,991
Corsair yellow hadn't held an elected position

1328
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:04,319
2011 when he handed a two-year run in the House of Representatives

1329
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
The 2017

1330
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Democratic

1331
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Primary

1332
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,695
I would use these pieces of evidence

1333
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:10,719
Spend the conspiracy

1334
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:12,511
The Brennan Gilmore with evidence

1335
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
State Department

1336
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,327
Was active in baking the events of Charlottesville

1337
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,143
The accusations are wide-ranging

1338
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
Come back to Alex

1339
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,959
Associate

1340
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:24,799
The Gilmore was a Soros operative and had something to do with the chaos

1341
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,567
But the rally

1342
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,615
Obviously these accusations are true

1343
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,151
So Gilmore stewing hour

1344
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
It looks like there's a pretty piece

1345
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
Decent shot of casework now

1346
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:36,063
I base that assessment on the fact that Alex in his lawyers and had to resort to

1347
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:36,831
Really we

1348
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,951
Like recently they tried to claim the gilmores a public figure

1349
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:46,303
So in order to prove defamation Gilmore's lawyers would need to establish malicious intent

1350
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,655
Gilmore's lawyers were pretty quick to point out that Gilmore is not a public figure and wasn't

1351
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,239
By lying about it spreading

1352
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,079
Is the reality of the Lost

1353
01:07:58,591 --> 01:07:59,103
That Alex is

1354
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Cities trying to

1355
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,151
Misrepresent

1356
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,175
Create

1357
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Talk about

1358
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:04,479
Because he knows better than

1359
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
To talk about it

1360
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
For real

1361
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
Cuz he does that

1362
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,831
Just make the lawsuits that might work

1363
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:13,183
No Alex Heather hair Vite of die from heart attack

1364
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,207
Is a legitimate

1365
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,999
An overt example of him using a

1366
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
A very traceable talking

1367
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,863
This is something that is only expressed on Nazi message

1368
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,887
Boards and Outlets

1369
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:24,703
Ability for

1370
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,471
James field

1371
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
This is a winking joke

1372
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,847
Speakers know the people who say they know that it is

1373
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:34,431
True but it's used to signal to each other that they approve of fashion

1374
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
Murder

1375
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
The talking point is based on a Mitsubishi

1376
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
Heather hairs mother made

1377
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,575
Two reporters in the immediate aftermath

1378
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,671
When she said Heather had a heart attack

1379
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
What you meant

1380
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,999
Expresses the doctors

1381
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,535
Told her that her daughter's heart it's

1382
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
Stopped at the speed

1383
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:57,727
This hair later clarified

1384
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:01,055
When Miss Harris gave her initials

1385
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,335
Express uncertainty

1386
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,639
It was said that you was waiting on the America

1387
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,455
When that report came out

1388
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
Clear that Heather died from blunt

1389
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,551
The only people

1390
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
Who would come anywhere close to suggest

1391
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,927
Heather died from a heart attack particularly in 2009

1392
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,463
Are doing so

1393
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,511
Two very specifically signal

1394
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:23,071
Do white supremacists and Nazis that they are on their side

1395
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,095
That is

1396
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Code

1397
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,143
And Alex is using it

1398
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,727
Now I also accept the possibility that Alex's

1399
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,519
I take it there's a chance

1400
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
Researchers

1401
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,383
Yeah I have you quotes

1402
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,175
Are using this code

1403
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,455
And Alex doesn't know that

1404
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:42,015
Cuz Alex doesn't do any preparation

1405
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:42,783
Right

1406
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,343
I think that there is a possibility that he

1407
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,647
Is unknowingly

1408
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
Speaking white supremacist

1409
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,719
Sister Nazi code

1410
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,487
Bonaire

1411
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:56,351
McKay's then the people who were doing his work for him are intentionally

1412
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,143
So

1413
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
That there's no good way

1414
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
For that

1415
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,495
No

1416
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
No I did not

1417
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
I did not even

1418
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
I just assumed

1419
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Run-of-the-mill can

1420
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,919
Conspiracy theory that

1421
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Everybody does

1422
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,479
But yeah why would anybody

1423
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:13,759
Just otherwise unless they

1424
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Make sure Nazis

1425
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:20,415
And

1426
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
It's become almost

1427
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
Is important

1428
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
What's

1429
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:27,327
Transmitted when it's

1430
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,399
Not to the question of police ordering a

1431
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
Handling Proto

1432
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,727
Metallic seems to think

1433
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,007
Is all he said

1434
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,311
That's all my coverage

1435
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,127
Are you saying that they cancelled these protesters

1436
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:40,895
Counter protest

1437
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,735
This is a little bit more of an open question that I actually wish

1438
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
It was

1439
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,551
It's one bums me out a little

1440
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,343
There are valid criticisms of the

1441
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:52,671
The police department close to what Alex is claiming

1442
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,951
But the context

1443
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
Distance around again

1444
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
Information on the way Alex

1445
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,023
Presence is narratives

1446
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,047
Make it so

1447
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,095
Pretty much Albertson still pretty much

1448
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:05,983
The police chief in Charlottesville as well as the city spokesperson

1449
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,055
Explicitly said that there was no Stand Down order put out that day

1450
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
ACLU speerise

1451
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,407
The police were hanging back and waiting for violence

1452
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,175
Breakouts

1453
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,015
Clear the area knowing that violence was an avid

1454
01:11:18,783 --> 01:11:19,551
That's

1455
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,367
Seems fairly plausible but also hasn't been proven

1456
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,463
An actual stand-down strategy

1457
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:27,743
Anything like that

1458
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:30,047
Employing it just seems like

1459
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,327
Seems to match with what

1460
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:33,119
Weather

1461
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:33,887
Is still in

1462
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,679
Is not based on evidence

1463
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,775
You have to you have to prove what would almost certainly

1464
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,543
Only be

1465
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
Something that was

1466
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,871
Generally agreed-upon

1467
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,735
Is it in action in like Following the Leader I guess

1468
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,743
Since they found for it comes from yournewswire and

1469
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:01,279
Uncensored

1470
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,071
To completely full of shake

1471
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:09,215
The two sites feature a quote from an alleged Charlottesville police officer

1472
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,263
Surprise

1473
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:14,079
We were ordered to bring the Rival groups together

1474
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,407
As soon as they were in contact with each other we were told to stand down

1475
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
It was outrageous

1476
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,759
We weren't allowed to arrest anyone without asking the mayor first

1477
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,831
We weren't even allowed to stop the driver if he sped away

1478
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,391
The event was being set up as far back as at least

1479
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:29,183
And it went like clockwork

1480
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,303
We want to do our job and keep the peace but these m************ in charge really want to destroy America

1481
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
First thing

1482
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,143
Hell of a fake quote

1483
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,543
Implants at least May

1484
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:51,199
Rally was so it's sort of time all the Rally's that happened to Charlie together

1485
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,479
As part of the globalist plan

1486
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
You know you know if you've read it

1487
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,551
If you read enough news

1488
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
To feel for when somebody

1489
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,391
Gives

1490
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,415
Too good a quote

1491
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,207
He has a real good one

1492
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:07,839
But it's also

1493
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,215
That's the same story that all of the

1494
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:14,239
Made-up quotes

1495
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,311
WhatsApp app

1496
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:21,919
Didn't get any coverage but all those websites

1497
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,503
And you were saying it's a really good quote but there's one piece of it

1498
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,087
You probably don't understand

1499
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:29,855
The quote

1500
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,415
What are the reasons

1501
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,439
You can tell

1502
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,463
Is obviously a fake

1503
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:39,327
Is because he said that they weren't allowed to arrest anyone without asking

1504
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
Singer Mayer

1505
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,679
This is a misunderstanding of how the city of Charlottesville

1506
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
Structure

1507
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,495
Any cop with any information

1508
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:48,031
In about the department of operation

1509
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
What absolutely not make that

1510
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,591
Mistake

1511
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
Charlottesville operate

1512
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
Under a city

1513
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,991
Manager form of government where the air is not voted into office

1514
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:59,039
What is selected by elected

1515
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
Councilmember

1516
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,135
The position of Mayor is largely ceremonial in terms of

1517
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:07,487
The duties literally no authority over whether or not to arrest anyone at the protest

1518
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
This is a glaring

1519
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
Example

1520
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,119
Insider info

1521
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:15,935
Clearly disseminated to produce a false narrative

1522
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
If not to report

1523
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:20,031
The mayor is just like

1524
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
Presides over

1525
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,151
It's not inch over the police

1526
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,431
Right and in 19

1527
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
92

1528
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
Might as well

1529
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,599
I'm not that's not fair

1530
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,415
So you understand

1531
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:38,719
This sort of information

1532
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:42,047
Would know that

1533
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,327
Together quotes

1534
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:46,399
Obviously that's so obviously fake that it

1535
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,959
And the thing is

1536
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,799
That fake Anonymous cops bulshit story doesn't match any other document

1537
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
Reality

1538
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:56,895
But it does closely match up with Alex's spin on the rally

1539
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:59,967
I have almost zero doubt that when Alex says the police

1540
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:02,271
Come out and admitted that there was a stand down

1541
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:04,575
Literally the only thing he's basing that on

1542
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:07,391
Is this bacon automatic

1543
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:09,951
Conspiracy sites that is interns frequent

1544
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Steelcon

1545
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,255
I'm pretty sure

1546
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Yeah that sounds right

1547
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:15,071
But now here's a little bit more

1548
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:21,215
In March 2018 a foia request public

1549
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:23,007
Dave before the Charlottesville rally

1550
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,591
In the memo there was discussion of how the permit for the rally

1551
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,359
Been granted with a

1552
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,151
Prediction of 400 people attending

1553
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,943
But intelligence

1554
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
That it would be way more

1555
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
People than that

1556
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,295
And that violence was a very likely

1557
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,879
Explicitly officership

1558
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:42,719
Keep close watch of crowd members were exhibiting Behavior

1559
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:48,095
Officer should make arrests when appropriate for unlawful Behavior interviews issued Fleck

1560
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
Text cops as

1561
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Restraints

1562
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,959
This plan was not followed through on

1563
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,287
Owing largely to shity communication and contradictory orders

1564
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,359
Seem to prioritize police officer safety

1565
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:00,383
The over civilian

1566
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:03,967
Police allocated Manpower and horrible fashion

1567
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,271
Heather seemed to be almost no coordination

1568
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:07,551
Responsibility

1569
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,343
Do the Charlottesville Police Department

1570
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,879
A Virginia State Police

1571
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,415
Who serve basically at parks

1572
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:14,207
Security as opposed to getting involved in

1573
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,487
The crowd control

1574
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
Which was desperately need

1575
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,071
There was no Stand Down order

1576
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,607
Terrible police

1577
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:21,631
Going on

1578
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
Police chief Al Thomas

1579
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,727
I was alleged to have said quote

1580
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:30,847
Let them fight it will make it easier to declared unlawful assembly as their rally was started tutor

1581
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,615
Ugly

1582
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,151
But even this doesn't constitute

1583
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,223
Also Thomas insist he didn't

1584
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,551
Say that his position was

1585
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Play doubt

1586
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,599
Either way

1587
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:47,231
Either way that helps position

1588
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
No I didn't want him to die

1589
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,095
I wanted people to see if he died

1590
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,655
Either way it's almost resigned in disgrace by the end of

1591
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,239
Good call an investigation done by us attorney Timothy

1592
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:03,103
Heafey found that the city was overconfident and their ability to deal with what was coming

1593
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,895
And because of that it's failed to

1594
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:07,455
Protect our community in Myriad ways

1595
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Stand Down order

1596
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:15,391
Like

1597
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
Anonymous

1598
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,695
Who is quoted in your news

1599
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:20,511
All the stuff is is

1600
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071
It's nonsense

1601
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
There is a more complicated reality

1602
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,959
Behind the lies about

1603
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:36,383
2 is like he's a little bit closer to reality than I like him to be on this

1604
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,175
Cuz it it would be nice

1605
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Just be able to

1606
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:47,135
The reality

1607
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,159
Most likely would

1608
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,951
And in their decisions

1609
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Season in their failures

1610
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,255
To manage

1611
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,791
The crowd appropriately

1612
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,839
They did end up

1613
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
Having

1614
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,655
Demonstrators

1615
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:05,311
And the people who are awful ended up in close proximity to each other which is a

1616
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:11,711
Upland appropriately and followed the plan as was stated in that

1617
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
7th

1618
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,271
Really

1619
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:18,367
Not have gone that poorly

1620
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,647
Probably

1621
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
Functional

1622
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:23,999
Probably

1623
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:25,279
You know

1624
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
There's a big difference

1625
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:28,095
There is a

1626
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
Supreme

1627
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,007
But

1628
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,287
He has other evidence

1629
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,311
Then

1630
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,335
This fake cop

1631
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,103
On your news

1632
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,735
Of all the things that could possibly happen

1633
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
Like

1634
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,295
I don't think I'm looking forward to

1635
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,367
To hearing about the Sandy Hook lawsuits as they progressed

1636
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,159
Probably

1637
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
Real

1638
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
Lucky you're not. Fun

1639
01:18:58,559 --> 01:18:59,583
Charlottesville

1640
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:05,215
Equally they are not equally maybe I don't know I don't want to put a scale on it it's also a traumatic

1641
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:10,335
But I do think there's potential for Alex

1642
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Really embarrassed

1643
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Open court

1644
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,943
If he follows through with this strategy

1645
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,735
F****** pray he died

1646
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,599
Collide together

1647
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
We supposed

1648
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,775
Would you be very powerful

1649
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:43,615
Google

1650
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:46,175
He is going to introduce

1651
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,199
F******

1652
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:53,599
Bogus ask Soros antifa contractor

1653
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
Spray that he chose that

1654
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,791
See how quickly

1655
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
Sir

1656
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,887
Mr. Jones

1657
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,983
Oh my God

1658
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,775
Mr. Jones

1659
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,543
This is stupid

1660
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
This is very

1661
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Second

1662
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
The evidence

1663
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,640
That you were providing

1664
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:18,176
Is related to something

1665
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,480
That has nothing to do with this situation

1666
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,088
Is a hook

1667
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:30,976
I think I begin

1668
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:35,328
Get your dog into court like could

1669
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:40,448
I mean not just because of introducing it but because I think obviously the court be like

1670
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,984
Nah

1671
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,544
His response to that I think would lead to it

1672
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:50,944
Contempt of court starts screaming about how this is a store Rose cover up

1673
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
Teacher bullhorn class in prison

1674
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,368
He does also seem like there's a part of me that thinks

1675
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
So he believes that those contracts are

1676
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,744
If you would go so far as to introduce them

1677
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:08,352
In court like I don't think you would pull that sort of the block if you knew that they were bulshit

1678
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,888
Yeah he

1679
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
YouTube

1680
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:12,192
Embarrassing chapter

1681
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,984
Like the Optics of him

1682
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,264
America

1683
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,592
Absurdly

1684
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,384
Trying to argue in court those are real

1685
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Holy

1686
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:27,552
That would be amazing Underoath where did you find wow this one guy

1687
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:33,440
His brothers stuff

1688
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:40,096
Yeah I know it sounds stupid

1689
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
Previously

1690
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,936
It feels better on a radio show

1691
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,472
Can say anything and nobody's like

1692
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:49,056
Deerfield

1693
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:52,128
Court thing on the radio

1694
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:58,784
When will be able to

1695
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
This one done

1696
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:02,624
Can I come up to Moby

1697
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:08,768
Can I come up

1698
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,888
Topix

1699
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,168
Talk about how Trump

1700
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
Has

1701
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
All of the best movie

1702
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:21,056
He has all the moves at his disposal

1703
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,104
Like he's playing poker with the globalist

1704
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
Yeah

1705
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,712
Listen carefully to this and see if you can

1706
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,760
See where my mind was like

1707
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:39,488
That's too many cards

1708
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:41,280
Couple 12 couple of

1709
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,304
Fors

1710
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:48,704
Are they playing

1711
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,296
Roblox Roblox Roblox

1712
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:08,416
Play Royal Flush he has them

1713
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,464
The Shiites

1714
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,048
I have three problems with that 40 second clip

1715
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,120
The first is that there are no one

1716
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,424
Alex

1717
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:25,568
There is no one if you ever one you have a f***** up that card someone's cheating

1718
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,336
Yeah

1719
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,896
Having a bunch of deck

1720
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,432
Also probably cheer

1721
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,712
Hundred

1722
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,736
Probably cheating

1723
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,784
No collusion

1724
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:36,832
No collusion

1725
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:37,856
Third

1726
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,648
Or Joker's Wild

1727
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:46,304
Because if so if you have a handful of jokers got a royal flush

1728
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,864
You got a handful of Joker

1729
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:53,216
If Jokers are wild this is Amissville

1730
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,288
Instructions

1731
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:02,688
What card is that what's going on

1732
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:05,760
Ohio having a 1 1/4

1733
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
Is it play it low

1734
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:07,808
Although

1735
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,600
What what occurs mean

1736
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,440
What is this what is this poker game where in one side only has a

1737
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,464
A few cards

1738
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,560
Honestly

1739
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:20,608
A couple of fours in a couple of Queens

1740
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,632
Not a bad habit

1741
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,984
Queen hacked

1742
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
Terrible

1743
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,848
Play No poker in my time to know that

1744
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,200
Also if I'm global

1745
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,248
And we're playing poker

1746
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,064
And I have a few cars

1747
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
My thought is going to be

1748
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:42,880
I don't want to play

1749
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,440
This game so I can play a different game

1750
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464
And you can have fun with

1751
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
With your car

1752
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:53,120
You got to know when to hold them when to fold them know when to walk away when to run

1753
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:59,264
Mister Rogers Neighborhood

1754
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,848
About what to do with cards

1755
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:10,016
Alex Express his fictionalized version of that Charlottesville lawsuit

1756
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,040
MLB keep the same

1757
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,344
Because we get another impression a new impression

1758
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:18,208
Yes the death is on your hands

1759
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
Obama

1760
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:20,768
Hillary

1761
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,072
Alexander Soros

1762
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,864
Not a Democrat

1763
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,888
Cameraman

1764
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,168
Who's work for Hillary

1765
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,240
Perfect

1766
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,600
Kill the woman

1767
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:03,520
The Suites

1768
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
Illegible

1769
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,592
It's Alex Jones

1770
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:10,432
He's the bad what every with questions things

1771
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:17,088
Impression of Ralph Northam I believe the governor of Virginia problem is like

1772
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,624
The time frame

1773
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,648
About is like

1774
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,976
Before he was

1775
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,536
Northam didn't get into office until 2018

1776
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
After

1777
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,168
I don't know what's going on there but I think what I want

1778
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:34,240
To point out here very important

1779
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,776
Alex's

1780
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:37,056
Re bringing up

1781
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:41,664
Use to kill babies

1782
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,272
Kind of rhetoric has been pushing late late last night

1783
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,552
Ever recording this

1784
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,832
Friday

1785
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:53,184
Or Saturday night Green Bay

1786
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:59,584
Instead of The Correspondents Dinner

1787
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,216
They're not allowed to after their Sailors got embarrassed last year they're very mean

1788
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:08,032
But at that

1789
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:11,872
By the way

1790
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:14,176
Is alphys

1791
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:20,576
Dubuque the Alpha's mate

1792
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
Do the snowflake dinner

1793
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:28,768
Green Bay to hold one of his

1794
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,840
Totally not authoritarian

1795
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,400
Rally's

1796
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:40,800
Trump talks about the idea that after babies are born

1797
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:44,384
Wrap up and then they the mother in the doctor decide whether or not to ask

1798
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:46,176
Executed yeah

1799
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:52,064
Mirroring Alex's rhetoric something

1800
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
Windows

1801
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:53,856
Narrative

1802
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:57,440
Which are Trail in Archer

1803
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,976
But do you see this

1804
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,072
Is going into over

1805
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,400
The ideas

1806
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,936
President Woods

1807
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:08,960
Push

1808
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:11,008
Infowars narratives

1809
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,312
Screaming crowd

1810
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,080
Of crazy

1811
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,896
Is there

1812
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:24,576
Academy Sports

1813
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,856
Didn't even need to be

1814
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,696
Needs to be used

1815
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,768
Need to be ratified get clearly we're not going to use it

1816
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:38,144
I mean for not now I don't I don't know I can't imagine

1817
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:39,168
Eddie just like

1818
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,496
Use a specific

1819
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:44,544
McPherson

1820
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
Person

1821
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
Jerry Lewis wins the next election as a Democrat it starts running around drunk with a lampshade

1822
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:01,696
Water is policy positions don't know anymore

1823
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:04,512
I can't

1824
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:09,120
If this isn't enough I can't imagine a scenario where it would be

1825
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,960
Even then

1826
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,104
You're too dumb that's 24

1827
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,384
Yeah

1828
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:27,296
Make a pretty robust argument just from like

1829
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,344
Whether or not

1830
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,880
Mental deterioration

1831
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:31,904
You know that's

1832
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:34,208
What you're doing is it

1833
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,584
0 dangerous people weather report

1834
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,888
The rights workers

1835
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:45,984
Who now have to worry about tons of people believe in that they're executing babies

1836
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:52,384
I bet it's Justified to shoot and bomb them as has been done in the past or whether it's

1837
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,152
Muslims

1838
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
Who have

1839
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:59,040
People who were emboldened by Trump like Alex coming out and expressing

1840
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:05,184
There can only be under 10% of the population Muslim or else

1841
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,000
Yeah I just

1842
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:11,840
You could make a pretty robust document the Trump being an office

1843
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
The danger to

1844
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
To the safety of

1845
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:15,168
A lot of people

1846
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:18,240
But of course if you tried to make those arguments Alex and his

1847
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,520
Propaganda cohorts

1848
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
Would be like

1849
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,872
Yeah he's a danger to the globalist

1850
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,432
And that's really what they're afraid of

1851
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
So give me we're just in a dead-end

1852
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,016
Yeah

1853
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:32,576
It's so disappointing

1854
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:33,344
Whenever you

1855
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,160
Like whenever you read Twitter saying we can't

1856
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:37,440
We can't get rid of

1857
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Natihei

1858
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,000
Is our algorithm

1859
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,048
Is it up with Republic

1860
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
Likes to bet guys

1861
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,864
Guys come on

1862
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,704
You didn't even work that right

1863
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
We can't get rid of this

1864
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
What republic

1865
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Yep

1866
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,592
So this is

1867
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:03,552
Was not super surprised by hearing Alex

1868
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:07,392
Talk about Charlottesville to where he was

1869
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,952
In line with

1870
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
This next

1871
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:11,744
Stretch

1872
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
Was crazy

1873
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,352
And that is that I think Alex

1874
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:19,680
Is trying to present the idea

1875
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:21,472
White supremacist

1876
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:23,264
That were at Charlottesville

1877
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,312
We're not only actors

1878
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:28,896
We're not only operative

1879
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,432
They were all gay

1880
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
What

1881
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:36,832
Did she look at all these men and look at their behavior and look at how they're acting

1882
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,880
This is the

1883
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:43,488
Acting Club Tennis is the drama club from surrounding universities and

1884
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:44,512
I mean

1885
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
It's

1886
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,656
Basically a giant dress up party with a bunch of gay men

1887
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:55,264
I dressed up as Nazis in their giant jussie Smollett the man

1888
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,664
Did you just

1889
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
I think I'm sick

1890
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:10,112
Wow so when I heard that I was like

1891
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:16,000
No it's all a bunch of dogs

1892
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:22,144
Wow so I thought that was it

1893
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:32,896
I was just so handsome today

1894
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,368
What

1895
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,824
Colleges

1896
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,360
And they dressed up

1897
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,920
As Nazis

1898
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:10,016
Let me just look at the footage

1899
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:17,184
This is not something I've heard him say the idea that it was a bunch of

1900
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:23,840
Your stuff is like

1901
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,888
Be alright I expected

1902
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,424
Riverview Alex

1903
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:28,192
He is

1904
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:32,800
Very insistent about the gay people

1905
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:37,664
Alien sister

1906
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,736
I think he muddled

1907
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:43,808
I'm not sure but let the forensic analysis

1908
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,368
Analysts were listening decide on that one

1909
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,648
A butler

1910
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:53,024
Nelly wadling

1911
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:58,912
What are we doing

1912
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:15,296
I don't know what we're

1913
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,856
What is still bad

1914
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:24,768
You still mad about these imaginary

1915
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:30,400
So he doesn't have to deal with the fact that there are a bunch of love

1916
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,936
Four Seasons

1917
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,240
Okay

1918
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:37,824
This is like him getting super mad about how much degrees of David Duke

1919
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
Crazy that is

1920
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,408
Okay

1921
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,480
Here's here's here's what we're going to do Alex

1922
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:45,760
We got a new angle

1923
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:48,064
This way you don't have to say that you love white supremacy

1924
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
Call him gay

1925
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,368
Done

1926
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:54,976
MoveOn next they're just actors

1927
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:57,536
What

1928
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:00,096
That's a lot of people who have been identified

1929
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,400
Rally

1930
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,288
And are not Democrats who were recruited from area colleges

1931
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:09,056
So this

1932
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:15,456
Well there were a few white supremacist Roomba

1933
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,600
Doing assertive disparagingly

1934
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,160
Everyone else thinks are stupid

1935
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:24,928
A butt

1936
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Much like

1937
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,744
Dos Toros

1938
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,512
T4 document

1939
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:30,304
I would love for him

1940
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:36,704
Jordan

1941
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:43,104
Here's the Not Guilty by reason of homophobia

1942
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:46,432
They are at all

1943
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,832
I guess the Staind

1944
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
I don't know

1945
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:54,368
I don't know

1946
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:56,160
One piece of evidence

1947
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,488
I think it's probably

1948
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:06,912
One piece of evidence that these are all

1949
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,216
This is evidence

1950
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:15,616
For them all being gay I think part of it is that they're wearing button-up shirts when they were holding tiki torches

1951
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:22,272
Looks like they were all in golf

1952
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:27,392
Do very much Alex play some video

1953
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,928
This is

1954
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:31,232
Listen to sort of definitive evidence

1955
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,256
But these are real.

1956
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:38,912
I'll just run around

1957
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:43,008
Oh yeah

1958
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,568
Slipknot everywhere

1959
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:51,456
If you're following this he's basically saying that the way they run is way too gay for them

1960
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:57,856
Alright alright where this line of thought

1961
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:07,584
Yep

1962
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:13,216
Looking forward to the Charlottesville tended to really happen

1963
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:20,640
Who was running

1964
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:31,392
They really miscalculated

1965
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,696
Funds by gentleman

1966
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:40,096
I'm needing to sell Prada

1967
01:37:40,352 --> 01:37:44,192
To fund his defense is still

1968
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,728
Kind of activity

1969
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:48,800
Like it's still sort of the Prelude to I need money

1970
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:53,664
The idea that these are all secretly local colleges

1971
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,712
Can program

1972
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,480
Listen up

1973
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:01,088
I got one question for you in this deposition and remind you you're under

1974
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:05,696
Are you an undercover Democratic operative

1975
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:06,464
Who's gay

1976
01:38:07,488 --> 01:38:09,792
Cyanide pill

1977
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,144
This isn't going to work out well.

1978
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,240
It is probably going to work out well with him getting some money

1979
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,520
From the people that

1980
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,544
He has left

1981
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,128
I need money

1982
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,200
I'm so excited about this

1983
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,504
Really on the wrong

1984
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,296
Able to V hell

1985
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:36,160
Please give me money knockout is 100% off

1986
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
If you know every

1987
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,744
Disappeared

1988
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:41,536
Tennessee death row

1989
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,424
He's operating

1990
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
As a

1991
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:51,776
Way to get Bryce to cover his bulge

1992
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:58,176
Later part of a lot more

1993
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,224
Come from

1994
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,784
Ayuda publica

1995
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:07,648
Stop go back to email like that sort of thing like you might be considering that is a

1996
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,488
Very likely outcome in the short amount of time

1997
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,792
But the good news is cast

1998
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:18,912
Since Alex is early days.

1999
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,192
Just doing the podcast

2000
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:23,520
It is if this show is any evidence

2001
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:32,224
Probably have to sell some boats maybe not be able to have all that great property

2002
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:34,016
About to The Standard

2003
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,040
You could get a one apartment

2004
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
Wouldn't that be fun

2005
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:41,952
Across the hall for

2006
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:46,816
Terrible I think the only few things would be worse than

2007
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,376
The neighbors I currently have to ask

2008
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:53,472
Knocked on your door is like my equipment gone down your mind

2009
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:56,288
All right now

2010
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:58,848
3 hours

2011
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:07,808
In this next Cliff Alex talks about this Democrats

2012
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,344
Pretending to be Nazis plan

2013
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,880
I want you to listen to this

2014
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:14,208
Think about how overly complicated this is

2015
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:17,024
As opposed to the idea that there are actual white supremacy

2016
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:17,792
Athanasius

2017
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,352
You're the Democrat plan is to

2018
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:21,632
Have left

2019
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,728
Step 10

2020
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,776
2

2021
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,312
Then

2022
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:32,640
Call Monty

2023
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,224
5

2024
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,016
And then claim a race horse

2025
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:47,488
From Soros group from

2026
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:50,816
No.

2027
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:53,888
Why they don't want us on air or you on here

2028
01:40:56,192 --> 01:41:00,032
Alright absolutely no pensarte real

2029
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,080
There is a thing where like

2030
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,616
I know in like

2031
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:07,200
TV and movies people be like I won't even dignify that with a response

2032
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,528
But in the real world

2033
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,552
Delta Airline

2034
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,624
Ever the Soros group

2035
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,160
I would say

2036
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,952
Not responding to this

2037
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:18,976
Good movies

2038
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:21,280
Goodman

2039
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
Yeah and then walk away

2040
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:28,192
I pointed out that to Alex

2041
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:32,288
Two of them had a little talk about

2042
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:41,504
But it's just Alex playing his interview with Max Keiser

2043
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:47,136
Play the interview

2044
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:49,440
I don't really care Alex missed out on

2045
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:51,744
50 million dollars a Bitcoin or whatever

2046
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,216
The only thing I really care about is this

2047
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,264
Clip from the interview with

2048
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Coronavirus

2049
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,056
Advocating

2050
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:40,384
The Democrats should just concede the 2020 election

2051
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,920
Look at all these Pro

2052
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,672
So when I was younger I was very against George W

2053
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,720
And

2054
01:42:54,976 --> 01:42:56,256
You know what

2055
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:58,304
Protest the Iraq War

2056
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,376
And I didn't like John Kerry but I was

2057
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,936
B a b Porta carry metalx

2058
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:09,312
At no point did I say George W bush should conceive

2059
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,616
Because that's f***** up that's crazy

2060
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,432
Cuz that's kind of similar to Alex's

2061
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:18,272
Cancel the election

2062
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:24,928
And stuff like that

2063
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:29,792
Who's going to win with like very normal countries have

2064
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:30,816
The only difference

2065
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:35,680
It's between him being like Obama's going to cancel the election

2066
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:39,520
Isn't his kind of being like a choice

2067
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,896
Understanding

2068
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,920
The same Obama

2069
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,968
To cancel the election by giving it up

2070
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,248
And Democrats

2071
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:51,040
To cancel this election

2072
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,088
Whatever the case

2073
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,672
That's really f***** up anti-democratic idea

2074
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:00,256
Here's the problem with the

2075
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,792
People change

2076
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:03,072
I don't like it

2077
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,352
So how about they just quit

2078
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:06,144
Ice bucket

2079
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:12,288
Alex gets back to talk about how he has both resources

2080
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:15,360
Tell you who they are

2081
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:23,808
Just amazing

2082
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:25,344
And I just give us until

2083
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,536
White Justice

2084
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,888
Why give me

2085
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,656
Aries

2086
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,568
You know the only thing that I could imagine is possible and I don't think

2087
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:48,640
The only explanation I can come up with

2088
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:51,200
Alex is trying to rope-a-dope the media

2089
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,224
Into saying like

2090
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:58,624
You don't have any f****** sources and then he pulls out

2091
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,416
What's happening

2092
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:06,816
He's playing it close to the vest if you will

2093
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:12,192
Only explanation that we as I secure and

2094
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:14,496
Think about like what could be going on

2095
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:20,896
That's the only thing that makes sense other than I'm making this s*** up

2096
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:22,176
Reveal information

2097
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,456
Besan people asking

2098
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,480
Question

2099
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:28,064
One way to play it is to just tell people who the person

2100
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:37,792
Especially when they've been given clearance by their sources and adds to the report

2101
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:41,888
Another possible strategy

2102
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Would be to

2103
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,472
Actual sources

2104
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
You can say my name

2105
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:49,568
Create a my name say my name

2106
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:54,944
Window lights on a radio show

2107
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:57,504
You can

2108
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,784
Information

2109
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:02,368
And then make a big deal out of how you're not going to say who the people are

2110
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,160
Knowing that everyone knows

2111
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:05,184
You lie all the time

2112
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:07,488
Covers

2113
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:08,512
Guys f****** make

2114
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,536
Shut up

2115
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:14,144
He's a big old liar it's just another example of it being a big old f****** liar with

2116
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,912
The thick neck

2117
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:18,752
What you can do is be like

2118
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:22,336
Mainstream media is getting a little better

2119
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,640
So

2120
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:31,040
Pull out your name of your realsource you get to be like the mainstream media

2121
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:34,112
Always

2122
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,648
Headed that way you can

2123
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:38,720
Sword of reclaim all the times you've been lying in the past

2124
01:46:39,232 --> 01:46:40,256
Feel like I could have done this

2125
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:44,608
Or something like that

2126
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,656
A propaganda coup out of it

2127
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:52,032
A potential strategy someone

2128
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:56,128
Could be employing like that someone falls into the Trap

2129
01:46:56,384 --> 01:47:01,760
Maybe like they're fake news they say I live their life

2130
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,320
The globalist plan with the Charlottesville

2131
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:05,856
Like

2132
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:09,440
Somebody conceivably could be that

2133
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:10,976
Weird

2134
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,816
But I doubt it

2135
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:20,448
Episode ended with interviewed Max

2136
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,496
Kaiser also spend

2137
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,776
Large portion

2138
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,312
Beginning of this episode

2139
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,336
Playing

2140
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,384
Andy's interview with Trump

2141
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,944
Fox News

2142
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,760
Alex plays autonomy

2143
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:35,552
And here it is Alex

2144
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:36,832
Setting up

2145
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,368
About to go to that

2146
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,696
The first

2147
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:44,256
To get to the Deep state

2148
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,816
The fact that

2149
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:49,888
They are pushing for

2150
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,568
But I know they have the evidence because I was there researching and watching it all

2151
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,664
We were the first show to say

2152
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:08,064
Up to this point have the evidence

2153
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,600
How's the Evelyn Farkas

2154
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,160
Larry's

2155
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,952
The loaded Bowl

2156
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:17,536
I know Alex brings up the

2157
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:20,352
Of things that we've covered on this show

2158
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,120
At our complete

2159
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:27,264
We then received drug enforcement

2160
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:34,176
Sure

2161
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,832
Whatever you got in the office are private numbers

2162
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,000
They got zero attention cuz

2163
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:48,768
It's b*******

2164
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:50,560
You didn't get it from the DEA you got it

2165
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:52,608
Dennis Montgomery by

2166
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,632
Through the hands

2167
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:58,496
Joe Arpaio

2168
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:08,224
You know who else Larry klayman who is now suing Alex

2169
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,272
So we're all that information

2170
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:13,088
10K from propaganda attempt

2171
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:15,392
By Dennis Montgomery

2172
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,952
Whistleblower who

2173
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:23,072
Jesus Christ if you want understand that go back to our episodes investigation

2174
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:35,104
Involves trying to intimidate a judge it's a mess

2175
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,968
Don Meredith

2176
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:41,504
So

2177
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,832
Do you have Larry C Johnson Evelyn Farkas nonsense

2178
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:51,488
Larry you got the the traffic

2179
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,768
1st and Alex's

2180
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:55,328
These as reinforcing that narrative

2181
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,608
He doesn't have anything

2182
01:49:57,120 --> 01:50:01,216
Trying to say that the globalist plan Charlottesville

2183
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:05,056
And I have the proof

2184
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:05,824
With Soros

2185
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,384
He doesn't have something real

2186
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,664
Start with this

2187
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:15,552
That's like if you are a stand-up and your opener is

2188
01:50:16,832 --> 01:50:17,856
I don't have faith

2189
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,904
Minute 3 is going to get good

2190
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:22,464
You don't open

2191
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,024
Which if you have something better

2192
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,584
Yeah and that's what Alex is doing

2193
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,352
Who's doing it

2194
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,400
A terrible set over and over and over

2195
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,984
So it is next April 26th

2196
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,288
Alex talks about how

2197
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,104
Covid-19

2198
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,480
Bstock

2199
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:49,344
And talked about the last time

2200
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,136
This is crazy

2201
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,416
And

2202
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,976
Because you're better than yourself

2203
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,512
Clash

2204
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,400
You just have to understand

2205
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:07,008
Because I know I know Alex will keep it up will be talking a lot more soon

2206
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:10,080
I don't care about the

2207
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,416
Go to certain people

2208
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,208
Certain people

2209
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,024
Miller

2210
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:32,352
That's why I wanted the people he

2211
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:36,192
Pretending you talked to my dad because he specifically

2212
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,240
Is implying Miller watches

2213
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:39,264
Show

2214
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:46,432
31

2215
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:50,784
Eva

2216
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,832
He's smarter than to think Alex knows any

2217
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:56,416
I could Feast even though I want to use Alec

2218
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:59,488
In some way but not respect

2219
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,280
You know yeah

2220
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,840
I think that he could see him as a useful idiot

2221
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:05,376
And maybe your fellow Traveler

2222
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
In there

2223
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:08,960
And white

2224
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:09,728
Ethnostate

2225
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,776
Creating but I can't imagine

2226
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:16,128
Like I would say Miller would here like

2227
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,664
Cicero's document to be like

2228
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:22,784
That sort of thing

2229
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
I don't know where we are with him

2230
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,672
You know I don't know I don't know

2231
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,952
I just texted anybody

2232
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:38,144
Anyone would believe Alex maybe I'm blinded by

2233
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:41,216
Is a person

2234
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:44,544
Thousands of people that are mother and Vegeta

2235
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,080
Together to decide whether or not

2236
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,104
KB

2237
01:52:47,872 --> 01:52:50,688
Everybody

2238
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
Yeah fair enough

2239
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,040
Really

2240
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:55,808
Really

2241
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:56,832
Shocked at The McNay

2242
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:57,856
A gesture

2243
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:00,672
Trump didn't need to call him

2244
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:02,720
Bright

2245
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,608
They would want that

2246
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:15,520
Call me anymore

2247
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:18,080
Your staff to watch a show

2248
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:24,480
Actually kind of feels like it might be a sincere feelings

2249
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,040
Need to talk to you as long as I can

2250
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:32,416
So

2251
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:37,024
Sort of Twitter was abuzz not too long ago about the idea that Alex

2252
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,304
Who's teaming up with qanon

2253
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:42,400
We heard earlier him bring up like I'm leaving

2254
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,424
Wendy's bread crumbs

2255
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,752
He sort of executive phrases that Harkins

2256
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,776
2 qanon

2257
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:53,920
Mistake

2258
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:54,688
Some people about

2259
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:57,504
And that was it Alex's not teaming up with Kayla.

2260
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,064
You can't because qanon

2261
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:05,184
Even if Alex warms up to qanon

2262
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:09,792
Do not specifically. I did not know that brings up in this

2263
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:25,920
Mama

2264
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:30,528
No one knows who qanon is it's a bunch of people on 4chan

2265
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:03,808
Yeah I mean it's a jumbled mess

2266
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:08,416
Qanon because I qanon doesn't like him

2267
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:11,744
So even if they can find common cause in terms of

2268
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,304
Benno putting forth the argument that there's a bunch of rest

2269
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:18,144
Coming Hillary is going to get locked up you know there is overlap

2270
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:18,912
To some of it

2271
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,704
But I would never

2272
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,336
Qanon to hate him and be on the same

2273
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:28,896
And there is the problem of course

2274
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:30,944
Where's Alex

2275
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:35,040
No Trump

2276
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,344
Who are you no one knows who you are

2277
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:39,904
And that bleeds into this next clip where you complain

2278
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:59,360
Who is

2279
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:07,296
So you can hear their Alex use the term breadcrumbs again that is a piece of

2280
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,088
It's so sad

2281
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:12,672
Just leave me alone let me go out there real person

2282
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,744
Just doesn't stop

2283
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:23,936
Whoever it is magical

2284
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,216
You're starting

2285
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:50,048
You know our names

2286
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:53,376
She was just a secret

2287
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,656
So

2288
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:00,288
There's a dangerous confluent

2289
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,848
Two of them

2290
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,920
Can be can be pretty bad I think the negative

2291
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,944
That effect

2292
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,504
But the possibility of the two

2293
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,272
Assertive

2294
01:57:10,528 --> 01:57:11,296
Audiences

2295
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:14,624
Merging in the idea of Alex ever being like

2296
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:15,648
Q is legit

2297
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,696
We got a f****** go on board

2298
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,000
It's never going to happen because of

2299
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,280
Ego

2300
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:22,560
It's just impossible

2301
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:24,608
Well it struck me that

2302
01:57:24,864 --> 01:57:26,400
It's been a long time since I've heard

2303
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:28,448
Such a long clip of Alex

2304
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Whining

2305
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,568
Well that might be because of eclipse I choose

2306
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:39,968
That's entirely because of the clips not afford them to me

2307
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:48,416
Quit the loser little tickets on their first and I saw the

2308
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:54,048
It's not it's not a good luck

2309
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:59,424
That's sad look for him because he's supposed to be like an alpha

2310
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,704
Forgot I was right about everything

2311
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:05,568
Is not pathetic

2312
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,104
And I think it's Alex

2313
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,920
You should just be doing FM radio

2314
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:15,808
We are

2315
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:19,392
Hollywood trash everywhere

2316
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:22,720
The dreaded

2317
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,840
And brother-in-arms

2318
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:31,168
Those against love freedom and Common Sense

2319
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,448
Alex Jones

2320
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,496
Guitar

2321
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,176
There's nothing

2322
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:54,976
I didn't have any large political Ambitions I am the scourge of perverts friend of

2323
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:58,560
Patriots I am Alex

2324
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:12,896
If those moments that are like

2325
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,968
You and far between

2326
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:17,760
I would say under

2327
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:20,064
What he does

2328
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:25,696
The rest of it doesn't come close to making up for it I love

2329
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:28,512
Cuz that's the kind of thing you don't hear on other sorts

2330
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:32,352
The shows like if you listen to Glenn Beck or Sean Hannity's radio show

2331
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:34,912
There's no moments where they have their humanity is like

2332
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:51,296
Honestly we can laugh all that moment

2333
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,088
But on some level it makes

2334
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:55,904
Look at makes the bad things

2335
01:59:57,184 --> 02:00:00,000
Because where is the humanity

2336
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,280
B b

2337
02:00:01,792 --> 02:00:02,304
Assertive

2338
02:00:02,560 --> 02:00:04,608
Shines through in moments like that

2339
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:06,912
I was like aesthetically liking music

2340
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:11,520
Individual personality that's allowed to

2341
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:14,848
Exist on the show then so many other political talk shows

2342
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:16,128
Which makes

2343
02:00:16,384 --> 02:00:17,408
Kind of feel like

2344
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,248
Muslims can't ever be over 10%

2345
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,272
The population

2346
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,808
It's coming from

2347
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,856
As opposed to it being like a

2348
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,136
Political talk show

2349
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:28,672
Which makes

2350
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,464
I think

2351
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:32,000
The humanity

2352
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,024
Yeah

2353
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:37,120
You think so I looked kind of why I like to step kind of why I like to play moments like that

2354
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:40,192
Electric it makes it worse

2355
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:44,032
You know like it this sounds very this sounds very gamergate

2356
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:45,056
Kind of

2357
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,104
Listen

2358
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:52,224
Go to the way he talks about that talks about The Highwaymen and and movies

2359
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,784
He's just got that kind of like

2360
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:58,880
Joy towards collecting something that is

2361
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
Under a

2362
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:02,720
And then

2363
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:05,024
That is part of that like fun

2364
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,072
Hardrace

2365
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:12,448
Or whatever

2366
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
You know

2367
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:20,384
Him being presented as a person

2368
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,968
Can be funny because of the

2369
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:26,784
Seismic shift

2370
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,344
Yeah but it also makes

2371
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,368
It worse because

2372
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:31,648
You're saying

2373
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:33,952
Yeah that's more

2374
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:39,584
Alex talked to whole bunch about how Trump is going to lock her up

2375
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,400
Whatever

2376
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:45,728
Who plays

2377
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:47,520
A ton of that

2378
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:51,360
Or at least of his show

2379
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,896
He plays at Hannity interview

2380
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:53,920
Anthony says this

2381
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,688
Switches

2382
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:10,560
I know that I can't prove this to you without playing the last hour of his show

2383
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:14,912
Just play

2384
02:02:15,424 --> 02:02:18,752
He did give you the benefit of the doubt

2385
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:24,384
Look out to commercial we laid it all out in the last hour

2386
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:28,736
You just played a softball propaganda interview with Trump

2387
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:31,040
Sitting down with Sean Hannity

2388
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:37,952
That's why maybe it's

2389
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:41,792
Flat a little bit in the room

2390
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,072
Time sorry

2391
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:45,120
Alex

2392
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,680
That's all

2393
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:51,008
Well alright

2394
02:02:51,264 --> 02:02:54,336
Play alt-rock playlist interview for Hannity

2395
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:55,104
The real Thief

2396
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:01,504
To talk about how Trump

2397
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,784
Is giving up

2398
02:03:03,040 --> 02:03:04,064
A lot in order

2399
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,088
To be president

2400
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,368
Like as businesses or suffer

2401
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:10,976
Sure miss clip

2402
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:12,512
Makes a pretty compelling case

2403
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,280
The trumpet

2404
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,304
Profiting off the press

2405
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:19,680
Justin

2406
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:24,544
You want to see

2407
02:03:25,056 --> 02:03:27,616
Liberals

2408
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:31,456
BuzzFeed

2409
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,760
Sneaking around in there

2410
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,208
Wild

2411
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:52,960
To do with that

2412
02:03:53,728 --> 02:03:55,264
Exactly my style

2413
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:59,104
Remodel house and I said yeah

2414
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:06,016
Wow

2415
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,344
My friends

2416
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,624
You certainly are

2417
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,392
That's

2418
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,184
Face out of

2419
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:14,976
Is but Sprite that's in

2420
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:17,536
Bootlicker

2421
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,328
211

2422
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:23,680
Approach

2423
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,704
Hotels

2424
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:27,264
Static is so good I'm going to make my house like it

2425
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:30,080
My wife said it's great Gavin Trump Hotel

2426
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,152
Pretty much

2427
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,456
Expresses the idea that this

2428
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:42,112
Bar in this hotel is become a hotspot

2429
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:46,720
Profiting off Amendment

2430
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:51,072
Nobody's doing that

2431
02:04:51,328 --> 02:04:52,608
Nobody's bothering with that

2432
02:04:55,424 --> 02:05:00,544
Nobody's bothering with just the regular doing crimes lot of like profiting off it like

2433
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:02,080
Alex is one of his

2434
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:03,104
Most ardent

2435
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:07,200
Supporters and he argues consistently the Trump doesn't profit up

2436
02:05:07,456 --> 02:05:07,968
Presidency

2437
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:13,088
Very clear argument that he is

2438
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,624
Absolutely

2439
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:16,928
Nope

2440
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,608
Isabel

2441
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:27,168
So in this next

2442
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,192
From the 20s

2443
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:38,432
Alex brocato for another 40 minutes

2444
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:42,016
From The Blaze

2445
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:47,648
So he was he was really fun in this one parallel to go into the office

2446
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:52,000
Parallel to the 2013 stuff that we're looking at

2447
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:55,072
Interesting

2448
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,352
Weird intersection

2449
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
Cincinnati

2450
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:58,656
At the end of this week

2451
02:05:58,912 --> 02:05:59,936
This Saturday the 25th

2452
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:02,752
26 Riyal into

2453
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:06,080
The idea of his intersections with other media figures

2454
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:09,920
Yeah so whether it's I talked to Max Keiser at the Trump Hotel

2455
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:12,480
Or I didn't interview with Eric Bolling

2456
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:18,624
Or you know Trump did this interview with Sean Hannity and he saying a lot of similar stuff to me

2457
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,440
There's the same thing with Alex being obsessed for a week

2458
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:24,000
Back in the past of he wet on Piers Morgan

2459
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:24,768
Pinchot

2460
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:29,120
So there's a little bit of a like a navel-gazing grind but Alex is in

2461
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:32,448
There's not a whole lot but on the 26b says this

2462
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:34,496
And this is like

2463
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:35,520
Again

2464
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:38,592
We talked about earlier

2465
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:40,128
So overtly awful

2466
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
Excusable

2467
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:50,368
Measles in frittatas

2468
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:53,952
Whooping cough but it doesn't matter

2469
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,256
Another shot

2470
02:06:56,512 --> 02:07:00,352
Are scams

2471
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,400
Are Trojan horses for other things

2472
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:07,264
Legal

2473
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:13,408
Water in high jeans

2474
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:21,600
Screen

2475
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:26,720
I will say an hour

2476
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:29,280
And that so long as we don't have immigrants

2477
02:07:29,536 --> 02:07:30,816
And we just starting out

2478
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,584
There will be no.

2479
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,656
I don't know up

2480
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,472
I want I want

2481
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:40,032
In fairness to Alex but I think opposite

2482
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:44,640
About Trump saying people should get there

2483
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:46,688
Internal

2484
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,968
Consistent with his

2485
02:07:50,016 --> 02:07:54,624
Liza

2486
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:55,392
Information

2487
02:07:55,648 --> 02:08:00,768
What is a Styler propaganda

2488
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:06,144
Claiming the immigrants and asylum-seekers are spreading disease and causing outbreaks is a time-tested way to

2489
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,680
Dehumanize a population

2490
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:10,752
To treat them like things with no right

2491
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:11,776
What means

2492
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,312
Comfortable

2493
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:16,384
We killing them because if you don't look at your community sick

2494
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,944
This is something that we've seen in history

2495
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:20,736
Never a good time

2496
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:21,504
Yeah

2497
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:24,064
Information

2498
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:29,952
Whooping cough immigrants coming

2499
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:34,048
Nazis and white nationalists online or spreading memes

2500
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:35,840
But any epidemiologist

2501
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:36,608
Research

2502
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:38,400
Easy will tell you very clearly

2503
02:08:38,656 --> 02:08:41,984
That these outbreaks are the result of people not getting their children vaccinated

2504
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:48,384
And I will tell you that they are getting their children vaccinated because they believe the b******* people like Alex Jones

2505
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:49,408
Donald Trump

2506
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,200
I've been telling them for years

2507
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:54,528
The substance being here doesn't even deserve to

2508
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:57,088
Discussion at McLendon

2509
02:08:57,344 --> 02:09:01,440
And it's not even the first epically Alex is made in this episode of our show

2510
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:05,792
This Frederick deserves condemnation denunciation remember

2511
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:10,656
The next time a white nationalist terrorist commits an act motivated by fears about immigration

2512
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:12,960
Rhetoric like this allows those fears

2513
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,240
Sofia feel real

2514
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
It's a fuel pressure

2515
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:18,848
And it allows the responsive murder to feel Justified

2516
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:22,176
Whether it's packaged as arguments that wants Muslim

2517
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:24,992
Make up 10% of the population.

2518
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:26,016
Or if it comes in

2519
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,296
The form of argument

2520
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:28,064
Refugees

2521
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,112
Central America or causing outbreaks

2522
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:34,464
No matter the particular shape it takes on any given day

2523
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,488
The message underneath

2524
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:36,512
Is the same

2525
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:39,072
People who are not like you are a threat to you

2526
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:42,400
And you're right. An unbalanced ethnic

2527
02:09:42,656 --> 02:09:43,168
6 Powerstroke

2528
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:45,472
It really bothers me it bums me out

2529
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:47,008
But when we here

2530
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:48,544
Like two different

2531
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:49,568
Pictures

2532
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:50,848
Two ethnic cleansing

2533
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:52,896
Within a two-day span on her show

2534
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,432
Two things that are

2535
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:56,224
Really

2536
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,016
Reminiscing

2537
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:58,784
Of

2538
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,832
Propaganda that gets

2539
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:01,856
People killed

2540
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:06,464
It it's really really hard for me to step back

2541
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:09,792
Maine

2542
02:10:10,816 --> 02:10:11,328
My position

2543
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:13,888
A coincidence

2544
02:10:14,144 --> 02:10:16,704
Then somehow he doesn't realize

2545
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:17,728
The sort of things

2546
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,896
I don't I don't know

2547
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,688
Veneer Falls away

2548
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:28,224
At a certain point

2549
02:10:30,272 --> 02:10:32,064
I like, I'm a huge fan

2550
02:10:33,600 --> 02:10:34,368
Of the first

2551
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,904
Just want to set get that out there

2552
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,232
Long-time lover first time

2553
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:43,328
Can you do

2554
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:49,728
Well I mean that might be why he's on

2555
02:10:49,984 --> 02:10:51,776
On the side of the line

2556
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:53,568
Is I take the probably you can

2557
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:57,152
I think that I think that probably is on the wrong side

2558
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:58,176
No free speech

2559
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,992
It's not on the wrong side of free speech

2560
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:03,040
That's their latest movies

2561
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,576
That are inspirational

2562
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:09,184
To see these sorts of things

2563
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,720
To make people feel like it's

2564
02:11:10,976 --> 02:11:12,000
The ticking time-bomb

2565
02:11:12,256 --> 02:11:15,584
Until there are enough Muslims around they will hurt

2566
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:20,448
Every one of these immigrants that's coming in

2567
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:22,496
Smallpox

2568
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:26,592
You know about the idea

2569
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,640
Estimated leading to three emerging

2570
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:30,432
Into things like polio

2571
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:32,992
Alex is rhetoric

2572
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:34,016
Person

2573
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:37,088
Who's coming here illegally is a potential

2574
02:11:37,344 --> 02:11:37,856
4

2575
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,392
Tocabe

2576
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:41,184
If you introduce these eyes

2577
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:43,232
I mean

2578
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,768
You know that there's

2579
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:47,328
Some percentage of them we were going to

2580
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:49,120
Rightfully interpret

2581
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:51,936
People existing is a

2582
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:53,984
I just don't

2583
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:56,800
There's

2584
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:58,080
There has to be a legal

2585
02:11:59,104 --> 02:12:00,896
There is a difference

2586
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:02,176
Justify

2587
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:05,248
Cleansing and calling 4S

2588
02:12:06,528 --> 02:12:07,296
I get that

2589
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:09,088
But it feels like you

2590
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:10,624
Have one without the other

2591
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:13,184
And if we were to get rid of the justifying pie

2592
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:14,976
We wouldn't have the calling for

2593
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:18,048
I don't know

2594
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:21,120
I'm not I'm not a

2595
02:12:21,888 --> 02:12:23,168
Choosing a lawyer

2596
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:30,592
So that makes me pretty mad

2597
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:32,896
Because like Ice-T a deterioration

2598
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:33,920
In the present day

2599
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,248
Sing like that

2600
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:39,296
ICA quickening

2601
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,880
Downward

2602
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,928
In terms of the Howard Danger

2603
02:12:46,976 --> 02:12:47,744
Whether it's

2604
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:54,400
Like when we talked about it I think was maybe a week or so ago when he was talking about the drag queen bingo

2605
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:57,472
Reading the drag queen story time

2606
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:06,432
Vampirism

2607
02:13:08,992 --> 02:13:13,600
And then an hour later he has a caller who says I think I should be able to go in

2608
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,392
Right

2609
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:16,928
Into the parking lot

2610
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,256
Island

2611
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:22,048
And subsequent episodes

2612
02:13:22,304 --> 02:13:23,584
He continues at the rhetoric

2613
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,608
That he was

2614
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:26,144
Think about that

2615
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:26,912
Storytime

2616
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:29,984
Stuff like that you just

2617
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,032
You recognize

2618
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,568
Like

2619
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:37,664
It's hard to phrase it any other way

2620
02:13:38,176 --> 02:13:41,504
No he doesn't care that a collar literally said

2621
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:43,552
I should be able to kill the

2622
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:44,320
These people

2623
02:13:45,088 --> 02:13:47,904
And it's reinforced by the rhetoric that

2624
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:48,928
Alex

2625
02:13:49,696 --> 02:13:52,000
Has died on the show and continues to

2626
02:13:53,536 --> 02:13:54,560
I don't I don't

2627
02:13:54,816 --> 02:13:55,840
I don't know what to do

2628
02:13:57,376 --> 02:13:57,888
I don't know

2629
02:13:58,656 --> 02:14:01,216
I mean turns varsha I just weekend we keep doing what we do

2630
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:02,496
Put like a

2631
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,520
I don't I don't

2632
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:04,544
I don't

2633
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:08,384
I become very uncomfortable with where this is like

2634
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,176
Legal

2635
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:11,968
This shouldn't be legal

2636
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:12,992
Mission be legal

2637
02:14:15,296 --> 02:14:16,320
Yeah

2638
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:17,856
I don't I don't know

2639
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:20,672
Where the line is still work

2640
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:29,888
Do not know how to end this episode at all I'm not feeling

2641
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:33,728
Optimistic

2642
02:14:33,984 --> 02:14:35,264
Into despair

2643
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:41,664
I think a lot of this stuff looks real bad and part of the reason why I feel a little bit more gloomy than usual

2644
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:46,272
Probably because the f****** neighbors keeping me up all weekend

2645
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:49,856
I think that there's a there's a possibility

2646
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:50,880
Moving forward posit

2647
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:53,184
Every time

2648
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:54,976
Listen to hours of Alex in Fresno

2649
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,512
It just

2650
02:14:56,768 --> 02:14:57,280
Man

2651
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:59,072
Man this show is bad

2652
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:00,864
This show is dangerous

2653
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:03,936
Like beneath the surface of the like

2654
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:07,776
CertiFit sensible political talk in like Trump is awesome

2655
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:09,568
Kind of stuff be soft

2656
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:11,872
Pictures to ethnic cleansing

2657
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:13,664
Being buried in there

2658
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:15,968
Are really really f******

2659
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:16,736
Troubling

2660
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:23,136
And I just I just don't know how to I don't know how to not take that as you're easily as it deserves to be

2661
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,232
I just don't know how to respond appropriately

2662
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:32,608
I've never thought about being in a position where like

2663
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:35,168
I see what is left

2664
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:36,704
To its own devices

2665
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:39,264
Could easily spiral into

2666
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:42,080
Alright Muslims aren't allowed to breathe

2667
02:15:42,336 --> 02:15:46,688
Yeah I don't know what to say to that other than go fuc yourself

2668
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:49,504
I just never I never

2669
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,552
Expected that I would be in a position where

2670
02:15:52,064 --> 02:15:52,832
Someone would be

2671
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:55,392
Expressing

2672
02:15:57,184 --> 02:15:58,976
Maybe I'll be better at it next time

2673
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:00,256
For now

2674
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:04,608
So I don't ramble more about how I don't know what to say about this

2675
02:16:05,632 --> 02:16:06,144
We got to watch

2696
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:31,136
Max Keiser offered Alex Jones

02:17:31,904 --> 02:17:33,696
$10,000 in Bitcoin

2698
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:37,792
