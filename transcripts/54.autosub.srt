1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,360
A couple dudes

3
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:22,016
But I know a lot

4
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:29,952
This is Calypso Blue Ocean ocean blue lemonade with real lemon bits

5
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:30,976
Which is

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
Is not enticing

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
To mine

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
You go ahead and take the

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,840
The first drink

10
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
20 oz it is

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,168
It is blue

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:45,568
It's nightmarishly blue

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,872
30 that's not good but

14
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
I'm worried about the pole penis

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,432
But I'm going to reach the bottom

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm just

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,552
I'm just still mad that I forgot the coconut juice which is just water with

18
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,696
Never bring that over the refrigerator

19
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:07,584
Driving to throw into your window one day I can say anything but you know

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,168
Coconut juice

21
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,728
Today Jordan

22
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,544
It is a major day

23
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:18,848
In the world of Alex Jones theology

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Which is the

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,248
Is Alex Jones

26
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,552
Interview with Megyn Kelly is come out

27
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,648
Coordinates on Sunday

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,280
Right presstime we don't know exactly how fawning and pathetic

29
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,096
Megyn Kelly really is probably

30
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
Pretty strong

31
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:47,520
So we're recording this this part one of the two episodes were going to be released

32
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,616
This is an exploration into

33
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,664
Before the interview

34
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:55,968
Suspect

35
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,760
That he knows

36
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,528
He f***** up

37
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,344
Write and post

38
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Yes

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
This pregame is going to be comprised entirely of any

40
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
On Friday night

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
Hour-long I've cut out almost done of it

42
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
It's scary

43
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,728
It is absolutely scary and documents a man

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,264
Who is lost it

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
And is trying

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:30,528
I love I love hit the criticism that people are giving him on Twitter which is perfect

47
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Because it's so obvious

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,600
They have listened to

49
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
0% of Alex Jones

50
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,976
This kind of like

51
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,304
They're they're always looking Alex Jones isn't

52
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
He's coming from a position of

53
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,704
Feels the need to get out in front of the story

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
Because nobody's paying attention who's criticizing

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,616
Aren't going to change their mind is Megyn Kelly is like

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Your

57
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Call the globalist

58
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
Workout

59
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Absolutely self-reinforcing systems

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,704
The thing that really bothers me the most is when I see these

61
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
These critiques that we're seeing on

62
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Twitter as you mention

63
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,104
People don't really understand Alex Jones is worth

64
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
So I understand it to empathize with it

65
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
But if you're going

66
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,504
Critique him you have to understand

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,904
The globalism portion of it fundamentally misunderstood Twitter and it's

68
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
Purpose summer. Don't misunderstand is how much I appreciate our new donor ladies and gentlemen I'd like to give a shout out to

69
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
What's up

70
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
I'm a policy wonk

71
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,680
Thank you for donating

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Absolute

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
We haven't had a new policy wonk and I like a couple episodes.

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,416
Before

75
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,976
Out of context

76
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:15,744
Fing

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Do you want to tell you

78
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
I love you

79
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
I'm sorry I'm doing this to you this is your proof

80
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
Free apologizing to me

81
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
It's that crazy stuff is really f***** up and be about we've had to do this

82
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,711
Weekend or the amount we had to engage with this weekend

83
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
Is a lot to put on your diaper

84
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,879
Everyone out there that I do a lot of work if you don't know whatever

85
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,999
F*** off Jordan have to put up with this and that's a lot

86
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Unbelievable

87
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Thing is not Alex Jones

88
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,727
But it's something that I I discovered thanks to a couple of Twitter interaction

89
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
But I had with listeners

90
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,311
Durant

91
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:03,103
Who's the guy who broke in

92
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,199
Bohemian Grove

93
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
You did not run it through the bushes

94
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,599
He has a slightly different take

95
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
On the whole situation

96
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,415
From Alex

97
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
He was being interviewed on C-Span

98
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
I'm going to play this clip from the interview

99
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
Because I think it's important

100
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
To understand

101
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,863
Summer

102
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Alex's brain and how it works

103
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
As we engage with

104
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
This video he put out on Friday

105
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
So we're going to put together like a baseline of

106
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,663
Ostensible journalist Jon Ronson

107
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,687
EBay

108
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
Creative nonfiction

109
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,807
Alex

110
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Reinterpreting

111
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,719
Steven Jon Ronson perspective on Alex himself

112
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,023
Now the C-SPAN interview recent

113
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
It's a couple years back

114
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,095
But

115
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
What happened with me and Alex is that

116
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,287
We both witnessed about open instead of me and I realized it was that

117
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,567
Play grown up

118
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
Tracks

119
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Gangnam Style

120
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
Anything that stops made with distance

121
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,807
You have two presidents of the United States was dependent on the vacations with the finger

122
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
Torchlight procession which kind of balance

123
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,391
Alex

124
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:22,975
Spin on its which ways that human sacrifice

125
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
Wood nightstand

126
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Which was

127
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,679
It's not that crazy

128
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Alex went back to his people with his own incredibly crazy

129
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,591
I noticed a couple of weeks ago and Alex Jones

130
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,919
Try to break into Bohemian Grove heavily-armed and

131
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:46,271
Alex Jones

132
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,087
The outside Mystic evidence of human sacrifice

133
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,791
What you saying about Bohemian Grove

134
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Play playing with fire

135
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
Alex said

136
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,655
Liechtenstein

137
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
Number two

138
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,639
Build up his own miso soup

139
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,175
End

140
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
It's

141
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,247
It is a struggle for us

142
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,575
To figure out exactly what is self-delusion and what is like

143
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,159
Because the lines pretty thin with Alex

144
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,047
When he is lying versus when he believes

145
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
It it's pretty tough

146
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
To tell and I think there might be a point where is you just

147
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:40,031
Like he was lying back then

148
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:44,383
Completely bought his own hype

149
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
He believed his b*******

150
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
It's possible

151
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Too much super male Vitality a chiropractor chiropractor

152
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Don't they

153
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
Grouper the fish

154
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Yeah that's for the next episode

155
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,167
So this video

156
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
What I wanted to do the reason we're covering the

157
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Is I wanted

158
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,287
To give

159
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,311
The audience

160
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,127
And everyone out there who doesn't listen to Alex Jones

161
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,407
A little bit of a glimpse

162
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,199
Into what he was saying in the lead-up

163
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
And how

164
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:24,063
Anything he wants on YouTube

165
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
I'm so

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,903
He gets to shape the narrative for his list

167
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,975
And what you would think you would want to do is like

168
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
F***

169
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,047
This is getting a lot of publicity

170
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,119
There's a lot of people who are maybe new people who are coming

171
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:37,887
Need to find me

172
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,727
I should put out a video where I think everything

173
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,519
I should put out a video

174
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:49,151
That notary in your head underwater reasonable go to reasonable

175
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,431
Gets very defensive

176
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,759
I've ever heard in my life

177
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,367
Unfortunately after that this was Friday

178
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
On Saturday

179
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,927
He put out another video

180
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,071
It indicates to me that he doesn't have the power hands anything

181
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,703
He's been playing this game for the last week that he is tape everything that Megyn Kelly did

182
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
The whole time she was there he was

183
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:15,775
Which of course

184
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Is that true

185
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,151
He has an audio accounts of course it's not true her crew be like

186
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,175
Stop taping

187
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,967
But NBC

188
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
That's not

189
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:29,599
Ifucking YouTube channel but I believe that he has audio of everything that happened

190
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,623
In his Studio

191
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:37,279
I believe that I don't believe he has audio of them at that restaurant that they went to

192
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
It was a secure location

193
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,911
I do believe the house that he was interviewed and they had he has audio of all that

194
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
Unless he had just some sort of a little recorder is pregnant

195
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,055
Panera Palladio

196
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,871
Consent would be illegal

197
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,967
And that's why we're not going

198
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,527
He released an audio of

199
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
Are recording of Macon

200
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,599
Kelly's closet

201
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
Okay before the actual interview

202
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,023
When they were discussing like what it was going to be and what have you

203
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,351
He says that she lied to him about stuff but

204
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
The audio of that call doesn't

205
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
Is that at all

206
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,471
It doesn't indicate any of the things he says

207
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,567
But we're not going to be playing any of it because I do not really know

208
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
The legality of it

209
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,615
And I

210
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,919
Certainly don't respect Alex Jones a choice

211
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
The idea that he's putting out private phone calls with

212
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
People

213
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,831
I mean we called

214
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:35,135
Larry Nichols and we took it off the show

215
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
Do the Point Clear Coat Factory

216
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,327
Realize we messed up and I can't believe I have to sign some sort of

217
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,887
Maybe

218
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,911
I don't know

219
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
That's better mattress

220
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
Put out after the one we're going to be going over

221
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,311
He was saying

222
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
Hey

223
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:59,199
You guys go ahead and post your put out your 11 minute interview

224
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:03,039
To put out the raw footage

225
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Which means to me

226
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
You don't have

227
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,671
This is a Blog

228
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
This is just like

229
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,511
What are you guys do the right thing

230
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,327
I could do it myself

231
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,679
Maybe maybe it's illegal for me to do it but you guys if you want such

232
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:21,983
Howard

233
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
Afraid of what the

234
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Footage says

235
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
Then you should

236
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,615
Really

237
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
The audio of the interview is edited

238
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
Play malicious way Alex Jones

239
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,855
Like there

240
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
Fall under the

241
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
Slander

242
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Certainly is

243
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,839
Legal department

244
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,727
Sort of b******* about please

245
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:54,495
Gotten

246
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:56,031
Alex

247
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Please just don't say that

248
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,247
Now

249
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
Yeah

250
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,831
So I don't believe his strong

251
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,623
Hand but he thinks he has

252
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,159
But I do believe this

253
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,231
This video that you put on Friday I believe

254
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Is sincere

255
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,071
It is a desperate man

256
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
It is a sad man

257
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
It is a crushed man

258
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,823
I texted you earlier it was heading a guillotine

259
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,615
Just waiting for it to drop

260
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,663
That is basically what's going on

261
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
We're going to start with this first

262
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
Where I talked about how you know all I'm trying to do is save the world that's all

263
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Watsonville

264
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,143
Mountain 5

265
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
Pacific oh my God. Explain how sometimes go over here

266
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,431
Global media

267
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
Remove like a cancer

268
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
From the Republic

269
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:14,367
This country a lot of people fought and died for that is

270
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
Amazing Nation

271
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Vision

272
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:21,023
Our dreams our forebears have been amazing

273
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,399
Is it is under the knife right now we're in an emergency surgery right now

274
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,727
Globalist face sucker off of

275
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,055
Another movie rap

276
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
Prince and parasites

277
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Even though Trump

278
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
Olive Branch

279
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,039
For themselves but also us

280
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,951
Very classy movie made

281
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Absentia

282
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,655
Doesn't know what that word

283
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,703
Imma go over that with Goldman Sachs

284
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Open up America riding with China's infrastructures better in the Goldman Sachs has moved Industries are

285
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
Americold ever come back on these people

286
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,199
Assholes

287
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
They're assholes

288
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
I hate I hate ask

289
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,319
Presentation

290
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,855
Keep a running tally of

291
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,927
By the way

292
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:28,607
The reference to Empire Strikes Back

293
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,591
Because they're necessarily there's just sort of the setup of the premise

294
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Surgery against them

295
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Or something

296
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,599
Yeah sure

297
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,183
You should learn about the real Renaissance like

298
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,047
It was free market at the time which led to patronage and a lot of

299
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,839
Poor people

300
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
Absolutely stopped

301
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,703
Renaissance

302
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,519
Luckily it's

303
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
Not a real thing

304
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
It's never explained what it is

305
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Just a catchphrase for Alex over again

306
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
And also by the way we are on Facebook now

307
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,063
Made a Facebook page

308
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,695
Done anything with it you and I both have been off Facebook for a good long while.

309
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:31,583
The people wanna find us on there it's knowledge fight on Facebook

310
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
And just as a goof

311
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:37,215
I put our founding date in 1775

312
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
Anyway

313
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,479
A date you cannot add

314
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:56,927
I got a little charge can't believe they let you go back as far

315
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,279
So I am about Donald Trump

316
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
And they think you're so stupid

317
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,703
But the good news is only a fraction of people really fully awake

318
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,543
You get a fraction 12 3% that's the Detonator

319
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
The big one

320
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,895
We've already got 30 40% they're partially awake

321
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:20,735
We've got 60 70% for supporting Trump and real polls

322
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,527
50mm Gallup

323
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
915

324
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
He's at 65% despite everything that's running it

325
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,583
And so they cooked up this Russia narrative and now

326
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
Dolly obstruction Meredith

327
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:43,775
So

328
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,311
President does it it's not

329
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:52,479
They're going on TV

330
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,551
Do they not know that Nikolai car they just

331
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
Are they just like a

332
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
You know what the problem was

333
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:00,671
Nixon didn't say it often

334
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,071
Yeah I'm also the most recent Gallup poll is 40% disapprove 54%

335
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,191
4% disapprove 39% of proof

336
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,519
Strong like

337
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,103
Plus 10 points conservative bent to it

338
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,455
All other polls are like Trump Rasmussen is like

339
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,831
Interesting things to do

340
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:29,599
Wisconsin terms

341
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
The methodology of statistical Gathering really doesn't understand that the

342
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:36,767
Terms of like

343
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,303
Adding on

344
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,143
Fit representation

345
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
It went he went to Junior College

346
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
I'm guessing he never took us

347
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Statistics course

348
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
That's what I'm guessing

349
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
It's not some sort of nefarious

350
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
We're going to add more Democrat

351
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:59,807
It's the trying to get a representative sample

352
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
Group of demographics

353
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Certain point

354
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,623
You can

355
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,719
You can kind of estimate what is in the larger

356
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
Absolutely

357
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
Mid-thirties approval rating

358
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,959
Mid-to-late thirties

359
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:20,799
These guys are in the 50s disapproving

360
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Exactly where Trump should have

361
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
Gone to hell in his mid-to-late

362
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
Some of the more extreme polls are showing likes

363
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,295
B+ percentage

364
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,415
Those are those are ones that are there

365
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:37,951
So

366
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
Nonsense

367
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,279
Anime idea that they're cooking up Russian stuff

368
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Open Cooking up collusion Subs

369
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
You doing it to himself

370
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,143
Yeah all this stuff is not made out of

371
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,543
Yeah his lawyer went on TV on Fox news with Wallace today and was like

372
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,103
He's not

373
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,431
He's never said he's obstructing justice and he's not being invest

374
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
And then the next question

375
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
Was like

376
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,831
Yeah he knows he's being investigated for obstruction of justice

377
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,623
And they're going like

378
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
No you can't say both of those

379
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,583
Contradiction

380
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,351
Yeah

381
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,655
Is it going to be really sucked up

382
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
But trust me it picks up real fast

383
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Flip is Alex

384
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Accidentally revealing that he might be a liar

385
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,943
He discusses how we

386
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,223
Vicinity

387
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:34,015
Which

388
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:36,319
As a former comedian and

389
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,367
I consider myself

390
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:41,183
Game records

391
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:50,911
I think I think he might be indicating in this club that he's aware that

392
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
He's doing it in a manipulative

393
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:56,287
The globalists are so evil so corrupt so pathetic

394
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,823
I'm a shame

395
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
That were not more effect

396
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
I know hero

397
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:10,111
I'm here promoting Freedom versus a bunch of pedophiles and devil worshippers in and islamists

398
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,511
Usually 20 years it seems like it's pretty tough

399
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,631
We have a nation we have a world we have the West

400
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
White,

401
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,031
The world if you have the

402
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,823
And so a lot of it

403
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,879
We've got to make this epic battle as possible because it's showing

404
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
You got it in strive

405
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:48,767
With our verbal acumen

406
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,815
Oracle palette

407
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,727
Just how amazing this fight is if we speak to them like they're sleeping

408
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,543
And ask him to awaken so the vampires

409
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615
Cultural

410
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,151
We want consciousness

411
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
You want to be alive

412
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,247
Just like in they live

413
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,295
1960s

414
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,831
Short story turned into a grape

415
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,696
Rowdy Roddy Piper John Carpenter film

416
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
We agree on that

417
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
I want you to live

418
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,888
We should all live

419
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Glasses on

420
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
You know

421
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,824
The way he's setting it up is

422
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
This battle is a globalist

423
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,224
We've got to make it more entertaining cuz otherwise people are going to wake up

424
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Bratz

425
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
We need to use our rhetorical pallets

426
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:44,832
Right

427
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
In order to take care of

428
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
What are your thoughts on that

429
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
I mean

430
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
What do you say we have

431
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Use our rhetorical palette

432
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,888
The first thing that

433
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Words an argument

434
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
And we have

435
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
2

436
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
Constantly in

437
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:04,800
Vent

438
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,640
And exploit new kind of worth an argument

439
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
To get

440
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:11,200
People to wake up

441
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
Wake up shore

442
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:15,552
I don't think that's what he saying

443
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,880
No

444
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,208
Is that true

445
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:28,864
Is barbed wire and I got to be over me

446
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:31,680
He's a hero

447
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
He's allowing

448
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:37,056
Hero

449
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,872
But again this comes to that like

450
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
This I am giving of myself

451
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,272
This interview with Megyn Kelly will be destruction

452
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:51,136
And I'm aware of it and I am hitting you might come over

453
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
He's setting him

454
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,464
Hopefully you'll come on

455
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,864
Lamprey

456
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:05,216
If you are sitting down to listen to this with your family

457
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
You are a big

458
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,824
He's setting himself up as a Christ

459
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,456
Absolutely

460
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,832
Little weird, rotary I have a kinship I have an alliance

461
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:21,856
Humanity

462
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
An alliance of my ancestors Ivan alliance with you

463
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:32,864
All this energy

464
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,728
Mission with no gravity

465
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:44,384
Was no spiritual and cultural muscle because our forebears were so good they created this

466
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Actually brought us down below

467
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,600
So that are mine

468
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:58,976
Our forebears were so good

469
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,048
Well I think he's going even further back

470
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,608
The mat I think he's talking about creating

471
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,656
Agrarian civilization

472
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:10,240
Like I think he's talking about the Agricultural Revolution

473
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:16,128
Well that is basically built around alcohol so

474
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
Entirely

475
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,944
In that case

476
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
I don't disagree

477
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
I like a good I like a good pinot noir

478
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,904
So he and I are on the same page

479
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,512
That like unfortunate accidental result of us creating civilization

480
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
Is it

481
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
So

482
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,192
He's talking about praising hunter-gatherer

483
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:46,080
Maybe which is which is not a terrible or not terrible I mean

484
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,128
Not an out-of-character

485
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,176
Taking for him because if you're

486
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
If you're saying is I'm

487
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,040
All the time I am

488
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
A predator I am here to provide

489
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
For my family

490
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:03,232
Of course of course

491
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,256
Of course you would want

492
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,352
Go back to that

493
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,704
What happened is to get that bone juice

494
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:19,360
He and Mark Dice robbed robbed together

495
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
Globalist

496
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,224
Global Academy

497
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,040
Society

498
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:33,184
Everything wrong with hunter-gatherer Society is

499
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,976
You can't really get auto-ship

500
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:40,096
Super male Vitality furano though

501
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
He responds to accusations that no one is

502
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
The term information War

503
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Channel I see the news

504
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:59,040
Jones coined the term information

505
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,112
Us

506
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:05,696
Department of Defense

507
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,256
What was the department defense department War

508
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,328
The German

509
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:17,472
Psychological War we call it knowledge fight

510
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,288
And we've got the real truth

511
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:23,872
Those are the big hundred Megaton hydrogen bomb

512
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
You do

513
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:29,504
We don't we don't need we need

514
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
The courage to not care about

515
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:36,416
The propaganda by people like Hillary and the horror media

516
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,072
I mean if I can't beat

517
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
Pedophile Robin witch

518
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
Oh boy

519
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Nobody

520
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Well I guess

521
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
Aesthetic

522
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,712
Yep they're weak and pathetic

523
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Because

524
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
You think truth

525
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Are you think lies are true

526
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:07,136
Right that's why

527
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Destruction

528
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
The fact that he goes into Bohemian Grove

529
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:15,584
And spells it out like it's a Satanic ritual might be killing kids

530
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
I all this all this nonsense

531
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,704
That is why there's a problem

532
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,264
If he was telling

533
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,800
20-ton Megaton

534
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
Bombtrack

535
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,872
I don't care

536
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,200
It's not going to care if people would really respect him

537
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
I would respect

538
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Oh absolutely

539
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,808
If he was out

540
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
And acted like he does

541
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,440
But he was telling the truth would be awesome

542
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
That is

543
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:47,840
Very very true

544
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:51,680
Why isn't there a why isn't there an Alex Jones on the left

545
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,520
Keith Olbermann

546
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
Alex

547
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:02,944
I think if you take some of the politics out of it he's Overman has Jokers 0 time

548
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,784
You do need an element of crazy

549
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
And maybe give me some

550
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
Absolutely

551
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Play who knows

552
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:19,328
I think the truth to a lot of people or the way it's presented

553
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,984
Is boring

554
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,800
Dreams about stop this is free-form ramp

555
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:35,200
He doesn't understand about the truth like that's That's essential

556
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
Every way too hard

557
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:42,368
By Jose I just yell about reality for 4 hours a day

558
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
No I want to say yes and then I was like no I can't lie

559
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,984
If I was allowed to do Coke on TV dexedrine for 4 hours

560
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Medicinal

561
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:05,152
If I just went on freeform rant about how our government has

562
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:11,552
Extension slavery and they're still doing it with the prison population and they're going through

563
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,880
Creating private prisons

564
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,976
Make sure that we put more people in prison

565
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
And all that they're doing is

566
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Utilizing that is

567
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
Free f***

568
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
In labor

569
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,008
Go to those people like all of this stuff is still f****** going on

570
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,592
And that's why we need to stop the non global

571
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,408
There's like 45 sec

572
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
I was really going for it

573
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:48,416
My cartilage pills

574
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
Otto shark skin

575
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
Next clip we have reached the point where

576
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Go off the rails

577
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,680
Yeah

578
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:03,008
Almost nothing from

579
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Hour-long episode

580
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
And here is where Alex

581
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Just goes

582
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,368
Goes for it

583
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,184
Things are never going to be the same

584
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:22,720
Cuz man it gets f*****

585
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:25,280
I'm not a pedophile

586
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Border

587
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,400
A client's pedophile child rapist her husband Jerry Epstein

588
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,872
Information

589
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
Do what you want supposed to pedophiles

590
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
Helicopters and police

591
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,856
So this is become a new narrative

592
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,624
Police in there

593
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,952
This has become a new narrative because scalise

594
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,976
In the past has

595
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,512
Supported legislation

596
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:58,816
Human trafficking

597
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,632
Mike cernovich

598
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
Is

599
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,496
Who started pitching this idea that the pedophile globalist

600
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,848
Had a Bernie Sanders brainwashed supporter

601
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:11,872
At Payback

602
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,176
For trying to take down their pedophile Network

603
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,712
Which is irresponsible

604
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
Absolute

605
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:22,112
Very very responsible

606
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
So why did you say

607
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,720
Disagree

608
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,816
I get where you're coming from but I don't like that

609
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Right to live

610
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:35,424
I agree with you there

611
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
Here's here's my perspective on

612
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,264
I know your type

613
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
I wish we lived

614
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,568
In a society

615
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,128
Where guns were not available to shoot

616
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
Since he is already been shot

617
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
The world is a better place without him

618
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
What did not without

619
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,808
He's going to recover

620
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,832
Unfortunately

621
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
I don't

622
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,000
I agree with you that it would be great to eradicate certain mindsets from the world

623
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Certain

624
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
What's a brain

625
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,032
Hurting or

626
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,568
Killing white supremacist

627
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,384
But because he's are alike

628
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,664
And I wish

629
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,688
Buddy Hackett

630
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:24,832
I truly do since he is already been shot and there's nothing I can do about it

631
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:27,392
And he's the one

632
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
To make sure that he was

633
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,048
I don't care

634
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
I don't

635
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
I could give a f***

636
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,960
I'm I'm I'm on the fence

637
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
I'm on the fence about your position

638
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
I don't think that I hope you have

639
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,080
But I

640
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
I get where you're coming from

641
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
I'm not sure I'm ready to be that extreme.

642
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:57,088
It is a rejection of the fact

643
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
His position

644
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,208
In the same way that if let's say someone shoots Alex Jones

645
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,744
I don't want him

646
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Todai

647
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:08,608
Necessarily even though he's already been shot and we can't take that back

648
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm not going to wish for him to not

649
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,168
Recover

650
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Alex Jones

651
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,008
Even though he is an awful bigot and water

652
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,800
Perhaps one of the worst people

653
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,592
Hubbell in the public sphere

654
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,896
He is still a parent

655
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,200
He's still someone kid

656
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:25,760
Exist within an ecosystem

657
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
Where parts of his politic

658
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,112
Parts of him Beyond his politics

659
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
Make a big effect on

660
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,488
I'm Steve scalise I'm sure

661
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,072
You wouldn't leave a massive Gap in a lot of people's lives if he dies

662
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,120
A white supremacist

663
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,960
Understand that

664
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,568
Is very cookie-cutter for subways

665
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
Accusing him

666
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,408
Of being a wife

667
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
Supremacist

668
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
His own words

669
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,760
He made a specific

670
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
Points

671
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,856
To say that he is a lot like what

672
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
Two-faced the governor of South Carolina

673
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,000
He's the one who fought so hard against

674
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,024
Integration

675
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,816
That guy he's the one

676
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
No I don't know

677
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,240
The point is he himself has said I'm going to be a white supremacist

678
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
Who doesn't say I'm away

679
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
That is that what

680
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
You said well again that's

681
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Basic wheel

682
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Like a ton of the new right

683
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,480
Beaver

684
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:29,760
I don't want to have this debate

685
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,088
We're not going to get to any kind of agreement

686
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
That's Beth probably

687
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,392
Let's get back to

688
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:42,048
Okay girls online trolling a New York mateso

689
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,400
Some of those girls 13 14 15 to get truck going the mall

690
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,752
Obliterates they never come out of those dungeons again

691
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
Imagine people like those globulus leaning over your daughter

692
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,944
Kidnapping subdivision right for a month straight

693
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,480
Portrait of teeth pulled out

694
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Skin pulled off

695
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,344
And they're crying out to God

696
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,648
Send me defend me defend me

697
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
Spirit world

698
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,512
Men

699
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
After then admit how bad it is

700
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Field against it

701
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,800
When you're attacked by these devils

702
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:29,920
It's almost embarrassing for people praise what we do

703
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
I could see that but at the same time

704
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Do that voice

705
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:39,648
You know really does it

706
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
Little girl

707
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,096
Exactly

708
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
Incredibly creepy

709
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
It's

710
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:55,520
How he

711
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,896
I don't think it's the idea of

712
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
That turns him on

713
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
I think it's the

714
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Telling of it

715
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,272
Not that like

716
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,808
Look at what I get to

717
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:10,368
Just a look at how awesome it is

718
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:11,392
That I get to

719
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,160
To say all of the

720
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,696
I disagree

721
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Yeah I think

722
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,072
It's what gives a boner is the idea that

723
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
That you've actually a hero

724
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,144
Okay

725
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Spells

726
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:26,240
Fantasies of

727
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,008
In his head

728
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:28,800
He gets really into

729
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,128
Yeah this isn't the only time in this episode

730
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
To put on that voice

731
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:39,296
He doesn't quite a bit but not so crows not always about such horrifying topic

732
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Website

733
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
I mean there is definitely a problem with white slavery in the world

734
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Only problem

735
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,816
With traffic

736
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,424
Yeah that happened

737
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
If

738
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:59,264
And I think this is the most likely so

739
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
Scenario

740
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
About

741
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,616
Aldi's globulus

742
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
But he talks about all the time

743
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
And how they trade in children

744
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
And what have you

745
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
Is incredibly

746
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,576
What he's doing is incredibly irresponsible

747
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,368
And he's just trying to trigger people

748
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
The thinking

749
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
His political opponents

750
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,376
Cheez-Its

751
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
It continually goes back to that

752
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,192
Pedophile

753
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Because

754
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
Cloud your mind

755
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,056
It keeps you from thinking clearly

756
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,616
If you if you genuinely believe

757
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,408
That your enemies

758
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,176
AR

759
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Pedophiles

760
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,784
How could you not

761
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
Get that visceral

762
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Hatred

763
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
Turn off

764
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,416
I'm taking out people's teeth

765
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
Which is just a weird fantasy

766
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,680
I mean you shouldn't be saying these sorts of things on his show without some sort of a warning

767
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:05,312
Quite frankly you're right if you are someone who maybe suffered abuse

768
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,616
As a child or something like that

769
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
You could be traumatized

770
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
Alex talkin like

771
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
Absolutely

772
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:16,576
Not as bad as

773
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Dammit Dan

774
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
You hate me

775
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:24,256

Oscar's every 5 minutes I mean this is like

778
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
Sure Victor

779
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
They don't have the power they got Hollywood

780
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,432
All these anti-christian anti-america anti

781
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Civilization assholes

782
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
To think they're going to break our will

783
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
I know

784
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
I've already seen

785
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
Is systematically releasing men

786
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:04,960
And went right now

787
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:10,336
Just a few years are going to be so articulate so powerful so psychic

788
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,128
So f****** show ready

789
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,688
In business and media at

790
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,992
Military everywhere

791
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
Level of human development is here

792
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:24,160
Has been given birth to right now but are women

793
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,208
White

794
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,792
And that's why sex is s***

795
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Hillary Clinton

796
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,656
Are are crapping all over their depends right now

797
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,192
Because

798
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Dana

799
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
41

800
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
Analogy of Terminator

801
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,128
Phone number three

802
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,992
Another already beat Skynet and I since my back try to stop it

803
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,344
That's why they're freaking out so bad they already lost phone

804
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:55,904
Turn off

805
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,864
What are any number of movies I could have gone with

806
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,984
Out from there

807
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,824
I would prefer movie reference

808
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,664
Uber

809
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,504
So there's there's something more important that I want it I want to pull out of

810
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,832
This cliff

811
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
That

812
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,464
In a couple years these info Warriors

813
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Are going to be

814
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
And then in the same clip you saying

815
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,120
I know I've already seen it

816
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,424
Yeah

817
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,984
Or that he knows

818
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
I want to be clear

819
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,056
Or that it's children

820
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
I don't have

821
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:46,848
Too much

822
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,896
To go on just from this clip

823
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,224
But this thought that I've just brought up I want you to track

824
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Get through the rest of

825
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,064
Whenever these sort of weird things come up

826
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
Cuz they do

827
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:57,856
There's a trend

828
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,160
I think

829
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:01,952
Super

830
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:07,328
I think he might think he does right further the other thing is I think

831
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,376
That we have been far too

832
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
Too generous

833
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,704
How about the idea of Alex Jones being brain dead

834
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:15,264
Because there are a couple instant

835
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,544
Amazon this episode where

836
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
He spells out some things but

837
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
He's alluded to before

838
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
And if the way he describes them are like

839
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,736
This is

840
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,272
So

841
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,320
I'll just spoil it a little bit

842
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
He might think he's talking

843
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,464
He might think he has communication with

844
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,256
I'm not entirely sure

845
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:42,400
Are we going to make

846
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:45,728
Making pottery

847
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
Whoopi Goldberg is right in front of me

848
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
It's a

849
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,872
I wish I wish

850
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:56,223
They we can put a fourth checkmark there but

851
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
His

852
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,039
Like his constant

853
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:04,927
Illusions to reverse engineering is kind of his cover for saying

854
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,463
I can't eat

855
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Into the past

856
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,327
And I can communicate with people

857
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
From ghosts

858
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
I don't know I don't know maybe

859
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
We got a lot to do

860
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
That that thing

861
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,591
He always does

862
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:23,359
Is

863
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:25,151
Start with pedophiles

864
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,687
And then

865
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,479
Add an islamist

866
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:29,247
It's in Hollywood

867
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
So it is

868
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,831
Even though he's not playing islamists

869
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
And Hollywood people are pedophiles

870
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,415
He's lumping them into

871
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:40,511
Together

872
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:46,143
You're right

873
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:49,727
To Doom

874
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,079
It's a little bit.

875
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,383
I'm a selfish person muscles my family

876
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
Analogical

877
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
British people

878
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Where to break up soon

879
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:17,119
Everything they're doing right now because they're broken already

880
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:23,263
How are you cure King off onto the deck

881
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,103
Feel the fires of hell

882
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,663
Just push him over the edge

883
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,735
I don't know how you don't hear that as a call to violin

884
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,807
If you're someone who believes his anti globalist

885
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,575
Nonsense

886
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,415
I don't I don't I don't think that you could do that and not think let's go

887
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,999
Absolutely well we are and we have so much evidence

888
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,327
People who are info Warriors

889
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
Going to places with guns

890
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,423
With the intent of doing harm

891
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,823
Yeah I mean Alex is really really careful that even if he's going through bad people

892
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,383
Being soulless

893
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,223
Still really smart in the sense that he's using this metaphorical language

894
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:09,599
Talk about the gates of hell look push him over these can get away with it literally

895
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
Calling for violence

896
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,647
Man

897
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:15,743
He's getting so close now

898
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,279
Frappuccinos that

899
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,607
Inevitably if people keep paying attention to him he's destroyed

900
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,935
There's a part of his brain that knows he's been lying

901
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
For twenty years

902
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
Yeah absolutely guilty conscience

903
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,615
It is it is the twin he absorbed

904
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Movie

905
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:40,063
Arnold Schwarzenegger

906
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,671
Certainly started out as Arnold

907
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:48,255
I'm not wrong is life is Twin

908
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,839
Here's where he gets into some islamophobia

909
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
And

910
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,167
Is using really meaningful statistic

911
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
6 to talk about it but

912
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,359
Do you think they're all over the news and kill me and kill everybody else they're not

913
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
People

914
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,479
How to get up

915
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,759
Out of bed the morning

916
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,391
Because those are the dead see the living at the curb

917
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,743
Like they were

918
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,047
Somehow they still be alive or not

919
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
Take the Muslims that they're so sad

920
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,679
And so pathetic

921
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,287
After 1400 years of their religion that teaches inbreeding

922
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:38,175
Covid in Europe and England up to half the deformed babies

923
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,247
Even on the populations only like 9%

924
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,367
That's a low number of the babies are deformed

925
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:50,463
Helen England 34%

926
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,303
30 +

927
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,119
Of the baby to form the UCare Muslims

928
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Text Danny

929
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
That can't be

930
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,263
Can you imagine what that's like

931
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,543
Statistically impossible

932
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Like the British royalty

933
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,383
Transylvania

934
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:16,063
That's why they want to end Humanity that's why they want time of Euros that's why they want clones that's why they want us all diseases like them

935
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,111
That's what they wanted DNA poison

936
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:23,487
Because they want us to be like

937
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,255
They are

938
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,911
Is this all Muslims are inbred disaster areas

939
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,447
Is a very popular narrative

940
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:33,215
The push by

941
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
People like Gavin McInnes

942
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,079
He talked about it a bunch on the Rogan program when he was on

943
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:41,919
Alex talked about it a bit this is one of the first times I've heard him be visix

944
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,223
Explicit about you

945
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
Statistics aren't really accurate

946
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
But

947
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,855
There's a lot to unpack when we want to talk about

948
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,927
Historically

949
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,999
There has been a lot more marrying of cousins

950
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
In Islamic

951
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,839
Oh yeah and that is allowed in the Quran

952
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,655
Said that you should do it

953
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,935
It's allowed

954
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:06,495
Important

955
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
There are a lot of benefits

956
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
Come from

957
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,103
Keeping families married

958
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,127
Enter married together

959
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
One of them is

960
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
That you keep property within your family

961
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,015
Sarah bunch of reasons

962
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,831
In less developed countries

963
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,111
That you would want to keep

964
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
Keep your tribe together

965
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Well

966
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,183
The same way with

967
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
He did put

968
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,535
He did put a

969
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,375
Sure

970
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,191
You pull it down for yourself okay

971
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,639
Marrying your cousin

972
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,919
Having a kid with them

973
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,455
Does not necessarily

974
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,735
Create birthday

975
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:52,831
If one parent is a carrier of it

976
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,367
You can be more likely

977
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,647
But you will have genetic

978
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,415
Defect

979
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
Both parents will likely

980
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
We have that

981
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Their carriers are

982
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
So the actual Act of f****** your cousin

983
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,607
Is it really that bad

984
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,423
We endorse f****** your cousin

985
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
In countries that have

986
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Far better

987
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
Medical tree

988
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,823
Their tests you can undergo beforehand

989
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,383
People who have kids

990
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,663
Just do that anyway

991
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:24,063
America only 300,000 have those

992
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Hey

993
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,207
Are you dating somebody related to

994
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,767
And it's like all the time before you have kids

995
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:34,047
It's very

996
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:37,631
Smart to go in and make sure that you're not carriers for recessive gene

997
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,423
They could end up creating

998
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,959
Lullaby

999
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
Another thing that's important to point out is the

1000
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
Statistics that are kept about birth defects

1001
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Include

1002
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:53,247
Superficial or minor things like cleft palate and those are far more common in Lesterville

1003
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,015
Countries

1004
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,551
So when you want

1005
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
To talk about

1006
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:01,951
Do you know any anomalies in statistics about Muslim countries having high

1007
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:02,975
Birth defect

1008
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
One of these

1009
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:08,351
It's really important to talk about is bad prenatal care

1010
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
It's not necessarily the

1011
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
The f****** of your cousin

1012
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,543
Right now I want to take one step further 10% of

1013
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,335
Women who contracted

1014
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:19,103
Did the zika virus

1015
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
Babies with

1016
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,455
What microcephaly

1017
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,735
Yeah like it's not

1018
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
Inbreeding

1019
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,063
There are plenty of viruses

1020
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,903
They don't have good medical

1021
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
Technology

1022
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:37,535
Yeah if so I want to ask how many

1023
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,863
States do you think in America is it legal to f*** your cousin

1024
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
26

1025
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
It's illegal in every single state

1026
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,775
With the exception of Mississippi

1027
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,799
Nevada

1028
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,591
Dakota South Dakota Texas

1029
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
Utah Wisconsin

1030
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,711
Kentucky do you mean the states that historically have a problem

1031
00:49:56,735 --> 00:50:00,831
Places where they like to make a law

1032
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,463
We've been doing this for way too long at the Mormon Mississippi

1033
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
The South hillbilly States you got Nevada

1034
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,423
A lot of people who want to have sex

1035
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,775
Moved into North Dakota South Dakota native

1036
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:24,895
American tribe populations in those

1037
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,687
Two states are so low

1038
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,551
Sure Wisconsin in the same way with Iceland like if there's only

1039
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087
Fifty thousand people there

1040
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,391
It's a good idea to Wisconsin

1041
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:37,439
I've no idea what's by they made a lot

1042
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,719
I want to

1043
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,559
How many states do you think you can marry your cousin

1044
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
In the United

1045
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:47,423
Well outside of those States

1046
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,215
I would say again all of

1047
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:50,239
I'll give you a list

1048
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Maine

1049
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,079
Alabama Alaska

1050
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
I'll give you a list

1051
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:01,503
Main Alabama Alaska California Colorado Connecticut

1052
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,343
Florida Georgia

1053
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,719
New Mexico New York North Carolina South Carolina Rhode Island Virginia

1054
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:14,047
Those are the states where you can straight-up marry your cousin no-questions-asked

1055
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Your first cousin

1056
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:16,607
Arizona

1057
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:19,679
You can marry your cousin as long as one of you is sterile

1058
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:24,799
In Wisconsin in Wisconsin

1059
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,639
You can marry your cousin as long as the woman in the equation is at least 55

1060
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:30,175
Or one-party Estero

1061
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:33,503
In Utah you can marry your cousin only if both parties are sick

1062
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
65 or older

1063
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:37,343
Over 55 and one of them is farro

1064
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,159
And Illinois you can marry cousin if both are over 50

1065
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
Or one of you is Daryl

1066
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:47,839
So there's apparently going on in the United States it's completely legal

1067
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,375
I mean I guess you just

1068
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
Like basically like

1069
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,471
Hey you can marry your cousin as long as you don't have a

1070
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:59,359
Well in those States

1071
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
You put that into a

1072
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,991
States is it legal to marry your cousin

1073
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,551
I just assumed it was because they didn't have any laws

1074
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
If it's not a problem

1075
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,927
Make a lullaby

1076
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:19,071
Stipulation

1077
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:24,959
If weird if you look into it

1078
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Inbreeding

1079
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,799
Is a really bad way to phrase because

1080
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,335
Who creates this idea of

1081
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
Horrifying

1082
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:39,551
Deliverance style hillbilly type

1083
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:43,391
But the reality is marrying your cousin is really that bad

1084
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,719
It is only bad if one or both

1085
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,511
The view is already a carrier

1086
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,535
4 something

1087
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,071
Like

1088
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,959
Give me diabetes in the good example

1089
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
Just because you have a shared what I understand

1090
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:12,063
Humanity was down to like a mediately after the Ice Age I believe Humanity was down to

1091
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,111
Between 14 and 30000

1092
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,695
The statistics that they have for at least

1093
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
I think the genetic

1094
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,327
That they have say that in order to maintain enough genetic diversity

1095
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,119
You only need like

1096
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
10 to 15000

1097
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,447
Which means their eyes

1098
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:29,471
Plenty of cousins

1099
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,127
Exactly

1100
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,271
It is really unfortunate a lot of the birth

1101
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:47,135
Defect that exists within not just Muslim countries

1102
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,159
And if Alex

1103
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,951
You want to really

1104
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:50,975
Be

1105
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
Sort of

1106
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,559
You should raise awareness

1107
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
Things you should donate

1108
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:56,607
Two causes

1109
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:01,471
You should support Doctors Without Borders and stuff like that

1110
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:05,567
Charity that fixes cleft palate

1111
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,967
Jimmy Pardo does give them a real help that you can do this

1112
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:15,551
Demonizing those people

1113
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,319
Right

1114
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,647
I think it's worse than this next clip

1115
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
More about

1116
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:24,767
Now it's 6

1117
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,887
General skyscrapers other buildings have been torched

1118
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,751
England and Muslims are celebrating it

1119
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:38,847
And the media can't even come out and say it's Muslims in fact

1120
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,687
The new socialist

1121
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,295
You f****** pile of garbage

1122
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
Shares

1123
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:53,695
They should take middle-class people's homes

1124
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,999
Not middle-class people

1125
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:02,655
Rich people do happy dogs

1126
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:09,567
Save a small amount

1127
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,199
Thousand Muslims running around

1128
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:20,575
U02 houses your farmer you want out there another house was your grandma's or whatever

1129
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
In Germany

1130
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,255
Christian ethos

1131
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:33,631
And I'd only little Coastal hotels and things were assembling a little Mason crying to go

1132
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,215
You either control all your Gaston Street

1133
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
Put in

1134
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:43,103
200 Africans who just landed your house

1135
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,991
He said that's over-the-top no no no

1136
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Testing

1137
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
Poking and prodding

1138
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,391
To see what you'll put up with

1139
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
Economy

1140
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,471
Look for deer screaming

1141
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,543
And what he hates the idea of forced charity

1142
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:18,431
Hate the idea whenever we talked about the clip of him being mad about

1143
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,711
18 Muslim women

1144
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,735
Starbucks

1145
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,039
What makes a man is integration

1146
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:27,903
Yeah he's not mad about the idea that these people can't integrated drawers

1147
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:33,535
Living evidence of integration right that proves his whole premise wrong

1148
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,583
Basically

1149
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:39,423
What he's really afraid of here is worried about people helping

1150
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,007
Other people and then proving I got we can all get along

1151
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
Takes away from

1152
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,079
Isaac it again

1153
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,895
If 1 people are so Supreme

1154
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,735
Explain to me why it is that we're all better off whenever everybody's in

1155
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,551
Yeah

1156
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
Has better outcomes

1157
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,367
Not just

1158
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,671
Are the people who are going there

1159
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
It is for everyone

1160
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,071
Yeah every school that's been integrated like in Alabama and the like

1161
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
Those

1162
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:11,167
Good like people worst like the picture of that

1163
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:12,447
Young white lady

1164
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:15,519
Screaming in the face of that black girl

1165
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:17,567
In that

1166
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
Time immediately following that

1167
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
Everybody

1168
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:21,663
Was better off

1169
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,967
Yeah everybody was better up

1170
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
And that is

1171
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
F******

1172
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
F*** them

1173
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,559
If those if those conservative Tory bowls

1174
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:41,119
F****** lit on fire themselves

1175
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,143
It's b*******

1176
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,703
So Alex is theory is it is Muslim

1177
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:50,079
It smells sticks

1178
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,687
Spiders that have happened

1179
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,479
He's misinterpreting

1180
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,623
That's crazy

1181
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,159
A rich person

1182
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,439
Wanted to save

1183
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,999
What

1184
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:14,655
Or whatever it is a hundred thousand pounds

1185
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:17,215
Or something exterior cladding

1186
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:20,287
Facade of the building

1187
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:25,407
By the waterproof

1188
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,735
And apparently according to regulations

1189
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:29,759
Veteran place

1190
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:34,623
That fireproof not fireproof only supposed to be used on like one story building

1191
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
Sprite and when you have a 24

1192
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,951
Story highrise

1193
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,535
You're legally supposed to use the fire retardant

1194
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
And they didn't

1195
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,351
Are is a small fire

1196
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,167
Cuz

1197
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Spread

1198
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
And because they didn't

1199
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Install sprinkler system

1200
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
Into this

1201
00:58:57,919 --> 00:58:59,711
In terms of

1202
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
Conflicting things about

1203
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:01,759
Sprinkler system

1204
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,855
I've heard both sides that some people did not want

1205
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,903
To have sprinkler systems

1206
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:08,927
Some of the Reds

1207
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,975
Themselves and that's possible

1208
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:17,375
But because they weren't there the fire spread got to the exterior of the building and the whole thing went up the Christmas tree

1209
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,655
Yep went up like crazy

1210
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,703
And to make matters worse

1211
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,983
There is a group

1212
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,079
Call Dee grenfell Action Group 2012

1213
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,127
Have been complaining about this building

1214
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,199
A talking about how it's a disaster

1215
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
And they working

1216
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,247
Consistently ignored

1217
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,807
Course

1218
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,599
The thing is that

1219
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Really sad and

1220
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,463
Is that it was in 2013

1221
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,279
They made a statement that was

1222
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,583
It is going to take a mass tragedy

1223
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
In order for you to do anything about this

1224
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:52,703
Yep this building is unsafe for people to be living in

1225
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
I am

1226
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,263
I mean it didn't happen

1227
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,567
And don't you know what I would guarantee

1228
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:00,895
Even though there was a mass tragedy

1229
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,687
They're not going to

1230
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,735
And the building was

1231
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
Just inhabited by Muslims

1232
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:09,343
Diverse population of poor people

1233
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
How much

1234
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,903
How many

1235
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:12,671
Like

1236
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,231
Death

1237
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
It's not worth a lot

1238
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
No

1239
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:23,935
It's genuinely

1240
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:28,287
Soylent

1241
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,079
Middle-class people's homes

1242
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,615
Which is complete b*******

1243
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,895
Corbin Assange

1244
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,967
Rich people's homes

1245
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
That are just empty

1246
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:40,831
Better just always empty because they own the property

1247
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
And they're waiting for the values to go

1248
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,415
So f******

1249
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,183
Get

1250
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,975
Do a good thing

1251
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:52,863
Put these people in there until they can move someone realistically there's no way to

1252
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
Like

1253
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:56,191
Tell people they have to do that

1254
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:02,079
So it's not a Galaxy's even misrepresenting the situation there's no way to force people into other people's homes

1255
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
And that's not really what

1256
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Discuss this more

1257
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
This is a proposal

1258
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,455
This is something that we should do

1259
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,759
Yeah it's

1260
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:10,783
Should I dilute

1261
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,575
People need to be taken care of it

1262
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Absurd

1263
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,111
This is

1264
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:16,927
The people

1265
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,999
The people write public are being victimized

1266
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,279
And have been victimized

1267
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,071
And you have an opportunity to really help

1268
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Pre-market

1269
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,887
Also I've seen

1270
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:28,959
Prosperity

1271
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,031
Really bad judge of things cuz I thought

1272
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
Like 9/11

1273
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:33,567
Was going to be

1274
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,359
In the tenth 20,000

1275
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,223
Yeah but if I saw that I saw the grenfell tower

1276
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,527
I can't imagine that's not hungry

1277
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:46,879
Well

1278
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
More people are still called messy

1279
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:55,071
Read some really sad thing about a guy got out with his old old wife

1280
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
And he knows that she

1281
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,423
She got out of the building

1282
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
But you can't find her

1283
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Jesus

1284
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,543
That sort of stuff is just like

1285
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,615
When Alex makes these bucking

1286
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
Declaration

1287
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
Things about stuff

1288
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:13,247
It's so hard to look at the real life stories of the people who are

1289
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,039
The victims of these things and not think

1290
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
How did you

1291
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,343
Look into this at all

1292
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,647
Do you know what you're talkin about

1293
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,415
Are you

1294
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
Willfully ignoring

1295
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
Right

1296
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:26,047
It is

1297
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:29,119
Like when we started doing this

1298
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,655
We started doing this podcast

1299
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
There was far less

1300
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
Just abject

1301
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Let's Patrol

1302
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Yeah

1303
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:40,895
It's turned into

1304
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:41,919
These people

1305
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Ark

1306
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,455
Rule

1307
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:45,759
Like they're immoral

1308
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,575
They don't give a fuk

1309
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:51,135
Like the

1310
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,671
I mean

1311
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,463
There should be

1312
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,511
Seriously

1313
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,071
And they're almost always want

1314
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,863
Now I want it I want to say this

1315
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,191
Alex Jones has a big

1316
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,519
The media likes to say it's 6 million that they're talking

1317
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,799
Pinpoint now I don't believe that

1318
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:14,943
Is GoFundMe for the info

1319
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:19,551
Or he was going to be like $400

1320
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,671
But be that as it may he still does have a ton of listeners

1321
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:27,743
Legitimately if he wanted to

1322
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:32,095
He could try and mobilize them to help the people who were

1323
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,887
Victims of the tragedy

1324
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:38,751
If he cares about the idea of rich people having to put these people in their houses

1325
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,055
He be like everyone I'm starting a fun

1326
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,383
We're going to get hotels for all the people who've been affected

1327
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,919
Via 6 million people

1328
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,943
Everyone donate

1329
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
Two boxes of 12 million dollars

1330
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,271
Hotel

1331
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,807
Campaign

1332
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,599
For all

1333
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
Call Samira

1334
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,183
For all the people displaced by the fire

1335
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,511
But you can't because he thinks Muslim started it's called Raya

1336
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,863
Well Emma the GoFundMe numbers that they put out was last year

1337
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,655
Half of GoFundMe was

1338
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Medical expense

1339
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,239
The numbers going up

1340
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
Yeah

1341
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,287
So anyway

1342
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
We got to go whenever people have to

1343
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,639
Crowdsource

1344
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:18,943
Being alive

1345
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,479
Two strong bigotry out of

1346
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:24,063
John dumelo voice coming in there even

1347
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
Podcast

1348
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
He hasn't really talked about

1349
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,559
I want to go over some of these men pieces because

1350
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,375
Unattended to business

1351
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:40,959
But I know Megyn Kelly's planning I want to let her know

1352
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:46,847
And our controllers and those stupid Ford Foundation Spooks they've got running Refrigeration

1353
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,431
I just want to know that I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you

1354
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,015
And

1355
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,367
I want them to know that I either angles because they're pathetic

1356
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,767
Because I'm good but because you

1357
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,047
Heart attack

1358
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,423
I know your mind better than you do I want you to understand that

1359
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,239
Groceries delivered your father

1360
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,031
Important

1361
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,847
48 l

1362
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,919
Blown out the garbage

1363
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,015
You're gone

1364
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
University want to keep you

1365
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
You can go to my phone

1366
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:36,511
Heaven destroyed

1367
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,327
Bloody

1368
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:47,007
But you're so weak lobotomize toad

1369
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
New every move you're going to make before you ever made it

1370
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,151
Are you saying you're lobotomize toad

1371
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,711
Yeah I think it is beyond Alliance

1372
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:59,295
He knows all their moves ahead of time

1373
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,135
I do like the fact that he doesn't believe in hell

1374
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:09,023
I just don't understand why people would want over not exist

1375
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,655
Yeah I don't know I don't know where I land on it I think reincarnation

1376
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
People live new experiences

1377
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,287
Give it give me a give me a goodbye

1378
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,895
Funeral home still alive farewell

1379
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,735
Is responsible

1380
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,783
Inevitability

1381
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,831
Going to stop at

1382
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,647
Megyn Kelly you're going to hell

1383
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Yeah

1384
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,975
It's like you are going

1385
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,279
To be destroyed by the universe

1386
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,351
Right Hunters Miss does not want you anymore

1387
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:46,143
Desperate that's really pathetic

1388
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:50,239
He can't own up to public scrutiny of the things he says

1389
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
EXO

1390
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,847
Is going to hell they're demons

1391
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:55,871
They're pedophiles

1392
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:56,895
It's

1393
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,663
It's nonsense

1394
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
It's it's to me

1395
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
A great indication that he is so scared

1396
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
About this

1397
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:04,831
Another thing I wanted to bring up

1398
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,391
Is I go back and forth on whether he's drunk

1399
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
I can't tell

1400
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
Episode

1401
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:14,559
It's hard to say cuz he has the wrong f****** posit

1402
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,351
He gets worked over there

1403
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,423
Bridget those are sort of indication that he's drunk

1404
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,215
But he's not

1405
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,519
Liquido drunk

1406
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,567
Be tipsy drums

1407
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,919
Cocktail Jones

1408
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Something like that

1409
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,015
This

1410
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:37,855
Oh no

1411
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,159
I don't like the tone you just started

1412
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:49,887
Jordan it's not so much

1413
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:50,655
An adventure

1414
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
That

1415
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:54,495
There're certain Revelations

1416
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,567
About Alex Jones

1417
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
And one of them is

1418
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:02,943
He's way more into certain things than we realize this is

1419
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:06,271
Sort of more proof of that getting back to 12 dimensions

1420
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,831
It's not quite that

1421
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
Okay

1422
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
Let's begin

1423
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:20,863
With the greatest abuse of a life

1424
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:24,959
This planet

1425
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
Has ever seen climate change

1426
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:36,479
It's the Industrial Revolution causing climate change and nobody doing anything about it right

1427
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,063
Doordash

1428
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,367
Just miles from where I sit

1429
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
Research laboratory

1430
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
That is in

1431
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,351
All the major medical and

1432
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,911
Genetic engineering literature

1433
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
And complete

1434
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:01,823
Joke

1435
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,455
To the people

1436
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,271
But are so self-centered

1437
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
They don't realize that the fall

1438
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:15,903
Species their fault

1439
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,951
Shell shellfish they don't know

1440
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,975
They're interconnect

1441
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
So foolish

1442
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
Show on God-fearing

1443
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,375
Weird ramble but you're wrong on all of your death

1444
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Chimeras

1445
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:35,871
Oh yeah oh yeah maybe this is the maybe this is the one time of year that he smoke pot

1446
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:42,271
I can definitely see that no cuz that was on Rogan show that was the only few months ago

1447
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:46,111
Obviously like his course

1448
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,695
The way his thoughts were disjointed the way he's like

1449
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,303
Nibbling on an edible or something like that

1450
01:09:55,839 --> 01:10:00,447
The word about to get deep into chimera

1451
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,031
I'm totally on board

1452
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,871
Not his version of chimera

1453
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:14,271
What I want

1454
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,087
Tanuki

1455
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,879
Move on its own

1456
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:24,255
Your f****** lazy lazy finger

1457
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,583
So let's get on with it let's get it

1458
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:32,959
It's been Declassified because the information was not released the seventies that the Nazis

1459
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:35,519
By 1938 were able to clone rabbit

1460
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Researchers

1461
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,455
They were able to splice

1462
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,479
Humans

1463
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,503
And other mammals

1464
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
Hold on

1465
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,599
By the seventies it's not been

1466
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,135
Declassified in

1467
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
Peer-reviewed studies

1468
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,463
They were able to create

1469
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,279
Human insect

1470
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:01,631
Oh f*** yeah

1471
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:07,519
Fish porcine

1472
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
Canopy bed

1473
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,383
Alright I'm in

1474
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Pause

1475
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,063
Mammals

1476
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,231
I remember like 22 years ago

1477
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:32,095
Read BBC articles about Halford Britain

1478
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,375
But how

1479
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:36,447
It remained classified and then I parked

1480
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:41,567
The sum of the genetic engineer is well-known people to help patents animators going to dollars

1481
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,895
These are serious scientist and they told me they said

1482
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:51,551
They said the stuff going on underground labs is is beyond any alien movie you've ever seen

1483
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,343
This is crazy

1484
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,183
I like how you described it basically

1485
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:03,583
Basically like a suicide drink that you would do when you're a kid and like a McDonald's and you would just put a little bit of

1486
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,631
Everything in there

1487
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:07,679
Spiders

1488
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
Porcine

1489
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,287
Turn off pad

1490
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
Mammals

1491
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:19,455
But you talk about each of us individually being sliced

1492
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:27,647
We have time to get into all that Nibiru

1493
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,951
Just completely repetitive cuz the episode

1494
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:34,559
We recorded an episode tomorrow that's going to come out later in the week where we break down all of the

1495
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:38,399
Current episode yesterday episode

1496
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,263
Middle of the week and we get into the

1497
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,567
Specifics about is dumb ideas about

1498
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Things you saying a real

1499
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,479
Hey get this

1500
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,527
If there were documents

1501
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,575
That were classified

1502
01:12:57,087 --> 01:13:03,231
They would be everywhere everywhere

1503
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,279

There are fish people

1506
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:14,495
Now we have fish

1507
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:20,127
Humanize if they're legitimately peer-reviewed

1508
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
It would be one of the biggest deals

1509
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:32,415
No way that you could get even classify it enough for somebody would be

1510
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:35,999
It would be possible to keep it under wraps

1511
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,815
Somebody would be

1512
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
Chimera

1513
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,887
Any evidence

1514
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,191
Ever seen these on classified

1515

01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:05,439
Profound

1525
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:08,255
Let's get on with it let's move along

1526
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,559
It's just like the Isle of dr. Moreau

1527
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,351
Years ago

1528
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
H.g. Wells envisioned

1529
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:18,751
Genetic engineering in atomic weapons

1530
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:24,895
99 and then coming back here later wrote equations bigger

01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:29,247
Symbol of medicine Institute snakes the double-helix

1532
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,319
Zappa done before the first rodeo

1533
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,599
That's from Greek mythology

1534
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,487
They already know erase memory

1535
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,535
From other planets

1536
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:42,815
Creatures

1537
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:48,191
Laws and rights for humans

1538
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,215
You should

01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:54,079
Their new

1540
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:58,943
I just means not of this world. Originally this planet

1541
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
They were artificially created

1542
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:01,503
Oh he's hot

1543
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,111
And this is the true Revolution

1544
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:09,695
Positronic rollectra

1545
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:13,791

01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:21,727
The internet in the 50

1549
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:24,031
They should call it at that email

1550
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,847
Coin email

1551
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,407
Are you talking about

1552
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,735
Do you have the Breakaway civilization

1553
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
Do do you got to Breakaway civilization

1554
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:35,807
He's made his point

1555
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,135
I don't know

1556
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:45,279
I mean there were there were like Elementary computers

1557
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,679
60

1558
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,519
What is wrong

1559
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Like

1560
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:04,991
These global

1561
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,783
The break

1562
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:07,807
Elevation is he called

1563
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,599
They have erase memory

1564
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,647
Possibly from another provider

1565
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,183
There aliens

1566
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,487
And or extra-dimensional demons

1567
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:18,815
That are coming in and they're trying to make animal hybrids

1568
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,863
Do you realize

1569
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,935
Like this is not a political show

1570
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:29,311
This is a lunatic I don't think it's his audience

1571
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,335
Even like

1572
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
Someone

1573
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
Who wasn't nuts

1574
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:35,711
Spelled out exactly what he was actually saying to them

1575
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,271
Hold on

1576
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:43,135
Libertarian

1577
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,439
If you were a libertarian

1578
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:51,839
You would have to be on board with the free market creating if there's

1579
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:58,239
Is a market for camara's Libertarians are super into you owning your own body

1580
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,519
Body and what-have-you

1581
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:00,287
The right

1582
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:03,615
Of the chimera

1583
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,175
I think I think they wouldn't be into it

1584
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
Is it still be texting is being done on living things

1585
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,783
That's true

1586
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,111
But I also know I don't know

1587
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,647
What is the official

1588
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:17,951
Call Rand Paul right now

1589
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,535
The official libertarian stance

1590
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,631
Alzheimer is it

1591
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,935
I am just I'm just wondering

1592
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,751
What is your official position on chimeras

1593
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:37,151
Did you know it's illegal to f*** your cousin in my stay

1594
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,711
Got to go

1595
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:44,831
I love I love the idea that we got to go

1596
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:50,719
So it was like well if I was just takes a little bit of a break from talking about don't worry it'll come back

1597
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:53,023
But he wants to say something

1598
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
Specific words

1599
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,815
Megyn Kelly about

1600
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,215
That's just one aspect of this

1601
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:05,311
I said statistically is cancer rates continue to grow

1602
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,151
Your three children by the time you're 67 years old

1603
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:17,087
Are going to die and she said how dare you say you want my children died of cancer

1604
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,671
If I taped it to Megan I just said to you

1605
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,487
If there's any human left in you I said

1606
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,047
This is the end of us were being set up for extinction

1607
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:27,839
Level 7 test plan

1608
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:31,167
Don't want to escape this evening machines

1609
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,471
David told humans

1610
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:35,519
4shared

1611
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:41,151
Whatever it is I don't know but I can see it's work it's not of this world it's not him

1612
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:45,503
Kraynak said that she sent me text messages

1613
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,111
Show the text messages

1614
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,903
NBC4

1615
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,463
Horses that shows she still had Humanity

1616
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,511
Sheepishly collapse

1617
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:59,583
Totally panicky totally scared about her career

1618
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,887
She's done three episodes

1619
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:07,519
Also I would posit that it's possible that if you're talking about her kids getting cancer and what have you

1620
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,311
Even if it is in the context

1621
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
That you think it's in

1622
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,127
Kind of bullying

1623
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:18,783
That's a little abusive I don't think he would you don't do what I say your kids will die

1624
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,831
Someone else

1625
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,231
I think that's kind of abusive

1626
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,535
Idea to save his kids

1627
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:33,119
Same keep him away from

1628
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:36,959
I don't I don't which is also the official position of Liberty

1629
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:46,175
Even if he thinks he can rationalize

1630
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,479
She's having an emotional response to

1631
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,247
I just

1632
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:55,135
Just come here to do an interview talk about my f****** kid

1633
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,183
Yeah you're affected by me

1634
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:59,487
Cuz you're weak

1635
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:00,767
So

1636
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
Abuse

1637
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,119
Yeah it doesn't even come down to gender lines or anything like that

1638
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,679
Well it does

1639
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
But it.

1640
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
It's just

1641
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,007
Like Alex Jones

1642
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,543
Is being a s*** person

1643
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,336
Trying to

1644
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:16,896
Response to him being a shity person

1645
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,200
Into a way for him to be even more

1646
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
Right

1647
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:26,368
Don't worry about your career you're upset because I told you

1648
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,464
That I have four children and our Destinies are tied together

1649
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,328
I still have to make the decision to have those children even though I knew this knowledge

1650
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:38,144
14 years ago my first child

1651
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,032
We do know that he did have to make a choice cuz he's for multiple abortions in the past

1652
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:47,104
Also we found out that he didn't pay for those abortions

1653
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:53,504
His dad did but me knows about that personal responsibility

1654
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
Philosophy

1655
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:56,064
Statistically Megan

1656
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:59,904
Already one of your three children will die before you have cancer

1657
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,488
If the numbers keep growing all three will die by the time you're 60

1658
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:07,328
That's f***** up looking

1659
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,632
That's not what I swear

1660
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,008
The child had to make the decision to put them in a toxic environment

1661
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:20,384
Because I'm decidedly I had to make the bed with you and try to fix this

1662
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
Battlefield

1663
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,368
I know they're really doing it out of the plans we have moles inside your organization

1664
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:36,256
That we saying your kids are documents

1665
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:39,072
But we have the type of what I actually said make

1666
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:42,912
Cannabis are going to make it out alive

1667
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,472
In 10 years in 20 years in 30 years

1668
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,544
You're going to sit over your daughters and your son

1669
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,480
He Sho glad to hear

1670
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:02,112
That you're panicking and depressed and crying and freaked out Jesus is that shows you do happy man

1671
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,648
What I saw in your eyes

1672
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,440
We were going back and forth

1673
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,768
Possessed by the force that controls you at you still

1674
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,840
You still like one of the thieves and murderers lacrosse

1675
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,912
You still at love God and you can ask

1676
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,008
Christ to cleanse you and you can say that you want live anytime

1677
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:22,848
Megan

1678
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,640
I love your children

1679
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,920
Oh this is f***** up

1680
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:29,504
That's so f***** up the audio drops out of

1681
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,344
Yeah there's probably some sort of technical glitch I don't I don't think

1682
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:39,744
I don't think they necessarily like cut anything

1683
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,864
Text that doesn't really show anything

1684
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,168
Black

1685
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,448
Text messages

1686
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
Hey dude

1687
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,032
What the f*** is wrong with you

1688
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:55,872
That would be good text your behavior is incredibly inappropriate

1689
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,200
Cuz I don't think we are to do a hatchet job

1690
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,480
Like we talked about

1691
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,248
Before the

1692
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,016
Show started

1693
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:05,088
She would love and softball that's right Amir Putin

1694
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,112
I don't think

1695
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,696
Fitness apparently she's there to be like

1696
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:11,232
I think more likely

1697
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,584
She's trying to get an interesting story out of it bring up

1698
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Sandy Hook

1699
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,400
You do have to bring up 9/11

1700
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:20,960
If you're talking to f****** Alex

1701
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:28,896
With what the f*** kind of interviews take anyone wants to do without you

1702
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,224
Well the one that I go to church on that's

1703
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Love that someday

1704
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,320
Cuz I'm a Christian but not these glitterbug churches

1705
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,600
Okay

1706
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,136
Betty White

1707
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:45,024
You can make jokes

1708
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,816
Plus you're old

1709
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:47,840
Truth

1710
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,912
They don't want to debate

1711
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,728
They kept the Quasi secret until now

1712
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
Nope

1713
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,920
They've done some weird stuff they've got whole research Labs they've got

1714
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:02,944
Cast

1715
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,296
They got people that are like

1716
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,600
1% wolf

1717
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:13,952
3% chimpanzee

1718
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,584
A really nice park near me

1719
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,680
Papers

1720
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,152
I'm bad you guys are going to pack in the lawsuit

1721
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,016
You are

1722
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,928
You should be pushing I'm worse than whatever you know Adam Lanza or whatever happened to Sandy Hook

1723
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,000
That's not the narrative it's being pushed is your guilt

1724
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,912
Guilt coming out because you know what you're responsible for you know

1725
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,960
That many of your listeners harass

1726
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:58,240
Sandy Hook

1727
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
Families

1728
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:02,080
Have you know that they probably wouldn't be doing that if it weren't for your info

1729
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:04,896
Now you're trying to pretend

1730
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
It's very cowardly

1731
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:09,504
Does not what a man would do

1732
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:12,320
So

1733
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,000
Yeah that is not that is not going on

1734
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:25,376
That would be more fun as we discussed basically reference in Gremlins

1735
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:29,984
That doesn't count for the references though okay

1736
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:37,408
We will discuss all the specifics of his Chimera is wack

1737
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,016
I just don't want to go over it all again

1738
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
As he brings

1739
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,832
Some other stuff up

1740
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,368
But

1741
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,464
The next episode is not quite as Chimera heavy

1742
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,512
Yeah

1743
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:53,280
Well

1744
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:55,584
Rhonda chimeras quite a bit

1745
01:25:57,632 --> 01:26:01,728
To talk about and we go where his wind blows

1746
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,008
This the slip-up

1747
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
Guess what

1748
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
Cameras

1749
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Well kind of

1750
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,872
But also about we're testing

1751
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,040
15 years ago by a engineer

1752
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,600
Biologist

1753
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,976
You think you know what's going on he said I'm going to show you something

1754
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
Took me in

1755
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,096
The DARPA labs

1756
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:33,216
Nope just restricted

1757
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,776
Just a Republican

1758
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,432
They said this is the monkey Farm in the Egg farm in Bastrop

1759
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:44,480
You see a little bit of this

1760
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,320
Punch up the strange I was like

1761
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,368
Jumping out of the Matrix Man

1762
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,392
It was just

1763
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:56,512
AirHead Extreme

1764
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,560
We're just testing

1765
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,352
The flicker rate for humans

1766
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:04,704
Heather Lavallee said yeah they get these women are they Pam

1767
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,496
They masturbate they watch p***

1768
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,544
Winchester Salt looked up to him

1769
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:12,128
What they're doing watching p***

1770
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,408
He said

1771
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:16,224
Work work work work setting the flicker rate

1772
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:21,344
So that we can just manipulate actually make women have psychological orgasm

1773
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,160
While they're watching television he said no

1774
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,952
This whole place is about women

1775
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,744
Everything we did was about 1

1776
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,328
Because women

1777
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,704
But it's like dark matter they can't measure it

1778
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,776
They can measure the response but they know there's a signal

1779
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,336
Women that is controlling men

1780
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:47,712
Women

1781
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:54,112
Then it got them like like like cyborg broadcasting kill the kill yourself death.

1782
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,416
Murder in rollover

1783
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:04,096
Is that not sophisticated

1784
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,680
I don't understand what my wife

1785
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:10,496
That's what he thinks feminism

1786
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,800
Yeah legitimately

1787
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,992
We can only measure the effects of it went dark matter

1788
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,136
What God

1789
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:30,720
Jesus Christ that bananas

1790
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:32,000
Some of the

1791
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,560
Seriously I couldn't but I can

1792
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,096
Listen to this and be like

1793
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,448
If he gave any goddamn specific

1794
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,216
To anything

1795
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:45,056
The only thing he says really specifically

1796
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,848
Edwin

1797
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:53,248
University lost thousands five they gave a

1798
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,552
4.3 million-dollar Grant

1799
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,344
The University of Austin

1800
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,136
University of Texas in Austin

1801
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:05,024
And here is a description of what they were doing there cuz it's all it's all very publicly available

1802
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,304
I've been single.

1803
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,376
The goal was to develop a new class

1804
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:13,472
Technology scalable power-efficient high-performance microprocessor

1805
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,544
Women to women

1806
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,080
To make them hate my exact

1807
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:20,896
Oops is designed to produce an architecture

1808
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,920
Scale down to

1809
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,456
The future semiconductor process

1810
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:26,272
Accelerating industrial consumer embedded

1811
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,552
And scientific workload

1812
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
Calculator

1813
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,368
A second with

1814
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,160
Today's weather

1815
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:34,976
Scale-down microchips and speed up position

1816
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:39,840
Absolutely getting of different universities and University

1817
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:40,864
Steve Texas at Austin

1818
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,728
Was Kepler and Doug

1819
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:50,592
Does not appear from any indications also this article gives out both of their phone numbers

1820
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,944
You're really suspicious about them you could go ahead and

1821
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,784
That's what what's up with DARPA

1822
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:05,440
Also there's a robotics lab that may have something to do with some DARPA funding at the University of

1823
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,488
Exhausting but again this is not

1824
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,768
It's not at all buddy

1825
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,560
Talking about

1826
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
Who's providing funding

1827
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
For the

1828
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:20,800
Let's make women masturbate in see if they can send out a signal to control men I think that what he's saying is

1829
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,104
Cuz I don't understand the bachelor

1830
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,152
I don't understand drag race

1831
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:31,296
Why do women like these shows and it must be because their kids are coming

1832
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,320
Specifically designed

1833
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,856
To give women psychologic

1834
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,136
Magical orgasm

1835
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,440
Literally

1836
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:39,488
I know about vaginal orgasm

1837
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,816
Was unaware of psychological orgasm

1838
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:48,448
You don't have to come just by a certain

1839
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,264
Anthem

1840
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:57,408
Is it is true

1841
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,176
Not quite

1842
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,992
But I would say turn off the radio

1843
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
And this is bigger than hip-hop

1844
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,368
They schools can't teach us

1845
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,952
Crackers and City Hall

1846
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,768
I want to do more

1847
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:19,168
Going to come up

1848
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,472
Black Labrador Retrievers

1849
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:27,360
Walking to the slap we got microscopic cameras

1850
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,760
Scanning people

1851
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,576
News

1852
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,136
NSA whistleblowers

1853
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:45,024
Structured person

1854
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:51,424
This woman because she's going over the bad guy that said Sandy Hook

1855
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,544
We are at the question just like babies

1856
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:01,664
I mean he has real only defense that he has is the babies in incubators

1857
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
Which was

1858
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,248
Palacios testimony

1859
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,272
In the lead-up

1860
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
To the first

1861
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,832
Iraq war Desert Storm

1862
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,136
There was the daughter of the

1863
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
Kuwaiti

1864
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:12,672
President

1865
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:15,744
Remember exactly I apologize

1866
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,376
But she gave testimony that people were coming and taking the incubators and leaving babies to die

1867
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:28,032
Visceral sort of gave people a real show this is horrifying

1868
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,824
But it was not the only impetus

1869
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,128
Four people going into Desert Storm

1870
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:34,688
No but it was bound to be

1871
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:36,992
She wasn't telling the truth

1872
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:42,368
Right but that's his only real defense

1873
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:45,696
People have lied about that kids before

1874
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,744
But he's also lying

1875
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,560
He said that it didn't happen we played the clip 100 times

1876
01:32:52,096 --> 01:32:54,144
Very specifically over and over again

1877
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,936
Said that Sandy Hook was fake

1878
01:32:56,448 --> 01:33:02,592
He was excited that robbed FBI agent uncle was going to go Rogue and investigated

1879
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:05,664
Great so I mean it's all bulshit

1880
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
It's all bulshit

1881
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,272
What NSA whistleblower

1882
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
What kind of

1883
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:18,720
Also isn't he against whistleblowers as long as they are not agree with there's a there's a thin line about

1884
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:23,328
You believe them

1885
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,352
Meaning

1886
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,120
Coming to me

1887
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,144
Usher

1888
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,448
Yeah but the other thing is

1889
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:29,984
Sure

1890
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:36,384
He says this woman is sitting in front of me with her millions of dollars

1891
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,712
Megyn Kelly

1892
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:42,272
Accidental driving it is

1893
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,064
Is first of all there's the misogyny

1894
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,136
There is the idea that like

1895
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,440
I've been to these DARPA labs

1896
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,976
Seeing all this s***

1897
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:51,744
You think

1898
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,280
You know stuff

1899
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:56,608
But you can't convince anybody that you're not lying

1900
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:59,424
Jon Ronson

1901
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:02,752
Going on record very clear that he was with you

1902
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,336
Every listen to at the beginning of episode you said

1903
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,872
Bet you he's not going to tell his

1904
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:14,784
You're aware of the fact

1905
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,344
Do women masturbate

1906
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,136
Horse knots

1907
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:23,488
Being like Megan you don't know shitt I've got all this information I'm the real truth

1908
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:26,816

1910
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,888
Something otherwise all the

1911
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:30,656

1912
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,424
Chimeras

I even show you the thousands

1915
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,920
Research articles

1916
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,200
About

1917
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,504

1918
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,784
Sodalite

1919
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:51,648
First of all

1920
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,208
He doesn't even show us those articles if you wants to prove anything

1921
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:01,376
He just said all this stuff only in America and now he's going to talk about something in China

1922
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:03,168
Your wife has a baby

1923
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:04,704
First of milk

What's a she orders online

1928
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,552
He has a pen he's putting it in Life Insurance Corporation arm

1929
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,136
Chilling milk

1930
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:27,232
But do you know that milk is not from you

1931
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,280
The milk is produced

1932
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:31,840
On farms with cows

1933
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:33,632
2R

1934
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,216
99% in general

1935
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
Beulah studies

1936
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,640
Mammary glands

1937
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,736
Almost complete

1938
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:50,016
Giant

1939
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,296
Human breast

1940
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:56,416
Account on YouTube

1941
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,744
Then we'll show you the Giant

1942
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Optional

1943
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:03,840
I want to see the cow with giant

1944
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,752
So the implication is that they're so much worse that they're not showing up

1945
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,544
Bulshit

1946
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:16,128
Look that show me a cow with tips

1947
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:21,248
I'm going to guess it's the rest of the show

1948
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,784
I'm going to guess it's a Photoshop

1949
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,064
Google me

1950
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:32,256
I'm not given

1951
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,328
Write on the check tonight

1952
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,192
These are not real pictures

1953
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,496
There's one here

1954
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,544
There's one here but that's that's not real

1955
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,592
That's that's a cow with

1956
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:48,128
Tiffany said of utters

1957
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:52,480
Yeah but that's not real it's not a real real art piece

1958
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
Let's see

1959
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,552
How does a disorders

1960
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,320
Those are all just

1961
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Shutters

1962
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,648
Route 222

1963
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,720
That looks like a daughter that

1964
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:03,488
You could

1965
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,280
Maybe say looks like a titty

1966
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:07,072
This is disappointing

1967
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:09,376
Yeah you probably saw that are peas

1968
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:16,032
I don't believe that Alex would be able to or interested in knowing

1969
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:20,896
Other picture was fake or not but he looked at the Army

1970
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
In China

1971
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:33,440
A good thing article here from 2011

1972
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:38,304
Professor ning Li was the scientist who led the research

1973
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:44,448
Eye of the state key Laboratories for Agro biotechnology to China agricultural University

1974
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:49,056
He insists the GM genetically modified milk

1975
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,104
Is milk from ordinary dairy cows

1976
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:51,872
She said quote

1977
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,664
The milk taste stronger than normal

1978
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,712
I don't know what that means

1979
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:01,088
Quote we aim to commercialize Azaria incoming in the coming three years

1980
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,880
For the human like milk

1981
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:06,720
10 years or more time will be required to finally for this enhance

1982
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
Milk into the customers cup

1983
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:12,096
Absolutely

1984
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,400
I mean you can't you can't say that

1985
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:20,032
This article that I'm reading that from is what he flashes on the screen

1986
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,104
Direct opposition

1987
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,432
I think he's sighting or the thing you claiming as like

1988
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:29,248
Proof because the headline of the article

1989
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,552
The headline of the article

1990
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:34,624
Is genetically-modified cows produce human milk

1991
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,744
And because the headline says that he doesn't have to deal with what's right under the fold

1992
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,072
Which actually is exactly the opposite of his bizarre fantasy

1993
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,376
Is it do you think I icing

1994
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:47,424
There is a certain amount of

1995
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,984
Does have to go to

1996
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,264
Go to the

1997
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:57,152
Go to the editors of all of these things because they are oftentimes

1998
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,504
Just like Sensational journalism I don't deserve it has

1999
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:06,112
Even then most a lot of those wind up being like

2000
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:07,904
This is possible

2001
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,464
Cuz we talked to a scientist

2002
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:13,536
And even when we talked to that scientist he was like

2003
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
This probably won't

2004
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:21,728
But maybe you could I don't disagree but I understand the business are genetically modified

2005
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,032
Cows produce human milk

2006
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,824
Yeah bear

2007
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,384
That's pretty fair

2008
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,152
Definitely

2009
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:37,600
Dangerous

2010
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,672
Jerome corsi

2011
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,488
When I was in the van

2012
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,400
And he told me about the stuff he saw these Laboratories in Maryland

2013
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:53,472
Now we tip it to a different story

2014
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,520
Explain something to you

2015
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,288
Whoosh

2016
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,920
Maryland serious I went to George Noory once in Austin Texas

2017
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:06,272
Completely overjoyed

2018
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:11,136
And he told me about the CIA and Killing Kennedy

2019
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,672
Now they came to his office

2020
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,512
Later life

2021
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:19,328
To Arms the country back into the family I want to Dallas

Lee Harvey Oswald body out of the crypt

The Sun

2026
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,344
Billiards basically

2027
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:45,440
They tried to kill him when he left

2028
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,000
And then threatened his family

2029
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,280
I talk to family

2030
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,496
Humanoids

2031
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:00,544
They're begging for help

2032
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,896
A boy

2033
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:08,480
It's the worst thing the children

2034
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
And then

2035
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,064
Like to suicide

2036
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,136
Very not suppose

I just been chosen

2041
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:29,984
To be a messenger at this point down the road

2042
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,544
I'm not worried this is so exhausting

2043
01:41:33,056 --> 01:41:35,616
I want to die.

2044
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:41,760

You are kind of living tell you what I know exactly

2047
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,096
Lying

2048
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,656
It's very hard to do

2049
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,448
For twenty years to lie

2050
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:02,240
Is very stressful

2051
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,008
It's tough

2052
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,800
If you were just telling the truth

2053
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:09,920
You would not feel the immense pressure that your aunt

2054
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:12,992
I would have been chosen by God to be a messenger

2055
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:20,928
I am a prophet of the lord we heard in 2015

2056
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:26,304
He had a prophetic dream

2057
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
No no

2058
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:32,192
We're going to the next clip where I told you to hold on to this idea

2059
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:35,264
This clip is where he spells out I think

2060
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:36,032
A biopic

2061
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
Schizophrenia

2062
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,384
You talkin about

2063
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,944
Race memory being something that is just

2064
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:43,968
Encoded in our genes

2065
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,272
I think he thinks and pictures

2066
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,296
Straight talk to him

2067
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,832
We'll see what you think

2068
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,392
Can I get made fun of by subpart

2069
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:58,304
F*** you stupid lawyer cross-examination

2070
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,680
Let me respond

2071
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:06,496
I hope Megyn Kelly's kids, years old

2072
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,592
By then I can live forever

2073
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,360
Literal

2074
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,408
But I won't be silicon

2075
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,576
Let me forever to your children and grandchildren

2076
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,624
Do the ideas picture stand for

2077
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,416
Stupid

2078
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:28,000
My ancestors are alive right now they're sitting here

2079
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:33,120
I want to fight

2080
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,752
Stop

2081
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,568
So I don't know how much that is metaphor

2082
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,384
I don't know how that could be a tall metaphor

2083
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:49,248
I could see a way of like thinking the pride of your lineage

2084
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:51,552
Like maybe if maybe if he was

2085
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:53,856
Maybe if he was pointing to himself

2086
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:54,880
Like

2087
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,952
In here

2088
01:43:58,208 --> 01:44:01,280
Yeah he's like my ancestors are right here next to me

2089
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:03,072
How do you say

2090
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,888
I am

2091
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
Yeah I think he talks to ghosts

2092
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,520
Yeah I think there's a possibility that he legitimately talks

2093
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:16,128
Well there's another part later in the episode where he appears to be responding to something

2094
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:17,664
Isn't there

2095
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:22,016
F*** yeah we'll get to a little bit later

2096
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,064
They just created really fun.

2097
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
Fairies like

2098
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,072
Is wacky bulshit that he's on

2099
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:37,376
The liftoff

2100
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,192
Misrepresenting

2101
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:42,752
I think I'm going to just go ahead and cut the

2102
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:43,776
Getting repetitive

2103
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:47,360
But

2104
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,664
How to set up the clip

2105
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
It's creepy

2106
01:44:51,456 --> 01:44:52,480
Oh boy that's weird

2107
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:58,368
Subway let me just get a few other subjects now that I've covered Megyn Kelly and I open children of 1,000 years

2108
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,928
Their children with a trillion years

2109
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
Affinity

2110
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,048
Because we are the Sheldon

2111
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,096
Very selfish person

2112
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,888
I want the big Birthright

2113
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,168
I want the next level

2114
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:12,448
I want it all

2115
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,776
The big Master architect and I'm ready

2116
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,336
Selfish person

2117
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:21,408
I want the next level

2118
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,600
Other stories

2119
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:31,648
It right there that no

2120
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,696
Was not in response to any

2121
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:38,560
And maybe there's somebody off camera or something like that

2122
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:41,632
But he appears to be wrestling with a thought in his head

2123
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:43,680
Yeah I want the next level

2124
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:47,520
I want the master builder to know that I'm ready

2125
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:48,288
He thinks the next

2126
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
I mean

2127
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:53,664
Turn on if you wanted pretend he's actually Cristiano Could Be Heaven

2128
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,736
If you want

2129
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:01,856
He believes in an eternal reward

2130
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:06,720
But if you like in the same way

2131
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,792
That cloud again

2132
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,096
I don't I don't see him

2133
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:16,448
More like

2134
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:23,104
Where is the forest ghost possible I think it could be a

2135
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:27,456
Sort of futurism thing where we become a type 1 civilization

2136
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:33,856
Realizing the keys the one working again

2137
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:36,416
Would be like a fully-realized

2138
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,976
United Humanity

2139
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
But

2140
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:50,240
Keep saying believing in anything other than

2141
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,032
I can become like

2142
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,824
You saying I'm very selfish

2143
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:57,664
See him thinking that there is some sort of

2144
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:02,016
Next level of his own conch

2145
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:08,672
Right

2146
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:19,424
Looking more into like a guy situation

2147
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,216
We're all part of the Earth

2148
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:27,616
Energy you referring to God is like the master builder is very Masonic

2149
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,896
Realtor

2150
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,296
I don't know I mean it's a mystery but I want play it back I want to play the end of that back

2151
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:38,880
Because I want you to I want it like really wrestle with this no

2152
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,672
Master architect and I'm ready

2153
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,976
Incredibly selfish person

2154
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,304
I want the next level

2155
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,776
Other stories

2156
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:59,616
It's unlike anything I've ever heard on the show before

2157
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:03,456
And I know we might be making a mountain out of a molehill

2158
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:09,856
But the idea that my ancestors are right here eternal life is already around us

2159
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:12,160
You live on through your

2160
01:48:12,416 --> 01:48:14,464
Ancestors and progeny

2161
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,768
I want the next level

2162
01:48:18,816 --> 01:48:24,960
That's not how we would respond to someone like one of his employees off camera

2163
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,568
They're just a hairy f***** up

2164
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,616
That's weird this is a man breaking

2165
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,920
Cuz I do

2166
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:38,016
If maybe he's high amp breaker

2167
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:40,064
Cuz he knows

2168
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,184
It's all because of

2169
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:46,208
Megyn Kelly

2170
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
And

2171
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,024
He's not ready for primetime

2172
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:52,096
He's not ready for people to scrutinize at Mannino's it

2173
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,120
F****** Nosa

2174
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:57,472
I just don't understand what this 11-minute interview

2175
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
Possibly have

2176
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:02,080
Five times longer than that and yeah

2177
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:06,688
Way worse

2178
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:11,552
Like there's no way like I ever met Kelly I would air this

2179
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:16,416
With no interview at all but just 11 minutes of this ago

2180
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:24,096
Like the way he's

2181
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,376
Portrayed as a kid

2182
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:26,144
Conspiracy

2183
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:29,472
Because he is so much more insane

2184
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:33,568
The future episode we're going to talk like

2185
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,384
Passing reference to Mars

2186
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,992
Right he's a guy who has much more of just a conspiracy

2187
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:43,808
Or someone like Richard Belzer

2188
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:49,184
Like those people are they wanted the distrust the government and they want to dig into things

2189
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:51,488
Alex Jones is not that

2190
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:55,328
That's why I speculated on our most recently released episode

2191
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,888
Uses the glittery Allure

2192
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,680
Conspiracy theory to bring people

2193
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,704
Into his psyche

2194
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:05,312
Weird religiously bent white nationalist world

2195
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,104
More really about

2196
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:12,224
Yeah it may be in the maybe in the past it was more about conspiracy theories but that f****** boat is sale

2197
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,760
We are in

2198
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,040
Territory

2199
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:19,648
This is crazy and I can't imagine like any of his

2200
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,696
I have to

2201
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,512
What does I think a lot of it

2202
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:25,280
Employees are going to leave

2203
01:50:25,792 --> 01:50:28,352
You think so it goes down

2204
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:31,936
I think I've taken down from outside is

2205
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,728
Everybody just kind of band

2206
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,800
The level of self-indulgence

2207
01:50:37,056 --> 01:50:38,336
The level of

2208
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,360
Insanity

2209
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:42,432
I'm going on in the last week and a half feet up

2210
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:46,272
To this interview I mean you're never going to lose David Knight

2211
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:49,088
Probably never going to lose Rob do a f******

2212
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
Years

2213
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,624
But

2214
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,952
Emilia Macado's already on an extended hiatus

2215
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:56,512
Might not be back

2216
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:59,840
Millie Weaver I don't know maybe she'll leave who the f***

2217
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:07,008
Make a lot of these other characters of already gone

2218
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:12,640
Already has the life-extension technology very well may

2219
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,736
But then

2220
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:17,760
Beyonce

2221
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:20,064
If he does release

2222
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:21,344
Facebook

2223
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,368
If he has

2224
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,416
Audio of everything

2225
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,208
It does inject

2226
01:51:26,464 --> 01:51:27,232
A lot of really into

2227
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:28,512
Everything legal issues

2228
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,792
But whether he has the right

2229
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,072
To that interview

2230
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,632
I could see him getting sued

2231
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,192
For doing that if he has that audio and releases it

2232
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,520
I mean I could I could see a lot of possible outcomes

2233
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,800
And none of them are good for

2234
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,592
Nope

2235
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
Nope

2236
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,688
It's and he knows it

2237
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,712
Yeah

2238
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:51,808
This has been such a strange six months

2239
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,600
Yeah

2240
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,904
I have such a hard time believing

2241
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,184
Where we started

2242
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:58,720
Verses where we are now

2243
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,024
Banana

2244
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:03,584
It is interesting

2245
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:06,656
256 episodes original

2246
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:07,680
Like just

2247
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,216
Even our

2248
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,264
Pretense that we started with is gone

2249
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
No abs

2250
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:15,616
Salute

2251
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:19,968
Laugh at this Airport

2252
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:23,040
Still kind of

2253
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:26,112
And now it's like holyshit Batman on the loose

2254
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,416
And we're getting these glimpses from his path

2255
01:52:28,672 --> 01:52:30,720
But really explain it like rental abuse

2256
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,256
Ivy

2257
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
Nipping

2258
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,816
Fumes under a building

2259
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:37,888
The wacky

2260
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:40,960
Head trauma

2261
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:46,592
Traumatic head trauma

2262
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:49,408
Did it might be expressing itself through

2263
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,200
Messianic beliefs

2264
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,248
It probably is expressing itself through

2265
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,528
The belief that he's

2266
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,576
Communicating with dead relatives

2267
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,344
Right

2268
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,624
I don't know anyway

2269
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
We're not done

2270
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,696
Alex wants to talk about liberal violence

2271
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,232
Finally

2272
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:07,840
Finally there's an article of the Daily Caller that is something everyone should read

2273
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:11,424
I spent probably 30 minutes this morning that I didn't have reading this

2274
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:17,824
Forgot

2275
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:18,848
I mean

2276
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:20,896
People that murdered Scout

2277
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:24,736
Burn shot one Overkill leftist slaughtering

2278
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:25,760
Police

2279
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:28,832
Conservatives shooting

2280
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,024
Only a fraction

2281
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,096
All these crimes are being reported

2282
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:45,728
The exponential level of what we're facing

2283
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:52,640
Interesting that you want to use that logic when conservatives don't seem to be all that interested in going to really give

2284
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,432
Bring some validity to Rachel

2285
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:56,736
Differences in police reporting

2286
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,368
Throw away any kind of hip-hop

2287
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,136
Chrissy arguments

2288
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:09,280
There's no there's no getting Beyond

2289
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,304
Well

2290
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,120
They don't

2291
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
Hair

2292
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:15,424
Like

2293
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:19,776
If I am being hypocritical

2294
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:22,848
I know I want to have some sort of

2295
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,152
Bluelight I want to have some sort of idea logic

2296
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,176
Belief system

2297
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,200
That is

2298
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,224
Consistent

2299
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:32,832
Play the world

2300
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:34,880
Like the whole point of that

2301
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:36,416
Is to be able to apply

2302
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,184
Quiet

2303
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,488
Across-the-board

2304
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,280
Yeah no

2305
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:46,912
So if your ideology only accepts when you think

2306
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:49,728
Things are bad versus when you think things are good

2307
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:52,032
And they have nothing to do with each other

2308
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:55,360
If they don't

2309
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:56,128
Hair

2310
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
About being hypocrites

2311
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:00,480
Like there's no such thing as a conservative ideology

2312
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,016
It's nothing

2313
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:02,784
It's nothing

2314
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,320
Cuz it's not even gun

2315
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,112
It's driving guns right now

2316
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:09,696
That guy is committing violence

2317
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:11,232
It's not like

2318
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:13,280
We need to support him for having

2319
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,304
Anna Gunn it's nothing

2320
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:17,632
They don't believe in anything other than

2321
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:20,704
Everybody is attacking them because their world is

2322
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:24,800
How does all the conservative ideology is right now

2323
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:25,568
It

2324
01:55:25,824 --> 01:55:27,872
World used to be this

2325
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:30,176
And now it's not and I will fight

2326
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,712
Tooth & Nail

2327
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,736
To try and make it

2328
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:35,296
Not back to what I thought

2329
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,064
Was supposed to be

2330
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:39,392
Yeah I'm looking at this as an hour this is

2331
01:55:39,904 --> 01:55:40,416
That's sad

2332
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,440
This is

2333
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,840
All top 20 I mean there are

2334
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,888
Some liberals that are

2335
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:52,704
Attacking people absolutely that's.

2336
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:56,288
That's not something that we necessarily condone across-the-board

2337
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:00,384
That's not really the most important conversation to be having right now though

2338
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,432
Cuz we got to flip it around

2339
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,224
Do you want to talk about conservative attack

2340
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,784
You're not going to like the outfit

2341
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:08,576
It's going to be much

2342
01:56:08,832 --> 01:56:09,600
Worst conversation

2343
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,880
But there's a bat

2344
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,904
That the false flag

2345
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
Every attack

2346
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,744
Every attack is organized by leftist

2347
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,024
Soros

2348
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,328
That that's what they always believe

2349
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:25,216
Yeah so good also he thinks like a really legitimately thinks the staging of Julius Caesar

2350
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:26,240
Is called

2351
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:29,824
To kill Trump not recognizing that every president has been debated

2352
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:37,248
I'm not trying to make an argument

2353
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:40,576
So he believes that and he believes that everyone is calling for Trump's dad

2354
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:45,696
You think that everyone's calling for him to be killed Brett

2355
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:50,048
Respond to what he wants to happen to people who are calling for the death of trump

2356
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:52,864
And the nothing that shows

2357
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:54,400
Did the courts are broken

2358
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:57,984
Mostly up y'all this is open sedition

2359
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,288
George Washington would have military team

2360
01:57:00,544 --> 01:57:02,336
Erratic 10,000 people tonight

2361
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,104
No he wouldn't

2362
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,440
Grimes

2363
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:20,512
Men women and children but if you shed

2364
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:25,632
If you like Patriots if you want to kill people

2365
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:31,264
Kill members of our military kill members of our citizens kill our people kill them

2366
01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:32,800
They sounded up warrants

2367
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
Drive to Walnut Avenue

2368
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:40,224
He raped a woman

2369
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:43,296
Lack of atrocity George Washington

2370
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,856
He was a rapist who owned

2371
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:49,696
You f****** in Fort Washington

2372
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:54,560
Maybe he has some Vision understanding of what we're dealing with the president

2373
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,632
We are being hot War George Washington president right now

2374
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:02,240
I don't have any blood loss after these dumb liberals I just know that they are organizing

2375
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:07,104
Murder and death publicly and it is a crime to let them do it

2376
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,640
So you better stop them

2377
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
How do you spell

2378
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:13,504
Probably kill him

2379
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:18,368
Which means we're justified in killing

2380
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:21,696
Also George Washington there are multiple incident

2381
01:58:21,952 --> 01:58:23,488
Pictures of him killing prisoners of War

2382
01:58:23,744 --> 01:58:25,280
Which is I don't know if

2383
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,048
The Geneva

2384
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,072
Around back then

2385
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:29,632
Applying our modern standards

2386
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,168
Atrocious abuses of Humana

2387
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,704
Prisoners of War supposed to

2388
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,984
Tubi

2389
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:37,312
Healing sleep sellers that to f*** you

2390
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:41,920
Argument is well it was everybody doing it go f*** your

2391
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:43,712
Go suck your

2392
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,016
No

2393
01:58:46,528 --> 01:58:47,552
I can't

2394
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,832
I can't fathom

2395
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,624
How

2396
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,392
Stupid

2397
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:54,208
If you are protesting

2398
01:58:54,464 --> 01:58:55,488
Julius Caesar

2399
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,280
You're a f******

2400
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,816
You're done

2401
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,352
You're stupid

2402
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:04,448
Not not recognizing at all murderers either is not a good thing

2403
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:07,264
Right

2404
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,544
And the rest of it shows

2405
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:14,944
The negative Fallout of democracy existed

2406
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,480
Killing us either it didn't

2407
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:19,808
Until 1770

2408
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:23,648
There were just kingdoms so like

2409
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,952
It is a Stark

2410
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,512
Misunderstanding and

2411
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,792
Just reactionary

2412
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:36,192
Think of what you're looking like you're killing my guy

2413
01:59:39,008 --> 01:59:40,288
Again

2414
01:59:40,544 --> 01:59:42,336
We're emphasizing with Alex

2415
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,104
Jones

2416
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,920
From time to time

2417
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,200
I like

2418
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,528
Reasons for why he's the way he is but I

2419
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:53,088
I stopped well short of saying

2420
01:59:53,856 --> 01:59:54,624
He should be pitied

2421
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,648
I think I

2422
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:57,440
Underoath

2423
01:59:57,696 --> 02:00:03,072
I'm saying pretty much a human like you see the difference

2424
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:06,400
Like none of these people f****** read the play

2425
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,168
Nope

2426
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:12,288
Also check the Soviets response was that he was going to put on it

2427
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:15,360
Play version

2428
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,896
The Salem witch trials

2429
02:00:17,152 --> 02:00:18,944
And they're going to burn Hillary at the stake

2430
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:23,040
Do it someone very astutely pointed out it's called The Crucible and again

2431
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:28,928
The good guys were not the people burning Hillary

2432
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:32,256
You just don't know what you're talkin about they're very dumb

2433
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,048
Very dumb angry people

2434
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,328
But you shouldn't kill him

2435
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,352
No of course not

2436
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:38,912
That's not that's not where we're at

2437
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:43,264
So Alex we're coming to survive

2438
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,312
Build a society

2439
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:46,080
Where

2440
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:47,104
People are

2441
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,408
Constantly under threat of mass shooting

2442
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,736
And you get mad shot

2443
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:54,016
It is ironic

2444
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:58,624
NORAD

2445
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:00,416
Couple more clips

2446
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:01,696
Maybe like

2447
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,464
6 or 7

2448
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:03,232
Jesus

2449
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:13,728
Sorry I thought those were going to be shorter yet another episode might be as long as

2450
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:15,520
Why does reproductive

2451
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:17,568
Be

2452
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:20,384
Again

2453
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,944
Ostensibly what I would have done if I were him

2454
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,504
If you like okay it's going to sound crazy

2455
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,040
When I

2456
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,320
Talk about

2457
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,112
Chimeras on

2458
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:33,184
Megyn Kelly show no

2459
02:01:34,208 --> 02:01:35,232
Specific research

2460
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,256
Just lay it out

2461
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,536
Pacific thing

2462
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:40,864
Hearsay from a random unnam professor

2463
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:43,936
Clearly fictionalized story of

2464
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:46,752
Women watching p*** at a DARPA lab

2465
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,032
Don't do that

2466
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:49,568
Like this is your chance

2467
02:01:49,824 --> 02:01:52,128
To really specifically bring it home

2468
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,920
What you actually believe in

2469
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:59,296
If you want to be given a fair day in court that's what you should do that's what it sane person would do

2470
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:01,088
Instead he's been a lot of time

2471
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,112
Bullshiting

2472
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:04,928
Talking about Megyn Kelly how she should come to Jesus

2473
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:08,512
Right by your people

2474
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:10,560
And now for the rest of the episode

2475
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:12,352
It's kind of out-and-out

2476
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,888
Islamophobia

2477
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,704
And good sprinkling of anti-semitism

2478
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:20,032
So we're going to get to this is how you want

2479
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:21,056
To f****** deflect

2480
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:22,336
From your interview

2481
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:26,688
And so much of this is just hatred

2482
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:35,904
Depends public shareholders meeting

2483
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:39,744
It's all of it together

2484
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,816
A bunch of wimps

2485
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:50,496
Grenfell Tower fire so much other fires

2486
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:53,056
And now I guess I'm into the Socialist leader

2487
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:54,080
Just give

2488
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:56,128
People's homes to Muslims

2489
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:58,688
So I can borrow got more Tower

2490
02:03:03,808 --> 02:03:05,088
I feel sorry

2491
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,112
For the Muslim

2492
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,136
But like

2493
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:13,024
It's like a rabid dog do they want to write children murder people

2494
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:24,288
Situation

2495
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:32,480
Chopper

2496
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,112
So notice that he's not talking about

2497
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:38,880
Extremist

2498
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:44,512
This is how he feels this is what they all do

2499
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:48,864
And I mean I'd like to point out that there are examples of Muslims

2500
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,144
Is when they

2501
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:51,424
Blow themselves up

2502
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:52,704
Or

2503
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:54,240
Style women

2504
02:03:55,520 --> 02:04:01,664
Yep and you know there was that fritzl guy kept women in his house

2505
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:05,760
And raped them in the

2506
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:09,600
There was Ariel Castro here in America

2507
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:11,136
Not something that's

2508
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:12,672
Specific to some culture

2509
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:15,232
Really f***** up people

2510
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:17,536
Dudes

2511
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:19,328
FairPoint

2512
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,608
Dudes

2513
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:26,240
But I can't say anything

2514
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,288
Unresponsive

2515
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,080
Cuz it's undignified

2516
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:34,688
It's such a

2517
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:37,760
Twisting of reality

2518
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,296
To suit your bigoted

2519
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,624
And I would love to say that

2520
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:44,672
30 years ago it was

2521
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:46,720
That

2522
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,000
I had the same exact

2523
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,024
It said about them

2524
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,560
Unfortunately it is

2525
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:52,608
Now current black people

2526
02:04:52,864 --> 02:04:53,376
Still have that

2527
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:56,192
Bye summer popular

2528
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,312
Hopefully

2529
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:02,848
Fortunately

2530
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,640
I want to go to the next level

2531
02:05:06,688 --> 02:05:08,224
Universal

2532
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:10,016
People

2533
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:15,392
Yeah sure the next year is about how Alex doesn't afraid of

2534
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:18,208
Afraid of being sued

2535
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:19,744
Yeah I probably should

2536
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,024
Mme misrepresents

2537
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,328
He basically shows that

2538
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:26,400
Doesn't have any idea what new shows do

2539
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:27,424
Right so that's

2540
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:34,336
No

2541
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:38,432
I'm not going to just person you're the people I got on tape line to me

2542
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:50,464
He's not he's not proving those that Final Touch specialist

2543
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:15,296
She always had a tough interview she would just act like she was fair and I wanted to use our

2544
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:18,880
Gravitas your gravitas shutting attention to her failing career

2545
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:23,744
A pleasure Feldman Megyn Kelly yes you do

2546
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:29,120
That's exactly what you want whatever you called her a tart with millions of dollars

2547
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,656
You wanted her to fail

2548
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:32,192
Dumb dumb

2549
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,216
Guess what

2550
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:36,544
Of course she interviewed

2551
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,848
Yeah also he said reported

2552
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,616
Family members

2553
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:46,272
That's him stating that they're not real you say that why would you

2554
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:52,416
I can't believe he doesn't think like oh yeah they would want to see both sides

2555
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:57,024
Corsa going to f****** talk

2556
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:58,048
New York

2557
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:59,584
What does what

2558
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:03,424
They're all my God what Ambush journalism

2559
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:04,960
That's insane

2560
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:07,264
There's no way she said she wasn't

2561
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:13,408
Do that there's no way they said he was going to final plus he was going to get Final Cut that person

2562
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:14,688
Was f******

2563
02:07:15,456 --> 02:07:17,504
Or it was robbed

2564
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:20,576
If they did that's wrong but I can't imagine any

2565
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,368
Legitimate news organization

2566
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:25,440
Lying someone like that

2567
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:28,000
Alex has a tape

2568
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:31,584
Of her saying like you can see it or something like that

2569
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:35,936
That's like if

2570
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:39,520
That's like if one of these To Catch a Predator guys like

2571
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:41,312
Hey will give that pedophiles

2572
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:44,384
Hoarseness

2573
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:48,224
Revealed that he definitely believes in

2574
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:55,136
You people need to cause a national debate about this but the elite have a breakaway civil

2575
02:07:55,392 --> 02:08:01,536
Station with a technology

2576
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:03,584
Football game

2577
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:09,216
I don't care

2578
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:13,312
What's it like being a one-story is a demon criminal am I

2579
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:16,128
Means nothing it's all a projection

2580
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,456
We're losing our very species

2581
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:23,040
And then they roll out Tom Brokaw

2582
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,232
It's all just a big joke

2583
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,048
I'm not even Maximus

2584
02:08:34,304 --> 02:08:37,376
Let's just not kill each other

2585
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:47,872
WIC program

2586
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:50,944
At some Scientology s*** right there

2587
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:55,552
Yep and every culture said there's evil

2588
02:08:57,600 --> 02:09:00,416
Without maybe that's some operating system of humanity

2589
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:04,512
Wants to make us be great I don't know what it is but it's real

2590
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:08,096
What's going on

2591
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:16,032
Propose this as an alternative Theory artistic expression

2592
02:09:16,288 --> 02:09:21,152
The reality that every decision you have to make in life you can do it

2593
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:24,480
Lead to negative consequences good thing lead to

2594
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:26,016
Good consequences

2595
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,040
Artistic

2596
02:09:27,552 --> 02:09:29,856
Legendary

2597
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:30,880
It's probably

2598
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:37,280
Probably not true but archetypical something that cultures trying teach artistically

2599
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:41,888
There are expressions that come out of

2600
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,960
Would like the fear of the devil

2601
02:09:45,216 --> 02:09:48,544
To get you to do negative

2602
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,104
The pleasures you could derive from

2603
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:54,176
So I mean maybe it's that I was operating

2604
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,736
System of demonic

2605
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,272
Well and if you want to go with

2606
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:00,064
If you want to go with operating

2607
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:02,624
Just go with evolution

2608
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,648
Like we are 8

2609
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,696

2618
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:30,528
We already heard him say that he wants

2619
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,320
Go to the next level

2620
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,856
He wants to know about you

2621
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:34,880
What about you

2622
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:37,952

You should have Mystery of Life with creativity and ended the shared wonderment

2627
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:54,080
That's experience on a power trip

2628
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:55,104
You imagine

2629
02:10:57,408 --> 02:10:59,712

02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:11,232
There is a framing of like kind of like a video game

2632
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:15,072
Video games are at DARPA program to brainwash people

2633
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,704

2639
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:51,168
He's terrible when people come together

2640
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:56,288
He's trying so hard to come up with a nefarious way to describe

2641
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,312
Community

2642
02:11:57,568 --> 02:12:00,640

Uber if at the end of the end of the Grinch story

2646
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:14,464
Instead of the Grinch's heart growing 3 sizes

2647
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:19,072
It shrinks down and he's like those are f****** evil

2648
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:38,016

Used against them

2652
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,096
They're sharing their goodness

2653
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:54,144

Stare

2660
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:34,336
Always the Arrogant demon stare of someone that could take life and creative form

2661
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:40,736
Women of the scumbag

The power to be a piece of Phil's you will bow as you see the ugly face

Well I mean that's also

2667
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,616
Didn't you say that

2668
02:14:09,152 --> 02:14:15,296
Confederates about Uno

You know his royalty but then like

2670
02:14:19,904 --> 02:14:22,976
I really really want people to juxtapose that

2671
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:25,024
How we talked about Timothy McVeigh

2672
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,584
How we talked about the guy Ruby Ridge

2673
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,376
The guy

2674
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:35,264
How he talks about dylann roof

2675
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:40,128
Well that's cuz that was a time

2676
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:43,456
The shooter at the Batman in Aurora

2677
02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:44,992
Everyone

2678
02:14:45,504 --> 02:14:48,320
Every single one of those

2679
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,088
He doesn't talk

2680
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:49,856
Talk about like this

2681
02:14:50,368 --> 02:14:51,136
Another reason

2682
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,672
There's a f****** reason

2683
02:14:54,464 --> 02:14:54,976
Offends them

2684
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:56,512
Even if you think they're guilty

2685
02:14:56,768 --> 02:15:02,912
Like even in case of like James Holmes

2686
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:03,936
Deniability

2687
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:04,704
Because of his wife

2688
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:08,288
What it's someone who's a Muslim is like

2689
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:11,104
They're also bad arrogant stare

2690
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,640
Cuz they know they can take away

2691
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,176
Deformity

2692
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,456
Bruh Bruh Bruh Bruh

2693
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:17,504

So f****** big

2695
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:24,160
Look at that

2696
02:15:26,976 --> 02:15:27,488
Yeah

2697
02:15:27,744 --> 02:15:28,256
Like

2698
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:29,024
Again

2699
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:30,560
All of his words

2700
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:32,096
Describe

2701
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:32,864
Him

2702
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:34,400
Like he's giving birth

2703
02:15:34,656 --> 02:15:37,728
He said he has the power to do

2704
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,056
And you see that and him being so open about it

2705
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,640
That is

2706
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:47,712
Just a more aggressive version of

2707
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:48,992
Everything you hear

2708
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:49,760
From

2709
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,040
Talking

2710
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,320
White Congress

2711
02:15:56,416 --> 02:16:02,560
I think one of the failings of people who are like

2712
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:08,704
I think one of the feelings that I fall into has a sort of cocktail liberal tard

2713
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:09,472
Or whatever

2714
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:12,032
How is that

2715
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:14,592
Stuff like this is a cry for help

2716
02:16:15,104 --> 02:16:15,872
In many ways

2717
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:17,152
And that's the wrong way to work

2718
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:22,016
Right because there is a part of me that I don't know what it comes from

2719
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:25,856
Wishing someone saved me as a child you know

2720
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:27,136
Did I feel the

2721
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:30,208
I feel I emphasize with people like Alex

2722
02:16:30,464 --> 02:16:31,232
In the sense that I can

2723
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:32,256
Can feel a lot of pain

2724
02:16:32,768 --> 02:16:33,280
Coming from

2725
02:16:34,048 --> 02:16:36,352
And what he screams about things that are clearly

2726
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:37,376
Projection

2727
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:41,216
Inside him coming out right there's a lot of

2728
02:16:41,984 --> 02:16:43,776
Me that has to fight against be like

2729
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:46,592
He just really need someone to help him

2730
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:49,408
Because that's not the case she is just

2731
02:16:49,664 --> 02:16:50,688
Out now.

2732
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:56,576
No you're not going to help a psychopath

2733
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:59,392
Nothing we could do to help him is

2734
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:00,160
What we're doing now

2735
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:04,256
People stop buying his dumbass

2736
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:11,936
It's like 5 minutes long for the anti-Semitic

2737
02:17:12,448 --> 02:17:13,216
It's crazy

2738
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:14,752
So here's what

2739
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:17,568
Goldman Sachs

2740
02:17:17,824 --> 02:17:18,592

And he tweeted out a couple of things

2745
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,344
So you tweeted about the Paris agreement

2746
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:30,368
On June 1st

2747
02:17:30,624 --> 02:17:31,648
Today's decision

Ever the US's leadership position in the world hashtag Paris

2749
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,816

Consider with making policy on environment trade defense etcetera

2755
02:17:49,824 --> 02:17:51,360

Against

2776
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:51,264

Turn down here Mike a little bit

Fight against the very

And that has no

2781
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:01,248

02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,112
Beavering away

Blow up the Earth basically

As soon as he killed everybody

2805
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:59,264
And I are just like they they think they have everything they're just like

2806
02:21:06,688 --> 02:21:10,016
They just operate in the state of ecstasy

Dementia

2808
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:24,096

Turn

2813
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:53,536
Takes on a very sort of

2814
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:54,560
Aspects to Anoka

2815
02:21:54,816 --> 02:21:59,168
But then also the the idea of globalism is anti-Semitic

2816
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,960
And the idea of

2817
02:22:01,216 --> 02:22:07,360
Weaving and Satanism with Judaism is classical classical

2818
02:22:07,616 --> 02:22:08,128
Will do

2819
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:12,480
That is

2820
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,272
Not appropriate

2821
02:22:14,528 --> 02:22:19,904
We bet on a big weekend

2822
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:30,400
I just want attention

2823
02:22:35,264 --> 02:22:36,032
So that's bad

2824
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:37,824
But he's still trying to find the pocket

2825
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:42,176
Cuz he was doing like the straight to my neck and it has gotten too little

2826
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:45,504
Hamzy nerd

2827
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:47,552
Alex Jones is a master in prayer

2828
02:22:47,808 --> 02:22:48,832

Wonder why that is

2844
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:58,720
Thelma's 30% hundreds of billions of dollars in bonuses to these assholes

2845
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:05,120
And they're mad at Trump because of hundreds of billions also went to the general investor in the public

2846
02:24:11,776 --> 02:24:12,800
That's where it is

2847
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,248
He bet 42:1

2848
02:24:23,296 --> 02:24:23,808

Challenge

2851
02:24:30,976 --> 02:24:33,280
Did you like begging someone to stop them just like

2852
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:36,352
They just can't believe that God keeps the planet control

2853
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:42,752
Keep stopping

2854
02:24:46,080 --> 02:24:48,640
Spiritual infection I've seen my own family

2855
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,200
I don't know what that means at all

2856
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:52,224
Very exciting

2857
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:59,136
What are you saying assault all I can say is

2858
02:24:59,648 --> 02:25:02,208
I'm not saying I'm your huckleberry all I'm saying is

2859
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:04,000
I know I'm on the winning team

2860
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:05,536
This body means nothing

2861
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:08,352
I am committed 100

2862
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:11,936
What percent and nnn is Riverdale

2863
02:25:12,448 --> 02:25:15,520
There will be a remnant of humanity to survive the fire

2864
02:25:16,288 --> 02:25:19,360
And I'm just your other for Southland but we want something

2865
02:25:19,616 --> 02:25:22,944
Without us doing anything

2866
02:25:23,968 --> 02:25:29,344
How much do genetic engineering no matter what he's got he and his whole family are in a diet cancer

2867
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:33,184
Oh almost felt when they brought in to devour them

2868
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:39,840
Oh boy

2869
02:25:40,352 --> 02:25:43,424
I just don't think he does but you can look at it he is

2870
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:44,704
He is like Gollum

2871
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:46,752
Oops

2872
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:47,776

Cantera Golem

2874
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:54,944
He's not going to be good

2875
02:25:55,456 --> 02:26:00,064
Neither are going to go with the ring from where he came into the fire

2876
02:26:03,136 --> 02:26:04,160
Look how does a separate reference

2877
02:26:08,768 --> 02:26:09,792
I mean unless you want to

2878
02:26:10,048 --> 02:26:13,376
Distinguish between fellowship with Rangefinder it's been returned over

2879
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:16,704

02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:18,752
Easy The Walking Dead

2881
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:22,080
The real problem is

2882
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:26,688
The classical archetypes of anti-semitism

2883
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:32,576
Explanation of court

2884
02:26:34,368 --> 02:26:35,904
That's not right

2885
02:26:39,744 --> 02:26:44,864
And if you wanted to have a nuanced discussion of the legitimate

2886
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,424
Has been responsible for

2887
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,216
Specific

2888
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:50,752
You listen some specifics

2889
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:53,056
Behind

2890
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:02,528
Platonic specific examples

2891
02:27:04,064 --> 02:27:09,440
What is it

2892
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:11,232
Vampire squid

2893
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:13,024
Blaze out

2894
02:27:13,280 --> 02:27:14,816
The years upon years in which

2895
02:27:15,072 --> 02:27:15,840
Goldman Sachs

2896
02:27:17,888 --> 02:27:19,168
The government is stacked

2897
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:22,240
With former and current Goldman Sachs executive

2898
02:27:23,776 --> 02:27:25,312
Have orchestrated a

2899
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:26,848
F*** the poor policy

2900
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:33,760
It's mysterious.

2901
02:27:34,016 --> 02:27:37,344
Strange coincidence

2902
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:41,952
Publix they have also been behind

2903
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:45,536
Of those f******

2904
02:27:47,584 --> 02:27:48,096
Goldman Sachs

2905
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:51,936
Evil so the important point though is is like a

2906
02:27:52,192 --> 02:27:56,032
Alex really wanted to get into stuff he could get into those things

2907
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:58,080
Like even the topic that he's covering

2908
02:27:58,336 --> 02:28:00,128
He could say okay

2909
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:03,456
He's f****** trolling Trump I get it that's fun

2910
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:06,272
Bababababa

2911
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:08,064
Deers with Goldman Sachs

2912
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:14,464
Instead of being like he still mad they get all this money but they want all

2913
02:28:18,816 --> 02:28:20,608
Goldman Sachs does want all of the money

2914
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,632
Well but it

2915
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:23,936
BitLocker

2916
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:24,960
Here's the thing

2917
02:28:25,472 --> 02:28:27,264
Billions of dollars are going

2918
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,288
Normal people

2919
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:30,592
That's not happening

2920
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:33,408
Blankfein

2921
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:36,480
So all that

2922
02:28:36,736 --> 02:28:38,272
Observe we're almost done

2923
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,088
George Soros

2924
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:44,160
I've always been a boogeyman

2925
02:28:45,184 --> 02:28:46,976
He mysteriously doesn't really come up

2926
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:49,024
But at the end of this episode

2927
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,584
Alex Jones decides to go after his son

2928
02:28:52,096 --> 02:28:53,120
Oh what

2929
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:56,960
Son of George Soros

2930
02:28:57,728 --> 02:28:59,008
Jesus and

2931
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:01,824
Decides to throw him into the Mack

2932
02:29:02,336 --> 02:29:03,616
Soros

2933
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:05,408
All of them

2934
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:06,432
Whittle's Farm

2935
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:10,528
God will crush them in God's time

2936
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:18,720
Hours for satanism

2937
02:29:21,024 --> 02:29:25,632
They only ship of this wicked Force

2938
02:29:26,144 --> 02:29:29,216
There's no evidence that any of these people who you claim or Satanist are Satanist

2939
02:29:29,472 --> 02:29:31,264
The only thing that's in common

2940
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,056
A lot of them is that they're Jews

2941
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:35,872
Well enter

2942
02:29:37,152 --> 02:29:37,664
F******

2943
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:39,456
Why do you fix

2944
02:29:39,968 --> 02:29:41,504
What he said to Megyn Kelly

2945
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:45,088
Probably

2946
02:29:45,344 --> 02:29:46,880
It's not like a

2947
02:29:47,136 --> 02:29:48,672
Your kids are going to die of cancer

2948
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:50,720
If You Don't See the Light it was probably

2949
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:52,768
Your kids are going to die in God

2950
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:59,680
Yeah or something along those lines

2951
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:03,008
How I say things are not always healthy

2952
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:06,848
Consideration we want to live in a society

2953
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,664
Any thought to that

2954
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:10,432
Thoughtful

2955
02:30:10,688 --> 02:30:12,992
It's such a simple thing

2956
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,272
Just just

2957
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:16,064
Think about other people

2958
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:17,088
Damn

2959
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,768
For the episode

2960
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:27,584
This is how is there a dismount

2961
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,888
This is been a high-wire Act

2962
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:36,288
And there is no activity

2963
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:42,944
Keeps falling off underneath keep

2964
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:49,344
He lives underneath it

2965
02:30:52,416 --> 02:30:52,928
If it's

2966
02:30:54,976 --> 02:30:55,744
I'll say this

2967
02:30:56,256 --> 02:30:58,048
Doesn't give a good summation

2968
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:05,216
I'm really angry

2969
02:31:06,496 --> 02:31:08,032
Megyn Kelly's interview is going to be at

2970
02:31:08,288 --> 02:31:08,800
Destruction

2971
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:11,616
Of my career because

2972
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:15,456
And oh s*** around realize I hadn't read the thing

2973
02:31:15,712 --> 02:31:18,016
Should I claim that I right or am I lying about them

2974
02:31:18,272 --> 02:31:20,320
My entire globalist mythologies going to

2975
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,600
The collapse from underneath

2976
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:23,648
People are going to buy my product

2977
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:26,720
I know it's an inevitability so I'm going to present myself

2978
02:31:26,976 --> 02:31:28,256
As a savior who his

2979
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:31,584
Graciously throwing himself against the barbed wires of people

2980
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:32,608
Can climb over me

2981
02:31:32,864 --> 02:31:35,936
I stood on my own petard

2982
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,984
And the house of cards that I built

2983
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:38,752
Bulshit

2984
02:31:39,008 --> 02:31:41,312
Yeah around me oh my God

2985
02:31:41,568 --> 02:31:42,080
Please

2986
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:43,872
It's all the Muslims fault

2987
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:45,920
That's kind of

2988
02:31:47,968 --> 02:31:48,480
Everything

2989
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:50,272
Everybody else's fault

2990
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:51,552
View of the Jews

2991
02:31:51,808 --> 02:31:53,344
The globalist

2992
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,648
Or the people who enabled the Muslim

2993
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:56,416
The lobster

2994
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:57,440
Yep

2995
02:31:57,696 --> 02:31:59,744
I want to thank Jesus Christ and I am not

2996
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:00,768
Alex

2997
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:01,792
Soros

2998
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:04,352
Thank God Almighty

2999
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:07,936
Father of all creation all is good

3000
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:15,360
I won't blame God for anything that happens to me never just don't let me be with them for eternity

3001
02:32:15,616 --> 02:32:18,688
Let me be with you because I have seen the power and the glory

3002
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:20,992
I've seen the light and that's where I want to be

3003
02:32:25,856 --> 02:32:26,880
God

3004
02:32:31,488 --> 02:32:37,632
Transmission 45 minutes going to be

3005
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:41,984
That's it

3006
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:45,056
Alright I'm out

3007
02:32:45,312 --> 02:32:47,872
Thank God I'm not like George soros's son

3008
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:51,200
I don't want to go to an afterlife that involves them

3009
02:32:51,456 --> 02:32:52,224
Long Pond

3010
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:53,760
Good God

3011
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:55,552
Another

3012
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:03,232
Broadcast

3013
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:06,304
We are going to

3014
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:08,608
Rap-up

3015
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:11,424
I believe that Alex is in a panic mode

3016
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:14,496
As I described right before they clip their position

3017
02:33:15,008 --> 02:33:18,336
And whether or not the interview is actually as explosive as

3018
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,872
I almost guarantee

3019
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:26,272
Of course it was the interview yet

3020
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:27,296
Animated

3021
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:36,000
But you can check out knowledge

3022
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:41,120
Oh there's a button

3023
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:42,144
The show called

3024
02:33:42,656 --> 02:33:43,168
Alright

3025
02:33:43,424 --> 02:33:45,728
Call it

3026
02:33:45,984 --> 02:33:48,288
If you don't

3027
02:33:56,224 --> 02:34:01,600
Left a positive review algorithms things

3028
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:05,440
I don't know

3029
02:34:05,696 --> 02:34:06,464
Climbing up the ranks

3030
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:10,304
Anyway

3031
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:14,400
It's so cannot call him Lord blank fine

3032
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:25,920
Easy walking

3033
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:27,968
Who can you name who isn't

3034
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:34,368
That was the guy with life-extension technology

3035
02:34:34,624 --> 02:34:36,928
Ability to hang pictures

3036
02:34:37,184 --> 02:34:39,488
Jon rappoport

3037
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,048
Holding

3038
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:47,680
