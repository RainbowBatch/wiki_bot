00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Thanks for holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

3
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:16,896
Novelty beverages

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
Damn

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
What's the last time you got stuck in

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
Yesterday driving around with you since I move to

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,184
Chicago

8
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:35,072
Teach me to drive during the store. Where I thought I was going to buy an RV

9
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,936
I realized I needed to get a driver's license

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:41,216
You didn't

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,312
Remember how to drive

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,336
6th Avenue

13
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
Years since I've driven all over the road

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,480
No traffic

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
Time

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:58,368
Yesterday

17
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,952
What happened in Missouri

18
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:07,072
Reputation

19
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Columbia Missouri City going for the most part

20
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,800
Pretty serious Chicago

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:21,152
Everett every comment I've ever known has driven drunk

22
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
It's not a secret

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,088
It's almost impossible to get in Chicago

24
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,624
It really that bad

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,440
Butter in Columbia

26
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
I never drove drunk after right

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
19

28
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
I got

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,984
Not a DUI or whatever but I was so scared in the

30
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:54,688
Losing control of a car

31
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,224
I was so scared of that

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
That's from 90

33
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,784
I never

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Got in a car driving

35
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Any alcohol

36
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,624
Even one beer

37
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Really yeah

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,440
Why is very very

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Terrified

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
I don't know I'm going to traffic

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:21,312
Communication

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,712
Sure

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,296
Alex Jones

00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,368
Play Queen

45
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,440
Anyway

46
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:43,072
Today we got to where we will be back in 2009

47
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
Some facts about that I want to discuss them on the other side

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
They're very

49
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,984
Donuts

50
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,776

The music video director like Mick ass

00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,264
I don't think it is MCS thank you so much

62
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,592
I'm a policy wonk

63
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Finally

64
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
You to somebody

65
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:34,528

Don't get mad and tell your brother someone someone sodomites

67
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:48,096

00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,264
Jesus Christ

69
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,896
Thank you so much Tyler

70
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
You can do that

71
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,320
The show we do appreciate it

72
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:14,720
Redirected website

73
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:21,375
I believe the Infowars. Wiki directoire

74
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
So that's fun

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Look

76
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,567
Today what we're doing is we're going back to 2009 and I mentioned

77
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
A lot of the name Mister

78
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
Kind of

79
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
They're not there

80
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,271
Mysterious about 2,000

81
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
Oath Keepers angle

82
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,647
We have a little glimmering

83
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,183
And

84
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,719
You know some of those main things

85
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
We're really driving Mike

86
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Curiosity

87
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,327
You know aren't that

88
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,447
Spectacular to me anymore but I realize our last episode ended

89
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
With coverage of April 13th

90
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
2009

91
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
2 Days Later is tax day

92
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
So we can't

93
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Leave 2009 without getting

94
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:10,015
Lost

95
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,623
I'm so excited we're going to stick

96
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,415
2009 at least for a little bit

97
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,439
I was like

98
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,719
You don't have to do I'm going to

99
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:23,071
The Fourteenth and Fifteenth knocked out now we're going to find out what happened

100
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,375
Unfortunately on this episode

101
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,959
I think the most shocking thing I've ever heard.

102
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Without representation

103
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,199
That would have been crazy just from a standpoint that

104
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,223
What like

105
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,271
I can't even begin to talk about

106
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
F***** up

107
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
The thing that happens on this

108
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,087
What episode is

109
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Like

110
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,927
There are not many times that I'm listening

111
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
These episodes

112
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,487
And like my response

113
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727
Pause the episode and sit there like for a couple of

114
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,495
Minutes

115
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,799
Westbrook

116
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:09,151
And then listen back to the clip like five times to make sure I heard it correct

117
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
So I don't want to oversell this

118
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
But we'll get to that

119
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,599
Adrenochrome

120
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
The 14th today we'll have to let text ewe

121
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,583
Really threw a wrench into my

122
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
My process

123
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
I was just complaining about taxes

124
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,495
Any idea if there are more new taxes

125
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
And then he discusses away

126
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,943
Squeeze you every States passing new taxes

127
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:51,391
And they're going to take your property take your home squeeze you swatting you they're going to send the police

128
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,719
It's by the fights back with a second

129
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,143
Yeah Agreed 100% phrasing is so f***** up

130
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,263
Second Amendment

131
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
And anybody who shoots

132
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,063
Beckwith gun so you paraphrase something fights back with the second

133
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
Beckwith guns

134
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,023
You do not recall the Second Amendment provides

135
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,119
Text Kim

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,167
So that's where we start

137
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
That's crazy

138
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:38,751
If you if you

139
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
Murder and irsha Gunn

140
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:46,687
Then they're going to be all in a tizzy murdering terrorists

141
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:47,967
Restart

142
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,991
Open

143
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:55,391
With the government is going to send the FBI and the cops to your house

144
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,791
Is going to do as a squid for your 4000

145
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
If you kill them

146
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,287
Call the same people cuz it would be necessarily politically-motivated

147
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
That would be terrorism

148
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
Anyway

149
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:19,455
Not sure why

150
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
I think he's sort of stealing the idea

151
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:27,391
Getting the temperature of America

152
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
Neal Boortz

153
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Neal Boortz is another conservative radio guy

154
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,559
Proponent

155
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:36,095
Of the

156
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,679
And also

157
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
Didn't have Alex Jones

158
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
More like a

159
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
Give all of the money to the rich

160
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:55,551
I was listening to Neal Boortz apparently borta starting to cover some

161
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,343
He's like my ex report staying

162
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,695
Alex about like

163
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,999
What is he think about that

164
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,303
Andy brings up the way boards is covering it

165
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,543
Anyway zet turned everything to a liberal issue why is there no left-wing

166
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
On the document why is it just right wing

167
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
And everything like that you know

168
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
And everything here locally in that unnatural and everything they're talkin about all the BT parties like that

169
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
One is a whale

170
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,207
Having thing like that why aren't they coming up against this stuff about the irs's up like that

171
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,287
Later the hour

172
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,615
Troubling is true

173
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,687
Wanting more taxes

174
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,783
Thanks Val social welfare yet

175
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,599
That's helping the poor to have big government

176
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,143
Now that's why they basically terrorist

177
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,935
A lot of these documents

178
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,031
Tires because

179
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
Question

180
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
He's my ex reports about live

181
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Why is it only us

182
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:45,119
Right-wing people were being pointed out for their extremism

183
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Pretend all government

184
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Is ever concerned about his right-wing

185
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,151
Blind

186
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,943
This perception is created

187
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,991
Reinforced by the fact that people like Alex

188
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,295
Or in his collars case Neal Boortz

189
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Only cover stuff like this when they need to go

190
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Get really defensive about reports

191
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,927
About right-wing extremism

192
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
So they can

193
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
Just basically prop up their own Narrative of systemic

194
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,023
Depression

195
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,815
It should come as no surprise that the

196
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
This version of reality

197
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,887
The propagandist

198
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
He's not

199
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
Anyway

200
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,823
In April 2001 dr. Carlos Figueroa prepared a report for the US Department of energy and title

201
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
Left-wing extremism the current

202
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Threat

203
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,919
This report in many ways

204
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Is pretty similar to

205
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,711
Is Viagra for

206
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,271
A lot of terrorists on the left

207
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
For communist

208
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
Which may be a cure

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
I'm not sure but in no way implies that this report is

210
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,207
You are a terrorist if you're coming

211
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,559
Have communist Lena

212
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,887
That doesn't mean that they're saying Communists are terrorists

213
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,679
Anything like that

214
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,471
Very similar to the microphone.

215
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
I'm anyways

216
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775
Exhaust

217
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,311
I wonder why

218
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
The report

219
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,919
The threat to the United States government from leftist extremist

220
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,247
Chris considerably in the past decade but it is not just a

221
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
It goes on to say that quote

222
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,831
The challenge the law enforcement

223
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:11,903
Insecurity is not to interfere with the rights of individuals

224
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,927
To express their beliefs

225
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
While also providing a means

226
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,743
For the early identification

227
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Extremists were playing criminal action

228
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Which is the underlying point

229
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Of all the quote-unquote

230
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,143
Patriot demonizing document

231
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Did Alex yells about all the time

232
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:24,959
The same thing

233
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,263
One of the things I found particularly interests

234
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
Secular reports out information from a study conducted by

235
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
Published in the State University of New York Press

236
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
Call terrorism in America

237
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
In the studies Smith looked at

238
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,855
378 members of identify

239
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,647
And compare the demographics

240
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,927
For those in right-wing groups

241
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
And blessed with

242
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,047
He found that members of right-wing groups were 97% male

243
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,143
Members of right-wing groups

244
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
497

245
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
Percent White

246
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
Compared to 29% in Blackwing

247
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:02,847
36% of the members of right-wing groups are over the age of 40 at the post 8

248
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
18% over the age of 40 and left-wing

249
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:09,759
12% of the members of right-wing groups

250
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Compare 250

251
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
4%

252
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,927
But the numbers are different enough to be in

253
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:21,023
Women

254
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,047
Only

255
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,143
24 Terrors for every 76 terrorists

256
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,263
I think there is scrap in ism

257
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,639
You're a terrorist JW

258
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,991
So also in October 2014

259
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,111
Department of Homeland Security

260
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Keep 7220

261
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,951
It's very clear that

262
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
You know from the data it prison

263
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,535
Mostly what you find

264
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,071
Is there's a s*** ton

265
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:56,351
Of left-wing terrorism

266
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
I'm in the 70s

267
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,679
And that shifts hard towards right-wing terrorism

268
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,703
From that point on

269
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
In the eighties and nineties

270
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Abortion active

271
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,823
The report

272
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
Where the number one category of Terror

273
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
United States

274
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,919
Comprising six

275
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Percent of a taxon

276
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,223
826

277
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:12,991
Percent of 1/9

278
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,087
Throughout that entire time to dhf does make a note the groups like

279
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
The animal Liberation Front

280
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,671
Earth Liberation Front were very active

281
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,791
What are the 24 years of the ALS was active at that point

282
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Their attacks have killed no one

283
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
And the same is true of the earth liberation

284
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
Over that same time. You saw

285
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
Involving

286
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,543
Republic

287
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,591
Confront

288
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
And the World Church

289
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,127
The Creator

290
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
At the same time the numbers of left-wing into

291
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
You see these patterns vary

292
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,599
The point is that the government and the researchers in these organizations

293
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,903
Don't ignore left-wing terrorism

294
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
They deal with the reality

295
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,767
But there's plenty of left-wing terrorism to discuss

296
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:00,863
And simultaneously there's even more right-wing terrorism to discuss

297
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
If anyone's ignoring anything

298
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
Is Alex and his right-wing elk ignoring

299
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
They cover all this stuff in order to maintain the illusion that the out-of-control government is targeting conservative

300
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
In preparation

301
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Put them in camps

302
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Or some s*** like that

303
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
That's all it's all bulshit

304
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,015
There's plenty of reports you can find

305
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:24,415
About left-wing terrorist about the FBI planting agents with inside

306
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:30,303
Inside left-wing

307
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,679
Including recently in

308
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
How many different place

309
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
In Charlottesville

310
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:45,407
Jensen there in so many different places

311
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,687
Is in the 60s

312
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,503
The main reason that they killed f****** Fred Hampton

313
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,575
Was because there was an informant inside of the Black Panthers

314
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Targeting them

315
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Specifically

316
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
And ignoring me

317
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
Terrorist groups

318
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Informant

319
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Provocateur

320
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:07,167
4minute like

321
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,447
Elohim City

322
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
You know

323
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
And the 90s

324
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
I do understand why there would be an informant in the Black Panthers

325
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
Know for sure but that's different

326
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,455
The reality of the situation

327
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,295
Today's the day

328
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,367
Best example of BFDI literally

329
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
Cleansing agents

330
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:28,927
Inside the protest

331
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,487
In order to incite

332
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:33,023
In order to

333
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,327
Credit

334
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,239
You know that as it may we got

335
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:47,103
Just bogus nonsense coming up here we go

336
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
About how

337
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,687
The left is

338
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,343
Free to roam and no one targets them or anything like that

339
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,623
You should kill tax

340
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Collectors

341
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
And

342
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,743
Also saying that right-wing terrorist is almost

343
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:08,095
Are you sure he doesn't he does

344
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:11,679
Is very cagey about not revealing

345
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,495
Narrative

346
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,799
President Barack Obama

347
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,663
I think first about the first part of it is pretty

348
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,247
The second part is awesome and it's another one of these scandals

349
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:30,111
But I completely forgot it's level I forgot about this one

350
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,895
She didn't get a rescue dog

351
00:17:54,687 --> 00:18:00,831
The space is right I remember that we we forgot people that about that

352
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:09,279
Black president strongly in favor of absolutely

353
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
To think that when celebrities

354
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Pepsi

355
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,887
Stuff like that

356
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,727
Ism's

357
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,287
To make of the president not getting a shower

358
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,687
In 2009 President Obama adopted America's first

359
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
What was the Portuguese water first. You've never had a dog before

360
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,647
Doc's was the first cat

361
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:42,047
Grateful

362
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:47,167
Democrat president introduces animals Into the Wild

363
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
All things can

364
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,031
The scandals that we all still remembers being a stain on the presidency

365
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,335
Barack Obama

366
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
After saying

367
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,151
Absolutely 100%

368
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,687
Only accept a rescue dog

369
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,479
Except that isn't true at all

370
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,527
In a press conference

371
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
We have two criteria that have to be reconciled

372
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,415
One is that Malia is allergic so it has to be hypoallergenic

373
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,487
Their number breeds that are hyper hypo allergenic

374
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,119
On the other hand our preference would be to get a shelter dog but obviously a lot of shelter dogs are mutts like me

375
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
So we're going to be

376
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
Is a pressing issue on the Obama household

377
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,543
So actually

378
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,103
Alex's other

379
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,407
Which is

380
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,527
Going to get a shelter dog or rescue dogs

381
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,343
But the requirements they were working with

382
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
By April the narrow down the dog hunt

383
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Dog

384
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,023
Ultimately they didn't find that dog

385
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:45,791
Bye

386
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:49,375
One of the littermates of the dog owned by Senator Ted

387
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,167
Exactly

388
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
So he bought it for them as a

389
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
Lobo the dog is also what's known as

390
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,055
A second chance

391
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
Meaning of its first owner had

392
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,151
Witcher something

393
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
Carry a little bit of a stigma

394
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,831
Obama never claimed that this made it a rescue dog but guess who did

395
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
Caesar f****** Milan did

396
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,695
The Dog Whisperer

397
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,279
He said it was a rescue dog

398
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Even for sale

399
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:22,655
The chief executive of the Humane Society called Bowie quote

400
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,727
Criticized for their decision

401
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,895
Long story short there's no Scandal here

402
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
I hate I hate I hate him I hate him

403
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
F*** you

404
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:43,135
Anybody who talks

405
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,695
Started the goddamn office

406
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,487
Breckenridge

407
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,375
You didn't get a rescue dog

408
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,447
She's not allowed

409
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,055
He's on the up

410
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:03,103
He's on the up-and-up on pets

411
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
So I'm okay with it

412
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
God oh my God

413
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:09,247
Alex

414
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Black is the color of your skin

415
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,928
It doesn't matter if you're 1%

416
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,000
But you're scared

417
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Treat you right

418
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,120
Different conversations

419
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,656
Intentionally blank

420
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Going to want to do what Alice

421
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,216
What's doing it

422
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,264
I just never like to hear anybody

423
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
Give like

424
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
Racial

425
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,432
And stuff like that cuz, from a good play never come from

426
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Good faith or like

427
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Saying something

428
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:45,344
It's always exclusionary

429
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
That sucks

430
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:56,352
Stories of a A-10 probably still going on right now actually almost certainly still going on right now

431
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,144
Summary of mixed-race is both

432
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,936
Excluded from the

433
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Skin color

434
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:04,032
Community

435
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,056
And also

436
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,848
Excluded from

437
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,128
Side of their

438
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Heritage simply

439
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Cuz their skin

440
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Like that is something

441
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
Massive

442
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,088
It's all about perception

443
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Right

444
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
Gas

445
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
He's got a gas and we met this guy in endgame

446
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:29,376
The Obama Deception

447
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,568
Columns in newspapers been a newspaper work for almost 50 years

448
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:41,408
Price for American Free Press he is the original guy

449
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,760
Began writing about the Bilderberg Group

450
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:49,344
Necessarily covered in

451
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,928
Obama Deception stuff alright in the end GameStop

452
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,464
And it's good for a refresher

453
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
How about that

454
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,768
Because he works for American

455
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:01,632
Yeah your name like American free press all those things are

456
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Things about sports

457
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
Love man how come you begin something with American

458
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Or is the press

459
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
That's great

460
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,176
Hoverboards are awesome

461
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
Also

462
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,784
Intentionally trick people

463
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
Thinking stuff like what I was just saying

464
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
For prosperity

465
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
Outlet

466
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,280
Anyone associated with it deserves a fair amount of Suspicion

467
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:34,400
The American free press was set up by Willis carto noted anti-semite in white supremacist

468
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,192
In 2001 a

469
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,216
Previous publication

470
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:38,240
The spotlight

471
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Was forced into bank

472
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:43,104
They were sued by The Institute for historical review

473
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
Holocaust denial is Publix

474
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,480
Which was also founded by Willis carto

475
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:51,296
I'm falling out of the good grace

476
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,136
So he co-founded this organization and by this point in time

477
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
He's not doing great

478
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
Call The Americans

479
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,536
American free

480
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Press

481
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
Minorities into small bits

482
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:05,888
Ciara

483
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
6

484
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,056
The Institute for historical review successfully sued Willis carto for just

485
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
$6

486
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,224
Because he embezzled

487
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
Of Gene Addison Ferrell the grandniece of Thomas Edison

488
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Who was herself

489
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
A really big anti-semite

490
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
Also about Thomas Edison

491
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:35,840
Not a cool guy tired of guy back in the day and then fired in the next day cuz he found out he was Jewish

492
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:40,448
Also

493
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:43,776
News for starting World War

494
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:48,128
But he's also an anti-semite

495
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,920
And great-niece

496
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
WhatsApp

497
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
Wasn't

498
00:24:56,832 --> 00:25:00,672
A Hungarian

499
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Newton

500
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:11,168
So we'll take his his ouster from ihr very well and it one point

501
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:13,216
Occupation of their headquarters to try and remain

502
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,032
In control

503
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:21,408
Dollars and then occupy the business that is

504
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,176
Suing you

505
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Perfectly

506
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,832
I'm not actually sure if that occupation was before the lawsuit or after but it doesn't really matter in my eyes

507
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,208
Bankrupted in the continuation of this case from 1996

508
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,024
Diverted funds

509
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Himself

510
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,912
Where you had to declare bankruptcy

511
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,472
And the spotlight ended up having to fold

512
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,800
Because we lost our toes and both of

513
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,848
The grip

514
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,152
He immediately started up American Free Press

515
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
And most

516
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
The people involved in the spotlight just started working

517
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
It's kind of just a Rebrand

518
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
You know it

519
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,600
It's good that he knew to stay in his Lane

520
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Except

521
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,232
Also

522
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,536
Glad you check

523
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,216
The most influential American anti-semitic propaganda

524
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
The past 50 years

525
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,824
Listen to set up in public

526
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
About the spotlight

527
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:26,432
Repressed as instruments to turn the public sentiment

528
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:31,552
Badl put that quote mobilizer again

529
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
The Jewish population

530
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,608
Didn't have a sports

531
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Medic political Jack rag

532
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,704
With cargo there's no gray area

533
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,032
He did what he did to Swindle money from organizations and to attack the

534
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,848
The Jews who he saw as the biggest threat to the world

535
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,640
He literally said quote

536
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:03,040
If Peyton himself with all of his superhuman genius and diabolical Ingenuity at his command had tried to create a

537
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:04,320
Permanent disintegration

538
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:06,112
Force for the destruction of

539
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,440
He could have done no better than to invent the Jews

540
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
Just blunt

541
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
That is Harsh

542
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:21,728
Directions to Alex's intellectual

543
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,824
68 presidential campaign

544
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
Running gear and be used for George Wallace

545
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,856
National Youth Alliance

546
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,952
National Alliance was a hotbed of neo-nazis and white supremacist

547
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,816
With many of their leading figures being members of a pseudo secret society called The Francis Parker

548
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Society

549
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,632
The group was named after the sky jockey

550
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:55,008
In American Nazi who collaborated with the American Bund during World War II

551
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
Create a Resurgence of fascism

552
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:00,384
Particularly after Hitler was defeated literally the Hitler

553
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Yep

554
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,480
In 1960 after being caught

555
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,016
Was falsified passport

556
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
This yucky guy

557
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,624
He was visited by you guessed it Willis carto

558
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
Who was

559
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
Philosophy

560
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,560
He probably wasn't related but yucky killed himself by ingesting cyanide a weekly

561
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,584
For him

562
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:31,104
Carter recruiting

563
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,432
Interesting Lee Pierce would go on to write the Turner Diaries

564
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Which is

565
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:38,016
Largely thought of his white supremacist militia Bible

566
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,624
Just took over the National Youth Alliance and rebranded it as National Alliance

567
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
Which is one of the most

568
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,768
The virulent white nationalist organization Republic operations during the 90s and early

569
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,536
2000

570
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
It's still in existence now

571
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Barely diminished

572
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,656
Pathic

573
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,960
Sucked up in Port

574
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:59,520
Of the Neo-Nazi white supremacist time

575
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,056
During that

576
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:01,824
Re-emerge

577
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
In the 90s

578
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
Sew-in adult races back

579
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,712
Willis carto MD

580
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,248
The George Wallace campaign

581
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,344
F****** come from

582
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,904
Another interesting parallel carto is one of the

583
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
People who helped launch the populist party

584
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Best known for

585
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,536
David Duke

586
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
President

587
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,168
Where is the populist party was just some of the staff that the more Mainline

588
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,448
Conservatives were at the time

589
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
They were notable for their stances about

590
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,800
Repealing the federal income tax

591
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:36,896
Abolishing the Federal Reserve and cracking down super hard on immigration

592
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
All things about all the time

593
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,320
And Alex was like 13-14 when they were coming out as a political entity

594
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:49,184
Right around with Alex claims he had his Clarity moment reading none dare call it conspiracy

595
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,256
Written by Gary Allan who worked for the Wallace campaign

596
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
Right alongside Willis cardo

597
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,376
Oh and also Carter was a huge fan of Ron Paul

598
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,008
And you know what that's Avengers of

599
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Is what we're talking about

600
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,944
They came together there was one great where everybody got their little viewpoint on that

601
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,968
The end of it

602
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,760
It turned into a movie that way

603
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,040
It could be

604
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:19,648
My point here is that there's a lot of really bad connections that you can see really easily

605
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,928
Both literal connection

606
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
People

607
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:22,720
And

608
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,024
But cheaply here

609
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
Is it Willis carto is a flagrant anti-semite Nazi sympathizer white supremacy

610
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
Is publication

611
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:31,936
We're set up

612
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Literally in

613
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:33,984
Explicitly

614
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
To further those worlds

615
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
Hey Jim Tucker was the editor of the

616
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Spotlight

617
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,640
Eddie came along to American Free Press

619
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
2001

620
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
Complicit

621
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,272
Do you know what kind of Outlet he was working

622
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
Presented as some kind of an expert

623
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
Instead of an anti-semite

624
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
Guesting on Alex Joe

625
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,488
There is one thing that he really was

626
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:58,816
The Bilderberg Group

627
00:30:59,072 --> 00:30:59,840
Really like

628
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,144
Curling sport

629
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,936
Really want there to be

630
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,824
There's so many other like only

631
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
White

632
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,360
Mostly

633
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,920
His Sports there's so much other stuff I'd really like to get in

634
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,712
But I'm not really sure how much

635
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
The patio

636
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Buchanan stuff

637
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,856
The spotlight

638
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
Buchanan

639
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,696
And look like

640
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,976
There's some of those connections

641
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,536
One of the problems we don't have

642
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,584
Audio of Alex

643
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,864
Times that those

644
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:37,216
Be relevant

645
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
I almost

646
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
Guaranteed

647
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:42,336
Yeah I have no idea

648

Soccersuck

649
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,760
And this is the only Charming moment they had just gone back

650
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Commercial break

651
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
The Jim Tucker speech

652
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,136
Is a little bit

653
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Labored

654
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:02,816
Couple weeks ago

655
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:24,832
That's pretty good

656
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:31,232
Pretty good now unfortunately

657
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:33,536
He starts talking about how cigarettes are overpriced

658
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:39,168
And you might move to Chicago now you might get your first indication

659
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,288
The turkeys in Congress

660
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,568
Cigarettes

661
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,640
Texas pop 62 cents a pack

662
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,248
Jerking food off the table for the starving Nicholas

663
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,344
Carton

664
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,184
Egypt $70 a carton

665
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,048
That came out of his mouth

666
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:13,728
Cigarette taxes

667
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,568
On behalf of the black youth

668
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:23,712
I don't want much but that was just

669
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,248
Oh boy

670
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
Text Cliff Alex

671
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,672
Jim still there but he's talking about how he hasn't plugged

672
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:35,744
He wants to plug

673
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,536
And the reason that he's parking is

674
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
Is because he knows that there's go

675
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,448
Tons and tons of a good marketing opportunity

676
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264

Everywhere Obama goes to speak for getting out thousands of these and the tea party's tokens are trying to call off

684
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,776
Patriots true Patriots

685
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
We're going out to these events and and

686
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,896

He conceived

690
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,552
It's basically where you seen all along

691
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,880
Dum dum conservatives

692
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,672
Drive to co-op

693
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:38,208
This Tea Party

Give me a ton more

697

And then we will swing this thing

698
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
And for him that like for normal business

699
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,056
Cuz you be like this is a bad B

700
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
But in reality for him it's a brilliant business

701
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:02,784
Because everybody that buying his is going to give it to somebody

702
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,064
Who does not have it

703
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:08,160
The definition of like

704
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,440
Market saturation

705
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Places

706
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,280
The corners of

707
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
Population

708
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,352
People who probably will never

709
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,520
Yourself answer you take a little bit of a bath because everybody

710
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:30,688
Is

711
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,528
Or whatever watching it on you are saying they're buying it also

712
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,136
You have potential you only

713
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,184
Exactly

714
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,208
That is better than

715
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,304
Tucker's are in the talking about Bilderberg

716
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,864
I mean to his credit bilderbergers like a month

717
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,656
He knows where it is

718
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
He does get the place right

719
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
It's in Greece

720
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,776
About 14 miles away from me

721
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:57,312
And the date

722
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,640
Get those right

723
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,456
Super vague about what the

724
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
It's going to be about

725
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,320
They're going to celebrate the financial crisis

726
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
Does inaccurate

727
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,488
Cuz you know

728
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,048
The best place to celebrate the financial crisis

729
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,840
The place hit hard

730
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Like I don't

731
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,192
Pretend to know where you got the info

732
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,032
From or even if it was publicly known

733
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,944
Whiter than I understand it's possible I don't know

734
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Date

735
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
But doesn't that doesn't

736
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Cuz everything else is off

737
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:47,232
But would you say that don't impress me much by Shania Twain reference

738
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Yeah

739
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
We find out something

740
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Very big

741
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,656
Sponsor

742
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,240
Because I've used this project

743
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,592
Nano silver

744
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
The smaller the particle

745
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:09,760
And the oldest antibiotics is a lot of great silver products out there

746
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:12,576
Rochester Road

747
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:17,952
Other things like that

748
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:23,072
Put silver on it

749
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,400
Even though

750
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
Michelle

751
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Again

752
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:33,568
What is silver solution silver is one of the oldest

753
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,616

Supernatural silver

759
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
From everything I can tell this

760
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:54,048
The first instance of selling silver based product

761
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,584
Which is

762
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,632
Source for colloidal silver

763
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,704
Interesting Lee natural silver is

764
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Actual legit company

765
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,776
At least.

766
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
Really be able to prove something is a comp

767
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,992
Write their website list

768
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:16,320
The PO Box in Huntsville Utah is their address

769
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
Leave the date wood

770
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,624
Be filed as a business

771
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,904
With the state of Utah

772
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,672
If

773
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
You search the Utah business Reggie

774
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,488
Website

775
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,048
No company called Supernatural silver on file

776
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,584
Even included businesses who

777
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,864
Filings of expire

778
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,912
It would take

779
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,192
The company is incorporated in

780
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
And a different state

781
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,240
But if not

782
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:36,288
If you search the site in the way back

783
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,360
Supernatural silver.com

784
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,664
You can find our terms of service

785
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,968
From like 2010 2011

786
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,064
Operated

787
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,112
Earthcam.com

788
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Call very weird nothing

789
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:53,952
They're customer-facing

790
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Keep that big of a company

791
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,816
Princeton I found her Twitter and they only have

792
00:38:59,072 --> 00:38:59,584
Follower

793
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,376
Since August

794
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,144
2018

795
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,448
Are they okay their website is

796
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
It's just a bunch of

797
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
Product like a list of products you can buy that takes you to a check out

798
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
It's super minimal

799
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,688
Going this far through it as like well

800
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,248
I don't know I've been able to establish that based on the

801
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
Terms of service page from

802
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
You can get on the Wayback machine

803
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,904
They are calling themselves Supernatural silver

804
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,208
That's the business name as described there

805
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
That isn't

806
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
Utah.gov registry

807
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
A business

808
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,072
But

809
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,352
There's one place left

810
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:33,120
Look for info

811
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,192
They claim that Supernatural silver is copyright

812
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,216
They own the copyright

813
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,032
So if that's the case then there's a file

814
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
When the government patent

815
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
Copyright office

816
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,896
Serena search on that and found at Fountain

817
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,944
And this is where things get a little bit

818
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,224
41

819
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,760
The copyright is lapsed now

820
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
So it's wide open if you have a cell phone

821
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Second

822
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,160
The actual name of the business is silver Panacea LLC

823
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:02,816
They don't have a doing business as name on sale for Supernatural which is what they're presenting as the business

824
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,936
I'm not sure if that the illegal in Utah as it is in Texas

825
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,496
When we looked into the on Spotify

826
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,824
I don't know about Utah's laws I'm going to leave that one up in the air

827
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,104
However

828
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,152
Because we can now find the business in

829
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Information about

830
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
We can find out more about it

831
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,064
Like the fact that so they filed o l l

832
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,624
Paperwork on March 11th 2009

833
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
They claim in their copyright application

834
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
The first-time business

835
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:35,072
Was April 9th 2009 a mere five days before the episode that we're listening

836
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
To which is not

837
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
The business

838
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:48,640
The business tracking site buzzfile sites an estimate

839
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
Silver panaseeda brings in about 7

840
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
$3,000 annually

841
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Companies

842
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Pretty accurate

843
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,344
Manta another business in

844
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
Information Tracking site

845
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
The same annual revenue

846
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:05,280
If these estimates are accurate that you're the minuscule business that haven't even been operating a week

847
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:11,424
Somehow being able to afford advertising on the show has been at least competitive at that time

848
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,984
Which seems legitimately impossible

849
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,776
None of this makes sense

850
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:19,104
Well what you got to understand is that it's really just

851
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,152
Who was the

852
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,480
I should have said person you're right

853
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:28,576
Because they're advertising

854
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
So it's just one woman who

855
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Was

856
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
Gift in a bunch of silver

857
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:38,304
Like a lot of silver

858
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,888
Silver has really have any overhead other than mailing

859
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,936
Could you

860
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:48,032
Instagram

861
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,687
Suspicious of the sponsorship button

862
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Places to fish

863
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,783
It's entirely possible that the person who started this business

864
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,087
Independently

865
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,111
Sponsorship

866
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,159
Hoping for a big return

867
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:10,559
Eminem keep my eyes on this one and let you know what comes up if it turns out that it

868
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,607
Really dumb financial investments

869
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,471
I'm ready to accept that possibility seems like a good place to do that

870
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,287
Aldo and the on the other hand

871
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:24,127
The Church of Jesus Christ

872
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
The third book

873
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,527
Does explicitly say that if you are do you know

874
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:33,343
If you are doing business in a different name you do have

875
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,719
Something is up there I don't know what it is

876
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Interested

877
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,047
And I'm going to keep looking into it see what I can find

878
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
But for now

879
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:46,399
It's either to someone who's like throwing money away

880
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,191
Or houses rates might be

881
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
Nothing

882
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,775
You know he might be

883
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,847
That some business literally just started

884
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
All that

885
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
I mean like if they're making

886
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
Jamaican 70s

887
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
$3,000

888
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,343
Still in operation

889
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
What were the

890
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
What would you do

891
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:15,327
Tweet if you were out of jail Florida had seven.

892
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,935
Buy silver

893
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,775
At this point

894
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,799
Clipset almost

895
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
To believe what you hear

896
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:37,855
Jim Tucker proves that he works for the Willis carto

897
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,183
And what

898
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
Clarence Thomas

899
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,815
Call Dorothea

900
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
Liberals Barb opposing

901
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:53,983
Euphemism for

902
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,311
Call Rachel

903
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,639
Alright

904
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:04,991
Well

905
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,671
Convinced that a ton of time

906
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,487
I'm sure that's a hard r n word

907
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,023
I'm convinced

908
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
You fear the r in there

909
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,007
There's no way it was just what he said earlier about the cigarette tax

910
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,615
That came out of his mouth so f****** easy he knows he's on the radio

911
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:36,735
You just called Clarence Thomas the n word

912
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:42,623
How crazy is that

913
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,927
I guess

914
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,975
You didn't have five second delay

915
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:50,559
Didn't have a five-second delay you didn't have anybody on the board going

916
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,655
Dusty

917
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,103
Conveniently dropped

918
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
I

919
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:08,223
I'm not going to play it again but you guys can go back and listen to

920
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Want to if you want to try it

921
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,135
Do yourself Darin words

922
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:29,727
I miss the forest for the trees

923
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,311
No no I'm going to go with that super races either way

924
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,687
Agrees with you more than anybody else

925
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,135
Even

926
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,951
Thomas

927
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,255
He's still against affirmative action

928
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,303
And that's great that's the most

929
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,167
He's one of the good ones that you could ever hear

930
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,775
You know what I would racist we say that he was articulate

931
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,335
Literally never ask a question in open hearing

932
00:46:08,127 --> 00:46:08,639
Jesus

933
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:12,991
Right I've never heard that

934
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
I've listened to

935
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,575
Hundreds and hundreds of hours of Alex's show

936
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,367
I've never heard of gas soaked

937
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,999
I've never heard anyone say. Call Michelle

938
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,023
Boy

939
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
Really threw that one out there

940
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
Unbothered

941
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,727
Alex

942
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:40,127
The casualness with which you use that word we want to thank you for being here you're a great Patriot

943
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
Good thank you for your 50 years of service

944
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:47,551
And finally dropping the n-word on my show because I've been a long time cuz

945
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:49,855
Lucky

946
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:53,439
Well I don't know

947
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:57,791
His book

948
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,655
I'm not going to let them talk without guidance

949
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Alex

950
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:07,519
Looks up to him

951
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:10,847
They got to go together the Bilderberg sometime to Bullhorn and chips

952
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,127
Pitbull session

953
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,223
Jim Tucker is clearly a guy likes his booze

954
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:20,831
He was but he insisted on being interviewed in the bar in endgame

955
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,415
Quite a bit

956
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,183
Together

957
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,255
Knowledge of each other and whatever

958
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:35,167
But I do know that Jim Tucker thought it was cool to say the n-word on Alex's show

959
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Slowpoke

960
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,455
Alex has done nothing in the time that they've known each other

961
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:49,247
To make it clear to gym

962
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,271
They don't fly here

963
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:56,927
That are appropriate

964
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:00,767
It's a Batman I didn't know what to do with that

965
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:05,119
Look I'm a racist on my show all the time

966
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,679
I want you to be a racist on my show

967
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,703
All the time

968
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,751
But we can't do that cuz then people would

969
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
I know you're 70

970
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,359
But come on

971
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:21,759
We got to use cold baby what are you

972
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,463
So

973
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,743
Alex

974
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,023
Jim off the show

975
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,375
We got to set up a time

976
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
Grease the week

977
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,935
Can do an interview and stuff like that

978
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:42,239
They doing on a meeting on air

979
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,519
Space

980
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:58,879
Did you know they changed up from Gregorian calendar because I'm going down

981
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,207
Valle Vista Festus looking motherfukers running around

982
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
Yikes

983
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,279
I don't know

984
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,303
I get them off the air

985
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,839
This is why I had to

986
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
To make kind of a

987
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,239
Is because it's soon if Jim gets off the air

988
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,543
Alex realizes what's been done

989
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,591
Just said the n-word on

990
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
On the show

991
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,151
Pretend

992
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
He said a different word

993
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,479
And he's got a spinach

994
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
The way he does it

995
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,551
He's not good

996
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:30,111
You know one of my pet peeves

997
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:34,975
Is people not knowing what words mean in semantics cuz I know

998
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:40,607
Robin page count on BBC reporter

999
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:48,543
Community service same rights as homosexuals Muslims he was arrested

1000
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,359
5 years ago

1001
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,151
The word homosexual is

1002
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:55,711
Now heterosexual homosexual

1003
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,759
Does his assignment

1004
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,039
For your sexual preference

1005
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:02,367
That's the same thing with Anglo negro

1006
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:06,719
And I was watching a documentary about the fifties and sixties Civil Rights Movement

1007
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,535
When developers called

1008
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,191
And they all freak out

1009
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:33,599
So that's the reason I needed to make a point of it

1010
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,879
Because

1011
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:41,279
No no I think what Alex is trying to present is that that's the word

1012
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:43,071
The gym set

1013
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,655
It is not if you are I looked at so many times

1014
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Just to

1015
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:49,471
Make it clear Justified some

1016
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,263
Justify to myself but like

1017
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,871
Your version of it is totally correct whatever word you use

1018
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,223
There was Rachel intent in it is not good

1019
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:01,759
Bye

1020
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Because of Alex's

1021
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,551
Response to it

1022
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:10,719
Words and semantics

1023
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Not the word

1024
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:16,863
He said

1025
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:19,167
Feel bad no matter what

1026
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,703
But he did say that Alex

1027
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,495
Just trying to get the fence

1028
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
There are tapes

1029
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:32,735
Oh man 5 second delay Alex a later on

1030
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Delay with us

1031
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
That one f******

1032
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,879
Christ

1033
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,975
Even if that guy says African American

1034
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,583
You're saying the n-word real hard

1035
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,143
Yeah it's a homosexual is not a

1036
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
Bad word

1037
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:55,519
But out of your f****** mouth it's a bad word

1038
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,687
So anyway that was really crazy

1039
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
And like

1040
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
I did

1041
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,295
And writing up on

1042
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,831
Do you like American

1043
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
Free Press

1044
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:19,327
This dude was there

1045
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
People are

1046
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,143
So

1047
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:27,775
Who's calling

1048
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,799
And

1049
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:32,127
I don't know how it happened but I've got

1050
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,151
I got

1051
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:35,455
Hepatitis C

1052
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,991
You got hepatitis

1053
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,367
He's like I got him at all the places that

1054
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,207
Apartments

1055
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,767
What have you I don't know I got it somehow

1056
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,559
Should I take my medication

1057
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:57,215
I don't want to hear the answer that question

1058
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,495
I'm worried

1059
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
The government is trying to

1060
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
Give me things

1061
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
With my hepatitis

1062
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:09,503
Until Alex starts talking about first doctor I can get medical advice

1063
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,551
And he starts talking about

1064
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,951
We've gone from one patient 2004

1065
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,047
Leprosy

1066
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,143
The 7000 in 2005/2006 next year

1067
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,495
From where

1068
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
I mean

1069
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,615
Hepatitis everything's off-the-charts

1070
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
Fast food

1071
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
That doesn't sound right

1072
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:46,879
Spray Farms

1073
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,207
World food

1074
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:51,999
I don't care about that

1075
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:55,583
According to a 2014 report from the centers for

1076
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,911
Diagnose

1077
00:53:59,167 --> 00:53:59,935
United States

1078
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,519
2011

1079
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
That's it

1080
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:05,823
Not

1081
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,687
Talking about things that get brought in

1082
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,735
That's over things that number cat

1083
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:17,343
Are you just making s*** up that's not that's not what I think and I think

1084
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
Trying to save there is that

1085
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
There were no cases

1086
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,791
Then there was one case then there were 7,000 cases and then there were no case

1087
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,607
So I think his point that he's trying to make

1088
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,215
And then

1089
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
I don't think

1090
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
I don't think

1091
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,567
Supposed to raise suspicion

1092
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,895
I think it's that

1093
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,431
They're bringing it in

1094
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:44,991
Is a third-world and stuff like that

1095
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:45,759
Supposed to

1096
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,527
Supposed to Anchor Inn

1097
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Leprosy

1098
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,463
Or whatever

1099
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:58,559
Global

1100
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,583
He was talking about

1101
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,911
Like let's say that 7,000 number is accurate for the entire world

1102
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:04,703
That one number is

1103
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
From the year before

1104
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,287
You can be using consist

1105
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Numbers

1106
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Make a call

1107
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
The only way

1108
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
Presenting

1109
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Is either

1110
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Cheating big-time Oregon

1111
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,343
Just making it up

1112
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:27,231
It sounds to me like a

1113
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:35,167
A little bit like Obama's dog isn't a rescue as their Scandal for immigration like instead of there

1114
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:38,495
We're going to rape everyone you know

1115
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:42,335
Or we just might get a little bit of leprosy that's not too bad

1116
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:46,175
Depends on if you're the first

1117
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,247
You win some you lose some music

1118
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
So now we're

1119
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,063
We get to the bad part of Alex's

1120
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Responsible

1121
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:54,623
I said

1122
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Because here

1123
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
The end

1124
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
His response

1125
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,255
Say something

1126
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Super

1127
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,327
Just finish up a question

1128
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,911
Interferon

1129
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,383
Drugs that supposedly treatment for HIV

1130
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:21,247
I was talked to chip in Michigan

1131
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,551
Just say that you don't just ask what else

1132
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,367
A lot of doctors is not enough doctors

1133
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,951
You don't get to start your answer by saying I'm not a doctor I can't

1134
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Give medical advice

1135
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
And then

1136
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Answer with

1137
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:35,839
A lot of doctor is a lot of experts a lot of people say medication

1138
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
Just make you worse

1139
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,631
But whatever

1140
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:39,935
But whatever at the end

1141
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
Particularly

1142
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,007
Because it's supposed to

1143
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:47,615
Implied dismissal of his own argument in order to highlight

1144
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,271
Take your medication

1145
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:57,087
Yeah that's

1146
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,135
Absolutely

1147
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,927
Not to take

1148
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
There there medication

1149
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,263
Medical advice

1150
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,359
Medical advice is if you take your HIV Medical

1151
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:20,639
You will die

1152
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Pepsi but yeah

1153
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,503
Could get that naked

1154
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:28,575
They have Maids

1155
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:33,695
Chronic condition

1156
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
Horrible side effects

1157
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,279
Conditions

1158
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,095
Also

1159
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Horrible sinus

1160
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,167
And just trying to make profit

1161
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,703
Out of the ideas at like

1162
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
There's a small /

1163
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
Percentage of people who will have

1164
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
Herobrine

1165
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Reaction

1166
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,591
Therefore no one should

1167
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
To take those it's so bad

1168
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,063
You cannot fight back

1169
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
Put the Second Amendment right

1170
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Straight up

1171
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
If you read between the lines of what

1172
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:15,423
This is f***** up that's a really interesting really interesting argument I would say for free

1173
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,263
Do you know what I'm saying

1174
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:22,079
Literally leads to the death of a person

1175
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,103
And that

1176
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:26,943
Purely because they believed what you said that's a really fascinating question

1177
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,247
Yeah I know I don't actually know what to do

1178
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,063
I don't know what like

1179
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:38,463
What would somebody have to die or would just Grievous bodily

1180
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
I would say I hope

1181
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
You know

1182
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,375
First of all I'm never the person who asked

1183
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,911
Besides those right

1184
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:53,311
I hope that you have a court will everyone expected tomorrow

1185
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
I mean

1186
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,967
If you're like a family member of like let's say this guide stops

1187
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Medication

1188
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
This as an example

1189
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,855
Write his family members

1190
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,671
Literally

1191
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:12,255
There's a lot of people take your meds are worse for you than your

1192
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,535
How your condition

1193
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:18,911
I don't know I don't know if that makes him culpable forgiven

1194
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:26,079
I don't know it dangerous it's super dangerous

1195
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,383
You know

1196
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,687
Although I don't know

1197
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
You're making

1198
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,391
Is fine but the

1199
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Consequences

1200
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:46,047
Threatening somebody shut the words

1201
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,071
That are the problem

1202
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,039
Yeah it I don't know it's complicated

1203
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Anyway

1204
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:12,415
Yeah it's just another call from a guy

1205
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
This guy

1206
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,487
Going to the Orlando Tea Party

1207
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,303
Yes

1208
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
I guess with the tea parties are going on

1209
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:28,031
There's definitely there's going to be a big one here in Orlando tomorrow

1210
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
Mueller Park

1211
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,383
About 6,000 people but we do have

1212
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:38,015
A group of about 20 people a couple of bulls horns or going to go down there tomorrow we have

1213
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,831
Crushers

1214
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,647
You give out with your Obama Deception in

1215
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,183
Call Connor Brothers stuff

1216
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:54,143
Maybe you know this is the first time you're hearing this and you don't know where to go to

1217
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,239
You can go to www.meetup.com backslash

1218
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:01,055
Orlando 9/11 truth we do a lot of stuff

1219
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,871
Last thing I'll let you go on somebody got to love to do

1220
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:08,223
What are we going to have a special celebrity endorsement tomorrow we got to

1221
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,271
VyStar Barack Obama

1222
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,319
We're taking to the rally with us

1223
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,367
What does speech bubble that says

1224
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
Administration

1225
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,439
Same agenda

1226
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:20,511
One World Government

1227
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
So that's not too bad

1228
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:28,191
We live in 2019

1229
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
50 parties

1230
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:33,567
Moving forward from here

1231
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,103
So and I'm not saying that

1232
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,383
This guy in anyway

1233
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,175
Facilitated

1234
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Really

1235
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,735
Inspirational

1236
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,551
Poopy sign

1237
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,855
It's just enter

1238
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,135
Send it before this

1239
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
Tax day

1240
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,695
Largest

1241
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,463
Number of

1242
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,743
Tea parties around the country

1243
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,559
Was there any sort of

1244
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,583
More innocent

1245
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,887
That would turn

1246
01:01:58,399 --> 01:01:59,423
Super dark pretty quick

1247
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,239
I think it's a function of the fact that at this point

1248
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,287
I don't think that the Tea Party

1249
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
At least

1250
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,615
Before text

1251
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:10,175
There was a focus that seems mostly on

1252
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,711
Being against taxes

1253
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,551
It makes sense

1254
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:16,831
This guy would bring it

1255
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,879
A big Obama cutout

1256
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,903
They just be like

1257
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,231
These new world order whatever you like

1258
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:25,279
You know what hanging dolls of Obama

1259
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:32,191
Western

1260
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,239
12:00

1261
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
New admitted

1262
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,567
Same agenda

1263
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,199
But then we were listening to your show earlier and Bill Tucker

1264
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,503
Got to go in that Sprite

1265
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
Call

1266
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,047
They don't have a five-second delay but they do have a call screener it's

1267
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,327
This point in time

1268
01:03:02,143 --> 01:03:02,911
Come on

1269
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:08,543
You can't pretend you didn't hear it when you rushed him off the phone like that respond

1270
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,079
Listen all you dumb dumb

1271
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,127
He said different work

1272
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:16,991
Fukkk offf yeah yeah if he had defended it

1273
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:23,391
There would definitely have been more of a

1274
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,439
They supposed to him like jumping into being like

1275
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:31,583
People are going to get that for me and terms

1276
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,863
Jim

1277
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,655
But there would be

1278
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Like a bit of

1279
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:38,495
Plausible deniability and what Alex heard

1280
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:40,031
If he hadn't

1281
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,103
Rhetoric

1282
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,151
Bring up that word

1283
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,711
It's not like Alex responded and needed to be like

1284
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:56,159
You didn't respond

1285
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:56,927
He heard f***

1286
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
Hard r n word

1287
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,023
He's like I got I got to save this

1288
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,303
So

1289
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,119
They either accept

1290
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,399
Whatever his version

1291
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,679
None of it was or they

1292
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,311
Right

1293
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:17,151
20

1294
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,711
And every show

1295
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,759
Is this going to be the show

1296
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,551
Where we finally get the n-word

1297
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
Today is

1298
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
You f****** red-letter day

1299
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,975
And that red letter is a hard r

1300
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:34,047
Jesus I don't mean to say this is

1301
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
The compliment

1302
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,863
Rolled with it

1303
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,423
Amazingly well like

1304
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,471
Negative way

1305
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:47,871
He seemed unfazed absolutely -

1306
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
AJ

1307
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:51,199
The great to have you on the show plugged

1308
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,295
Soon as he got off the phone

1309
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:58,367
Seems like

1310
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
That isn't something

1311
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,743
Could happen

1312
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:08,095
I legitimately can't think of any situation where a friend of mine

1313
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:10,399
Would just suddenly drop that word not be like

1314
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
Observational only have one more

1315
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
On this side episode

1316
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
We're going over here on the 14th

1317
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,319
And

1318
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:30,367
If it's an interesting thing that goes on

1319
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:32,159
That for most of the show Alex's

1320
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,183
Using the gas

1321
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
Cities going to have on

And that Economist is

1325
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:50,335
Lionel Messi

1326
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,663
Okay might be as much of an account this message but like

1327
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
Soccer player of all time

1328
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
Have you seen the

1329
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,551
So this dude

1330
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,855
Is like having phone troubles

1331
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
Push back a bit

1332
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:04,927
Six more calls

1333
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
Boring

1334
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:10,559
It doesn't really matter but a timely Alex gets

1335
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:18,751
Argentinian

1336
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:24,383

Operative

1339
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,911
In Argentina

1340
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,471
He doesn't actually get him on the phone and I'm not going

1341
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
Give him the courtesy of

1342
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
You playing anything

1343
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
Because it's just

1344
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
To talk and whatever

1345
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:01,503
Of course

1346
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,319
Spell bougie

1347
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
He is at these economist's

1348
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Discuss the hardships

1349
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
Economy

1350
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:17,375
However failed to point out that sell Bucci is an ultra-nationalist in part of a group called project

1351
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,143
Second Republic

1352
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:21,215
Pendants to Argentina

1353
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
New Independence

1354
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:24,543
You might ask

1355
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:25,823
I think you already know

1356
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,359
The Jews

1357
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:32,991
Balducci and his group believed in a conspiracy known as the Antonia plan

1358
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:35,295
Which plants

1359
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:39,135
Regarding Jewish emigration to South America in the late 19th century

1360
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:40,415
Early 20th century

1361
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
An exaggerated them

1362
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,487
H-E-B in Jewish playing

1363
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,791
Take over Argentina and establish a second

1364
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
Jewish state

1365
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:51,935
The theory of Argentinian Neo-Nazi propaganda for decade

1366
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,471
The new style Boutique

1367
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
Announcement

1368
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:59,615
2014 by the delegation of Argentine Israelite at those

1369
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,687
Which shouldn't be surprising

1370
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Considering that he

1371
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,479
Make a habit of

1372
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,759
Being interviewed by Holocaust

1373
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,527
Deniers

1374
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:10,111
Like this guy James Fetzer who got interviewed by who once wrote quote

1375
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:13,183
My research on the Holocaust narrative suggests it's not only

1376
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
But probably

1377
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:14,975
False

1378
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:19,071
YouTube video on his own channel

1379
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
Entitled

1380
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:22,655
The truth about the protocols of the stages of Zion

1381
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,215
Which unsurprisingly was not a debunked

1382
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,311
I don't know

1383
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,103
All of this

1384
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
But

1385
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:35,199
It kind of concerns me that anti-semitism

1386
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:38,015
Flourishes in a place where I

1387
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
May be incorrect

1388
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,831
In assuming this

1389
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,159
But I feel like there are not a ton of Jews living in Argent

1390
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,975
There were a number of

1391
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,535
There was

1392
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,911
South America was attractive

1393
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Number of

1394
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,335
Pics of that necessarily but there are there are some

1395
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Down there

1396
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:15,391
The Boys from Brazil in South America

1397
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Dim sum in sum

1398
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
Hyper Nash

1399
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,583
Situations

1400
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,375
And so this guy

1401
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,191
Is that that's that

1402
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Flavor

1403
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,007
He's not an economist who wants to talk about

1404
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,567
Alex's

1405
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:34,591
Supposed

1406
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
The conception of them

1407
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,895
Coming in in

1408
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,455
Economic takeover and what-have-you

1409
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
He wants

1410
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
You do believe

1411
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:45,855
Create another Israel's are you like you can't be

1412
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,903
Considered an economist if

1413
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,463
Part of the basis of your worldview of

1414
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,231
Economy is

1415
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
First we got to kick out the Jews

1416
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:58,143
That part of the Chicago Austrian

1417
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,215
I'm pretty sure it is part of the ostrich

1418
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:07,871
Was Abigail Adams

1419
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,455
I think he was more

1420
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,223
Just about being a dick

1421
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:13,247
And

1422
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,391
I don't know if I would call him a Neo-Nazi

1423
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,951
He has a lot of leaning

1424
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,719
Some sympathy

1425
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,743
He's an absolutely

1426
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,511
Somatic

1427
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
He's brought to the world

1428
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
So

1429
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,375
The idea that I was having

1430
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,447
A little bit of credit on the

1431
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,983
And that is I don't

1432
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
Because he has I don't think he has any

1433
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,895
Earlier

1434
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:43,199
Argentina

1435
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,735
Like I think

1436
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,295
During the episode

1437
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,063
Teasing it a bunch

1438
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,391
I think it's good he didn't remember his name

1439
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,975
Yeah

1440
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,511
Because he hasn't done any

1441
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
Research

1442
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,583
Mike that he allows someone who

1443
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,191
Right to come onto his show and

1444
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,567
I think in retrospect Alex would call that a happy

1445
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:12,383
Accident not mistaken Reese

1446
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,663
No problem

1447
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:17,247
Probably

1448
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:20,319
But you know what the problem is due there it's the monster

1449
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,343
Furtive of how like

1450
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,391
You can have somebody who is

1451
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,695
Look the protocols of the elders

1452
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
Zion

1453
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,303
Come in and take over Arjun

1454
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:32,095
Make another is real gear

1455
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,399
Blah blah blah

1456
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,167
You can have that

1457
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,983
You can have the editor of Willis carto

1458
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:40,031
Somatic Publications

1459
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
Come on the show

1460
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:44,127
You can have them all make argument

1461
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
Consider

1462
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:47,455
Like

1463
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,991
That says something

1464
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,039
It really does say something

1465
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
That red flags

1466
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,111
The pop up for Alex

1467
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:56,927
Maybe I'm hanging out with bad people

1468
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:58,719
That's not good

1469
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
The show not good

1470
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,607
Where were people

1471
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:07,423
That's a really frustrating

1472
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,007
That's really frustrating

1473
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:15,871
It really does seem like you can't go anywhere without somebody eventually being like

1474
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,407
The Jews are trying to take over

1475
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,199
A lot of places

1476
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Soviet Bloc

1477
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
Currently have

1478
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:30,463
History

1479
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,583
South America

1480
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,935
There's plenty of country

1481
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:41,727
Have much less

1482
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
Historical

1483
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,543
Tendrils

1484
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,615
Like I don't know I would hope Australia

1485
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,919
Absolutely.

1486
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,967
No not even close

1487
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,903
They're so far away

1488
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:07,071
Kind of hoping they missed that one took a knee

1489
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
That lets me charge it was like

1490
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:10,399
Dude I wish we took a knee on a

1491
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:13,727
I don't know

1492
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,383
This is Bernard

1493
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
Episode

1494
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:28,575
2009 little bit of a shorter episode but

1495
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:31,135
Edwards on this episode

1496
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,535
Episode

1497
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:45,471
I would say we jammed packed a lot into a very short. Of time

1498
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,055
WhatsApp

1499
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383

Snowman
