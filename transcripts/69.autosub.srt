World world we live in

00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,880
The least weird thing I've ever heard

21
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:04,000
All the time about how much you love gun

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
Always carries guns on him and

23
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,120

Rough River Lake

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,176
I don't know everything about Alex

28
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:26,016
Correct groups

29
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,344
Jamaican Me Happy Dan you know why these are called Escape

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
Cuz that's the name that the actual title of the Pina Colada Song

31
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
Escape

32
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,280
Come with me and Escape

If you're not into yoga

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,984
We have

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
We have had

37
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Bottom

38
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,616
As far as music already

39
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
To go over today so we've got it

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:58,016
Chose Jamaican Me Happy

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,064
One August

42
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
One was aspirational

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Jamaican Me Happy

44
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:11,584
Is representative as we've hit an a

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Actual record

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,168
Downloads

47
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,216
All these milestones in people

48
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,496
Finding us

49
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:23,104
Inexplicable utter inability to promote

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
In anyway messages got on Facebook and on the email and over Twitter it's awesome

51
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,320
Most of it's very positive and interesting stuff

52
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,600
A little bit of it awful

53
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
A couple dickholes tweeting to get a little bit

54
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:47,168
We're assholes

55
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Escapes children's

56
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,776
You know what I owe you.

57
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:56,128
What's that I love first of all be like if you're not into yoga and

58
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
Can you do like champagne

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,968
That's in his personal ad that he's

60
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
He sends out the papers the story the song

61
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:08,416
It's not it's not for your response to the the personal ad is like

62
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,976
Yep

63
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Enough about Rupert Holmes

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
The OKCupid

65
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,728
Yeah absolutely but

66
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,312
Before we do that cuz I'm sure we will by the end of the show

67
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Oh that's not bad

68
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
Very unique styles of policy

69
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,672
Now I'm either already policy walk decided to

70
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
And donate

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,000
More

72
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:47,584
A secondary policy walk status

73
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Which is I don't know policy

74
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,960
C squared 1

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,360
Unfortunately I don't have clippers

76
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,712
You're both now

77
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:07,040
Guys are amazing with

78
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Intricate

79
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Policies

80
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
Covered in North Korea I feel like we have to give you know about the intricacies of inter Europe

81
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
Country relations

82
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,375
Do you know about what's going on with brexit

83
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,423
If it turns out they both

84
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
Support brexit

85
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
Okay

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
An expert

87
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
Anyway

88
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,687
It is only appropriate that we are drinking

89
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
Seagram's

90
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,503
Jamaican Me Happy

91
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,135
Island style booze in the present

92
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
We need to check in and see what was going on

93
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
Really heavy as far as news

94
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:56,191
That's all of it in the history of America

95
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Does not cover any of it

96
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:00,799
Quartzsite

97
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
The reason that this booze is appropriate

98
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Self is

99
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,687
Is because

100
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,247
I didn't realize what was going on

101
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Alex Jones has been in Hawaii for like a week

102
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,231

103
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,863
Drinking probably a lot of these Seagram's chiller

104
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:27,679
You know just hanging out on the beach

105
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
Sing with a little bit of extra I would go wrong that's a much better

106
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
Pennywise

107
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Alex Jones

108
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Wasn't Hawaii

109
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
You would know

110
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,247
Considering your

111
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Missouri River

112
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
That's so

113
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
Well he wasn't White

114
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,463
Alex Jones

115
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
Some of the biggest celebrities in the world

116
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
And got an interview

117
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:03,263
Celebrity couple would you like to guess

118
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
No guessing

119
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,639
We're here was Heidi

120
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Montana

121
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
Spencer Pratt

122
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
What's the popular

123
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,583
Play the cowboy show.

124
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Great again I guess

125
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
Protocol check

126
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Can I run into

127
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Barracks

128
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Jones in Hawaii

129
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
This should highlight I really think one of Alex like

130
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Strfkr

131
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,167
MSN

132
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Heidi

133
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
Spencer or like

134
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,519
These people know what's up

135
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,591
Not giving credibility buckets

136
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,359
Look

137
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,151
Hey get it

138
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
She was my

139
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Third

140
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,527
A favorite character on the Hills

141
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
Which

142
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,927
Was a show which was a show that starred my

143
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,743
5th favorite character on Laguna Beach

144
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,863
Which was a reality TV show version of a TV show I never watched

145
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
Call the o.c.

146
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
Blake 90s were weird

147
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:45,151
I was I was aware that the hills was the thing are you curious about my power rank of people from Laguna Beach

148
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
Number 11 low

149
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
The reality show was Laguna Beach and The Hills are both reality shows has called the gouna beach the reload

150
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,303
It was a dash of Adam Brody show

151
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
COC

152
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
It was supposed to be a reality show version of it was a

153
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
The disaster

154
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
But my favorite character was she going to lunch

155
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,591
She seems like a really great friend never got into too much trouble

156
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Lover

157
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Number two

158
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
The guy named Trey

159
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
It's really hate tray he made a hat

160
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,343
And gave all the money to charity

161
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,671
You seem like a really cool dude

162
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,231
Chicken entree

163
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,303
What is the late 90s

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Give him a bath

165
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
The show was on

166
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
Number three

167
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
There's this guy named

168
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Upholster

169
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
He was not a main character on the show at all

170
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
But every time

171
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Every time I had a Chiron under his name

172
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
It said

173
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
Something enthusiasm

174
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:54,271
So like when he was helping Trey with the hat thing or like

175
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
Number for

176
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Not at all baby Lauren was

177
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,767
My fourth favorite who knows anyway

178
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
The hill sucked

179
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:06,815
And I like

180
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Whitney

181
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
And Audrina

182
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Raymore

183
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
Did Lauren

184
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,703
All right.

185
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,495
God damn fighting

186
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
She was terrible

187
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:22,687
Anyway it was a lot about the hell I spent a lot of time

188
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,991
I spent a lot of time watching those shows when I was younger

189
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Get high

190
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
A reality star Lauren on the Hills

191
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,767
Friends with Lauren from the o.c.

192
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
To the Hills

193
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,839
And got a job working for a fashion magazine

194
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
And so she

195
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,423
I think she like lived next door

196
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,007
Whatever

197
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,895
Celery to accelerate the downfall of a country that could create

198
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
Spencer and Heidi

199
00:09:54,943 --> 00:10:00,319
So they were friends she started dating Spencer and they're our friendship fell apart

200
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
Spencer / Lauren

201
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
Big betrayal

202
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:10,815
And I don't I know that reality show is manipulative interns

203
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
In terms of editing and stuff like that

204
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:17,727
This interview is going to prove

205
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:24,383
Even beyond that you can tell from their behavior in real life after the show how consistent it is with how they're portrayed

206
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:30,015
You can complain about editing if you want I'm sure they did some tricks

207
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,831
Also you

208
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
How do you spell Terraria

209
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Hawaii and Alex Jones at

210
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,511
Because they are Proto Maga

211
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Talkabouttd

212
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,143
No cuz that would have been

213
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,239
Belle I want to go back we're doing a second investigation

214
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,335
We want to fight Alex Jones went all-in on Trump

215
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
And we wonder whether or not hide

216
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
I know that but spin it now

217
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,927
That like because we were against globalism

218
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Because we were Christian

219
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Conservative

220
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:15,071
They edited me and turned me into a different character

221
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
And wrote me off the show

222
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,143
Cuz if you don't play ball with

223
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
The globalist there to take you out

224
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
And

225
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,495
Alright

226
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,615
Now let's hear this s***

227
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,919
Meteor hit

228
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:36,575
Hawaii while they were there unfortunately.

229
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,623
Is a little bit

230
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:44,511
Cuz Alex refuses put the mic close to Heidi's face in his Stanford misogynistic approach to life

231
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
He's pretty

232
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Good with giving Spencer the mic

233
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
10 years

234
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah last time we saw you

235
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
We were

236
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
An hour

237
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,527
Pretty irrelevant

238
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Relevant

239
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,343
Hated person that we know

240
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,623
An outside

241
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
You took our game and I was a little sad I was here

242
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
Super famous

243
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
And everyone cares about what

244
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
Nobody cares about Spidey anymore

245
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
Sweeney Todd

246
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,399
He did what

247
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
Serious

248
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,263
Reality

249
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,799
Start

250
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Secret societies in LA

251
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,455
Movie stars

252
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
The Second Amendment

253
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,439
Second Amendment

254
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Rich people have bodyguards

255
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:52,607
Bruce Willis

256
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,263
Oceans 12

257
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
Give me a Megastar like Clint Eastwood

258
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,103
Be able to be conservative

259
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,151
In Hollywood anybody else trying to

260
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,455
Brakes repair

261
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Destroyed

262
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,063
Body

263
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,903
What is a start at

264
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,255
So we were chanting death to the New World Order

265
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,023
10 years ago

266
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
Documentaries and then about a week later

267
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,887
We are no longer on

268
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,935
Automatically

269
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
Since the Inception

270
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
If the New World Order is watching

271
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
We still will not accept chip

272
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
But

273
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,895
You know we will take

274
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:37,919
Gig in the

275
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Established

276
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
Media

277
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
Bills to pay

278
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:43,295
A cell

279
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
New World Order where available

280
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
Never thought I would say this

281
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695
Will take a check

282
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
For real

283
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,535
Be careful what you say

284
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,839
So at the end

285
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
Spencer is basically saying

286
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Play ball

287
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
To him by the name that he

288
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:05,823
Himself even give himself that that's what it's called

289
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
Spidey

290
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:11,199
Spencer Heidi

291
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,527
Like Spider-Man

292
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Explain that that's on me

293
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Rat

294
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,511
I just want to check and Alex has to jump in there to do that horrendous fake laugh

295
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
In order to make

296
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,399
Another time later begging for

297
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
Hey c'mon

298
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,191
Will you do something

299
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:34,495
And I also know he's not joking

300
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,287
Cute. They've done

301
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
So many sad reality shows

302
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,127
Since they'll

303
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,967
They've done a ton they were on at least two seasons of Big Brother

304
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
It's a disaster

305
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,343
Well

306
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,439
Hollywood because of his

307
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Christian conservative

308
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Christian

309
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,791
Conservative beliefs

310
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,839
Do with lack of talent

311
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
Well

312
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
Response of charisma

313
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
They aren't

314
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:10,079
Like they aren't actors really and they're not convincing even when they're playing version

315
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:10,847
Of themselves

316
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:17,759
And playing themselves right there and I hardly believed

317
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
Just about acting

318
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,415
It's not like

319
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,695
That's all they do

320
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
I also

321
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,279
Spencer was trying to Launch

322
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:33,119
Now there we go

323
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,911
That included this song

324
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:40,543
I hate you dad you are not Jamaican me happy right now

325
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
The vocals are low in the mixed berry

326
00:15:54,879 --> 00:16:01,023
It's like like Nirvana except for

327
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,423
Write what you know this

328
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,823
This is auto-tuned is f*** but when you get to the chorus I don't want to get there

329
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,223
Doris is pretty expensive

330
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:26,623
Really do what

331
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,023
Thank you guys so much for listening and now we will punish you with

332
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,959
Alright sorry I wanted to get to the chorus cuz if they it's like

333
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
They say I'm superficial they say I'm a b**** because I'm sexy I'm famous

334
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
I'm rich

335
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
In the

336
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,535
The chord structure

337
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,167
Piling on Heidi and Spencer I think they're total

338
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,703
Same horror

339
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,263
And have been for the better part of my adult life

340
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,311
I've been aware of them as

341
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,895
Mosquitoes

342
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Stuck any blood out of Fame

343
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
Nintendo broke

344
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,575
When he was talking to Alex

345
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
We used to be the most hated now I'm jealous of you getting all the attention

346
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,695
You took our game

347
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
I need

348
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,071
The entirety of my experience with him

349
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
So

350
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,911
I love that Alex is like so desperate

351
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,703
Celebrity

352
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
This is except

353
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Do you think

354
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
Alex

355
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,151
Admittedly they say they knew who Alex

356
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,247
Alex or Alex

357
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Told them who Ali

358
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
Probably

359
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,135
Got into his documentaries at some point

360
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,695
I bet

361
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,279
Like no 911 road to tyranny or loose changes

362
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,583
The Obama Deception

363
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Something that he's done

364
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:17,215
Look there they're idle

365
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
Fake celebrity

366
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,287
They have nothing to do they don't have jobs

367
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:25,407
True that is true somehow have enough money to be in Hawaii

368
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Blues Traveler

369
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,831
Victor their Bungalow in Hawaii

370
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,879
Also by the way

371
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Great look

372
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:39,231
In Hawaii like it doesn't look like there's much around it sort of secluded

373
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:40,767
Looks like they really expensive

374
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
Resort

375
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Right on the beach

376
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,983
Well-known for budgeting

377
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,031
Inappropriate I don't know where the money

378
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:56,383
It's not important

379
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,151
Appearances

380
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:03,551
Yeah

381
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Can we do that

382
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,415
I thought about it

383
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,791
But not considering it but I thought about the logistics of it and I think it would be miserable

384
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:14,815
Of course

385
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,351
Especially

386
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Yeah

387
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
I mean

388
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,471
If you have so many people expecting something of you and

389
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,335
Evie

390
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,127

Smirnoff

392
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:32,735
Kind of promotion going on

393
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759

I learned about dare that was VE in the Dare program I believe

403
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
I don't think we're supposed to be in those clubs

404
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,855
I think the last time I went to

405
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
It's on like dance dance club

406
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719

408
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,511
Dance Dance Revolution

409
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,559
I did not but I did almost

410
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
Get into a fight with

411
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
The DJ

00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,431

I'm the worst

416
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
They do go on to say that they were worried that they were going

417
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,303
Get killed

418
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,119
Like how celebrities get killed by that

419
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911

When they are no longer worthwhile

422
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,519
I don't care

423
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Cuz I'm not here to talk about Spence

424
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Delusions about Alex Jones

425
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Alex

426
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
To deal with them Russians

427
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
Okay

428
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,087
This is an interesting answer on a beach

429
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,135
What's the deal with the Russian

430
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Spell Mia

431
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Where did they

432
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,512
Hundred percent

433
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
If you go to DC or New York

434
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
There are Russian

435
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376

From Saudi Arabia

437
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
Crawling out

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,664
And so Russia

439
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,040
Contrast

440
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:43,808
Constantly

441
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:50,976
I'll just use

442
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
Defense, they're transferring

443
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
Mozart ships

444
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,872
Infiltration

445
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Mass acceleration

446
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
Total

447
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Not true

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,376
Russia missile

449
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,192
Old world country

454
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Christian Roots

455
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,784
Globalism

456
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,136
Bolshevik

457
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
Corporate system

458
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,744
Trump

459
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Russian contacts

460
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:02,656
Thomasville

461
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:10,848
Normal Court backgrounds

462
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:11,872
Turn on Trump

463
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
Should I take normal behavior

464
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
And blow it up like

465
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,064
Mountain out of a molehill

466
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
That's boring the s*** out of me

467
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,232
I can be both molehills

468
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,608
You know what is a great crime that Alex has just committed

469
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,216
Hawaiian boring is s***

470
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:41,568
If you're watching the video to of this Heidi and Spencer are not entertained

471
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:45,152
Rambling about

472
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
He's like going into being on the show mode daylight

473
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,832
What is it Daylight outside

474
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Tell me the magic hour

475
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
Alex is 3/4 in the back you might be a little drunk

476
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:03,328
But be that as it may this this next clip I think is really telling

477
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,144
And halfway through

478
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
What

479
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,288
Within the interview

480
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:19,968
Yeah I think it is because Alex Jones is most comfortable around people he wants to impress

481
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,064
Okay if we let down some of his guard that he should have

482
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
And if he isn't

483
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,160
After a couple of these like Tiki drink

484
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
But

485
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
He asked

486
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,280
Heidi and Spencer

487
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
How real are reality show

488
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:39,680
Like what is the like what's the most real reality show

489
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
And then after that

490
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Ask him a question

491
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
And Alex Jones accidentally shows

492
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
Of his cards

493
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
How many of the realities

494
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736

00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,320
Totally

496
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
I would say

497
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
The only reality show

498
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:15,008

Let's get this

504
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,880
He pulled out his phone

505
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,160
He is now

506
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:35,488
Video

507
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,256

509
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,568
Has his phone out

510
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,360
Recording him and Alex

511
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,152
Being like yeah come on

512
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
Give me one of these outbursts

513
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,952
That's Berkeley

514
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
No.

515
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,288
Viral clips

516
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Cuz I would love

517
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:31,552
Trigger line that I say

518
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
Worked up

519
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Yeah there they are

520
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
Hillary ruling over my family

522
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,128

523
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Stop nightmares

524
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
I'm glad I don't have no

525
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,400
How to display of how fake his anger is

526
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,264
Is undeniable proof that he just

527
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,568
I don't

528
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,384
I thought that was fake

529
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:34,272
It sounds exactly like a lot of times again

530
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:41,440
He's tired of drinking in Hawaii

531
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Evan revealed that he dreams about the

532
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
I thought that was the big reveal that you had rights

533
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:08,576
If you're watching the video of this Tookie ramps into like

534
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,368
Putting it on

535
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Incredibly fake

536
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,976
Try but it was a very short

537
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
He got the sense that Spencer was using him

538
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:23,168
Viral clip

539
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,752
They would just give him more

540
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,288
I don't know

541
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,312
It is a mess

542
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,360
I wish you would realize how many of the

543
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Gaster

544
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:32,896
Accuse him

545
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,504
It's incredibly bizarre to notice of it you start to realize

546
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
All of these people are kind of just

547
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,136
Spencer in this case is absolutely

548
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:45,696
Just one of those fish you clean algae off a bigger fish

549
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
But he's just trying to get a meal

550
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:48,768
Yeah

551
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Does he think that

552
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Alex is

553
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,472
Help him

554
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,568
Just getting the attention is what he really

555
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,360
He's just

556
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,944
Attention

557
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,248
Become relevant

558
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
Especially with Alex

559
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,040
Vouching

560
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
For him is like a pro

561
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,880
It'd be in cool to talk like

562
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:21,024
Hip guy he was woke for vocals woke there's a lot of

563
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Old white men

564
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Who have

565
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,912
Military service in their background

566
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,312
And they never did before because they thought he was a

567
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:36,384
The fact that he's been at Publix ad for over a decade

568
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
But now

569
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
Because Alex Jones explained it to them know

570
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,040
Everyone presented them as being s*******

571
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Because they were Christian

572
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:45,344
Conservatives

573
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,648
And that is not tolerable

574
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:48,416
To the globalist

575
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,464
So they had to attack

576
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,232
Publix

577
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
As opposed to

578
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,304
To Spencer having his own advice column

579
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,352
In like stuff magazine

580
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:01,216
Whatever it was stuff but yeah

581
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,824
Dark. In my early twenties

582
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,432

Paula Jones we had a sec

584
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,088
There's no doubt

585
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,672
But yeah

586
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,328
For Heidi and Spencer interview

587
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:31,424

That selfie

594
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,456
Victim status

595
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736

596
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:48,320

597
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,344

Let's count off some of the things that have happened

613
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
Since you went on vacation

614
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656

Alex was around when he got in cuz he was you talk you talking about how great it was

618

Again

625
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
A crime

626
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,616
You need to get bingo

627
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,712
Problem disconnected on the board

628
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
What's true Corners in

Well currently he is living in a freezer

631
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:33,792
SAR

632
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,864

633
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,192
What else

634
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Invent

635
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,728
Seth rich

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,056
Priebus

00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,336
Spicer

638
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,896
And scaramucci all gone

639
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,200
In the time that he was on vacation

640
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:56,320
All of them

641
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
No no

642
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
Oh that's right she's gone from like Wednesday

643
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
So they're all

644
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,256
All gone

645
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:10,656
John Oliver has done his segment on Ventura Alex comes back to a word

646
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
World where she doesn't know what

647
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
To respond to

648
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,240
And I think he's

649
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
Really depressed

650
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Does his voice

651
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,336
Does not sound good

652
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,992
He can't get much enthusiasm for stuff that this should be

653
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,528
When you shine baby

654
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
You're under attack

655
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,464
But you come back from vacation you have that little

656
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,536
Cuz you're in a war

657
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,376
This is an infowar

658
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,472
Hey you can't have f****** lingering hangover from vacation

659
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:49,056
Getting in your way you have so much to attend to right now

660
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,896
With the most

661
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
Difficult job in the world

662
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,992
And that is cover up for Donald Trump

663
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,064
Attempted cover-ups

664
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,184
Keeps blowing up in his face Donald Trump that is positive

665
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Meanwhile

666
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
Aah

667
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,304
Yo personality who you've already attack

668
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,328

669
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
Doesn't

670
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Inure

671
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,680
Perceptions

672
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,032
You come back to that world most respected late nights

673
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,104
Of any kind like he's the guy that

674
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
Golden Grill

675
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Yeah

676
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:33,600
Do you come back

677
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
They painted him as so much

678
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:38,720
I didn't get in

679
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,768
I mean you can't do it in the 20 minutes

680
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:41,536
F****** TV

681
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
He's getting

682
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,656
Is that what your podcast is not what episode

683
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
Jesus

684
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,544
My point is

685
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,592
Is it if you were in that situation

686
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:57,408
Do you want your audience to really believe that

687
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:59,712
You think of it as a war you can't come back

688
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
Half staff

689
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,296
On the first day I correct

690
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,088
Swinging

691
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Interesting narrative

692
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
I've stopped by to go over

693
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,936
Stacked deck of all of his guests that he has on everyday basically

694
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
Rodger Stone

695
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
The good doctor Feelgood himself Jerome corsi

696
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Cuz I watch that Alex Jones face

697
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,456
And I absolutely

698
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,272
I believe everything he says

699
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,808
But that his shirts too tight

700
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,576
True

701
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
What else you got

702
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,672
His pills kill yourself

703
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,440
Course

704
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
Bone broth

705
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,536
Sure what you saw a picture of doctor

706
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,728
Jerome corsi

707
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:56,032
Add BBC off

708
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,384
Corsets

709
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,992
But also we got to guest appearance

710
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
He comes in

711
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
Right

712
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:16,256
Cast of characters for a little bit of a hungover Alex

713
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,328
Corsi and Rodger Stone are basically on everyday

714
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,144
Rodger stone is pretty much on everyday

715
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,472
Once a week

716
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,312
Or so it's a very standard rotation of

717
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
It's kind of sad

718
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,128
Like you think that if you had

719
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
You know

720
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,944
40 million fifty million

721
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,968
People watching week

722
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
You could get

723
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Better

724
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,392
You could get people who actually have credibility with credentials who have

725
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
A track record of not being race-baiters

726
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
Track record of people who haven't written

727
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:52,352
Books about presidential candidates

728
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
People who have

729
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
Defended crime

730
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,168
By saying

731
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,776
Real people who haven't played the birther ship

732
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
People like Steve

733
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Pieczenik

734
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,224
Believe it

735
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,272
Story which we now know to be holy

736
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,136
Constructed out of

737
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:20,768
Rodger

738
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,352
Seth Rich was

739
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:28,960
The night of his murder

740
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,104
I just Grace Wasserman Schultz

741
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:41,760
So wait wait wait so we have

742
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
You're doing that stuff

743
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
Their time

744
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:46,880
I know this is a different

745
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,952
Okay

746
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:52,000
Never heard this one

747
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,048
I got one

748
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:59,680
There were these three pakistani-born

749
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,704
6 / 2

750
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
They are Juan Brothers

751
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:03,776
They

752
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
What

753
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,848
She had working

754
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,712
And other Democratic git specialist

755
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,832
Well I don't think all of them work for her but they were all in like Congressional offices

756
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,904
TV show now

757
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,440
TV show

758
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:27,072
I don't know if we're going to be able get the rights from them cuz

759
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Chris Rice

760
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:32,448
Self their brother's trying to get

761
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:34,752
Through America which is a different culture

762
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
So we got Fish Out of Water

763
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,640
People to we got all those kind of awkward interaction right

764
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:41,920
Big Bang Theory

765
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,480
My balls

766
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,528
Cuz 3 it is coming

767
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:49,088
So

768
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,136
In the show it's revealed they killed set

769
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:57,792
The long and short of it is there's a lot of rumors about stuff from what I can tell there is a chance that

770
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,328
They were doing some illegal stuff

771
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
But

772
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:04,192
At this point I can't find good reporting on everything

773
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,544
Everything leads back to like Daily Caller articles or zerohedge

774
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,616
And then they're getting stuff from

775
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
A lot of it does

776
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
Come back to room

777
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,968
I can't find anything really concrete on it

778
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:18,016
But Alex Jones

779
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,296
With the help of Rogers down

780
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
Completely moved

781
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:23,136
The Narrative of the Seth Rich stuff

782
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,464
He is now trying to tie it to this other

783
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,024
A sea of these Pakistani it expert

784
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,072
VA claim

785
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,888
We're working with the Muslim Brotherhood

786
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:38,496
They were taking all of this information off of the DNC servers

787
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:40,288
And confidential information

788
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,336
Funneling it back overseas

789
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,920
Some espionage

790
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,736
And we're being aided and covered up by Debbie w

791
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,160
Murdered all right this is

792
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
Written all over it

793
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,096
The reason

794
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Seriously

795
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,448
Why would they hire that that

796
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,056
Business casual

797
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:20,224
Alex is telling you about this story and it's a Paul Joseph Watson article

798
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,760
And The Source on it

799
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,784
Is Rodger Stone

800
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
So it's all just in house

801
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
But they say Trump

802
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
Insider says

803
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,376
Rodger Stone comes on the show to credibility to the claims the teen making through it

804
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,912
Infowars.com

805
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:42,496
It's just a crazy cycle of nuts that fantastic circle jerk

806
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:45,056
But they have to do this

807
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,896
Because the news just came out that Rod wheeler the guy who was

808
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
The private eye

809
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,992
That was hired by a rich Republican donor

810
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,528
Buy with ties to Trump

811
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,296
I was

812
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,856
I mean who came out when the f****** thing broke

813
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,160
Like months ago came up and he said

814
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,720
They told me what to say I didn't I didn't

815
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
I didn't know any of that stuff

816
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,560
Did it wasn't

817
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
You seen the screenshot of that text message

818
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Which one

819
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
The the one that they're using

820
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,472
The kind of corroborate that evidence of

821
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Somebody

822
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,336
Wheeler like

823
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:21,664
Trump saw the story and he's really happy

824
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
How did I do that

825
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,016
I'm just not sure if it's

826
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,088
Anteater

827
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,392
Rock wheeler has already discredited on

828
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,232
With his behavior in terms of saying the things on Fox News

829
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,816
That's why they told him

830
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:42,656
So the idea that now he's saying Trump was involved with it

831
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
And stuff like that

832
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
You have to take a setback I'm not sure we can trust you

833
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,288
We want to believe that but

834
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,616
You've already shown yourself to be a liar

835
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,919
The only reason that I'm

836
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Incline

837
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
To believe it

838
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,503
Is private Liars also

839
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
Character on

840
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,319
And the Great Hall and Oates.

841
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,903
The only reason I'm inclined to believe it is

842
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
That is a big difference

843
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,231
Between

844
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,559
Saying something untrue on Fox News which is illegal

845
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
And making it erroneous true

846
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
The president

847
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,031
If you're just making fraudulent

848
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Possible

849
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
And then it came out today that Sean Spicer released

850
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,663
The statement that they did have a

851
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
That

852
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,903
Navigating with ShopRite

853
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:36,927
They feel like they're just

854
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:42,047
Look like at very least there was a

855
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
Concerted effort behind the scenes

856
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,607
To push this

857
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,375
The story

858
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,679
And now here is why I believe

859
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
It's

860
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
Literally ache

861
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,495
Conspiracy

862
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,567
I believe it is incredibly nest

863
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,127
This has to be defended at all costs

864
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
Fire the entire Opera

865
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
If it's

866
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,247
Shown to be not true

867
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
If

868
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
All of the Things Fall Apart

869
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:09,695
And they can't keep moving the ball to different places like this all on Brothers connection

870
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
Do that

871
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:15,327
With the

872
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,607
That's just a rumor

873
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:18,911
There's no backup

874
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Hearsay

875
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:24,543
Nothing to do up in that stuff like that

876
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,359
Is it shown to not be true Everything Falls

877
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Cuz that

878
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:29,919
Is what there

879
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
Do it narrative on

880
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
That's what they're they've already

881
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,319
Made it clear that

882
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
They think

883
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,415
Rich was the one who gave the emails to Wiki

884
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Okay

885
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,767
So if they don't have that piece in there fake narrative

886
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
Then

887
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:46,815
Well

888
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:49,631
Super to point out

889
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,471
You at least your stories wrong your version is absolutely wrong

890
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
So they it

891
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Very essential

892
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:57,055
And I hear the other part

893
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
That's really f*****

894
00:43:59,103 --> 00:43:59,871
You start to look at

895
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,151
Who are the people

896
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
Who have

897
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,223
Vociferously defended

898
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:07,551
The Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC

899
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
Storyline

900
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
Build

901
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:17,279
You have Alex Jones infowar

902
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:18,559
You have

903
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
Mike cernovich

904
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,631
Cassandra Fairbanks

905
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
You have

906
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Jack Purcell

907
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
You have

908
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
Julian Assange

909
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Julian Assange has

910
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Repeatedly

911
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,407
Insinuate

912
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:36,991
Which is not true

913
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,527
It's absolutely not true

914
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:39,807
But

915
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
People

916
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,647
Are connected

917
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
In a propaganda web

918
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,535
But they're all pushing this narrative

919
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,839
Will be a huge problem

920
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Mesa Falls

921
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Because it's

922
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:54,655
So not true

923
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,447
You understand

924
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
I think I think

925
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:02,591
I think that this is one area where

926
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
The right-wing media is entirely a

927
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,711
Skipper we all know it

928
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,991
It's obvious

929
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,551
Regardless of whether or not you

930
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:12,575
Prove something is

931
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,623
Is true doesn't mean that

932
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,927
It's going to change their there

933
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,511
Look I mean they won't be able to stay in

934
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,303
What the people want

935
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,631
Black people jokes

936
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
Clarify

937
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,495
So that'll be levels

938
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
Simply don't live in reality

939
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:35,103
Trump and the White House are implicated in

940
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
Creating a fraud

941
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:39,967
With

942
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,991
This after Rich stuff

943
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:41,759
Yeah

944
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,575
Is involved with the White House

945
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
Rodger Stone

946
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
Who does Rodger Stone have ties to

947
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
Jack the Soviet

948
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,511
All these other right-wing dickhole

949
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,047
Julian Assange

950
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,583
It becomes

951
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Cleared that there's a network

952
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,423
That is sharing information with each other

953
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,959
I'm pushing the same narrative

954
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,519
They're clearly a propaganda operation

955
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,799
With these tendrils

956
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,407
I mean the Russian Embassy tweeted out stuff about Seth rich

957
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
Feed

958
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:12,223
The f****** RT and Sputnik

959
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
It makes it

960
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,783
Very clear

961
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:16,063
That it is Russia

962
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,135
And that these people are on the same f******

963
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
Yeah that's true it makes it clear

964
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:25,023
What's the reason for it is who knows

965
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,863
The allegiances are there they're pushing the same narrative

966
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,143
Against All Odds

967
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:35,775
So whether or not the right question

968
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Proven false

969
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
If it's not what's important

970
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
What's important

971
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,151
Is

972
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
The fact that this story came out

973
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
And they're going to be looking into truck

974
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Being implicated

975
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
And having an active role in the campaign

976
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,391
Bring

977
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Too close to the Spear of this

978
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,999
And so in order to protect him

979
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
And

980
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,535
Text this

981
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,583
Maga operation that they have going

982
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,863
Almost

983
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:01,887
Will know

984
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,167
They don't have to

985
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,703
But in order for them

986
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,775
In order for them to make sure.

987
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:11,871
Has to go down

988
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
The Dew is a

989
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
To create a new story

990
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,711
In order to be like

991
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,991
This is fake

992
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,551
This this whole lawsuit is bogus

993
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,623
And they're only doing it because they knew we were going to release

994
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
This news

995
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,695
Then he was hanging out with the all Juan brother

996
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Okay

997
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
Alright the narrative

998
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,095
Are entirely

999
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
And then you don't have to

1000
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,935
To deal with the Fallout that everyone else is experiencing

1001
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,519
These Craven motherfukers

1002
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,823
Are utilizing some dudes murder

1003
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,103
In order to

1004
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,919
Take the heat off of what they clearly did

1005
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
It does that make sense

1006
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
What are we

1007
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,879
Go like

1008
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Do over

1009
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:57,951
Like

1010
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,023
We won't

1011
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,839
All of the crime

1012
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,631
Committing you can do

1013
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,911
Trump is done

1014
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,471
So we're way past that

1015
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,263
They're just trying to get them out

1016
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,031
Right

1017
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
Howard like I can't

1018
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
I can't

1019
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,407
Really processed

1020
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,479
Massive levels of

1021
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,319
The only way that I can really get to the GOP

1022
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:25,087
To do anything

1023
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
Not being able to act

1024
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,159
Unite long enough to go

1025
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Not only

1026
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,767
Has he committed all these crimes but we're divorcing

1027
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
So the only possible explanation

1028
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,143
Is that they know

1029
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
Their constituents

1030
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
No longer believe

1031
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Reality that's possible or that it doesn't matter

1032
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,639
The only the only thing that I can think of is

1033
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Is that if

1034
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
To the truth

1035
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,295
They will be hated by there

1036
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
Lie swallowing audience

1037
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
At least

1038
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,023
Ride like 30-something percent of people who

1039
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Still

1040
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Don't get it

1041
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
But like

1042
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
50% of Republicans

1043
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Climate change

1044
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
The point is

1045
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:22,431
There's no going back from their FOX News application

1046
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
They can't go back

1047
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,271
Entire generation

1048
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
A Republican

1049
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:29,087
Before they can get pass

1050
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
Ask the Fox News War

1051
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:35,231
Yeah

1052
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,279
Rational moderate Republican

1053
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:42,143
Nope.

1054
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,727
Kirk Franklin

1055
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,055
Like Luke Bryan

1056
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,919
How about yeah

1057
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
That's nonsense

1058
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:59,551
Does Heroes

1059
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,879
McCain is

1060
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,207
Been getting a lot of accolades for his bulge

1061
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,727
I don't know if none of

1062
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:23,615
I don't know what the answer is I don't know

1063
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:27,199
How we get back to normal or anything like that I don't take a

1064
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,735
The possible probably

1065
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:36,671
It's like it's like an underwater cave sometimes have to go down to get back up

1066
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
You can't go you can't

1067
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
Push that push up

1068
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,303
Glitter to drown you got to go down further

1069
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:48,703
Bomb North Korea the Constitution martial law

1070
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,007
I put more in the water

1071
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,055
I'm going to go if military coup would also be no

1072
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,223
Alex's

1073
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Elect

1074
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,575
Erdewan Secretary of State

1075
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:06,111
While at the same time being

1076
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:07,903
I can't

1077
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,791
Not as much as we have now

1078
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,607
Not far off so this

1079
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:23,007
S*** is pretty shameful I withhold judgment on the Autobahn

1080
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Brother stopped

1081
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,335
Just because all the information I can find on it is

1082
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
Is so speculative

1083
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,151
And I don't know

1084
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,455
I don't have any

1085
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:32,479
It is

1086
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,807
I put it at 95% most like

1087
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,087
I can't find enough

1088
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Information

1089
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:44,511
Discredited is what I'm saying I am certainly not in the boat of saying that there isn't

1090
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,303
Corruption in the Democratic party too

1091
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,631
Also do you get over someone f****** around and maybe like

1092
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Dealings

1093
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:57,567
Big connection

1094
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,591
Set up the murder

1095
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,383
That I don't believe it all

1096
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
You know all that other stuff

1097
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Anyway

1098
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
I like it

1099
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,527
Anyway Alex Jones

1100
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:10,111
Has to Grapple with the news of scaramucci going down

1101
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:14,463
So in this little clip and I believe

1102
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,767
This is actually him saying a quote

1103
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
From Rodger Stone

1104
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,119
Like I accidentally cut out the beginning words that Rodger says this

1105
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,447
I don't think scaramucci's going to survive

1106
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:26,751
Tirades reporters

1107
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,871
Buy fake emails

1108
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,919
Spoofing reporters emails

1109
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,711
To manipulate

1110
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,503
Isn't a timeline on that backwards

1111
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
A little bit

1112
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:41,343
The the prankster the email prankster

1113
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,439
I was actually was after right

1114
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Been fired

1115
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Well it have to be after

1116
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,511
Did the New Yorker

1117
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,791
Yeah yeah

1118
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:52,095
But he also has it wrong

1119
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,119
This guy

1120
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:57,983
Thanks a bunch of administration officials

1121
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,287
Other officials

1122
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,407
And most of them gave him information willingly

1123
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:09,503
Gave him his email address is personal email address

1124
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
There's no protocol

1125
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
We are

1126
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,743
We are saved

1127
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,351
And

1128
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
Yeah

1129
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,399
The dumbest group of

1130
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
People

1131
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:29,471
That is ever run anything ever

1132
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,239
Totally

1133
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Totally

1134
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,079
I mean it. Like at least The Borgias

1135
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:36,639
Martinizing like

1136
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:41,503
This is not the Catholic religion

1137
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:42,527
Splendid office

1138
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,295
Prodigy

1139
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:51,743
Doing on a day-to-day

1140
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:55,583
Some tweets that were arguing

1141
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,655
Department

1142
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:01,983
Nibbling on grass right outside bunch of little holes

1143
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
I fell into one of those holes

1144
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,847
Was talking about how I'll sudheer

1145
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,895
The head of Iraq

1146
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,431
Earlier

1147
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,223
She acrylic cleric

1148
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,503
Okay

1149
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,295
To Saudi Arabia

1150
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,087
That was the Crown Prince

1151
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
I believe

1152
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,791
Tweet I was reading was making the argument

1153
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,839
The truck facilitated this

1154
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
Because used

1155
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,375
Virginia

1156
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,703
And meanwhile he doesn't want you to know these negotiations

1157
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
Going on

1158
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,263
So he creates all this chaos

1159
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,335
In order to distract you from the fact that they're blah blah

1160
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,383
What

1161
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
Credibility to this

1162
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:49,087
And so I looked it I looked into it and no I mean it is it is rare it's been like a decade since

1163
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
Know the difference

1164
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,439
Between Sunni and Shia

1165
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
No

1166
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
So we're done

1167
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:59,071
No yes

1168
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,191
You can still be a genius by being like

1169
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
Hey

1170
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,007
Why don't you tell me what

1171
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Do you want to have

1172
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,639
No nothing about this like the entire conflict and just be like

1173
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
What would you like me to enforce

1174
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,247
Both side let's agree on it now

1175
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,295
What do you want let's do it

1176
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:23,647
Do you mean that the Kushner israel-palestine talks right

1177
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:26,719
Well you both can

1178
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:33,375
Weekend weekend stepdad

1179
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:40,287
It was because you were saying like

1180
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:44,639
Incredibly inept

1181
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:49,247
But there are people like that guy who wrote that tweet who create

1182
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
Bees

1183
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Other

1184
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:53,855
Reality is for people to live in these other narrative

1185
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:59,231
Amazing stuff

1186
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,023
I'm f****** up wildly in public

1187
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:04,095
Northern make you think that is a bumbling fool man

1188
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,375
Well imagine

1189
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,935
So so like with my family

1190
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
Voted

1191
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Mostly Trump

1192
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,287
Like imagine half

1193
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,311
To come to grips

1194
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
You thought

1195
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
You were a clever

1196
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
Smart person

1197
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:19,455
And you wound up voting

1198
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,991
For the dumbest

1199
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:22,783
Dumbass

1200
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Administration

1201
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,111
Olive

1202
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,439
All of the time that would be tough you would need that

1203
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,231
Ointment

1204
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:37,631
Fake ideas about Seth rich

1205
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
Nobody wants

1206
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,447
No

1207
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:50,687
But that's a much better response than f*** how do I

1208
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:55,039
I will not be made a fool of my response last time I

1209
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Fell for some

1210
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,623
Are you sure it's going to Ria

1211
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:11,167
Girl f****** let that XXX

1212
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:15,263
I don't like you all night making me happy

1213
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
I was not Jamaican snapper

1214
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,079
You put

1215
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
A song by Heidi and

1216
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,455
Maricopa superficial

1217
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,319
You got one I got one we're both at -1.4 this episode

1218
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,135
Alright so

1219
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:33,695
Look generally this episode is really boring

1220
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,767
The August 1st 2017 episode

1221
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
Alexis Park

1222
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
Like I said he doesn't have the verb

1223
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:43,679
Would or should have

1224
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Situation

1225
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:48,799
But he does some stuff that I think is worth

1226
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Noting

1227
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
And worth

1228
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:52,639
Disgusting here in this next clip

1229
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
He jumps into something about

1230
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,271
It's a really good demonstration of his

1231
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
Tremendous fear of Muslim

1232
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,599
Let's expand on that

1233
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,583
What we know with people like

1234
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:14,399
Man having a

1235
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:16,447
ShopRite now Mueller

1236
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:23,103
Contacts

1237
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
Play the Democratic

1238
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:33,087
Islam

1239
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,159
When they are responsible for 90%

1240
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,583
Radical Islam was not on the list in the first place

1241
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:45,631
Too broad

1242
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:50,751
And also this is just that thing that he gets really mad about all the time that is what you like

1243
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:51,519
Why what

1244
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,847
You call it radical Islam that's the problem

1245
00:58:55,103 --> 00:59:01,247
The reason that you wouldn't do that if you don't want to create perception of a holy war and you don't want to alienate possible Muslim allies

1246
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,063
Some people do

1247
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,135
You thinks it's political correctness run amok as opposed to

1248
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Do good strategy

1249
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,951
And then the other thing is

1250
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
Muslims

1251
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,279
Do not create 99

1252
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,303
9% of a terror

1253
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,583
Any

1254
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,167
No it's really not

1255
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
It's white people

1256
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
A lot of

1257
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
Eco terrorism

1258
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,311
Turns out one of the largest portion

1259
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
Terrorism

1260
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,127
In the United States

1261
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
Environmental

1262
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:32,223
If you look at it I don't know who

1263
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
I don't know

1264
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,111
It's very complicated that is complicated

1265
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
Burning down

1266
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,695
S*** like there's a lot of arsons that Environmental

1267
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:44,255
It's pretty wild

1268
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,071
But it's a lot of lot of CO2 into the air

1269
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,911
Cleaning arson

1270
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:58,079
Scrubber

1271
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,663
Mara

1272
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:05,759
Make America arson

1273
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,039
Anyway

1274
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,087
Yeah it did the

1275
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,111
Statistics really interests

1276
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,671
The fact that that is a large

1277
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,439
Trunk of

1278
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:16,511
If you look into the terrorism

1279
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,047
Actually

1280
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
The broad definition

1281
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,607
Statistics buttercup

1282
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:21,887
A lot of stuff that you would

1283
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:22,911
Think is Terrorism

1284
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,703
Falls under that category

1285
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,007
Vandalism

1286
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:29,567
Stuff like that

1287
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,103
10 item checkout

1288
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:33,151
Absolutely

1289
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Sure

1290
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:39,807
Someone listening without headphones to music on the train

1291
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,951
And then we asked why is the Muslim Brotherhood being back to the Arab Spring

1292
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,255
Why is outside and Isis being back

1293
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Why

1294
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,583
Why is Hillary staying in the same bed

1295
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,423
Aberdeen enter Islamic family

1296
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,799
A woman leading the feminist movement

1297
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,871
Linda sarsour

1298
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,711
Are you a human

1299
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,783
Why is it everywhere why is everything Islam

1300
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,391
So his is conception

1301
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:19,487
Yeah if conception is the Hillary and Huma Aberdeen are lover lover

1302
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
They are they they be banging

1303
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Again rumor

1304
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:24,863
And gossip

1305
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
You know Larry presents there at the right time

1306
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,335
Absolutely

1307
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:38,175
But he also believes the cheese produced

1308
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Hillary Clinton in order to

1309
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
To get her to be a mole

1310
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
Working for the Muslim Brotherhood

1311
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,623
Because going to have it even has Muslim Brotherhood ties

1312
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
It's a whole thing it's Larry Nichols s*** it doesn't matter

1313
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:55,839
That's a fun narrative I like that one and then the other stuff is super mad at Linda sarsour for being involved with life

1314
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
She is a lady who

1315
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Tune activist

1316
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:04,031
And she has been involved in like the the women's March

1317
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:05,823
Stuff like that

1318
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,895
Because you where is a job

1319
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,967
And you just think that

1320
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,319
Sharia law

1321
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,391
And I having this Muslim woman

1322
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,463
First of all

1323
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:26,047
Head up this feminism

1324
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,143
Trendys Mantua

1325
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:30,911
Or even

1326
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,983
Party supply store

1327
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Freak out

1328
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
Yeah

1329
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:41,407
One of his favorite Boogeyman Boogie women and

1330
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:44,991
She has deep ties to George Soros

1331
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,039
When is like a globalist operative trying

1332
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,319
Bring Islam

1333
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,343
Into

1334
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,135
Dumb liberals

1335
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:56,511
But this is really in that whole thing

1336
01:02:56,767 --> 01:03:01,119
7 District religious want to be beat up by Muslim man we all know that

1337
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,679
Wyatt is the

1338
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,959
You can still

1339
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,751
B**** about Hillary if you're the

1340
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,287
Is because

1341
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
She's a globalist

1342
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,127
So even if she's president

1343
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:14,431
She's still one of those high-ranking

1344
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,223
Members

1345
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
She's not in the Illuminati

1346
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,319
She's not president but she still in the

1347
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:23,135
Behind the scenes

1348
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,743
Yeah I mean Larry Nichols his whole thing was that Hillary was going to become president

1349
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
Atlanta point

1350
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,279
Bill

1351
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,327
To be the ambassador to the UN

1352
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,631
And within a couple months he was going

1353
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,423
To be the Secretary General of the UN

1354
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
And then as a couple they would control the world

1355
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,287
Can you imagine

1356
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
The right-wing outrage

1357
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
A at a president

1358
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:52,319
Appointing a family member position enough

1359
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:03,327
You're f****** mad when Obama's daughter went to Lollapalooza

1360
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,375
What the f***

1361
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399
Globalist

1362
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:07,167
Playbook

1363
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Right there

1364
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,495
Yeah, but

1365
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,519
Application I guess

1366
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
TuneIn

1367
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:16,639

Casey Jones

1369
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,015
He claims Muslims are involved in crime

1370
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,343
And that Muslims are unvetted at some Muslims have diseases

1371
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,671
When it's either of them thought about that.

1372
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,327
This is the Untouchable. Group

1373
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:40,959
It looks like they just infiltrated the owner of Chobani yogurt

1374
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:43,263
New York

1375
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,055
Federal Reserve board

1376
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,895

Hamdi ulukaya backup

1378
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,671
He's not on the New York

01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,767
A Federal Reserve board episode about him

1380
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,071
That was that's not true at all you wasn't

1381
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,351
Advisory member

1382
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
Years ago

1383
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:12,191
Business anymore

1384
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:15,007
Upstate New York

1385
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:19,103
It was the most

1386
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,151
Nothing that could be nothing

1387
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,967
Collection of business owners who give feedback

1388
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,527
Federal Reserve

1389
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:27,551
Boise

1390
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,135
But isn't legally actionable

1391
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
Of course not

1392
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,463
Slander

1393
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:41,887
It's a all it is is just trying to

1394
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,447
To create more powerful victims for Alec

1395
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:46,239
To be attacking

1396
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Attacked by

1397
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847

And stuff like that

1400
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:56,991
We went over that is your wouldn't be afraid of that if we all had vaccines

1401
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,551
Particular like

1402
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,855
Alex let me get rid of one of your fears

1403
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,671
I think it probably did

1404
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,207
You got soft

1405
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:09,535
Killed but that stuff is from the same

1406
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,679
Fear narrative came out of the Breitbart stories about Idaho

1407
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:17,471
We went over that there were

1408
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,031
Six cases of TV or something

1409
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:21,567
They were all treated

1410
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:25,407
We already went over that

1411
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:31,551
Voice there's just a defeated Nation

1412
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:37,951
And throwing up

1413
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,487
And get this this next

1414
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,255
Clip

1415
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
He brings up something

1416
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,815
Super old

1417
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,119
Embarrassing

1418
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:49,983
Is he talks about that

1419
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:54,079
He talks about

1420
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,127
How he was angry at Putin

1421
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
M2000

1422
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,943
And maybe you was wrong

1423
01:06:59,455 --> 01:06:59,967
To be mad at

1424
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Oh boy yeah

1425
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:05,599
Next episode

1426
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,159
Get real excited cuz the intro music

1427
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
Hot

1428
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,487
And then Alex's

1429
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Swear to God

1430
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
Okay

1431
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
After the intro music

1432
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,607
Alex Jones talks

1433
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,887
Substantially

1434
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:29,407
But growing up I noticed people

1435
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,327
You are the most boring three-year-old ever

1436
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,631
Power trips

1437
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,679
They just think they're invincible

1438
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,495
I always make the biggest mistakes in business

1439
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,895
In life Leadership

1440
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:04,479
They're on the power trips looks on their faces

1441
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:09,087
I wouldn't buy a car from them

1442
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
They just look crazy

1443
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
Hillary all the time

1444
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,951
Looks insane

1445
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,279
Walking around

1446
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,119
What are eyes bugged out like she just started a bunch of

1447
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,191
Buick nomad

1448
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,519
With a bunch of other weird sycophants running around behind

1449
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:32,639
I don't know what you call this psychologically

1450
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:35,711
Nancy Pelosi

1451
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:40,319
Every time she speaks almost George W Bush president

1452
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:47,743
What legislation is in basic Trump

1453
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,815
These people have less knowledge

1454
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:54,655
Junior High student eating

1455
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,935
Is from

1456
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:02,335
Pics 8 months ago from the show

1457
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:05,663
Slip of the tongue one-time Maxine Waters

1458
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,711
I've said Korea what you meant kromia

1459
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,295
Nancy Pelosi

1460
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,575
Once you meant to say Trump

1461
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,111
Well that means he's a junior

1462
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,159
It's a slip of the tongue to happen once

1463
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,463
And Alex is he keep saying

1464
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
You saying that they

1465
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,791
Keep saying

1466
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:28,447
They just constantly having their senile they're crazy look at them

1467
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,239
Create the perception

1468
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:31,775
For his dumbass audio

1469
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,823
You know 8

1470
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,127
It's a little lingering thing

1471
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,663
As opposed to a slip of the tongue

1472
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:42,783
Yeah there's people who are are the ones

1473
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,063
To commit the worst

1474
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
Mistakes and busy

1475
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,415
A lot of those people

1476
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,463
Right

1477
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:53,535
28

1478
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:59,935
Somewhere in between their company

1479
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
Say some

1480
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,799
Flatout slanderous

1481
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,823
Terrible if they

1482
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:12,479
That say that.

1483
01:10:14,527 --> 01:10:17,087
They get clocked out by their own military

1484
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,671
I just love the idea.

1485
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,743
Generally speaking about talking about people being crazy

1486
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:30,399
Cuz that's why

1487
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,967
As well

1488
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,271
Talking about how

1489
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:48,063
Abusive to women

1490
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,111
Muscling in

1491
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
Anyway the other thing

1492
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,487
That I wanted to point out there is his description

1493
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,511
Hillary Clint

1494
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,327
Eyes bulging out

1495
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,119
Like she's done methamphetamine

1496
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:03,167
Yep describing himself

1497
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,471
He has done math multiple times

1498
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:07,263
And he is surrounded by

1499
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:08,543
Absolutely

1500
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,567
Broccoli

1501
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,591
Anyway

1502
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:11,615
This next

1503
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:13,407
Alex

1504
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,015
Which one

1505
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,111
Anyway this next one

1506
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:32,095
Anyway reminiscing over

1507
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:35,167
How do I convert 7 oz

1508
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,727
43 back

1509
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,055
So

1510
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:46,175
Was played at the moment one of those John Oliver on Last Week Tonight this week put out a piece

1511
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:49,759
I was a 20-minute exploration about

1512
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,063
Pretty hard autumn

1513
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
I did exposed

1514
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:57,183
The stuff that we've talked about like how a doctor group is a chiropractor

1515
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,999
The only difference is they actually contacted the school

1516
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:06,399
I found out that he doesn't have an undergraduate degree beyond what we knew

1517
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,215
That's great to know you know

1518
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:09,983
Alex

1519
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:12,543
When I saw that

1520
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:13,823
Peace

1521
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:15,359
I knew what

1522
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:19,967
And it's not as bad as the Bon Iver

1523
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,527
Because the bodies are still actively use

1524
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,319
As propaganda

1525
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:26,111
He can twist it and make it

1526
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Proper

1527
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,999
With this site I saw the Avenue defense really easy

1528
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
Like it's so clear what it is

1529
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,071
I think I even text

1530
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,607
Did you that what he was going to do

1531
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:38,143
That's just what he's going to

1532
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,935
To say that the globalists are trying

1533
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
Cut off my money

1534
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:44,287
They've already attacked us by taking us off Google ad

1535
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:46,335
They keep trying to discredit me

1536
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:52,223
And they know that they can't take me down I don't rely on Advertising I just rely on you getting

1537
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
The pills

1538
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,063
You getting all of my supplements

1539
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:03,487
This is the great globalist attack that I've been telling you was going to come and that more or less is what

1540
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:06,815
His response to it

1541
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,631
But again he says that they're lying about

1542
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:10,911
August

1543
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:17,311
They are not they're not but it's entertaining

1544
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,615
To do witches take him in contacts

1545
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,663
And that's and they kind of

1546
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:25,503
But there is a greater context that they

1547
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,575
Like John Oliver did mention the globalist a couple time

1548
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:34,207
Really I called Ian says probably glanced past that not realizing what he was talking about

1549
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,999
But be that as it may

1550
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,815
You might be surprised by exactly what

1551
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:39,839
Really stick

1552
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,631
And Alex is crawl

1553
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
About

1554
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
The Oliver report

1555
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,751
Man

1556
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:54,943
The vanity of

1557
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,367
He says we sell the

1558
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:04,159
That there altogether

1559
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,743
Domesticated Birds

1560
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:13,375
We sell the meat of dead domesticated Birds

1561
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,423
Okay

1562
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,727
Time

1563
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,311
Coffee

1564
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:24,127
Southern Mexican

1565
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:28,479
Hi Mountain Knife.

1566
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,015
Call Nate

1567
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:32,319
Basically you're seeing what I was

1568
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:34,111
Hoping you would see immediately

1569
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
He's turning this

1570
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:41,535
He's turning it into a coverage of dead Bart

1571
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:43,327
Nothing is John Oliver didn't talk about the coffee

1572
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,911
Article

1573
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,959
And they weren't tight

1574
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,287
We just sell coffee

1575
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:53,823
Like

1576
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,847
Yes it's B

1577
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:57,407
Patriot blender whatever the mushroom

1578
01:14:57,663 --> 01:15:00,735
Weird

1579
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:01,759
Stuff like that

1580
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:03,295
That's what people are making fun

1581
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,831
Not coffee

1582
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,391
The fact that you have Vitality coffee

1583
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
And stuff like that

1584
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:14,815
He's misleading even in his account people are misleading you

1585
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:16,095
Call Alex

1586
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,119
The king of coffee

1587
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
Indeed

1588
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:25,567
$5 lesson they sell at Whole Foods we get from the exact same Chiapas

1589
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:31,199
Years ago

1590
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,991
It's a good deal

1591
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,343
Wake up America Coffee they want to make fun of the fact that we sell things

1592
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,391
So this is the other

1593
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:45,279
I Celtics everybody sells things

1594
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,583
Get it

1595
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,887
Also I want

1596
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
This entire time

1597
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,775
She's already talked to Steve for about a couple minutes

1598
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,823
And then he goes on this

1599
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,455
6 minutes long and I don't have all of it

1600
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
Is on Skype

1601
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,807
Just holding and not saying anything from

1602
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,599
Yeah

1603
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,415
Do Skype interviews with Alex like at least if your

1604
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,791
Like if you're on the phone you can at least like do something

1605
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,327
I just kind of standing there

1606
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,631
Just like I f****** wrote books

1607
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,191
Tom Clancy

1608
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,031
Delivery

1609
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
Anyway back to this

1610
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:08,735
So you can't tell because of the overlapping

1611
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,831
Audio here but John Oliver

1612
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,671
Of Alex sitting down with Buckley

1613
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,207
Takes a drink

1614
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,143
Be like

1615
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,703
It's not it's very obvious

1616
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,727
The second thing

1617
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,335
Alex has picture in a picture going on infowars.com

1618
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,871
So they're playing

1619
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,663
The John Oliver video

1620
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,943
And he is on the side

1621
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,223
A video of him

1622
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
Fake laughing

1623
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,575
You'll hear laughter over this that says Alex

1624
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,599
A team doing

1625
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,391
Same fake laughter

1626
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:51,487
Trying to show that like I don't care

1627
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,815
It's Heidi Spencer level actor

1628
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
Yeah

1629
01:17:56,863 --> 01:18:01,983
So much more

1630
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:07,615
This is why the

1631
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:20,159
A good grandma

1632
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,871
I'm going to do an analysis of this today or tomorrow it's

1633
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:43,967
20 minutes

1634
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,319
Plug-in product

1635
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,879
Did you count plugs on here and the ads

1636
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,695
That's the standard for broadcast radio on TV

1637
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:55,231
Okay

1638
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:59,327
25% of 50

1639
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:04,191
Average 30 years ago

1640
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,103
Here is what Alex is doing

1641
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:13,407
He is a big fan of double count

1642
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,711
And so when

1643
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:19,295
John Oliver says on one of the show's be analyzed

1644
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,599
25% of the show was

1645
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,647
I'm talking about pills are directly cell

1646
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,719
Just say pills a placeholder whatever

1647
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,535
Alex playing

1648
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,815
15 minutes of

1649
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
The show

1650
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
Every hour

1651
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:33,375
Is

1652
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,447
He's not and that's not on it

1653
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,311
We know the show is

1654
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,591
No

1655
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,871
Yeah

1656
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:45,919
And then another 15 minutes is

1657
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:48,479
Is that cuz we know

1658
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:50,783
From we have a copy of his contract

1659
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,319
Syndication

1660
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,879
12 minutes

1661
01:19:55,135 --> 01:20:00,255
Which is available inexplicable infowars.com 12 minutes

1662
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:05,119
15 minutes that are commercials that are on the show go to the

1663
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
The station

1664
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,935
In question they can play their own ads

1665
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:10,239
Been 3 minutes go to Alex Alex

1666
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
Theory

1667
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,287
Supposed to be that

1668
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,567
Is how he gets paid

1669
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:16,128
Because there is no fee to syndicated show

1670
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:18,688
Now what he's not taking into account is

1671
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,456
But that is

1672
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
The 12 minutes

1673
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:26,624
Is very sensitive to run your goddamn show

1674
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,696
That has nothing to do like you just give that up

1675
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,232
The fact that you spend

1676
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,048
I would say probably 25 is

1677
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,840
Generous that's what I was thinking

1678
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:40,192
Alex was lying about John Oliver actor

1679
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,496
I'm going to start keeping track

1680
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,288
I'm going to buy a stopwatch

1681
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
And I'm just going to

1682
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,360
Keep track

1683
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,408
I can't do it while I'm watching a

1684
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,200
Cuz I'm always

1685
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,480
On my phone at work

1686
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,296
I'm watching YouTube

1687
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:59,648
Publix

1688
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:05,280
Well look so Alex Jones is double dipping in the same way that trumps budget money

1689
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,816
In the same way that Alice

1690
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,144
And Alex Jones double and triple count audience

1691
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:15,776
Then all that stuff with advertising time

1692
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,336
And this is why people

1693
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,616
Make fun of you for

1694
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,920
Add so are they doing so many add

1695
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,456
It's because it's on a

1696
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,248
Beat the pig

1697
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
That is

1698
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:27,296
Appropriate

1699
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,320
Is

1700
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:30,880
Commercial time

1701
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,160
Yep Showtime

1702
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,952
Commercial time

1703
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Showtime

1704
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,512
Commercial break

1705
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,864
It's unethical for you to sell product manipulative

1706
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,168
In in the what we're seeing right now

1707
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,728
This is sold coffee in the middle of this what's

1708
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:52,128
Supposed to be analysis analysis defending myself against John Oliver

1709
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Frozen

1710
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,200
A completely Superfluous plug for the coffee

1711
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,480
That's

1712
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,784
This is 10 minutes of the show

1713
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,856
So if this is 10 minutes of one of the hours

1714
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
That's 16

1715
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:04,672
Right there

1716
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:06,208
It isn't the only place he did

1717
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,488
Nope

1718
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,024
Commercial time

1719
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,328
Bayonet H would be 15 minutes

1720
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:14,656
25 minutes of the hour already that's covered by

1721
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,680
Some sort of

1722
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Commercial

1723
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,288
Does another commercial probably 5 minutes less today

1724
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,848
It's taken up by non Conte

1725
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:25,664
And even then a lot of his ads

1726
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:28,736
Like a lot of his narrative

1727
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,040
Right

1728
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:34,368
Like the like the financial collapse is coming

1729
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:37,184
Dubai

1730
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
Even his

1731
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:41,024
Real show right advertisement

1732
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,096
Antonym anyways

1733
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,400
In the sense that a lot of his stuff is supposed to

1734
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
Create fear

1735
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,472
Narratives

1736
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,496
Are built on

1737
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,824
Bothering minorities and vulnerable populations

1738
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:59,712
Making you afraid that you're going to be killed by roving gangs of black people

1739
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,272
By making you afraid of financial collapse

1740
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Afraid of

1741
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:08,928
The communism that's creeping around every corner every leftist around every corner

1742
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,000
It is supposed to get you to buy food for your family calls it

1743
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
Insurance you can eat

1744
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,840
Boots storable food

1745
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:17,632
B cells

1746
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,192
Vista linium the

1747
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,216
The

1748
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:24,800
Colloidal silver the

1749
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:27,104
I think he doesn't do that anymore I'm not entirely sure

1750
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:33,248
Alright well there we go again but like all those other things all the pills are

1751
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:37,088
Give you back your Humanity that the globalist have taken from you

1752
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,392
Every single narrative is base

1753
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
So

1754
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,744
25 is

1755
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,048
Absolutely not true

1756
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,120
50 is even spiritually not true

1757
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
So

1758
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:52,960
Alex you don't understand what people work

1759
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
Before

1760
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,800
I actually genuinely

1761
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
He doesn't

1762
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,128
It's possible but you'd never be able to tell

1763
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:04,736
Know that it's impossible for us to discern the line between willful line

1764
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:06,016
And I don't get it

1765
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,296
Cuz he's too much

1766
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
So he doesn't get it

1767
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,184
He wouldn't know that cuz he's on HBO

1768
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:16,000
Which is owned by Time Warner

1769
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,584
$20 last year ripping folks off on cable

1770
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,288
Ivory

1771
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,384
Every cable company charter

1772
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:35,200

1773
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,736
Whatever what's the one here

1774
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:37,760
RCN

1775
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,528
Is that it

1776
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,296
Oii

1777
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:44,928
Temperature in the world

1778
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,464
Everyone hates the Malik

1779
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,304
Rice is not special now is a good time to get into Monopoly

1780
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,888
I think you and I are going to solve this problem right now

1781
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,472
Whenever you have a single-source

1782
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
For any kind

1783
01:24:59,008 --> 01:24:59,520
Product

1784
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,312
In any situation

1785
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,592
A lot of times

1786
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:08,992
Good ideas

1787
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:10,272
Literally

1788
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:12,320
Hard to quantify

1789
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,624
The amount of nutrients

1790
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:20,256
50 bowls of chicken soup for serving and it's something ridiculous you can't really quantify

1791
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:23,072
It's amazing or bottom but like

1792
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:23,840
Okay

1793
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,888
I don't know if

1794
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:31,008
Get more vitamin D amount

1795
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
You can't

1796
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:38,688
Quantify it it's like 50 bowls of chicken soup hey guess what

1797
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
You can't quantify

1798
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,016
It's numbers

1799
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,344
A ballpark

1800
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,744
Nutrition information on Chunky Soup

1801
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,816
Here's the nutrition information

1802
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,608
You could easily tell

1803
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,424
So

1804
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,472
You can't quantify it

1805
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,240
It's like

1806
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,824
It's like a stardust amount of chickens right

1807
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,360
Yeah

1808
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:10,944
Brigan non-specific languages on play that s***

1809
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,736
So he goes on

1810
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:16,832
It's like the tears of children amount of chicken soup

1811
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:23,232
We still haven't gotten which is really funny.

1812
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,256
Elvis

1813
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,280
Particular thing

1814
01:26:30,656 --> 01:26:36,800
Defend himself against these allegations

1815
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,080
Get so wild

1816
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:40,640
Cute he makes fun of the fact

1817
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
Talking about

1818
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,480
Attracted that's known for nerve growth factor

1819
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:50,368
World. America

1820
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,392
We can sell it

1821
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:55,744
They're trying to make it a drug right now

1822
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:57,536
Organic stores

1823
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,840
Pitbull Japanese Mitsubishi mix

1824
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:04,704
Expensive

1825
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,240
Not doctor group

1826
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:09,056
But I always think you saying Mitsubishi

1827
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,664
Biopqq is only found in cars

1828
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
I think it's Mitsubishi

1829
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:20,320
Or something like that I think it's something like that

1830
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,856
It cannot be Mitsubishi

1831
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
It can't be a

1832
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:29,024
I can't be a secondary car dealership

1833
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,352
Stop

1834
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,960
Four major networks

1835
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
Are they control all of our media really. Right there

1836
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:55,392
And put milk in it

1837
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,160
Okay

1838
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,720
Okay

1839
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,048
Doesn't work with vanilla flavor works with chocolate strawberry flavor

1840
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:11,008
Why is the super good knowing from okay

1841
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:24,064
Is because it tasted okay before and with milk

1842
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,344
It tastes like a

1843
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,392

I've got John Oliver challenge

1849

I don't know what that is

1850
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:57,344
Probably what it's going to be is a sale which we already are doing of course if you want to return it

1851
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:03,744
That's decent business practices who is the girl who is

1852
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,048
The woman on the show Millie Weaver

Did Millie Weaver that's about rainbow snatch

1854
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,960
She swore by

1855
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:14,240
I believe that was Owen

1856
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:20,640
Troy who was bullying her into talking about how much you loved it

1857
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:23,968

01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:53,472
I think they should all drink a dime

1902
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,824
I think we should run that risk

1903
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:01,408
If that is what they based on hearing Alex

1904
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,456
Do we have a responsibility

1905
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
You stop them

1906
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,040
Resume Alex's open misrepresenting

1907
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,600
I have heard on a couple episodes

1908
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,904
I didn't have time cuz I'm a job

1909
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,952
But I have a couple times

1910
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,720
I'm saying

1911
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,000
That other iodine

1912
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,280
Not

1913
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,816
Like the liquid top till I die

1914
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,656
Pretty dishonest

1915
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:25,216
Clips from the archive in

1916
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,752
Somewhere fun

1917
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
Yeah

1918
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,336
Like every time

1919
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,712
And Dad love you

1920
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:36,992
He

1921
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:40,064
I think he knows that Alex is in a weird mood

1922
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:44,416
You spend most of the time that he's on talking about

1923
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:48,512
What you talked about how Hillary's crazy and that Trump is great

1924
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:54,400
Stop from it more was he was giving Alex

1925
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
Pep talk

1926
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:58,240
He was giving him a little bit of a down on yourself

1927
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:03,872
Alarm

1928
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,152
Yeah I think he knows

1929
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,176
But he needs to

1930
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,736
Alex is back from vacation he needs to get his head back in

1931
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:11,296
In the game and the only way to do that is to

1932
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,600
So here is

1933
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:17,184
Talking about how much of a

1934
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
Alex Jones

1935
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:27,936
I would suggest you invite

1936
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,520
Okay

1937
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:15,296
Guatemalan

1938
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:24,256
And you look like a sweaty biatch on it

1939
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:28,096
You look like a disaster

1940
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:31,680
And we're still waiting for you to release those unedited videos Alex

1941
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:32,448
Spell please

1942
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:35,520
Release those things to prove it

1943
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,800
Manipulative Lee attitude

1944
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,592
If you release one little thing

1945
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:43,200
They just showed that they edit

1946
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,248
TV show

1947
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,576
I want to create a slick products

1948
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:49,600
It's not just

1949
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,928
Yelling about how hours

1950
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:55,232
Even Alex

1951
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,792
Don't get the Good karaoke every time

1952
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,144
Yeah

1953
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,448
Yeah that's true

1954
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:07,264
Are you saying that the people who reposted are

1955
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,032
Cutting out

1956
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,408
Cuz I think they all realize it

1957
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,176
Embarrassing

1958
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
Call man

1959
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,224
It's crazy

1960
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:22,624
We got a new conspiracy theory now

1961
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,672
Keep us away from the real truth

1962
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
So you think

1963
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,488
The global history behind Alex Jones

1964
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,024
I want to cover up his singing

1965
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,096
No I think they know that Alex is

1966
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,120
Real power

1967
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,144
Comes from his back

1968
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:38,240
Apologize and thank our buddy Mike

1969
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,288
Michael pointed out

1970
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,824
Failed

1971
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,104
Episode

1972
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,664
Whatever Alex

1973
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,968
That's

1974
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:52,832
Randy Rhoads

1975
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:57,696
I love that.

1976
01:35:57,952 --> 01:36:02,816
Of all the lies

1977
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:09,216
If I would just get an apology from Alex about that we can end the show we're good we did what we set out to do

1978
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,824
Alex does not have a strong wit

1979
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,872
He'll be destroyed at any certain time

1980
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:17,920
Couldn't

1981
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,200
Convince people

1982
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,736
He didn't agree with David

1983
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,016
Absolutely

1984
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
Nowhere

1985
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,464
Completely unable to hold a conversation

1986
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,768
Stephen Colbert

1987
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:36,352
Because they put on a professional show everyday

1988
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,472
Another reason that Alex think

1989
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,288
Accomplished

1990
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,592
An improviser

1991
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:52,736
It's the same thing with people who are alike

1992
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:56,576
The best Heckler there's ever been I'm going to shut this

1993
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,648
I do this just

1994
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:02,208
Just leave it alone like if Alex

1995
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,512
Tried to talk to John Oliver

1996
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,560
It would be John Oliver says

1997
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:10,656
Brakes Alex Jones

1998
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:16,800
Haven't you ever seen these people like Colbert or Jon Stewart on

1999
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:20,640
Conservative talk shows

2000
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:27,040
Devastating destroyed since career for like 3 years

2001
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:33,184
The bow tie

2002
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:39,328
It's just sort of indicative like I said this is a really boring show

2003
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,632
Like I wanted it to be an hour of him responding

2004
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,752
We don't know that cuz

2005
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,288
Tuesday recording

2006
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
But we don't live in

2007
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,640
The future if it is we're going to have to convene an emergency

2008
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:55,968
C-section go all over his Oliver

2009
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,760
Library

2010
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
This basic

2011
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,576
Hire a writer

2012
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,880
Maybe it's me

2013
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:05,440
It's super boring

2014
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,256
Because of these things that we're seeing it's all very repetitive

2015
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:09,024
It's old stuff

2016
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:11,328
He's not he's going with these things that he thinks

2017
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,096
A good bit

2018
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,888
Like the Nancy Pelosi

2019
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:17,728
George Bush's presidency Linda sarsour

2020
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:20,288
I like Hillary's banging Huma Aberdeen

2021
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,568
All this like

2022
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:26,176
You need a new act bro this is like a comic who's on year for of doing the same time minutes

2023
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,272
The more like

2024
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,040
If I'm

2025
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:33,600
If I'm at 15 and I want to do something

2026
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,624
The new and then I just

2027
01:38:35,136 --> 01:38:36,160
It just slipped out of my mind

2028
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:41,024
Without

2029
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,816
Next

2030
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,584
Like I'll be

2031
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,376
In the back of my head I'm thinking

2032
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:46,656
Wait what was the bet that I was

2033
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:47,936
Want to do it like I'm not paying

2034
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,752
I would argue that it's possible that the

2035
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:54,336
The new bit he wanted to do was this new Seth Rich narrative

2036
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:56,384
And didn't have like the juice

2037
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:57,920
To actually do it

2038
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:01,248
If possible if that's the case that was his new bit and then just went with

2039
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
Old classic

2040
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:05,856
Is Jerome corsi on towards the end of the show

2041
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,648
And they just

2042
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,696
Do another old B mispronounce

2043
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
And

2044
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,936
If you don't repeat

2045
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:23,264
I can just cut the funding out of

2046
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:33,248
Let Congress have the best Healthcare in the world

2047
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,296
Legislation sponsored

2048
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:40,160
That's how you win friends

2049
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:44,256
They're calling him a loser because in 6 months you can get

2050
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
He's a total winner

2051
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,728
Endorsing

2052
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,800
No it's not but also

2053
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
He's a loser

2054
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:03,712
Trump gives up his paycheck

2055
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,736
Which again is

2056
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,040
Small Potatoes compared to watch

2057
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:07,808
Threat

2058
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,344
Or compared to what he's feeling

2059
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,464
This is personal enrichment from being president has been

2060
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:20,864
Give up his salary to probably

2061
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,144
You know he wasn't Tech

2062
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,168
We hired yet

2063
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:30,592
That's hilarious

2064
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,640
Like

2065
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:35,200
This is this is right back to the thick of it

2066
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:35,968
Where it's like

2067
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:39,552
Look if you get fired next year it's because you f***

2068
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,600
If you get fired next week

2069
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,624
Cuz I f*****

2070
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,744
There's some of that

2071
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,512
I mean

2072
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,048
These guys like

2073
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,864
Rodger Stone comes on the shower

2074
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:55,936
It's scaramucci was a political suicide bomber

2075
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:58,752
He flamed out on purpose in order to take out

2076
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,288
Spicer and priebus

2077
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:02,080
Who are two globalist

2078
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,104
Stronghold

2079
01:41:03,616 --> 01:41:06,944
He goes in there you bloat

2080
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:07,968
I don't

2081
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:12,576
I think he's just a loudmouth assholes who didn't realize he was on the record until it was too late

2082
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
No heat

2083
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
Apparently

2084
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:15,904
You said he knew you was on the record

2085
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,464
Well now they people say that because you said

2086
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:19,232
He requests

2087
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,768
Did the go off the Record later

2088
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,352
Indicates that he would have known earlier

2089
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:31,520
Totally possible that he just realized it halfway into the conversation

2090
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,896
He had that brief moment of like

2091
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:39,968
What did I say you can't work in the White House

2092
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,992
What's the Soccerzone deck

2093
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,272
You just cannot do it

2094
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,296
What's that mean

2095
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832
To me that means

2096
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:47,136
Perfect person to work in that way as

2097
01:41:47,648 --> 01:41:50,464
Absolutely

2098
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,232
1

2099
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:52,000
That's

2100
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:54,560
I like it when

2101
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,120
I like whatever that veneer of

2102
01:41:57,376 --> 01:41:58,144
Political speech

2103
01:41:58,656 --> 01:41:59,680
Is just gone

2104
01:42:00,192 --> 01:42:06,080
Hangouts to you if you want to be like

2105
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:08,640
If you want to say what you want to say about Bannon

2106
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:09,664
Uh

2107
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,200
You can say it like

2108
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:12,736
More poetically

2109
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:14,784
But nothing

2110
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,088
The point like Bannon wants to suck his own

2111
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,928
Right with your friend

2112
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:24,512
Even if we don't like the people like Steve Bannon

2113
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:27,584
Scaramucci and don't really give a f*** if they gets fired or

2114
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
Or drown

2115
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,656
At the same time

2116
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,216
Truck

2117
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:39,104
Even if you had the road if you don't care

2118
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:41,920
It's still really degrading to our

2119
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,712
Really degrading

2120
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:45,504
To the idea of decency

2121
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,040
And working order

2122
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,600
For these people to behave this way

2123
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:52,416
Public videos where

2124
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,720
The Japanese Parliament got into real fist fight

2125
01:42:57,024 --> 01:43:03,168
Sure I would rather live in a world where Paul Ryan got punched in the face I wouldn't mind that

2126
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:05,728
Loses any fight Paul Ryan has ever been

2127
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,544
Is there a possibility for arms

2128
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,336
Fur like physical conflict

2129
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,872
And that in the house

2130
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,664
That would be a

2131
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,504
Kamala Harris right next to me

2132
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:24,928
McConnell is a physical contact were possible Within

2133
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,208
Another house through Republican

2134
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:27,744
Example for open carry

2135
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:34,400
We found it

2136
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:39,008
Do the other thing with that clip

2137
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,824
He's just going back to the fannie-freddie Merida

2138
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:44,640
I've already gone over the total

2139
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,176
It is it's

2140
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
It's boring

2141
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,344
Do you think you just misspoke there because Trump

2142
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,136
Can withhold subsidy

2143
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,000
He just doesn't know that those are different

2144
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:03,584
I don't think you understand the concept of money being fungal

2145
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:04,864
And the government

2146
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,400
That you can

2147
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,424
Just moving around

2148
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:12,032
Money that comes in is money that goes out money is money

2149
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,056
I think

2150
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:17,408
He does know that he's just trying to score points and pretend it is

2151
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:19,712
Jerome corsi is reporting with

2152
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:21,504
What's correct

2153
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,784
Okay

2154
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:24,064
Okay now I guess

2155
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:27,904
Adjust exploitation of

2156
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:29,696
I don't think the Trump

2157
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
Does come out

2158
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:32,256
Made any claims about Fanny

2159
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,024
Freddy

2160
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,864
If Trump knows about

2161
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,216
I think you must

2162
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,264
Galaxy probably heard him

2163
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,104
I don't know it look where the crazy thing is

2164
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,384
Tom president

2165
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
The secret book

2166
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:54,272
Right

2167
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:57,344
Good teacher to Fan your own fresh

2168
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,952
Spread your own Fanning

2169
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:03,488
You get two points for that

2170
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:09,888
22 - 112 let's get boring episode we've been covering

2171
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:13,472
The Source material didn't do it for me today

2172
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
I would have rather

2173
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:18,080
Probably spent all the time talking about Heidi and Spencer

2174
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:23,456
Quite frankly cuz it was it was

2175
01:45:24,224 --> 01:45:28,832
Blast From My T-Mobile early twenties around

2176
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:34,720
Just watch f****** Laguna Beach and argue about whether or not these kids have brakes

2177
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:38,048
Loser

2178
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,352
He's got it

2179
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:44,448
Talons like number 6 probably

2180
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:50,848

Holding
