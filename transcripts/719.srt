1
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:47,006
It's time to pray.

2
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:52,786
Andy and James, I love your room.

3
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:54,060
Knowledge fight.

4
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,074
Knowledgefight.com, I love you.

5
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,658
Hey, everybody, welcome back.

6
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:01,138
Knowledge Fight.

7
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:01,514
I'm Dan.

8
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:01,982
I'm Jorge.

9
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:06,890
We're a couple of dudes like to sit around worship at the altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones.

10
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,014
Oh, indeed we are.

11
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:09,230
Dan Jordan.

12
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:11,254
Dan Jordan, quick question for you.

13
00:01:11,352 --> 00:01:16,258
What's your bright spot today, buddy? My bright spot today? It's been a little while since we've checked in on the Dreamy creamy summer sure.

14
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:20,990
And talked about some of the ice cream treats naturally have been going in my mouth.

15
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,562
Yes.

16
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,770
It hasn't slowed down since I've been gone.

17
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,378
It has not, no.

18
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:27,794
And it's been going at full speed.

19
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:32,542
I think I'm up around, like, maybe 60, 60 ice cream? I think so, yeah.

20
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:40,774
But this is I mean, part of the problem is it can be tough to find enough variety, I mean, of easily accessible things.

21
00:01:40,812 --> 00:01:44,950
You don't have, like, special order, get dry ice delivery.

22
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,626
Listen, most of the best ice creams I've had have been in San Francisco, and you're going to have to go a long way for that.

23
00:01:50,748 --> 00:01:53,650
And a couple of times I've tried to order, like, ice cream cakes.

24
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,270
No, we need to stop you from ordering ice cream cakes.

25
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:06,486
But I think there's obviously still a good couple of weeks left of the dream.

26
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,102
Anything could happen.

27
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:14,260
But right now, I am feeling like I'm pretty close to giving the title to Cool House.

28
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:25,266
H-A-U-S? Well, yes, I assumed that I think that their consistency is pretty solid, like, across the different flavors of ice cream sandwiches and novelties.

29
00:02:25,338 --> 00:02:30,234
We're talking as a whole, not like best ice cream, but best producer of ice cream.

30
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,240
I think so.

31
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:38,982
And if I had to choose the Standout All Star from them, it would probably be the Street Churro Cone.

32
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:40,154
That sounds amazing.

33
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:42,278
Yeah, it's quite good.

34
00:02:42,364 --> 00:02:43,720
I enjoyed it.

35
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:53,590
But today what I want to talk about is a little head to head challenge versus any other, because churros are incredible.

36
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,260
Yeah.

37
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,242
They're too big.

38
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:56,566
They're almost a king of desserts.

39
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:59,694
They're almost enough to get me to buy a box of that Cinnamon Toast Crunch treat.

40
00:02:59,732 --> 00:03:00,258
Absolutely.

41
00:03:00,404 --> 00:03:03,990
But I didn't, because I assume it's just Cinnamon Toast Crunch at a different garbage.

42
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,226
They have some ice cream treats that are like poppable.

43
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:10,858
Yes.

44
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,310
They're little ice cream balls.

45
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:14,186
Popcorn.

46
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:14,818
Yeah.

47
00:03:14,964 --> 00:03:17,220
There's one that's, like, low class.

48
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:28,246
I'm sorry, is there a box of wine version of the poppable ice cream deck or the Nestle's Crunch poppable? Yes.

49
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:33,180
Now, of course, actually, the problem is, the moment you said it, I was like, yes, you're right.

50
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,058
Those are the pedestrian as well.

51
00:03:36,144 --> 00:03:37,486
Yes, that's what they are.

52
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:42,586
And then there's a classier version that is, like I think it's called Dream Pops or something like that.

53
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:45,660
Yeah, whatever they are, maybe a nondairy situation.

54
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,410
Disgusting.

55
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,320
Look, they're both bad.

56
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,622
That's the end result of this interesting head to head.

57
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:55,402
Yeah.

58
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:58,262
Each one was slightly lesser spade.

59
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:00,190
Right? They both sucked.

60
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,740
Okay.

61
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,458
It can't all be street church cones, man.

62
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:14,410
In situations where you're dealing with a subpart snack, usually the snack that really goes for being the most subpar winds up tasting better.

63
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,506
Also, that reminds me that also I got in under the Wire and got a Choco Taco before.

64
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:23,830
Where? Before they shut down operations.

65
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,070
Before they were victims of cancel culture.

66
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,482
The ultimate cancel culture seasons.

67
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:30,886
Good.

68
00:04:30,948 --> 00:04:31,654
It was good.

69
00:04:31,752 --> 00:04:32,482
Yeah.

70
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:39,050
I will say that I remember being better, but I think that's how almost everything your taste buds were newer.

71
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,490
The rose colored glasses of history.

72
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,950
Look back on these ice cream novelties of yours and you think like, oh, God, it was so perfect.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,150
The ice cream was just the right consistency.

74
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,820
True.

75
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:58,174
But yeah, almost every time you're going to get one of those, the taco itself, the shell is going to be a little bit the consistency isn't great.

76
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:04,690
Sure, tacos are kind of a bad thing to have, like, too squishy, middle crunch.

77
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,474
But the insides, if you bite down on it, ice cream is going to spell out.

78
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,462
That's almost inevitable.

79
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:12,420
That is true.

80
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,798
But, yeah, still pretty good.

81
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:15,746
Better than either of the poppables.

82
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,340
That's not hard to do.

83
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,038
So what about you? What's your brain? My bright spot is yakuza.

84
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,270
Like a dragon.

85
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,758
I enjoyed it.

86
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:31,500
We talked earlier about how difficult we've been having finding a video game.

87
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:39,526
We thought we'd play something simultaneously, so we tried Yakuza Zero because it was on sale for, like, $45.

88
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,602
Yeah, it was a good start.

89
00:05:41,736 --> 00:05:42,538
It was fun.

90
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:43,102
It was fun.

91
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:45,674
But I think both of us found the combat a little bit monotonous.

92
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:50,278
I'm just not a punching punch guy, which is weird because it's essentially the same game.

93
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:51,886
Like, all the sense of humor is there.

94
00:05:51,948 --> 00:06:01,970
All of the story beats are very similar and stuff, but there's something about turn based JRPGs being dropped into modern day Tokyo that is hilarious.

95
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,518
It's just very funny.

96
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:04,510
And it's a good game.

97
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,410
I like it.

98
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:05,950
Well, good.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,358
Yeah.

100
00:06:06,444 --> 00:06:07,800
Maybe I'll give it a try.

101
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,118
Okay.

102
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,270
Maybe I won't.

103
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,470
We'll see.

104
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,866
You're not really a turn based RPG guy too often, are you? I think I was the person who told you to try three houses.

105
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,254
No, for sure.

106
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:26,806
But, I mean, this is more like I have not historically been too much of that.

107
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:27,382
Sure.

108
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:31,090
But I think that maybe it's something that I enjoy more than I know.

109
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,390
Yeah.

110
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,760
So I don't know.

111
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,558
I think I enjoy that.

112
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:35,458
You might appreciate it.

113
00:06:35,484 --> 00:06:35,854
I don't know.

114
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:36,998
I like three houses.

115
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:37,666
There we go.

116
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:42,900
Hey, so, Jordan, today we got an episode to go over.

117
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:59,618
I don't know if it's unprecedented, but it's rare, certainly, and that is that we're actually going to go back to the past, but only, like, a couple of days before our last episode because I realized that we missed something in terms of the catching up to the presentation.

118
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:00,070
Sure.

119
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,550
So we're going to be talking about August 19, 2022 today.

120
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,994
Interesting.

121
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:09,562
And that is because this is the day after Brian Stelter got oh, that's right.

122
00:07:09,756 --> 00:07:12,310
After we got Brian Stelter canceled.

123
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,430
Look, I don't think there's a direct correlation.

124
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,110
I don't know.

125
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,818
You don't know.

126
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,430
Well, certainly no causation.

127
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,582
There is correlation.

128
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:21,190
That's true.

129
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,474
They let us on.

130
00:07:22,632 --> 00:07:24,358
They should never have done that.

131
00:07:24,504 --> 00:07:26,594
Next week is his last episode.

132
00:07:26,702 --> 00:07:29,150
Understand the consequences cosmically.

133
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:39,578
I understand that maybe it wasn't us who got Stelter specifically fired, but by us going on CNN, it unlocks Pandora's boss.

134
00:07:39,614 --> 00:07:40,102
Absolutely.

135
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:44,282
And I do think that it had something to do with your Chicago Teachers Union shirt.

136
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:46,426
Maybe that got Stelter in hot water.

137
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:47,220
Yes.

138
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:49,882
Worth it.

139
00:07:50,016 --> 00:07:50,242
Yeah.

140
00:07:50,256 --> 00:07:56,234
I was looking at some of the stuff that had happened over the course of the time that we'd missed.

141
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:56,530
Sure.

142
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:04,042
And obviously there is the fake turning on Trump and Jugan's daughter's death that they seemed like actually important things.

143
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:10,574
And in that I kind of just forgot that Stelter, his show had been canceled.

144
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:15,766
And I don't know, maybe there was a part of it that was blocked me, that was blocking it out of my mind since we were on it.

145
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:16,440
Right.

146
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,030
Also, we don't really pay attention to TV, honestly.

147
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,470
No.

148
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,986
But this is important for Alex.

149
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:22,330
Yes.

150
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,050
That's the thing.

151
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,386
Yeah.

152
00:08:23,448 --> 00:08:27,422
This is way more important for Alex than anyone other than Brian Stelter.

153
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:27,742
Right.

154
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:30,482
I think it's probably more important to him than Stelter.

155
00:08:30,506 --> 00:08:31,090
Yeah.

156
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,182
Stelter is going to get another job somewhere.

157
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:33,838
Yeah.

158
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:36,850
So we'll get into this and see how Alex takes the news.

159
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,074
But before we do, Jordan, let's say hello to somebody wonk.

160
00:08:39,122 --> 00:08:39,730
That's a great idea.

161
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,562
So first, this shout out goes to Emily from Laura Alice.

162
00:08:43,646 --> 00:08:46,414
She's sorry she fall asleep to this every night.

163
00:08:46,452 --> 00:08:47,038
Thank you so much.

164
00:08:47,064 --> 00:08:48,250
You're now policy walk.

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,390
I'm a policy walk.

166
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,398
Thank you very much.

167
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:53,654
Next, the foundation to finally take Alex Jones's daughter fishing.

168
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:54,238
Thank you so much.

169
00:08:54,264 --> 00:08:55,414
You're now a policy walk.

170
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:56,434
I'm a policy walk.

171
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:57,226
Thank you very much.

172
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,990
Check out next the worst druid ever.

173
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,578
Thank you so much.

174
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:00,754
You're now a policy walk.

175
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:01,922
I'm a policy wonk.

176
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you very much.

177
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,834
Next, the dreamy creamy supremie.

178
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:06,442
Thank you so much.

179
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:07,706
You're now policy wonk.

180
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:08,762
I'm a policy wonk.

181
00:09:08,786 --> 00:09:09,490
Thank you very much.

182
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,294
Thank you.

183
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:16,570
And Devonstone, the legal eagle is a beautiful man and I now know that Mark Bankston is a handsome beast as well.

184
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,122
Thank you so much.

185
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,338
You're now a policy wonk.

186
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,478
I'm a policy wonk.

187
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:20,302
Thank you very much.

188
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:20,734
Thank you.

189
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:22,598
And finally we got a technical cry in the mix, Jordan.

190
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:24,550
And I'm going to go with the old sound bite for this.

191
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,690
So thank you so much.

192
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,682
To Stephen, the bachelor squash of Ireland.

193
00:09:28,826 --> 00:09:30,266
You're now a technicrat.

194
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:31,860
I'm a policy walk.

195
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,790
Your mother, tell her you're brilliant.

196
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,110
Someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop daddy sharp.

197
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,646
Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean black accent.

198
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:45,206
He's a loser.

199
00:09:45,398 --> 00:09:46,778
Little Teddy baby.

200
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,418
I don't want to hate black people.

201
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,154
I renounce.

202
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:50,050
Jesus Christ.

203
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,002
Thank you, Stephen.

204
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:52,030
Yes, thank you very much.

205
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:04,090
Bachelor squat but of Ireland, which has fallen out of favor to Scotland in the Knowledge Flight International Listener ranking stepping up Ireland.

206
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,740
The celts are going to come for us, man.

207
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:09,010
So here we go.

208
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,014
We're starting off the show here.

209
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:22,210
This is how Alex comes m it's live, August 19, 2022, friday edition of the Vaunting.

210
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,310
The attacked the embattled infowars transmission.

211
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,790
There's too much confusion.

212
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:54,578
If you thought the news was intense a year ago, do you think it's intense now? You ain't seen nothing yet.

213
00:10:54,724 --> 00:11:04,034
Thank you so much for joining us on this live, uncensored, unfiltered, teleprompter free transmission of we the People.

214
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:05,402
It's interesting, man.

215
00:11:05,536 --> 00:11:09,880
Essentially nothing Alex says about his own show is accurate there at all.

216
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,678
I guess embattled just means consequences are mounting for things I've done.

217
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:16,070
Sure, yeah.

218
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,538
You can make an argument that he's teleprompter free, but that doesn't mean anything.

219
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:22,994
And he has a screen in front of him the producers put messages on.

220
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:29,330
He has a board that shows him the callers, and he has an earpiece that the producers are talking to him throughout the show on.

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,686
But he doesn't have a teleprompter.

222
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:32,366
That's true.

223
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:36,222
See, but it's not as freewheeling of a show as Alex wants it to appear.

224
00:11:36,306 --> 00:11:40,110
Yeah, the show is not uncensored because he can't swear on the radio.

225
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,014
So by definition, he's operating under censorship.

226
00:11:43,182 --> 00:11:46,922
And I couldn't imagine a show that's more filtered than this one.

227
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:57,014
Just recently, with the acknowledgement of Trump taking money from Pfizer, we saw a crystal clear example of the sort of filtering Alex does to the information that's acceptable to be on his show.

228
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,610
This is a common thing, too.

229
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:11,186
Like, Alex will conveniently pretend to not be aware of certain things about figures he's trying to support, but when they fall slightly out of his good graces, he magically knows about all the things that should have been a big problem for him before.

230
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:23,440
We saw another glaring example of this with Bill Barr, who Alex loved, but then when he wouldn't back Trump's nonsense at the end of his presidency, alex suddenly had information about Barr's family's ties to Epstein that never had come up before.

231
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,650
This is an intensely censored filtered and produced show.

232
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,658
It just appears to not be any of those things because Alex is too lazy to prepare, so he has to fill his show with pointless rants and his imagination is disgusting.

233
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:39,114
So he ends up rambling about grotesque topics for long stretches.

234
00:12:39,282 --> 00:12:42,110
Glad to see him rocking out to a little All Along Watchtower.

235
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:51,222
I was thinking about that song and it is kind of interesting to really go back in time and think about how much of that type of music blew people's minds.

236
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:51,614
Sure.

237
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:52,766
Right? Yeah.

238
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:56,054
Now that is fucking nothing to me.

239
00:12:56,092 --> 00:12:58,994
Like, music has moved way beyond that back then.

240
00:12:59,032 --> 00:13:00,614
That must have blown people's heads off.

241
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:02,174
Yeah, I used to think about that quite a bit.

242
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:05,166
Like the idea of this being played on the radio.

243
00:13:05,238 --> 00:13:09,722
Yeah, the first times you heard it on the what the fuck? Yeah.

244
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:13,694
How could you get you were listening to fucking Clog dancing before that.

245
00:13:13,732 --> 00:13:15,362
And then all of a sudden this happens.

246
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:19,062
Of course you lost your welcome over to Baba O'Reilly.

247
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:20,080
Oh, my God.

248
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:24,530
Everybody was talking about the latest fiddle player before this happened.

249
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,574
And now you're like, holy shit, what am I doing in the small town? I get it.

250
00:13:28,612 --> 00:13:30,242
It's oversimplifying things a little bit.

251
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:38,558
But yeah, that wonder is kind of like maybe it's just because it's something that is inaccessible to us and something outside of our life experience.

252
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:39,002
Sure.

253
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:46,542
But imagining you know what it is too? It's a desire and urge to go back to a monoculture.

254
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,234
Sure.

255
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:48,170
I can see that.

256
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,082
It's like everybody was connected by hearing these songs on the radio.

257
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:53,800
Sure.

258
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:03,170
There was this thing that everybody was experiencing, or at least everybody within your sort of your cohort I get what you're saying.

259
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:13,146
I'm going to throw it more towards like I'm longing for the days whenever a discovery was more like Pythagoras discovered A squared plus B squared.

260
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:17,906
And it's like, holy shit, nobody's going to discover anything for like 1000 years after that.

261
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:22,490
So All Along the Watchtower, nobody had heard shit like that before.

262
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,614
But whenever Kanye comes out with, Jesus walks.

263
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,954
That's great.

264
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:27,998
That's awesome.

265
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:38,562
And it's epoch changing, but it's not like back then because we already had All Along the Watchtower, if I didn't have Jesus Walks, I could still listen to that shit.

266
00:14:38,646 --> 00:14:40,190
They didn't have anything.

267
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,522
They had nothing.

268
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:45,182
They had those four bastards in the past.

269
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:47,390
They were wasted.

270
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,242
It was all just nothing.

271
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:59,140
And then Jimmy Hendrix came along and then one day, and I believe that's a cover of a Bob Dylan saw too.

272
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,040
So they actually had another version of this song already.

273
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,034
Great time.

274
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,162
Your point makes sense.

275
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:16,100
And one of the problems is Alex is so dumb and boring that we end up being very interested in going down that road.

276
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:23,286
So Alex has a big news story that I think will probably be his main focus for today.

277
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:24,510
Let me just do this.

278
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,398
Let me just give you the main stack headlines.

279
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:31,110
We're going to plow through them all, take calls and have special guests in studio.

280
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,678
They put out a press release yesterday.

281
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:49,050
They put out a podcast with Claude Schwab and others and they have declared their number one enemy infowars and have said that they've hired 110,000 operatives.

282
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,810
But they called information warriors.

283
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,230
Where have we heard that term before? The Info Warriors.

284
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,450
The counter.

285
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:02,946
man.

286
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:07,338
I keep trying to explain to the listeners they're really scared of us.

287
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:14,802
Not just me, but the fact that we've got the Death Star plans big, if true.

288
00:16:14,996 --> 00:16:17,470
Yesterday they put out this press release.

289
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,774
A lot of agents for one press release.

290
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:20,526
That's true.

291
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:30,618
So I was able to find the story that Alex is talking about, and it's an article in News Punch about the World Economic Forum hiring 110,000 people to combat misinformation on social media.

292
00:16:30,764 --> 00:16:38,050
This was a post that was published on August 17, 2022, and it's based on a video published by a channel called The People's Voice.

293
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:48,502
This is just like a junior varsity ass infowars channel on YouTube, and their main source is a podcast the World Economic Forum put out featuring the UN communications director Melissa Fleming.

294
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:56,926
She never mentions Infowars being Class Schwab's number one enemy, though she does discuss efforts they were taking to push back against misinformation.

295
00:16:57,118 --> 00:17:02,122
The first one she mentions is called Verified, which is done with the help of a communications firm.

296
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:08,070
And it was an effort to take solid information and put it into formats that would be easy to share on social media.

297
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,950
The concern was that so much of the actual information that you could have was buried in inaccessible PDFs and large documents.

298
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,522
Whereas misinformation is packaged so slickly and it's optimized for engagement.

299
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,874
That's the entire business model for misinformation.

300
00:17:21,922 --> 00:17:23,562
So it's a primary concern for them.

301
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:28,810
Whereas the folks at the UN were a bit behind on making the information that was provided good for posting.

302
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:35,554
Well, I mean, the fundamental issue is that they're running up against learning is hard and chocolate is delicious.

303
00:17:35,662 --> 00:17:36,320
Yeah.

304
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:46,758
Essentially, another initiative they were launching is called Pause, where they were trying to spread the message that you should stop and think before reposting something that seems too good to be true.

305
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:50,074
It excites you, so you want to post it, but maybe it's bullshit.

306
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:55,674
Take a second to think about it, and if you still want to share it once that adrenaline wears off, go ahead.

307
00:17:55,832 --> 00:18:01,210
Apparently, the belief is that encouraging the sort of behavior would cut down drastically on nonsense posting.

308
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,354
I'm skeptical, but maybe it couldn't hurt.

309
00:18:04,462 --> 00:18:13,942
She also does say that they have recruited 110,000 information volunteers who are applying these kinds of practices and introducing good information into misinformation spaces.

310
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:20,070
I guess Alex could consider that information warfare, and maybe he's right, but I also think it is defensive in nature.

311
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,620
All that being said, this podcast was released in November 2020.

312
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,226
This is not news.

313
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:27,382
It was yesterday.

314
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,170
So close.

315
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,482
It's being presented in this newspaper article as if it is.

316
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:36,438
And because Alex has no idea what he's talking about or covering, he thinks it's news, too.

317
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:44,338
If only he'd listened to Fleming's advice about thinking before you repost something ironically, maybe he would have gotten this story a little closer to accurate.

318
00:18:44,434 --> 00:18:45,380
It's possible.

319
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:47,746
Doubtful.

320
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:48,234
Yeah.

321
00:18:48,332 --> 00:18:55,314
I mean, I was wondering here's my problem there, okay, with the new Sponge thing.

322
00:18:55,352 --> 00:19:00,406
Can the World Economic Forum just hire 1000 people? They're volunteers.

323
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:01,770
No, that's what I'm saying.

324
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,042
That's what I'm saying.

325
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:13,642
That's my big issue with that is like, what are you talking about? Nobody has just the kind of cash to toss around at 110,000 new employees, let alone the World Economic Forum.

326
00:19:13,726 --> 00:19:13,938
Yeah.

327
00:19:13,964 --> 00:19:17,950
And I'm willing to bet that a lot of this is fairly unofficial.

328
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:24,790
I'm willing to bet that some of this is just like people signed some kind of a pledge, some sort of a symbolic pledge.

329
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,090
No, the Nielsen ratings are 100% accurate.

330
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,370
Thank God for that.

331
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,030
Yeah.

332
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,670
But Alex is getting a lot of mileage out of this two year old podcast and things happened yesterday.

333
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,270
Ouch.

334
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,466
Two years old.

335
00:19:38,648 --> 00:19:39,318
Oh, boy.

336
00:19:39,404 --> 00:19:40,554
Not good.

337
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,594
So we get to Stelter here and Alex is in a mood.

338
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:51,270
We have some celebratory things here to make fun of, but I don't know if I can laugh because I'm going to cry.

339
00:19:51,650 --> 00:20:01,460
Brian Stelter, who already had no viewers, so he already hit show, was already canceled if no one's watching, like 100,000 viewers, I mean, small local radio shows have that.

340
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:06,800
We have millions and millions and millions of listeners an hour.

341
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:17,858
So if you already didn't have any viewers, it's a fact that you had a zombie broadcast like CNN.

342
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:19,154
It's dead, it's not alive.

343
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:19,750
No one's watching.

344
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,810
It's a joke.

345
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,898
I think this is sad.

346
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:27,038
You can't even really muster the energy to dance on Stelter's grave.

347
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:32,554
Yeah, but you know what should be his greatest day ever? No.

348
00:20:32,652 --> 00:20:43,106
When you have a nemesis, all right, you can't be happy when your nemesis is gone because your nemesis is what pushed you to the heights that you couldn't have reached without said nemesis.

349
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:44,014
That's true.

350
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:46,754
It's not a formal enemy, an enemy you defeat.

351
00:20:46,802 --> 00:20:49,714
But Stelter was a man among men.

352
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:52,546
We are about to play I'm going to play a clip a little bit later.

353
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:55,630
Alex is repeatedly yelling that Stelter is his enemy.

354
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,186
Okay, well, maybe I did my best.

355
00:20:58,248 --> 00:20:59,938
Yeah, I get what you're saying, though.

356
00:20:59,964 --> 00:21:05,160
You have more of a bond with the only people you have a bond with.

357
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:10,874
And I think that there is a like, well, I won't have him to punch around anymore.

358
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:20,650
There's probably a disappointment, like when Alex doesn't have a Democrat in office or whatever, he doesn't have that easy tool.

359
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,834
And for Stelter to be gone, it's going to be a little bit harder for him to, I don't know, deal with Wolf Blitzer.

360
00:21:26,882 --> 00:21:27,490
Yeah.

361
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,030
It must be bittersweet.

362
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:37,440
It must be a bittersweet feeling to know that you've perhaps outlived your oldest enemy, but you're still an old wasting man yourself.

363
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,520
True.

364
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,030
Deep.

365
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,114
So we're going to get into a little bit of coverage that Alex has about monkey pox.

366
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,598
And I'm just going to give a little bit of a warning.

367
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:51,626
This is pretty intensely homophobic.

368
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:55,042
And why would I expect otherwise? Yeah, pretty bad.

369
00:21:55,236 --> 00:22:03,600
By the way, 99.9% of the monkey pops cases with no deaths in the US are gay men having hundreds of sexual partners a month.

370
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:16,210
And the media is defending it, saying, we want you to go under lockdown, we want you to wear masks, but we want to continue actually have articles, the gay orgies.

371
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:19,958
So you got to wear a mask, you got to go under lockdown.

372
00:22:19,994 --> 00:22:26,342
They're say, Coming soon, but these men can get together and give each other a bunch of diseases.

373
00:22:26,426 --> 00:22:28,370
Disgusting.

374
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,482
See, that's not good.

375
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,670
Wow, man.

376
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:39,742
I hope all those people like Alex Lee Moyer and Glenn Greenwald and Joe Rogan, who loved to carry water for Alex, like the kind of messages they're steering people towards, because that's pretty cool.

377
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,966
Yeah, no, it's great.

378
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:57,242
So while it is true that the available information does indicate that men who have sex with men are disproportionately represented in the cases of monkeypox that have been identified at this point, the way Alex is covering this is unacceptable and is essentially no different than the rhetoric you would have heard him spout in the early days of AIDS.

379
00:22:57,386 --> 00:23:08,042
He has an intense disdain for the LGBTQ community, but he knows it's unfashionable to just be honest about that, so he finds other stories he can use as cover to express his hate.

380
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:18,910
An important point about this whole dynamic comes up in a CNBC article about 98% of patients who provided demographic information to clinics identified as men who have sex with men.

381
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,350
According to the CDC, that's not necessarily saying that 98% of people who have contracted monkey pox are men who have sex with men.

382
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,380
There may be a percentage of people who saw treatment who did not provide that demographic information.

383
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:36,586
That said, it would be slightly dishonest to say that there's not something statistically relevant here.

384
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:47,258
There do appear to be increased rates in the community of gay and bisexual men, but it's dangerous to create this association and even more dangerous to pretend that it's just an STD.

385
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:48,790
It's a complicated situation.

386
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,742
People like Alex acting like this are going to get innocent people hurt, and I think that's what he wants.

387
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:57,734
Incidentally, there's no call for monkey pox lockdowns.

388
00:23:57,782 --> 00:24:01,354
And in fact, the reality is just the opposite of what Alex is saying.

389
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:05,986
Tedros, the head of the World Health Organization said this at the end of last month.

390
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:12,310
Quote, for men who have sex with men, this includes, for the moment, you're talking about, like, mitigating actions.

391
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:22,882
This includes, for the moment, reducing your number of sexual partners, reconsidering sex with new partners, and exchanging contact details with any new partners to enable follow up if needed.

392
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:33,638
Alex hates the LGBTQ community, so he makes up shit to attack them with things that paint him as the victim and them as a privileged class who the system wouldn't dare even suggest inconveniencing.

393
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:41,770
He's pretending that the government is going to force good people like himself to lock down over monkey pox, but they won't even think of suggesting behavioral advice to gay men.

394
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,214
This is complete bullshit.

395
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:53,018
Because the World Health Organization has a goal of dealing with the outbreak by serving the people who are affected by it while working to minimize any stigma that's going to lead to discrimination.

396
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:56,170
Conversely, Alex's goal is that discrimination itself.

397
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:05,942
So furthering, that goal is not best served by dealing with what the World Health Organization is actually doing, but rather by creating a fake storyline that conforms to your persecution complex.

398
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:07,382
And it's complete shit.

399
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,100
Yeah.

400
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,450
Great.

401
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,158
Yeah, it sucks.

402
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:13,020
Yeah.

403
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,822
First off, only Wilt Chamberlain has had hundreds of partners in a month.

404
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:20,134
Right.

405
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:21,430
Let's start right there.

406
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,894
And even if you want to take that and ground it a little bit sure.

407
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:32,174
The close contact that can spread monkey pox is not something you need 100 partners.

408
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,314
You could have one partner.

409
00:25:33,362 --> 00:25:33,960
Absolutely.

410
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:45,420
You could go on a date with somebody and have a great time and even use condoms conceivably and still contracted from skin to skin contact.

411
00:25:46,110 --> 00:26:00,458
And also, all we're really seeing is what happens whenever you have a community that is isolated due to shit and a disease breaks out in an isolated community, it is going to break out of that community eventually.

412
00:26:00,554 --> 00:26:07,846
But as it stands right now, the only reason that it's stuck there is because of discrimination that's already inherent in the fucking system.

413
00:26:07,968 --> 00:26:08,254
True.

414
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:12,660
Like, this is a self made creation again, always.

415
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,486
Yeah.

416
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:14,510
Very frustrating.

417
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:20,374
And there's also a self fulfillingness that Alex is kind of working towards.

418
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:30,610
I think it was fairly similar with Covet, and that is that his actions and a lot of the rhetoric that he's putting out is exactly what you would do if you wanted the disease to spread more.

419
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,934
We said it at the beginning.

420
00:26:31,982 --> 00:26:41,890
He must have been paid for by Covet, that's the only explanation, is that he was working for ladies and gentlemen, we are subsidized by Cove.

421
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:51,922
Is it possible for a virus to congeal together a personality long enough to pay Alex $50 million in order to spread itself? I don't think so.

422
00:26:51,996 --> 00:26:54,250
But if it is possible, that's what's happening.

423
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,066
That is what happens.

424
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:59,026
And Alex gets worse, even let's say that's great.

425
00:26:59,088 --> 00:27:00,058
Yeah, that's great.

426
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:02,866
Absolutely disgusting to spread disease like that.

427
00:27:02,928 --> 00:27:05,590
I don't care if you're heterosexual or homosexual.

428
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,222
Men and women were having hundreds of sexual partners a month and spreading disease.

429
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,670
That's disgusting.

430
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,486
That's dangerous.

431
00:27:14,618 --> 00:27:22,618
It's like saying you're going to go lit toilet bowls at the airport or you're going to go to a grocery store without a mask and spit on it.

432
00:27:22,644 --> 00:27:27,550
It's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps in China because he's gay.

433
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,222
He wears a little turtleneck.

434
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,422
It's like, well, he's not threatening.

435
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:30,806
He's gay.

436
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:31,330
It's all right.

437
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,274
He runs death camps with suicide nets around him.

438
00:27:33,312 --> 00:27:33,994
The same thing here.

439
00:27:34,032 --> 00:27:35,340
Well, it's all right.

440
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,482
We got to lock down society because of what you're doing.

441
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,020
Just keep doing it.

442
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,250
We're going to make little kids though, wear mask over their faces.

443
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:52,270
It's like, well, so what if they rape dogs, be Seality, and give them monkey pox, and they got to be euthanized liberal.

444
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,102
It's all about they can do whatever they want, and we got to just stand down and put up with this crap.

445
00:27:59,246 --> 00:27:59,818
So, yeah.

446
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:33,806
Rogan, how do you feel about Alex suggesting that there's a connection between being gay and raping dogs? These motherfuckers, for years, multiple years, bitched and whined about having to wear a mask to stop spreading disease, and now they're going to wring their hands and, oh, my God, someone spreading disease, doing something I don't like, instead of going into random strangers home and spitting all over their shit, coughing in front of somebody at an abortion clinic.

447
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:40,570
Like, all of this shit, they are diseaseridden horror monsters, and they're going to come at me with this bullshit.

448
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,110
That's very frustrating.

449
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:42,682
It is.

450
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:43,754
It's very frustrating.

451
00:28:43,802 --> 00:28:45,170
I understand your frustration.

452
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:53,690
I think I'm more frustrated by the aggressively anti gay mentality that he's expressing.

453
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,442
Right.

454
00:28:54,636 --> 00:28:56,954
Everything that he says is it's absurd.

455
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:58,346
It's awful.

456
00:28:58,478 --> 00:28:59,618
It's fucking awful.

457
00:28:59,714 --> 00:29:00,540
It is.

458
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,586
So, look, Alex wants you to post his shit online.

459
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,066
Yeah.

460
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,002
Because you have to.

461
00:29:08,076 --> 00:29:13,740
You'd fight back against Schwab, but, man, let that sink in and put this full show headline up.

462
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:26,170
World Economic Forum publicly declares an Information Warfare operation with information warriors to counter Infowars and other disinformation outlets.

463
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:47,794
How honored are you as the army of Infowars to know that you're in direct conflict and information warfare with Claus Schwab and the New Order? Now do you understand why I say share the articles? Now do you understand why I say, magnify what we're doing? Because I don't want to be the best in the fight, because I'm not that good.

464
00:29:47,892 --> 00:29:48,934
I want to stop these people.

465
00:29:48,972 --> 00:30:02,662
I want to see other leaders like Tucker Carlson, Balsan, Ro, Joe Rogan, and other stand up, and they're starting to but you know what? The enemy recognizes us and me as the number one enemy in their new world order.

466
00:30:02,796 --> 00:30:08,374
I told you 20 years ago, I was eating a chicken fried steak and drinking an iced tea.

467
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:14,402
27 years ago, not again at Waterloo Ice House after I done a two hour TV show that I literally talked about a vision.

468
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:15,650
It was like a download.

469
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:25,798
And God showed me the future, what was going to happen, and also how dangerous would be, and said, Are you ready to sign on for this? I remember sitting there alone in that restaurant and going, yes, I accept this.

470
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,618
Like, I was floating.

471
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:28,490
I go? Yes, I accept the mission.

472
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,482
And it went, here's the rest of the download.

473
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:33,202
And I got slammed with the imprint of data.

474
00:30:33,276 --> 00:30:35,570
And it was like, all right, soldier, you joined.

475
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,454
Get ready.

476
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:39,646
I literally was commissioned by God for this war.

477
00:30:39,768 --> 00:30:40,234
Wow.

478
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:40,882
Yeah.

479
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:46,618
This seems like somebody who's so much more reliable than the mainstream media.

480
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:47,340
Yeah.

481
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,718
This is.

482
00:30:48,744 --> 00:30:59,254
A guy who you go to to cut through the bullshit, right? I mean, Jake and Elwood Blues were busy, so God had to commission a different asshole for this job.

483
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:05,220
Honestly, their mission from God was saving a bunch of children.

484
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:10,990
It was lower stakes than this mission saving an orphanage by doing a concert.

485
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,860
That, I think, is fine.

486
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,646
I mean, if you're going to have delusions of grandeur, at least that's a good one.

487
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:21,658
Yeah, this is a little bit different.

488
00:31:21,744 --> 00:31:23,026
Maybe a little bit wrong.

489
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:28,690
So look, Claus Schwab put out this podcast that he didn't yesterday.

490
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:29,986
Two years ago.

491
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,382
Yeah.

492
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:33,120
And Alex wants to explain to you why.

493
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:36,960
Here we are inside the New World Order.

494
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:56,762
Well, the World Economic Forum, which is the mouth of the New World Order, the mouth of the UN, the mouth of the megacorporations, the mouth of slave masters, the spokesperson for evil has come out and said that their attempted world continual, never ending lockdown and forced injection failed.

495
00:31:56,846 --> 00:31:58,210
It was still devastating.

496
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:08,640
And now there's a total rejection happening of them across the board and billions of rotting poison mRNA gene therapies that no one will take.

497
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:15,262
And their answer is a declaration of war.

498
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:19,030
Next level censorship.

499
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:31,022
With 110,000 volunteers inside media and big tech, an army of Brian Stelter Humpty Dumpty Pennywise's.

500
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:33,242
Well, Brian Stelter got fired.

501
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,778
Brian Stelter, humpty dumpty.

502
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:37,262
Pennywise is a barrage of imagery.

503
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:37,774
Yeah.

504
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:41,566
So that clip brings up something that I want to stress for a second here.

505
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:47,098
So a lot is made of how Alex just makes stuff up all the time, and rightfully so.

506
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:52,886
However, it's key to recognize that he does more than just makeup details and lie about concrete facts.

507
00:32:53,018 --> 00:33:00,274
He also writes stories out of these fake facts that are necessary to explain them within the context of his made up world.

508
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:13,358
For instance, here Alex has this headline that he's done zero investigation into that he's presenting as the World Economic Forum, declaring war on infowars by hiring 110,000 information volunteers to counter misinformation.

509
00:33:13,514 --> 00:33:20,170
In order to bolster this story, he needs to connect it to some of his larger storylines in order to embellish the story.

510
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:29,390
Alex says that the World Economic Forum is doing this because there are so many shots that no one wants to take and all the antivax people are winning the war of ideas.

511
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,830
So they enlisted an army to crush antivaxx voices like Alex.

512
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:39,254
This is Tana Mont to him running a disinformation campaign against a campaign meant to fight misinformation.

513
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:40,330
Which makes sense.

514
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,374
Liars really don't like fact checkers.

515
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:50,242
Yeah, I mean, why would you not go after them? Yeah, but what's critical here is that Alex is making up the why for this story out of thin air.

516
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:57,802
He's got a piece of information, this 110,000 volunteers thing, but he has literally no other details about this story.

517
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,566
So he's just making it up.

518
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:06,542
He doesn't realize this was a story from November 2020 before any of the vaccines were even available, which is kind of sad.

519
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:18,806
In order to make sense of why the World Economic Forum would be doing this in the present day, as Alex thinks they are, he just falls back on what version of this story would be most emotionally satisfying for himself and the audience.

520
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:26,760
That's why the rationale for their alleged action is that Alex's side is too successful and they have all these expiring vaccines that no one wants.

521
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:39,134
This explanation is a fiction that creates a sense of victory for the listeners and more importantly, it frames their online activity as a critical part of the fight against the World Economic Forums information volunteers.

522
00:34:39,302 --> 00:34:44,810
Promoting Alex's content isn't just about getting new people into his revenue streams and selling his dumb pills.

523
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:55,270
It's actually fighting back against claus, schwab's cyber army who are only even being enlisted because you all were too powerful with your previous posting of Alex's content to begin with.

524
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,750
Right.

525
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,622
This narrative works really well for Alex on a couple of fronts.

526
00:34:58,646 --> 00:35:01,874
But it's completely made up the simple detail that the podcast.

527
00:35:01,922 --> 00:35:03,206
That this is the basis.

528
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:14,782
That the basis for this entire story came out in November 2020 reveals it all to just be shit that Alex is making up to stroke his own ego and convince the listeners to continue working as his unpaid social media team.

529
00:35:14,856 --> 00:35:16,274
Yeah, it's wild.

530
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:16,726
Yeah.

531
00:35:16,788 --> 00:35:26,580
I mean, it is a little bit like somebody took a rent fare too far and it's just now his full life, just every day is the rent fare and whatever.

532
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:35,242
Like, if somebody brings a phone in there, they got to retcon the entire rent fare to make sense of the phone being inside.

533
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:41,650
And then every time you add a new thing, now we're in a cyberpunk rentfair, and so now we've got God over there.

534
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,162
Like, it's just a bigger and bigger rent fare.

535
00:35:44,246 --> 00:35:49,330
I was not listening to you because I started to think about Renfield Renfare.

536
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,766
What would that look like? Or a renfare.

537
00:35:52,838 --> 00:35:54,610
Renfield renfare.

538
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,638
Yeah, he's got a gallon of mead.

539
00:36:01,734 --> 00:36:02,946
A flagging.

540
00:36:03,138 --> 00:36:04,010
No, I see that.

541
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:04,238
Yeah.

542
00:36:04,264 --> 00:36:07,538
Sorry, I know you were making a point, but I got distracted by word point.

543
00:36:07,564 --> 00:36:09,294
I think I just started talking about rent fares.

544
00:36:09,342 --> 00:36:09,842
Yeah.

545
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:14,786
So here Alex plays a clip of that podcast that, again is two years old.

546
00:36:14,968 --> 00:36:23,514
We have announces a recruitment of 110,000 information warriors close quote to counter info wars.

547
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:24,902
We specifically in.

548
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:33,618
Their documents are named and the American people and others resisting their design planetary collapse.

549
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:38,800
Let's play a short clip of the podcast that the WEF spokesperson just put out.

550
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:47,234
A part of this verified and pause campaign entails also recruiting people around the world.

551
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:53,450
And so far we've recruited 110,000 information volunteers.

552
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:59,730
It's just an elaborate fiction based on Alex not looking into the story that he's telling.

553
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,400
Yes.

554
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,566
Do we have any follow up on these volunteers? Like, whenever she announces, we've got 110,000.

555
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:08,618
That's 110,000 people signed up.

556
00:37:08,644 --> 00:37:10,646
Did anybody actually do fuck off.

557
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,042
No.

558
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:13,970
I know we didn't solve this information in the past two years.

559
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,306
No.

560
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:19,050
But I did see a recent thread on the conspiracy subreddit.

561
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,478
Okay.

562
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:24,470
And the people were like, oh, that explains all the shills commenting recently.

563
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,686
Recently.

564
00:37:25,758 --> 00:37:27,230
Because they didn't look into it either.

565
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,926
Of course not.

566
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:30,230
Yes, they just saw this News Punch article.

567
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,950
The date on the article is recent.

568
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,146
Oh, all the shills? Yeah.

569
00:37:36,268 --> 00:38:04,290
When will the chills stop shilling, dad? It really also brings into sharp focus the idea what a joke, this notion of critical thinking in conspiracy and Alex Jonesy communities are, did any of these folks and their great leader Alex stop to ask themselves what's the context of this? Is there an actual story here? No, it's convenient.

570
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,082
It's saying what you want it to say.

571
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:07,430
Right.

572
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:17,538
And so you will not only accept it as real and true and current, you'll embellish and make up details about it to make it even more perfect for your ego.

573
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:27,530
I do appreciate anybody who gets a piece of information and then instantly is like, well, that explains this other thing that it doesn't have anything to do with.

574
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,074
I enjoy that because there's nothing in between.

575
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:34,382
You'd think there would be something in between, but no, you're just like, that explains that.

576
00:38:34,456 --> 00:38:36,170
My world makes sense again.

577
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,190
Hooray.

578
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,742
So Alex is mad at Sam Harris, and I don't care.

579
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:42,100
I want to hit business.

580
00:38:44,230 --> 00:39:05,478
Because if you want to talk about a Rosetta Stone, if you want to talk about a skeleton key, if you want to talk about something that really illustrates who we're up against and their hubris, their smugness, their bravada, it's this clip.

581
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:07,230
You are wasting time, dude.

582
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:07,850
Come on.

583
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:21,902
Sam Harris is a supposed deep, dark web intellectual leftist, and he's doing an interview a few days ago and he goes, well, of course we censor conservatives and there's a conspiracy to do it.

584
00:39:22,096 --> 00:39:23,810
Trump is too dangerous.

585
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:26,594
Sam Harris is in charge of all media.

586
00:39:26,692 --> 00:39:28,910
Yeah, obviously, whatever.

587
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,446
I don't really care.

588
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:39,782
But one of the things that Sam Harris was talking about was that the corruption that you can find with Biden and Hunter biden, sure.

589
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:43,646
It doesn't come anywhere close to what Trump is involved in.

590
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:50,550
So these kinds of arguments about the corruption and the concerns about it are kind of weird and dumb.

591
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:55,850
Right? One of the things that he brings up is Trump University, and Alex is going to latch onto that.

592
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,114
Sure.

593
00:39:56,152 --> 00:39:58,300
But I want to clarify one thing really quick.

594
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:08,550
According to Alex's worldview, the crimes of the Biden's are much greater than Trump.

595
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,150
Yeah, of course.

596
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,990
But in the real world, well, not really so much.

597
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:22,830
So if Alex is comparing Trump's University, let's say, for instance, to the fake imaginary version of Biden, right? Then yes.

598
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,306
Trump University not that bad.

599
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:24,702
Sure.

600
00:40:24,776 --> 00:40:28,362
But if we're in the real world, trump looks pretty shitty he does.

601
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:31,894
And that's kind of the tension that's at play in this clip.

602
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:40,906
And that's even if you want to add in all of Biden's shitty, shady Delaware shit that he's been doing for the whole time, like, oh, credit card companies don't have to pay, blah, blah, blah.

603
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:41,710
That's corrupt.

604
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,318
I get it.

605
00:40:42,344 --> 00:40:45,474
But that still isn't I got nuclear secrets in my house.

606
00:40:45,572 --> 00:40:46,842
Yes, it's a little different.

607
00:40:46,916 --> 00:40:52,522
I'm not saying anything to let Biden off the hook for any corrupt dealings.

608
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,802
I'm just saying that he didn't kill kids in a basement.

609
00:40:54,826 --> 00:40:57,690
He didn't kill kids in a basement, which Alex is going to a legend.

610
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,602
And then Alex loses the thread and gets really defensive about how he didn't go to college.

611
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,394
That sounds about right.

612
00:41:02,432 --> 00:41:04,834
That's not an issue according to Sam Harris.

613
00:41:04,882 --> 00:41:12,680
No, he goes, Just look at nothing Biden can do, including dead bodies in a basement of children.

614
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:25,920
Wait, the basement is of children? I mean, compromised by foreign powers can compare to Trump University, which I think was a great deal.

615
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:33,914
Weekends with Trump and top experts and brainstorming and networking.

616
00:41:33,962 --> 00:41:50,690
I mean, I can tell you people ask, why did you go to college, you pathetic creature? Well, I mean, I got out of high school and I went and got a job selling memberships at a spa, at a gym.

617
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:56,390
And I was making $100,000 a year when I was 19.

618
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,970
What? I was driving a sports car.

619
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,074
I was in a nice two bedroom apartment.

620
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:03,050
I was having the time of my life.

621
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:10,790
$100,000.30 years ago was like a million dollars today.

622
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:21,234
I was 19 years old making 100 plus $1,000 a year working 4 hours a day because I became a salesman.

623
00:42:21,402 --> 00:42:27,002
And I sold a good product and I looked good and people bought the memberships, especially the women.

624
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:34,230
But the point is and a few times we're on a date, I love that salesman job.

625
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,426
The point is that I'm red, but I don't lie about it.

626
00:42:39,548 --> 00:42:44,420
What is happening? The point is that that was a real value.

627
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,650
That experience was real.

628
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:50,310
I should have paid to be a salesman at that hot club.

629
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,258
I mean, one of the hottest gyms in US of the time.

630
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:56,970
They said, hey, you want to be a salesman? I said, sure.

631
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,574
Boom.

632
00:42:57,622 --> 00:42:58,450
Salesman.

633
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,970
First weekend sold like ten memberships.

634
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,218
This is about Sam Harris.

635
00:43:02,254 --> 00:43:08,894
Remember they say I don't have a college degree because I'm a loser.

636
00:43:08,942 --> 00:43:12,466
No, I don't have a college degree because I went on the fast track to success.

637
00:43:12,528 --> 00:43:13,702
But that doesn't even matter.

638
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:15,480
That's not what I'm getting at here.

639
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:32,974
What are you getting at? All these educated idiots like Sam Harris that talk really slow and act real smug and sit there in their chair and say, yeah, the number one evil of Trump is his trump University is your problem.

640
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:36,660
That he's sitting in a chair talking about what is happening.

641
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:46,094
I think that it's fairly important to recognize that not everybody does need to go to college.

642
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:48,642
I think higher education is fantastic.

643
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:50,102
I'm a big proponent of it.

644
00:43:50,116 --> 00:43:53,642
But I don't think that people should be shamed for not going to college.

645
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:54,546
I didn't graduate.

646
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:57,842
Yeah, it's not the most important thing in the world.

647
00:43:58,036 --> 00:44:00,594
The people learning a trade is pretty fantastic.

648
00:44:00,702 --> 00:44:03,246
A lot of people find a great deal of happiness.

649
00:44:03,378 --> 00:44:04,610
You can learn whatever you want.

650
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,610
Just find some books.

651
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,894
Sure.

652
00:44:05,932 --> 00:44:06,640
Be great.

653
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:13,490
I just want to put that to the side just because I don't want to be like, shitting on Alex for not going to college or anything.

654
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,958
But he really is insecure about it.

655
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:17,740
Oh, yeah.

656
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:33,810
What's being expressed here is very much a feeling of why does everyone think he's so smart? Right? Maybe because he doesn't go into shit like his monkey pocket nonsense.

657
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:39,690
Before we go any further all right, let's start with the easy smart thing to do.

658
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,422
Don't defend Trump University.

659
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:42,778
It lost the lawsuit.

660
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:45,010
You don't even have to just say, oh, that sucks.

661
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,482
I have another smart thing he could do.

662
00:44:46,496 --> 00:44:50,000
What's that? Not talk constantly about visions from God.

663
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,226
I mean, honestly, that would bite into his bottom line.

664
00:44:53,408 --> 00:44:54,238
Not defending.

665
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,890
Trump University is free.

666
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,490
That's true.

667
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:09,022
There's no downside to not defending university, but there is a downside to defending Trump University, which is where you go on to this weird tangent about how you fuck good when you worked at a club.

668
00:45:09,106 --> 00:45:09,390
Right.

669
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,362
That's it.

670
00:45:10,556 --> 00:45:18,154
I also think that one of the things that maybe could use some examining on Alex's part is how he never stopped being a salesman.

671
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:27,066
Yeah, I don't think that's something he can really he is not a researcher or a journalist or anything like that.

672
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:28,462
He is still just a salesman.

673
00:45:28,486 --> 00:45:30,262
He's selling his dumb pills.

674
00:45:30,286 --> 00:45:32,002
He's selling his worldview.

675
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:36,654
More importantly, that's really his primary product.

676
00:45:36,812 --> 00:45:43,470
He sells you the worldview, you internalize that worldview, and it creates needs that he can fill for you.

677
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,106
Yeah, there is culture in there's.

678
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:55,554
Nothing that somebody would find unfamiliar if they just listened to the whole Rich Dad, Poor dad series and then watched Alex Jones sell set.

679
00:45:55,592 --> 00:45:59,614
And they'd be like, oh yeah, I guess you'd gone to Trump University.

680
00:45:59,782 --> 00:46:03,430
Actually, I think you don't get sales skills at Trump University.

681
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:04,438
You get sold.

682
00:46:04,534 --> 00:46:04,794
True.

683
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:05,686
You get conned.

684
00:46:05,758 --> 00:46:07,470
So Stelter got canceled.

685
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,190
But it wasn't he just got canceled.

686
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:15,390
Now let's spend some time on Brian Stelter.

687
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:18,838
Yeah, we can celebrate all day that he's been cancelled.

688
00:46:18,874 --> 00:46:19,858
He's a joke.

689
00:46:20,014 --> 00:46:23,574
But he had 1000 viewers for cable news.

690
00:46:23,612 --> 00:46:24,930
That's not even a pulse.

691
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,770
Okay? He was good because he was way to be black.

692
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,766
He was a laughingstock, he was a clown.

693
00:46:30,898 --> 00:46:31,666
Now a jester.

694
00:46:31,738 --> 00:46:38,670
He was an officious, self serving, arrogant booby.

695
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:43,858
He was the most schmug person you could imagine.

696
00:46:43,894 --> 00:46:47,130
That's the armor they wear, this fake pomposity.

697
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:51,454
And so now he's been canceled.

698
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:52,494
Canceled itself.

699
00:46:52,592 --> 00:47:01,146
CNN spent 400 and something million dollars on CNN Plus, and it failed in a month and a half or less than I was, like, 40 days.

700
00:47:01,268 --> 00:47:16,234
So there's a lot of theories about exactly why Stelter and Reliable Sources got canceled, and it's unclear what the precise reasons are, but I think everyone is pretty comfortable with the idea that it's part of the aftermath of the Warner Brothers Discovery merger that was finalized back in April.

701
00:47:16,282 --> 00:47:25,030
Yeah, there have been all sorts of cuts made throughout their properties, like HBO Max, and this is actually part of a larger story about big corporate media consolidation.

702
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:27,922
But Alex is completely missing the forest for the trees.

703
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:35,398
He hates Brian Stelter, and the story he wants to tell about this is that Stelter is a failure who got fired because nobody liked him and his show had no viewers.

704
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:40,230
That's a story that's emotionally satisfying for Alex, and it's what the listeners want to hear.

705
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,878
There's more to the story, though, but it doesn't matter because he's the tip of the spear.

706
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:47,278
He's the king of big tech and media watch doggery.

707
00:47:47,314 --> 00:47:49,186
And just missing this entirely.

708
00:47:49,258 --> 00:48:02,886
What a great time for somebody like Alex to really dig into what happens whenever media is monopolized and how the powers that be whenever they become a smaller group and a smaller number.

709
00:48:03,068 --> 00:48:05,730
All of them with control over the media.

710
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,482
Like a number of companies.

711
00:48:07,556 --> 00:48:09,450
Let's say smaller than ten.

712
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:15,174
And those companies have CEOs and they all meet in back rooms and they control the media.

713
00:48:15,272 --> 00:48:16,054
Literally.

714
00:48:16,222 --> 00:48:20,250
It would be a great time for somebody who is a conspiracy theorist to talk about that.

715
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:33,354
Well, I think you're sounding a little bit I'm just saying, I think that there is a wonderful opportunity for Alex here to rise above his enemies, as it were.

716
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,770
It would be a great idea.

717
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:41,382
And he could, instead of talking shit about Stelter, put that aside because everyone knows he already doesn't like him.

718
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:50,334
And all this, that'd be redundant for him just to do a little dance and instead be like, look, sure, we can all be happy about that, but there's a bigger picture here.

719
00:48:50,492 --> 00:48:57,010
And also, it's actually a bad sign Brian Stelter got his show axed.

720
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:03,102
It's a bad sign that HBO Max is streamlining and laying off all these people.

721
00:49:03,236 --> 00:49:07,246
It's part of a I know.

722
00:49:07,308 --> 00:49:08,940
Consolidation coming together.

723
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,314
The story plays, though.

724
00:49:11,352 --> 00:49:16,546
You know, that, like, I would die to defend your I don't agree with what you say, Mr.

725
00:49:16,608 --> 00:49:21,470
Stelter, but I would die for your right to not be owned by one conglomerate.

726
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:29,198
I demand that this man, my mortal enemy, be freed from his prison of corporate lockstep.

727
00:49:29,294 --> 00:49:31,550
That's there that message plays.

728
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,894
Everybody loves that shit.

729
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:34,886
And it would be an impressive thing for Alex.

730
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:35,450
Totally.

731
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,442
It would be amazing.

732
00:49:36,576 --> 00:49:38,086
And Dee just doesn't have it.

733
00:49:38,148 --> 00:49:38,966
Doesn't have the guts.

734
00:49:39,038 --> 00:49:39,706
No.

735
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:40,306
Mr.

736
00:49:40,368 --> 00:49:42,278
Stelter, tear down that roll.

737
00:49:42,374 --> 00:49:42,886
Yes.

738
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:43,920
Come on.

739
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,922
The spirit got in me while you were fixing going to china, man.

740
00:49:48,996 --> 00:49:50,230
You got to do it.

741
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,870
So Alex plays some clips here.

742
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,614
Here's an old clip of Stelter that Brian Alex we're doing this is your life.

743
00:49:59,772 --> 00:50:00,334
Not really.

744
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:04,250
I was just think there's a few that are like these are great clips of Stelter.

745
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:05,074
So here's one.

746
00:50:05,112 --> 00:50:12,430
Okay? Okay, so let's play the late, great founder of the Weather Channel, a meteorologist schooling Brian Stelter years ago.

747
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:13,186
Here it is.

748
00:50:13,308 --> 00:50:14,726
First, let me bring in John Coleman.

749
00:50:14,738 --> 00:50:16,150
He's in San Diego this morning.

750
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,580
Thank you for being here.

751
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,454
Nice to be on CNN.

752
00:50:19,502 --> 00:50:20,870
Hello to all your viewers.

753
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:23,162
I resent you calling me a denier.

754
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,978
That is a word meant to put me down.

755
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:30,034
I'm a skeptic about climate change and I want to make it darn clear mr.

756
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:31,382
Kenny is not a scientist.

757
00:50:31,466 --> 00:50:32,014
I am.

758
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,126
He's the CEO of the Weather Channel.

759
00:50:34,188 --> 00:50:37,646
Now I was the founder of the Weather Channel, not the co founder.

760
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:40,174
And I'm glad you did because I am addicted to the Weather Channel.

761
00:50:40,212 --> 00:50:41,210
I lost a lot of cable.

762
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:42,518
Now hold on just a minute.

763
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:43,486
I'm not done.

764
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:51,530
And CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus.

765
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,750
Well, there is no consensus in science.

766
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,178
Science isn't a vote.

767
00:50:55,334 --> 00:50:56,990
Science is about facts.

768
00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:02,470
And if you get down to the hard, cold facts, there's no question about it.

769
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,594
Climate change is not happening.

770
00:51:04,752 --> 00:51:09,598
There is no significant man made global warming now.

771
00:51:09,744 --> 00:51:13,558
There hasn't been any in the past and there's no reason to expect any in the future.

772
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,302
There's a whole lot of baloney.

773
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:22,294
And yes, it has become a big political point of the Democratic party and part of their platform.

774
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:25,190
And I regret it's become political instead of scientific.

775
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,754
But the science is on my side.

776
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:39,650
I don't think we're going to come to conclusion about the topic right here what I do want to use because you wouldn't allow it to happen on CNN, but I'm happy when I got on the air and got transferred to your viewers.

777
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:40,680
Hello, everybody.

778
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,382
So the sea levels haven't risen half inch in 100 years.

779
00:51:49,456 --> 00:51:58,142
So doesn't that clip actually kind of refute a lot of Alex's points about mainstream media? No, they never put voices that dissent with them on the air.

780
00:51:58,216 --> 00:51:59,474
Dan right.

781
00:51:59,572 --> 00:52:03,110
I mean, it's actually one of the worst clips Alex could have chosen to play.

782
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,490
I know it's fun to hear someone be rude to spell.

783
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:05,810
Sure.

784
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:17,630
No, I guess that appeals to Alex in some way, but it's actually so counter to the perception of media that is essential to sell infowars as the alternative to it.

785
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,706
I mean, he's literally saying, thank you for letting me get my message across on the mainstream media.

786
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:22,994
Right.

787
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:27,174
And Stelter is being polite to this guy who's being incredibly polite.

788
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:27,866
Yeah.

789
00:52:28,048 --> 00:52:36,146
Can you imagine the reverse? Like Stelter coming on Alex's show and being addict to him and Alex being polite? It doesn't happen.

790
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:37,334
No, I can't imagine that.

791
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:37,646
Right.

792
00:52:37,708 --> 00:52:39,690
No, alex would need to be more famous.

793
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:44,906
Alex would offer nothing but a hostile platform to somebody who disagrees with him.

794
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:55,578
And the media, for better or for worse, often does have a deferential platform for dissenting voices.

795
00:52:55,734 --> 00:53:03,890
Maybe not as vigorous debate as Alex would like, which is I mean, it translates to people screaming at each other and saying disgusting shit, sure.

796
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,254
Calling each other pedophiles and what have you.

797
00:53:06,352 --> 00:53:07,814
That's a good TV day.

798
00:53:07,912 --> 00:53:14,442
But, yeah, I would have maybe told them, choose a different clip.

799
00:53:14,586 --> 00:53:16,026
I think this hurts your argument.

800
00:53:16,098 --> 00:53:18,880
Yeah, I mean, it doesn't help Stelter either.

801
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:25,790
I think that's a fairly good clip to play for everybody to look at the media and just go like, we're not doing a good job.

802
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,466
Whatever it is that is, that's not good.

803
00:53:28,528 --> 00:53:30,820
Well, I mean, there are certainly questions.

804
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:39,102
Did you have any reason to suspect this is how Coleman was going to act? That's on you.

805
00:53:39,176 --> 00:53:43,174
Maybe you could have prepared to field him being a dick.

806
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:43,954
Mute.

807
00:53:44,122 --> 00:53:45,500
You got a mute button.

808
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:55,138
Anyway, Alex, instead of really celebrating Stelter, he decides he's just going to play some old clips.

809
00:53:55,234 --> 00:54:02,602
He's reminiscing about his enemy, kind of, but also reminiscing about how much he yelled at Stelter.

810
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:05,146
He's kind of navel gazing reminiscing.

811
00:54:05,218 --> 00:54:05,922
Sure.

812
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:07,162
It's Brian Stelter.

813
00:54:07,186 --> 00:54:07,686
There it is.

814
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:08,960
Oh, my God.

815
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:11,742
That is a horror movie cover.

816
00:54:11,876 --> 00:54:14,314
Seriously, he is scarier looking than at the clown.

817
00:54:14,362 --> 00:54:21,282
I mean, would you let your children anywhere near that psychopath? That is a psychopath right there.

818
00:54:21,476 --> 00:54:22,842
I mean, look at him.

819
00:54:22,916 --> 00:54:27,586
God, it cries out, danger.

820
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:28,186
Danger.

821
00:54:28,258 --> 00:54:28,726
Alert.

822
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:29,206
Alert.

823
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:30,874
I am a scumbag.

824
00:54:30,982 --> 00:54:31,954
I am filth.

825
00:54:32,002 --> 00:54:33,270
I am your enemy.

826
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:40,518
I would literally not be able to finish my dinner if somebody walked over and talked to me that looked like these two guys.

827
00:54:40,604 --> 00:54:51,586
And I'm sorry, they're not just lying anti American scumbags that want to run us all on the ground, okay? That's what it's about.

828
00:54:51,648 --> 00:54:53,650
It's the spirit of evil.

829
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:56,580
Good point.

830
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:02,290
I've tried to do joke photos like this to look disingenuous and I can make any face I want to.

831
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,300
I can't pull it off because the eyes, she's gone.

832
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,594
Oh, my gosh.

833
00:55:12,702 --> 00:55:14,990
Oh, hell on Earth.

834
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:17,210
He wants to run your life.

835
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:26,450
He wants to control every aspect of your life because he knows he is a cowardly, degenerate sack of anti human trash.

836
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:34,106
I pledge before my heavenly father that's right, I will resist them every way I can.

837
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:39,302
These people are the literal demon spawn of the pit of hell.

838
00:55:39,376 --> 00:55:39,986
Look at him.

839
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:43,274
And you know what? He is better than you if you keep letting him run your life.

840
00:55:43,372 --> 00:55:46,674
He runs your kids, he runs the schools, he runs the banks.

841
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:54,230
This guy, this spirit, this smiling leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is.

842
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,070
He is your enemy, period.

843
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,738
So fun.

844
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:01,494
I like the music in the background.

845
00:56:01,542 --> 00:56:02,450
Yeah, that is fun.

846
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:09,650
This is one of Alex's old rants about Stelter that he just had to replay, probably because he can't be bothered to put any energy into the show today.

847
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,206
I was going to say he knows what people want.

848
00:56:12,328 --> 00:56:23,982
Thankfully, there are these old clips of him putting a little gusto into his Stelter hate, but this actually is a curious clip to play on the day after Stelter's show has been canceled and he's out at CNN.

849
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:30,042
That's because if anything Alex was saying meant anything, then it shouldn't have been so simple to remove him from his perch.

850
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:45,606
How important is Stelter to the globalist plots if he can just be fired? Honestly, knowing that Stelter was just axed over business considerations and it didn't cause widespread chaos among the globalists kind of makes this entire presentation that Alex is putting on seem pretty stupid.

851
00:56:45,738 --> 00:56:50,834
It seems so weird to hear how worked up Alex was about Stelter in these clips now that we're on the other side.

852
00:56:50,872 --> 00:57:01,662
Because now that Stelter is out, alex just seems like a worked up baby who is so mad that someone was criticizing him that he decided to make up a bunch of stuff about them being central to the globalist plans.

853
00:57:01,806 --> 00:57:03,414
And this isn't even the full rant.

854
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:04,562
It goes on.

855
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:14,630
Disingenuous, fake, false, broke, back twisting, a defiler, a betrayer, a back stabber, a devil.

856
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:18,930
You will pay.

857
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,898
Yeah, you think I don't see your face? Come.

858
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:25,354
Is he still praying? Did he end the prayer? You understand I forgot.

859
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:27,440
I know what you think of me and my family.

860
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:47,040
God is going to destroy you.

861
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,930
Get them offscreen.

862
00:57:58,810 --> 00:57:59,426
Come on.

863
00:57:59,488 --> 00:58:01,014
We're drunk on our children's blood.

864
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:01,854
For God's sake.

865
00:58:01,902 --> 00:58:03,460
Get your shit together, guy.

866
00:58:04,450 --> 00:58:08,334
So this is an illustrative moment when Alex is saying all this shit about Stelter.

867
00:58:08,382 --> 00:58:10,386
None of it has any connection to reality.

868
00:58:10,518 --> 00:58:15,222
It's just Alex trying to put some kind of an elevated appearance onto his petulant anger.

869
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:24,926
He knows well enough that if he got on his show and started yelling and lashing out about how he doesn't like people being critical of him, his audience would rightly see him as the weak child he is inside.

870
00:58:25,108 --> 00:58:38,694
By masking that immature insecurity with over the top pronouncements about Stelter probably being a pedophile and how he's a betrayer, whatever that means, alex is able to protect himself from being seen for what he is, which is a hypersensitive loser.

871
00:58:38,802 --> 00:58:49,878
Now the issue is that the audience doesn't really realize that they're just watching Alex play out a psycho drama on air and may think that he's actually saying something about Stelter as opposed to just yelling about his own hurt feelings.

872
00:58:50,034 --> 00:58:59,598
They form opinions, post things on social media, and even harass stealther over things that Alex says, as if there was anything behind it other than Alex being a baby with a boo boo.

873
00:58:59,754 --> 00:59:03,458
Anyway, I probably would have played a different clip on this episode if I were him.

874
00:59:03,544 --> 00:59:10,698
It seems dumb to portray Stelter as some kind of a big high level big bad guy the day after his show ended with no real pushback or fanfare.

875
00:59:10,854 --> 00:59:15,206
Seems like that should have been a much harder fought victory if anything Alex was saying meant anything.

876
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:21,786
And this is kind of a grandiose thing because he got fired.

877
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:23,118
Yeah, no got canceled.

878
00:59:23,154 --> 00:59:24,278
I mean here's the problem.

879
00:59:24,364 --> 00:59:24,914
Here's the problem.

880
00:59:24,952 --> 00:59:25,670
It's just a show.

881
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:37,938
When you choose your enemies to be of the demonic realm, you think TV is a great choice because it's so big and it's like, oh, it's TV.

882
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:39,746
But it's really not that big.

883
00:59:39,928 --> 00:59:42,270
It's not as big as you might think because you can just get fired.

884
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:53,358
Like you can't claim that if you didn't get the job at a Denny's, you can't claim that the manager is the antichrist because eventually he's just not going to be the manager anymore.

885
00:59:53,454 --> 00:59:57,890
The manager can't be the shift supervisor.

886
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:00,282
He's a fry cook.

887
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:02,270
He's not the antichrist.

888
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:11,214
I used to work at a dairy Queen when I was like 15 and the guy who was the burger guy, he was a satanist.

889
01:00:11,382 --> 01:00:15,170
Well, yeah, that's great counterpoint.

890
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:20,174
Now you've brought that piece of information to light.

891
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:22,840
I do retract take that.

892
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:28,660
So Alex just played that old stelter rant and he's feeling good about it.

893
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:30,818
You got to bask in your work.

894
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:37,420
No, it reminded me of that time that you remember Hannibal's bit where he played his own joke and just vibed with it.

895
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,210
Reminded me of that quite a bit.

896
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,934
So here Alex lets us in on a little media secret.

897
01:00:45,102 --> 01:01:04,120
And I can tell you that little ranch is not my best brown silver rant, but I'm told that that is shown in the newsrooms for years every week as the resistance back to little Tucker Carlson inside dope that is required viewing at least once a week.

898
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:10,654
So that's a little gift to old Tucky.

899
01:01:10,762 --> 01:01:12,450
Even that's brainwashing.

900
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,550
Honestly, I don't believe it's true.

901
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:30,750
But if it is true, that's brainwashing that they're doing a Tucker show or they're laughing at him yeah, I feel like as far as ways to end your 05:00 on a Friday, instead of doing the whistle, you just start playing that clip and you're going to leave with a bit of a smile.

902
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:36,334
All right, I think I can go get drinks now.

903
01:01:36,372 --> 01:01:36,958
That's happy.

904
01:01:37,044 --> 01:01:40,954
But that's only like really funny to you because you haven't heard that in a long time.

905
01:01:40,992 --> 01:01:41,638
It has been a while.

906
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,450
If you watch that every week it would get really annoying.

907
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:47,914
I don't think you watch it every week but you play it over the PA.

908
01:01:48,012 --> 01:01:48,970
I love this though.

909
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:53,890
Like all of Tucker's employees have to watch this once a week so they can keep their head in the game.

910
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,438
They can understand what it's like to resist.

911
01:01:56,594 --> 01:02:00,446
They can watch me fake being nauseous, looking at stelter.

912
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:01,966
Okay, I understand.

913
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:03,290
Yell about demons.

914
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:04,610
I'm the key grip.

915
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:06,226
Do I really need to work? Yes.

916
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,474
No, But I mean all it's in your contract.

917
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:10,618
God damn it, I hate this show.

918
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:13,870
Yes, Hannity's, people have to watch it once a month.

919
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,610
That's why they're not so hardcore.

920
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:24,940
So a caller calls in and he wants to know how Alex finds the time to read so much.

921
01:02:25,630 --> 01:02:26,934
This is a bummer.

922
01:02:27,102 --> 01:02:30,530
I want to say I'm very excited when your new book comes out at the end of the month.

923
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:42,578
Now, I admit that I normally read Kindle books and am highly addicted to the Internet, and my cell phone is always amazing, like so many of us are, by ordering your hard book.

924
01:02:42,604 --> 01:02:44,138
And I can't wait to read the physical book.

925
01:02:44,164 --> 01:02:48,278
It made me have an epiphany that I'm so bombarded with information.

926
01:02:48,364 --> 01:02:51,546
I'll admit I'm in a trance of a low attention span.

927
01:02:51,618 --> 01:02:55,490
Now, you read so much, sir, you digest so much information.

928
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:00,878
I would love if you could share with me and the audience how you find so much time to read.

929
01:03:01,024 --> 01:03:10,338
Suggestions on how we can use the Internet, use our cell phones in a way that promotes enlightenment, but also a way that promotes a long term attention span.

930
01:03:10,494 --> 01:03:21,570
Do you speed read or what would you recommend to focus our attention span so we can take the time to read entire books? Do we have a cyber free Sunday? Get away from the Internet.

931
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:29,138
How do you recommend because it's a strong part of the information war to manage information, sir? Well, when you study the global it's a really good question.

932
01:03:29,164 --> 01:03:30,782
We talk for days about it.

933
01:03:30,976 --> 01:03:33,700
A whole college course on it or a whole degree in it.

934
01:03:34,690 --> 01:03:41,630
They have the same programs over and over again, so once you know their operations, you just see the same permutation of it over and over again.

935
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:42,494
That's not hard.

936
01:03:42,592 --> 01:03:44,114
Like, oh, I've seen this press release before.

937
01:03:44,152 --> 01:03:45,182
I've seen that before.

938
01:03:45,316 --> 01:03:47,114
There's only a few dozen things they do.

939
01:03:47,152 --> 01:03:48,750
There's only a few dozen plays.

940
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:57,654
So they have so this reminds me of a conversation I had with a comic years ago who was really proud of their ability to do crowd work and respond to hecklers.

941
01:03:57,702 --> 01:04:00,846
Sure, in reality, they weren't that good, but they were very confident.

942
01:04:00,918 --> 01:04:05,798
And they explained to me that there are only a few possible types of responses you need to be ready to have.

943
01:04:05,944 --> 01:04:12,042
You can respond to something with an angry, mean retort, a nice retort, or a confused retort.

944
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:18,278
As long as you had one of each of these in your pocket, ready to go, you could respond to just about anything an audience can throw at you.

945
01:04:18,304 --> 01:04:20,850
The rock paper, scissors theory of stand up comedy.

946
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:28,890
Yeah, that's all good and well, but what it's actually doing is taking the act of responding in the moment on stage and reducing it to a parlor trick.

947
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,418
You're creating the illusion of being in the moment and fast on your feet.

948
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:43,022
You're faking being clever because you know that you aren't clever enough to be it for real, and you're terrified of being seen as not clever and getting caught in the moment of being like, oh, I don't know what to say.

949
01:04:43,216 --> 01:04:46,478
This is kind of what Alex is doing with this globalist playbook idea.

950
01:04:46,624 --> 01:04:57,194
He's constructed a couple of stock responses to world events that he's decided to call the globalist playbook, and it's basically just his crutch, so he never has to appear like he doesn't know what's going on.

951
01:04:57,352 --> 01:05:00,450
Think of a tragic event as the equivalent of someone heckling.

952
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:09,402
In terms of how to interpret Alex's show and the narrative, he needs to be able to respond to it quickly or else he'll risk showing weakness to the audience.

953
01:05:09,546 --> 01:05:13,346
So just like that comic I knew, alex has preloaded responses to stuff.

954
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:22,158
Instead of angry, nice, or confused retorts, alex has things like false flag it was secretly antifa, or elaborate deep state plotting.

955
01:05:22,314 --> 01:05:32,980
These are go to responses he can whip out to apply to any situation, and he can then rationalize based on some detail and be like, oh, this is part of that globalist play means nothing.

956
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:36,338
Alex has nothing to say and he hasn't read anything.

957
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:44,550
It's pretty telling that this guy asks this question and Alex's first response isn't that he reads all day, every day, because I think even he would know that that's silly.

958
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:50,798
His response is just that he knows everything already, so he can see things happening in the world and then make stories up about them.

959
01:05:50,944 --> 01:05:59,550
Considering Alex's track record of being super wrong about almost everything he's ever called to play from the globalist playbook, this should really worry the caller and the audience.

960
01:05:59,670 --> 01:06:01,530
But they're not paying attention.

961
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:13,050
Alex satisfies their emotional needs with rants like the one about Stelter and their need to feel like a part of something important with the nonsense about fighting Klaus Schwab's digital army by posting infowars links.

962
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:20,918
As long as those needs are met, and as long as that's the case, the reality that he's just making shit up all the time, it doesn't really matter at all.

963
01:06:21,004 --> 01:06:23,382
The audience will never care or notice.

964
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:36,302
Yeah, that caller scares me a lot because he sounded so rational and so sane and had a clear thought process.

965
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:40,754
But if you listen to that, that's the most insane thing anybody has ever said.

966
01:06:40,912 --> 01:06:42,350
That's the most insane.

967
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:48,094
How do you do it? That's an insane thing to say to Alex Jones.

968
01:06:48,202 --> 01:06:57,202
That's more insane than I swear to you, I believe more that Raptors would eat chocolate than I do that Alex reads.

969
01:06:57,226 --> 01:07:04,858
Well, what do you believe more Alex reads a lot, or Alex had a vision from God over chicken fried steak? I believe the second one more than Alex reads.

970
01:07:04,894 --> 01:07:06,642
At least the second one is possible.

971
01:07:06,776 --> 01:07:09,210
Yeah, because Alex is a passive participant.

972
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:10,338
Exactly.

973
01:07:10,424 --> 01:07:12,210
It requires no effort on his part.

974
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,050
Yeah, fair enough.

975
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,222
I can't prove that God doesn't speak through chicken fried steak.

976
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:19,350
I can't prove he doesn't have been great.

977
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:25,422
Alex should work out a deal with that company for advertising because this is making a steak and ice cream.

978
01:07:25,616 --> 01:07:27,798
It'll give you a message from God.

979
01:07:27,884 --> 01:07:28,278
Yeah.

980
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:31,410
So Alex goes on to explain his work process to this call.

981
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,070
Oh, my God.

982
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:38,506
No, but really, what I do is I scan him for I scan a bunch of mainline sites.

983
01:07:38,518 --> 01:07:39,646
I scan legislation.

984
01:07:39,778 --> 01:07:41,658
I go and look at what Jacksolvic is saying.

985
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:51,858
I look at what Mike Sternvich is saying, I look at Ron Paul saying what Senator Paul is saying, I look at what the Santa's saying, and I just quickly scan through all of that.

986
01:07:51,884 --> 01:07:57,680
But I already know the globalist agenda from reading their books, reading clock swap statements and knowing what they're doing.

987
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:11,060
And I really go back to the key books written by the population controllers and the statements put out by Brzinsky and the books written by Brzinsky and Henry Kissinger and the program.

988
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:16,460
And so once you know that, it's pretty much reading the same thing over and over again.

989
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,342
And so that's where we are.

990
01:08:18,416 --> 01:08:20,910
Lawlessness collapse of society.

991
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:24,486
This should be a huge red flag to anybody who's listening to Alex's show.

992
01:08:24,608 --> 01:08:36,330
I mean, he has basically these old texts that I don't know if he's even read or not or if he's just taking them in by way of John Birch society literature that demonize those.

993
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:36,846
Right.

994
01:08:36,968 --> 01:08:40,962
I think that's more likely they're more part of the lore than they are actually read.

995
01:08:41,036 --> 01:08:41,670
Yes.

996
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,922
And he talks about like Ecoscience by John B.

997
01:08:44,936 --> 01:08:47,274
Holder, and you haven't read that? Fucking get the folk out of here.

998
01:08:47,312 --> 01:08:47,670
Get out.

999
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:52,218
Yeah, and then his workflow is just like, I skim my own website.

1000
01:08:52,304 --> 01:08:59,362
Isn't that what he's saying? I skim some other websites, and then I go check the Twitter accounts of shitheads like Pobik and Cernovich.

1001
01:08:59,446 --> 01:09:09,282
I mean, that's not great in the context of the rationality of the question that he's responding to, of which I do that idea.

1002
01:09:09,356 --> 01:09:15,102
Like, oh, should we have a Cyber Sunday where we get rid of all of our things and actually just fucking read books? Hey, that's not a terrible idea.

1003
01:09:15,176 --> 01:09:15,594
Not really.

1004
01:09:15,632 --> 01:09:16,662
I'm fine with that.

1005
01:09:16,796 --> 01:09:19,218
To respond to that with, here's what I do.

1006
01:09:19,304 --> 01:09:20,554
I skim shit.

1007
01:09:20,662 --> 01:09:24,620
And then I just kind of get the vibe of how people are talking about it.

1008
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:28,758
Kramovich and Ron Paul and DeSantis are putting out talking points.

1009
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:29,346
Yeah.

1010
01:09:29,468 --> 01:09:33,558
And then I just double down on the thing that those extremist shit heads are doing.

1011
01:09:33,644 --> 01:09:36,594
I grab what they say, and then I go plus one on the crazy.

1012
01:09:36,692 --> 01:09:37,746
And that's my job.

1013
01:09:37,868 --> 01:09:45,066
And I start the day by looking at my own website that I pay people to write headlines for sure.

1014
01:09:45,128 --> 01:09:51,150
So I'm responding to people who are paid to write things that will tickle me, I guess.

1015
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,002
Yeah.

1016
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:54,510
That's a bizarre circle.

1017
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,590
That's an oraboros of bullshit.

1018
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:59,442
Right? So what I did is I created okay.

1019
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:03,990
Do you remember Elvis group of yes men that always said yes around Elvis? Yes.

1020
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,058
Yeah, exactly.

1021
01:10:05,204 --> 01:10:07,100
So I turned that into a job.

1022
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:11,420
Now it's their job to say yes to everything I have to say.

1023
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:18,366
So Alex gets to thinking about what he needs to do, and there's one thing that he needs to do.

1024
01:10:18,428 --> 01:10:19,446
Read? No.

1025
01:10:19,568 --> 01:10:20,790
Pray with his dad.

1026
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:29,682
Again, I appreciate what you do, and I know that you speak about Jesus, and I just want to remind people to not give up hope that there really is an answer out there.

1027
01:10:29,696 --> 01:10:30,838
But we have to keep fighting.

1028
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:32,986
We must operate in determine.

1029
01:10:32,998 --> 01:10:35,418
I believe in these days, we must prepare our house.

1030
01:10:35,444 --> 01:10:36,498
That's what I'm telling my friends.

1031
01:10:36,584 --> 01:10:41,706
You got to do what you can, naturally, to prepare your house, but also spiritually, you've got to prepare your house.

1032
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:42,738
No, I totally agree.

1033
01:10:42,764 --> 01:10:47,034
And I'm going to tell a personal story right now I never told because the Holy Spirit wants me to.

1034
01:10:47,192 --> 01:10:56,634
There's been three times in my life where I was under incredible attack and I went to see my dad and where we prayed, and literally within hours, I wrote you a check.

1035
01:10:56,672 --> 01:11:03,140
And there's something really special about believers coming together, but also men and women coming together and family members.

1036
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:09,902
I'm going to pray with my father this weekend for awakening and victory.

1037
01:11:10,046 --> 01:11:19,622
And I don't know all the ways of God, but it's just powerful because our ancestors did so much before us.

1038
01:11:19,756 --> 01:11:24,640
And by praying with your father or your mother, it connects to the people before you.

1039
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:26,550
And it's incredible.

1040
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:30,114
In fact, I'm going to pray with my father and my mother this weekend.

1041
01:11:30,222 --> 01:11:32,798
Let's all confirm we have fathers and mothers left with us.

1042
01:11:32,824 --> 01:11:37,362
What are our family members? There's something particularly electromagnetic.

1043
01:11:37,386 --> 01:11:38,942
Let's all confirm that.

1044
01:11:39,016 --> 01:11:41,642
Just spiritual about that.

1045
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:47,480
Do you hear what I'm saying? He's gone.

1046
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:53,660
Must have been a spirit taking back to that place.

1047
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:56,910
I was really under attack.

1048
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,074
Like, eight years ago.

1049
01:11:58,232 --> 01:12:00,754
I was out with my dad's backyard by his pool.

1050
01:12:00,922 --> 01:12:03,066
I said, dad, I want you to pray with me.

1051
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:25,062
put his hands in mind, and we made the circuit of the past, present and the future.

1052
01:12:25,196 --> 01:12:29,300
And that's why these Satanists hate us, because we have that power, and we're not using that power.

1053
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:30,980
Oh, man.

1054
01:12:32,990 --> 01:12:34,438
Howie in New Jersey.

1055
01:12:34,474 --> 01:12:35,086
Howie.

1056
01:12:35,218 --> 01:12:35,900
Wow.

1057
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:37,534
What a ride.

1058
01:12:37,702 --> 01:12:39,070
What a fucking ride.

1059
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:45,750
Also, if it's the past, present and future, shouldn't, like your son have also been involved in the prayer? No, he doesn't give a shit about it.

1060
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:47,598
I think it's the present and the future.

1061
01:12:47,684 --> 01:12:48,680
Oh, my God.

1062
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:50,634
This is okay.

1063
01:12:50,732 --> 01:12:59,802
I like to though the idea that eventually I don't wish this upon him or anything, but eventually Alex's dad is going to pass away.

1064
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:00,702
Yeah, that's how it works.

1065
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:05,758
And then Alex will put out a Luther Van draws style pray with my father.

1066
01:13:05,854 --> 01:13:07,606
I think that dance with my father.

1067
01:13:07,678 --> 01:13:09,138
Yeah, I can see that.

1068
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:10,218
I can see that.

1069
01:13:10,364 --> 01:13:12,094
Put some prayers on an album.

1070
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:15,534
If I could pray with my father one more time oh, man, that's what you do.

1071
01:13:15,572 --> 01:13:16,470
That's what Alex does.

1072
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,650
Deathbed prayers.

1073
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:19,150
Records them with his dad.

1074
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:22,174
That'll give everybody the magical energy of a father.

1075
01:13:22,222 --> 01:13:23,590
Insured the closed circuit.

1076
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:24,260
Absolutely.

1077
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:28,758
With that closed circuit energy, you got some money to be made, my friend.

1078
01:13:28,844 --> 01:13:31,234
Alex's son is like, dad, let me hold your hand and pray.

1079
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:36,886
No, I will not be the past with this closed circuit.

1080
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:39,320
I am the present and the future.

1081
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:41,286
I will eat your soul, son.

1082
01:13:41,348 --> 01:13:44,190
You will not steal my vitality and youth.

1083
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:48,186
Yeah, so Alex gets another call.

1084
01:13:48,368 --> 01:13:49,018
Hey, Alex.

1085
01:13:49,054 --> 01:13:55,126
I just wanted to say, like, the Saxco burga family that you talk about, they are an RH negative bloodline.

1086
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:56,590
They're actually from Ukraine.

1087
01:13:56,650 --> 01:14:01,486
They're sorry, what people call fallen angels, or, like you say, fallen.

1088
01:14:01,558 --> 01:14:07,578
Sure, and that's what I say, that they believe they're their own species, right? Yeah.

1089
01:14:07,604 --> 01:14:10,234
I mean, they took over the stacksons of Germany.

1090
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:11,358
The direction is right.

1091
01:14:11,384 --> 01:14:16,702
I think they went from Ukraine to Germany, took over the Saxons and the Anglos, or the angels, fallen angels.

1092
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:24,918
The demons that have merged into the actual, the true humans or the true humanity, they've grafted themselves into it.

1093
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:26,958
And they took over the Netherlands, too.

1094
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:34,702
And that's where the West India Company is pretty much the basis for the evil side of the American colonization.

1095
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:41,970
Really? Like you said, Anderson Cooper is the extension of the Vanderbilts, and the Vanderbilts are just an extension of the West India Company.

1096
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,558
And I know parasites just live in colonies, even in your body.

1097
01:14:45,584 --> 01:14:53,094
That's why they need to get your products, get your parasite cleanse and everything like that smooth into a plug right there.

1098
01:14:53,132 --> 01:14:54,198
That is pretty good.

1099
01:14:54,284 --> 01:14:56,838
I mean, here's my take on this.

1100
01:14:56,984 --> 01:14:59,118
Sir, that's too much.

1101
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:00,438
That's too much.

1102
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:05,370
You know what? Normally, I'm cool with conspiracy people, I'm Alex Jones, but that's too much.

1103
01:15:05,420 --> 01:15:07,218
You got to go talk to somebody about that.

1104
01:15:07,304 --> 01:15:08,250
That's too much.

1105
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:11,878
Yeah, the saxcobar got fallen.

1106
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:12,594
Too much.

1107
01:15:12,692 --> 01:15:13,482
Too much already.

1108
01:15:13,556 --> 01:15:16,810
Who took over the Anglos.

1109
01:15:16,930 --> 01:15:17,938
Sarah? Angels.

1110
01:15:17,974 --> 01:15:19,506
See, that's already another too much.

1111
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:21,510
Mixing with the real human.

1112
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,910
Why did they do that? Giants.

1113
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:31,470
And they had to go to the Netherlands, right? And then maybe the West Indy.

1114
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:34,100
That's the one that you don't know about.

1115
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,902
That's the one that's underground.

1116
01:15:35,986 --> 01:15:43,950
The Dutch East India Company, I guess, is related to the Vanderbilts because they're both of Dutch descent.

1117
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:47,514
Okay, yeah, see, I think we nailed it.

1118
01:15:47,552 --> 01:15:49,254
No, actually, sir, that's too much.

1119
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:50,118
Go talk to somebody.

1120
01:15:50,204 --> 01:16:06,654
Well, the Dutch East India Company dissolved around the time that Cornelius Vanderbilt, the sort of the founder of that family's great fortune, was a child in the US.

1121
01:16:06,752 --> 01:16:20,458
Right, but didn't they defeat the Anglosaxons and then absorb them into their powers, thus gaining angel and Saxophowers? I'm afraid you are much mistaken.

1122
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:22,258
Have I mistaken? That was the wombat.

1123
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:23,722
Alien oh, God damn.

1124
01:16:23,746 --> 01:16:24,286
Wombat.

1125
01:16:24,358 --> 01:16:25,726
Yeah, the Wombat alien.

1126
01:16:25,858 --> 01:16:28,378
How about the Mighty Ducks? Are they still doing okay? The Mighty Duck.

1127
01:16:28,414 --> 01:16:29,430
Aliens are okay.

1128
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:29,766
Good.

1129
01:16:29,828 --> 01:16:30,486
Yeah.

1130
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:34,138
So Alex gets another call who's a little spiritual.

1131
01:16:34,294 --> 01:16:38,170
I enjoy your products and I look forward to receiving your product, Alex.

1132
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:40,858
This is a message for all the infiltrators.

1133
01:16:40,894 --> 01:16:46,818
The FBI, the CIA, the New World Order, carlos and his economics, who are listening right now.

1134
01:16:46,904 --> 01:16:47,478
I love you.

1135
01:16:47,504 --> 01:16:52,018
First of all, Alex, first of all, we are decentralizing the Infowars.

1136
01:16:52,054 --> 01:16:54,918
It's decentralizing their power, your power and control.

1137
01:16:55,064 --> 01:16:58,962
Alex Jones, you have been chosen by our Lord to be the leader in the front.

1138
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:01,026
You are the member of the body.

1139
01:17:01,148 --> 01:17:10,878
You represent body of the left and the right wing who are taking us or manipulating us in the direction that they have been using to maintain control.

1140
01:17:11,024 --> 01:17:17,550
George Washington warned us against the power of political parties and replacing our nationality.

1141
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,710
You are standing up against what we have been chosen.

1142
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,970
The majority of the masses support Infowars.

1143
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:35,826
Obviously, they are those who are against you, but they cannot stand against the masses of us because we are using the power of our lawyer, which is through quantum communication you talked about.

1144
01:17:35,948 --> 01:17:36,406
Totally.

1145
01:17:36,478 --> 01:17:45,990
I want you to continue, but what do you make of cloud schwab declaring information warfare against us and saying he's going to launch info warriors? I mean, they are scared.

1146
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:47,406
Yeah, they are.

1147
01:17:47,468 --> 01:17:48,450
Yeah, totally.

1148
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,920
I guess this guy doesn't know that it's two years old too.

1149
01:17:53,390 --> 01:18:01,030
Did you ever notice how the Lord is exactly as dumb as the person talking about him? Yeah, the deity has the information that the individual so weird.

1150
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:04,066
You think they would have more on accounting.

1151
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:07,602
Well, but Alex only knows what the Lord wants him to know.

1152
01:18:07,676 --> 01:18:09,270
Sure, that's data download.

1153
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:12,034
Yeah.

1154
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:13,058
Good call, Lord.

1155
01:18:13,094 --> 01:18:14,146
You got me on this one.

1156
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:21,746
So apparently Alex is chosen as a leader by God, and the majority of the United States supports Infowars, the masses.

1157
01:18:21,878 --> 01:18:23,794
That's absolutely not true.

1158
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:29,530
Yeah, that seems like a lot for the masses to have changed in just a short period of time.

1159
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,322
In my experience, obviously professionally, sure.

1160
01:18:33,396 --> 01:18:41,354
You can't really judge the temperature of Alex because I run in circles that are pretty antiinflors, naturally.

1161
01:18:41,522 --> 01:18:43,534
And so I put that to the side.

1162
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:53,290
And there are a number of people that I interact with just whether it's somebody in a service capacity or just a random person.

1163
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:59,290
And generally, if anybody asks me sometimes lyft drivers, for instance, sure, I've been there.

1164
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:02,614
They'll ask me what I do and I'll explain it.

1165
01:19:02,652 --> 01:19:06,334
And usually it's Alex Jones who yes, like most of the time.

1166
01:19:06,372 --> 01:19:08,174
There was that one guy in Austin who was a fan.

1167
01:19:08,222 --> 01:19:17,674
Yeah, but other than that, the masses have really not just a low level of support for Alex, so much as they have no idea who that motherfucker is.

1168
01:19:17,712 --> 01:19:17,914
Yes.

1169
01:19:17,952 --> 01:19:22,946
And that guy in Austin sticks out in the memory because he was so unusual.

1170
01:19:23,078 --> 01:19:24,070
Yes, absolutely.

1171
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:29,474
I have encountered in the wild really, that has been somebody who is an Infowars supporter.

1172
01:19:29,582 --> 01:19:37,030
I think generally it's people who have no idea and maybe would be like, oh, he's that guy.

1173
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:37,800
Yes.

1174
01:19:38,490 --> 01:19:41,110
He's that guy who like Big Trump guy.

1175
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:41,710
Yeah.

1176
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,698
That guy was a january 6 is not starlord.

1177
01:19:45,734 --> 01:19:48,000
He is a character actor in this show.

1178
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,346
He's extra to most people.

1179
01:19:51,408 --> 01:19:51,814
Yeah.

1180
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:55,598
He's the deity appointed leader to his fans.

1181
01:19:55,694 --> 01:19:56,026
Right.

1182
01:19:56,088 --> 01:20:02,390
And a fucking child with a boo boo to most people who pay attention.

1183
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:02,854
Yeah.

1184
01:20:02,952 --> 01:20:06,274
Anyway, Alex said he was going to have a guest, and he does.

1185
01:20:06,372 --> 01:20:06,706
Sure.

1186
01:20:06,768 --> 01:20:07,574
But it's not a guest.

1187
01:20:07,622 --> 01:20:08,410
Oh, no.

1188
01:20:08,580 --> 01:20:13,666
Well, my old friend Greg Reese, great researcher, is in studio with us.

1189
01:20:13,848 --> 01:20:15,362
I saw him yesterday, gave him a hug.

1190
01:20:15,386 --> 01:20:15,938
I was busy.

1191
01:20:15,974 --> 01:20:16,538
He was busy.

1192
01:20:16,574 --> 01:20:18,038
Only talked about a minute.

1193
01:20:18,194 --> 01:20:19,034
It's not a guest.

1194
01:20:19,082 --> 01:20:20,290
He's your employee.

1195
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:22,750
He's a guy who works in Infowars.

1196
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:35,050
Does Alex know that? But I mean, with the rotating cast of people now he knows for sure because Greg Reese, alex plays his reports all the time on the show.

1197
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,642
Talks about how each one is the best that's ever been made.

1198
01:20:37,716 --> 01:20:38,026
Right.

1199
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:48,660
And if you go to band video, you'll find that his videos get significantly more traffic than even, like, Owen or Harrison Smith's stuff.

1200
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:52,838
Alex is somebody who is nothing if not motivated by traction.

1201
01:20:52,934 --> 01:20:53,662
True.

1202
01:20:53,856 --> 01:20:58,200
Greg gets a fair bit because his videos are pretty slickly done.

1203
01:20:59,850 --> 01:21:02,666
He shows competence in certain aspects.

1204
01:21:02,798 --> 01:21:04,030
I winced at that.

1205
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:04,930
I did see that.

1206
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:05,338
Yeah.

1207
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:06,660
I wouldn't say that.

1208
01:21:07,170 --> 01:21:10,750
Maybe in terms of editing, like there's some competence there.

1209
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:10,978
Sure.

1210
01:21:11,004 --> 01:21:15,286
His voiceover I find incredibly boring jarring to listen to.

1211
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:19,560
And the stuff that he says is just stupid like this.

1212
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:22,260
He has an idea.

1213
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:26,710
I want to see if you can come up with some ways this idea might go bad.

1214
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,142
I think everyone in the world is starting to wake up to that fact right now.

1215
01:21:30,276 --> 01:21:35,650
That the Federal Reserve fiat currency system is what's responsible for all the problems in the world right now.

1216
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,118
Sounds right.

1217
01:21:36,144 --> 01:21:42,850
And people are talking about silver and gold mines going into private business as banks since they have the vaults already.

1218
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:46,510
And they tie a crypto card to gold and silver.

1219
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:56,494
And then the private market, the free private market can just compete for people's trust and serviceability to start creating a parallel banking system.

1220
01:21:56,532 --> 01:21:59,734
So the end of their systems here, they're trying to rope us into.

1221
01:21:59,772 --> 01:22:02,386
Instead of them going to prison, they get more power.

1222
01:22:02,508 --> 01:22:08,890
What they want is they want to toss us an idea of some type of digital fiat currency.

1223
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:15,338
Only a fool is going to accept anything that they take after all of the death and destruction that they've caused for decades and decades.

1224
01:22:15,494 --> 01:22:17,062
But that's obviously the plan.

1225
01:22:17,196 --> 01:22:19,094
We just get 8 million in bitcoin.

1226
01:22:19,202 --> 01:22:21,298
Look, this is a dumb idea.

1227
01:22:21,384 --> 01:22:23,242
No, you don't understand.

1228
01:22:23,376 --> 01:22:25,334
He just invented mining town.

1229
01:22:25,442 --> 01:22:26,890
It makes perfect sense.

1230
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,966
All right, here's what we do.

1231
01:22:29,148 --> 01:22:31,510
We go all the way to the west.

1232
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,102
We get a covered wagon together.

1233
01:22:34,176 --> 01:22:35,470
We get all buds together.

1234
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,022
We build a little tent.

1235
01:22:37,106 --> 01:22:45,970
We open up our own general store around the Mind, and people will pay us with the gold that they recently banned out of the river.

1236
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:50,410
The only people who could really afford to run that store anyway are the people who run the mine.

1237
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,920
I think that's a great idea.

1238
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:57,106
They should actually give their own currency out.

1239
01:22:57,288 --> 01:23:00,862
They guarantee using their money so you can only buy the stuff.

1240
01:23:00,936 --> 01:23:02,290
I think that's implied.

1241
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,710
Yeah, that's a smart move.

1242
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:06,986
This is wild.

1243
01:23:07,058 --> 01:23:16,750
I mean, also, just logistically, I think that people who have a lot of resources right now are going to be able to buy those mines.

1244
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:27,686
But I think you'll end up with probably oligarchs of mind banks who will be able to maybe set unregulated.

1245
01:23:27,758 --> 01:23:31,320
By the way, that's also definitely an implied part of the system.

1246
01:23:33,150 --> 01:23:34,846
No, absolutely not.

1247
01:23:35,028 --> 01:23:38,280
There's so many opportunities for abuse of this system.

1248
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:40,966
It's almost parody of itself.

1249
01:23:41,088 --> 01:23:43,334
I appreciate it when Tech Bros.

1250
01:23:43,442 --> 01:23:51,622
And all those stupid people invent things that we already invented a long time ago, and then they put a new name on it and you're like, oh, you're a genius, like that kind of thing.

1251
01:23:51,756 --> 01:23:53,182
I really don't appreciate it.

1252
01:23:53,196 --> 01:24:02,554
Whenever we do have, like, a history where people did the step by step thing that you're recommending, and you can go back and you can read about how it turned out.

1253
01:24:02,652 --> 01:24:03,742
You can just read about it.

1254
01:24:03,756 --> 01:24:04,342
It's there.

1255
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:05,266
It happened before.

1256
01:24:05,328 --> 01:24:06,250
Yeah, and it was bad.

1257
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:07,426
It was so bad.

1258
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:09,178
That's why we had to not do it.

1259
01:24:09,204 --> 01:24:10,414
We had to stop doing it.

1260
01:24:10,452 --> 01:24:12,610
Why are you going like, oh, no, I've got an idea.

1261
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:22,750
That bad thing we did that led to everybody dying in the Great Depression and all that shit, but what if what if we did it again? So Greg's got another dumb thing to say.

1262
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,918
Sure, big picture.

1263
01:24:23,954 --> 01:24:24,562
You're a smart guy.

1264
01:24:24,576 --> 01:24:27,454
I really respect your opinion reports every week.

1265
01:24:27,492 --> 01:24:28,560
People love you.

1266
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:34,702
Why are you optimistic? Where do you think we are historically? I think the test is clear.

1267
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:37,238
I think we're being offered it's offering acceptance.

1268
01:24:37,274 --> 01:24:38,770
And they've been doing this for years.

1269
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,850
They're offering us slavery.

1270
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:44,914
They've actually started to offer us slavery years ago.

1271
01:24:44,952 --> 01:24:49,738
I think they started up 1619 right after the Revolutionary War, try to rope us back into it.

1272
01:24:49,824 --> 01:24:51,986
And ultimately, it's our choice.

1273
01:24:52,058 --> 01:24:54,278
Ultimately, we don't have to be slaves.

1274
01:24:54,314 --> 01:24:58,070
We could actually become independent, become responsible.

1275
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,690
They're offering you slavery.

1276
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:01,450
That's not really how it works.

1277
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:07,678
And back at the Revolutionary War, guess what? Some people were not offering slavery so much as they were forced into it.

1278
01:25:07,704 --> 01:25:12,910
Yeah, generations talking about these people are so stupid.

1279
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:14,446
It's just so amazing.

1280
01:25:14,508 --> 01:25:15,878
We're being offered slavery.

1281
01:25:15,914 --> 01:25:19,726
How do you get to say these things? How is that allowed? Man.

1282
01:25:19,788 --> 01:25:21,130
You work at Infowars.

1283
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:24,826
People are like, shamed for not going to college.

1284
01:25:24,888 --> 01:25:29,090
I swear to God, you should be shamed for not reading comprehension in fourth grade.

1285
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:30,550
That's what should be happening here.

1286
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:37,058
Well, I think that they can read, and there's some reading comprehension there's just like, I don't know what you're reading.

1287
01:25:37,154 --> 01:25:39,206
Yeah, maybe you're just reading shit.

1288
01:25:39,278 --> 01:25:49,462
Wingdings I think when they read a real book, it's just a bunch of bork or you're just suspicious of everything you read.

1289
01:25:49,536 --> 01:25:55,882
And so when you read a line that says X, you're like, trying to trick me into thinking X.

1290
01:25:56,076 --> 01:26:06,218
Maybe what this book is actually saying is why? Why is it that nobody believes in the double bluff of books? They're like, they think you're tricking you, but they're actually telling the truth.

1291
01:26:06,254 --> 01:26:07,286
It's a double bluff.

1292
01:26:07,418 --> 01:26:10,450
What about the triple bluff? Oh, you can't trust the triple bluff.

1293
01:26:11,730 --> 01:26:15,598
So anyway, researcher, great mind.

1294
01:26:15,684 --> 01:26:25,982
Greg Reese the reason I believe that we're going to win is because you can see that the way they've had this thing hold planned, they weren't expecting this much pushback.

1295
01:26:26,006 --> 01:26:30,746
They weren't expecting this much they were definitely expecting more people to take the vaccine.

1296
01:26:30,878 --> 01:26:36,374
Which tells me that Susan comes out and says, today we've hired 110,000 Info warriors.

1297
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:39,026
They use our term to counter the disinfo.

1298
01:26:39,098 --> 01:26:42,542
Right? I mean, they're desperate.

1299
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:42,874
Yes.

1300
01:26:42,912 --> 01:26:48,226
Just going along with Alex's bullshit story about a two year old podcast that he's now saying klaus Schwab said, sure.

1301
01:26:48,288 --> 01:26:56,822
And making it all about himself, which wasn't the case unless you identify solely with the idea of misinformation.

1302
01:26:56,906 --> 01:26:59,050
Yes and yes.

1303
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,606
Greg greece just going along to get along.

1304
01:27:01,728 --> 01:27:02,446
Yeah.

1305
01:27:02,628 --> 01:27:07,090
That is such a weird example of just total capture.

1306
01:27:07,410 --> 01:27:10,766
Just like, hey, the sky is orange.

1307
01:27:10,898 --> 01:27:12,254
The sky is not just orange.

1308
01:27:12,302 --> 01:27:12,778
You bet it is.

1309
01:27:12,804 --> 01:27:14,354
It's green and orange.

1310
01:27:14,402 --> 01:27:14,938
Yeah.

1311
01:27:15,084 --> 01:27:17,258
Now it's striped like the flag.

1312
01:27:17,354 --> 01:27:17,882
It's nuts.

1313
01:27:17,906 --> 01:27:20,158
It's so crazy.

1314
01:27:20,244 --> 01:27:21,742
And you're like, oh, wow.

1315
01:27:21,816 --> 01:27:23,302
There's just no bottom.

1316
01:27:23,436 --> 01:27:24,086
None.

1317
01:27:24,218 --> 01:27:25,450
Facts, capture.

1318
01:27:26,970 --> 01:27:29,986
Look, these people love the individual.

1319
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:32,450
They're so into individualism.

1320
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:38,686
They think that you are the greatest thing, and God is, like, working through you.

1321
01:27:38,748 --> 01:27:41,050
And that's why they do whatever Alex tells them to do.

1322
01:27:41,100 --> 01:27:41,966
Individuality.

1323
01:27:42,038 --> 01:27:46,226
And also, maybe some people are so dumb that we need leaders.

1324
01:27:46,418 --> 01:27:50,938
If you were to tell me three or four years ago that we need leadership, I might have argued that.

1325
01:27:51,024 --> 01:28:02,366
But after seeing covet and realizing that a large amount of the population is sheep, like, out of respect and love for our fellow man, we do need leadership.

1326
01:28:02,438 --> 01:28:02,998
That's right.

1327
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,026
As leaders, we don't want to lead people.

1328
01:28:05,088 --> 01:28:06,074
We want them to be leaders.

1329
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:11,506
But if they're going to be under the control of people, we've got to not control them, but lead by example.

1330
01:28:11,568 --> 01:28:12,746
Be the good shepherd.

1331
01:28:12,878 --> 01:28:14,170
That's what we have to be.

1332
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:15,854
We want people to be independent.

1333
01:28:15,902 --> 01:28:16,726
And lead themselves.

1334
01:28:16,848 --> 01:28:22,198
But if they believe things that are different to what we believe, we must for their own good.

1335
01:28:22,284 --> 01:28:25,490
Or lead them as a good shepherd.

1336
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:25,882
Yeah.

1337
01:28:25,956 --> 01:28:29,602
No, I don't understand why people don't understand that religion is great.

1338
01:28:29,676 --> 01:28:34,078
If people don't believe what you have to say, you torture them until they do.

1339
01:28:34,164 --> 01:28:34,910
It's benevolent.

1340
01:28:34,970 --> 01:28:39,480
Why isn't this obvious? It's the way that God meant things to run.

1341
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:41,890
The Lord gave me a message.

1342
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:45,070
And to be fair, I mean, I do think that we need leadership as well.

1343
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:48,730
Not because I think people are too dumb to lead themselves or anything.

1344
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:52,898
I think that there are other benefits that we gain through leadership.

1345
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,242
Things like morale, things like feeling connected to each other.

1346
01:28:56,316 --> 01:29:07,582
Sure, there are all kinds of benefits, but the way that they're looking at it has a real patronizing view of just the public, which makes sense.

1347
01:29:07,716 --> 01:29:08,794
They don't care about people.

1348
01:29:08,832 --> 01:29:10,200
They don't think people are great.

1349
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:11,810
Nonsense.

1350
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,058
No.

1351
01:29:12,084 --> 01:29:23,518
They don't want somebody who's a leader, who's going to listen to the people, who are going to synthesize information and then ultimately is going to take responsibility for the decision that they make.

1352
01:29:23,664 --> 01:29:25,094
No, that's called leadership.

1353
01:29:25,142 --> 01:29:25,354
Yeah.

1354
01:29:25,392 --> 01:29:29,074
And another thing that's great leadership is providing hope.

1355
01:29:29,172 --> 01:29:29,820
Yeah.

1356
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:32,926
Providing a message that people can rally behind.

1357
01:29:32,988 --> 01:29:41,390
Now, one other form of leadership you could consider would be something along the lines of an iron fisted dictatorship.

1358
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:44,294
Now, is that leadership? It's a good shepherd.

1359
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:46,022
Well, it's a shepherd of sorts.

1360
01:29:46,046 --> 01:29:47,474
It's an effective shepherd.

1361
01:29:47,642 --> 01:29:48,910
I don't think that's true.

1362
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:52,298
So you like beef? Not if it's shepherded.

1363
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:52,642
Wrong.

1364
01:29:52,716 --> 01:29:54,806
Well, Alex loves beef.

1365
01:29:54,878 --> 01:29:55,222
Okay.

1366
01:29:55,296 --> 01:29:59,402
Beef is actually one of the most nutritious I mean, it's the sacred cow.

1367
01:29:59,426 --> 01:30:05,522
It's a life sustaining what? Do you not know what the sacred cow things alive is only alive because it's consumed.

1368
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:07,754
And a cow eats grass and it's self fulfilling.

1369
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:08,966
It feeds you beef.

1370
01:30:09,098 --> 01:30:09,746
The Bible.

1371
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:11,486
Genesis starts talking about beef.

1372
01:30:11,558 --> 01:30:12,180
Yeah.

1373
01:30:14,470 --> 01:30:16,960
So Greg is just going along with whatever.

1374
01:30:17,290 --> 01:30:18,302
Just whatever.

1375
01:30:18,436 --> 01:30:27,966
So I think that Greg is trying to point to the idea that cows are sacred in Hindu culture, which is dumb because they're specifically like they don't slaughter and eat cows because they're consistent.

1376
01:30:28,038 --> 01:30:28,902
They are sacred cows.

1377
01:30:28,926 --> 01:30:29,114
Yes.

1378
01:30:29,152 --> 01:30:30,822
They aren't sacred because beef is delicious.

1379
01:30:30,846 --> 01:30:32,114
Because they fucking love it.

1380
01:30:32,152 --> 01:30:32,498
Yeah.

1381
01:30:32,584 --> 01:30:34,194
This is the steak of steaks.

1382
01:30:34,242 --> 01:30:37,086
Also, Genesis does not start by talking about beef.

1383
01:30:37,158 --> 01:30:38,874
Beef, it's what's for dinner.

1384
01:30:38,922 --> 01:30:39,906
Say it the Lord.

1385
01:30:39,978 --> 01:30:45,590
It starts with God existing in a void of formless, nothingness in creating the earth and light and all that stuff.

1386
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:52,014
It's not until Genesis 124 that land animals are created, and that's after birds and quite a bit after vegetables.

1387
01:30:52,062 --> 01:30:56,714
Sure, there's no mention of beef, but humans are said to be lords over the natural world.

1388
01:30:56,872 --> 01:31:04,122
Interestingly, though, God does say, quote, I give you every seed bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed.

1389
01:31:04,146 --> 01:31:06,700
In it, they will be yours for food.

1390
01:31:07,030 --> 01:31:15,306
Anyway, the Bible doesn't start with a passage about beef, and it's really embarrassing for Greg to just yes, and that shit facts capture.

1391
01:31:15,378 --> 01:31:20,810
The irony is that the first real discussion regarding beef ends with a murder.

1392
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:23,138
That's in the next book, though.

1393
01:31:23,164 --> 01:31:23,946
Or next chapter.

1394
01:31:24,018 --> 01:31:28,900
Yeah, the first big like, what's beef about murder? Yeah.

1395
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:31,334
Seems pretty obvious from the get go.

1396
01:31:31,372 --> 01:31:32,430
It's also it's for dinner.

1397
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:33,470
You already said that.

1398
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,090
Catchphrase marketing.

1399
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:41,198
Anyway, we get back to the sacred cow idea, and Greg the wrong idea about the sacred cow, kind of.

1400
01:31:41,224 --> 01:31:43,478
But he actually even has a worse wrong.

1401
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:45,962
Okay, I'm doing the report on that now.

1402
01:31:45,976 --> 01:31:55,310
And one of the interesting things there's a myth of vegetarianism is sort of connected to yoga, and there's a bunch of yoga so popular, and there's all these vegans into that.

1403
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:59,246
But that's a whole myth, because if you actually look at that, that was based on the caste system.

1404
01:31:59,368 --> 01:32:03,074
Vegetarians were just a lower caste class.

1405
01:32:03,172 --> 01:32:05,058
Indian culture class were given meat.

1406
01:32:05,094 --> 01:32:09,938
And the only reason the lower caste were given vegetarian meals was so that they could save the meat for the upper class.

1407
01:32:09,964 --> 01:32:10,226
Exactly.

1408
01:32:10,288 --> 01:32:12,698
That's what the vet description, and that's all they're trying to do.

1409
01:32:12,724 --> 01:32:19,754
I'm sorry, what did you just say? System where we're all these lower peasants eating bugs, and then they can fly around the jets and have all the good stuff.

1410
01:32:19,912 --> 01:32:25,218
So there are definitely some connections between the caste system and rates of vegetarianism and traditional Indian culture.

1411
01:32:25,254 --> 01:32:35,394
But what Greg is doing is oversimplifying things in a way that is specifically designed to compare one to one with modern day infowars talking points like how kawab wants you to eat bugs.

1412
01:32:35,562 --> 01:32:46,230
Many of the lower classes in the caste system were not practicing Hindus, so they wouldn't have been concerned with the dietary restrictions that largely stemmed from Hindu beliefs and nonviolence.

1413
01:32:46,410 --> 01:32:56,658
Conversely, many of the Brahmans were actually their priests and members of the scholarly class, and as you might expect, they were more observant people in terms of Hinduism.

1414
01:32:56,814 --> 01:33:06,558
The phenomenon you see when you look at historical trends related to the caste system and vegetarianism is actually that the higher someone is in caste, the more likely they are to be vegetarian.

1415
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:12,614
It's actually the reverse of what Greg is saying, but this doesn't work for the Kaosha squad wants you to eat bugs thing.

1416
01:33:12,652 --> 01:33:18,040
So he's pretending that there's no Hindu belief in this do no harm thing.

1417
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:22,694
They're just trying to trick poor people into eating plants so they could save the cows for themselves.

1418
01:33:22,852 --> 01:33:28,550
I do recall reading the Upon USAds and thinking, man, this is all about how the rich need jets.

1419
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:30,842
Yeah, that's what it is.

1420
01:33:30,916 --> 01:33:37,734
The argument that Greg is making is absurd, but the reality of this dynamic is actually far more complicated than even the picture that I've described.

1421
01:33:37,782 --> 01:33:45,170
And I'm not doing justice to the nuances of how this plays out in tradition day in India.

1422
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:51,078
There's a lot of the Indian subcontinent has a history that is almost impossible to unravel.

1423
01:33:51,174 --> 01:33:52,146
It's incredible.

1424
01:33:52,218 --> 01:33:53,706
It's very complex.

1425
01:33:53,778 --> 01:34:01,202
But the notion that it's like, oh, they were just tricking the poor people into eating vegetables so they could keep the cows for themselves works for me.

1426
01:34:01,336 --> 01:34:01,886
Wow.

1427
01:34:02,008 --> 01:34:03,026
Write it on the board.

1428
01:34:03,088 --> 01:34:04,098
That sounds trophy.

1429
01:34:04,134 --> 01:34:07,106
It's in the vedic scriptures? Come on.

1430
01:34:07,168 --> 01:34:08,862
You don't know it's in the Vedic scriptures.

1431
01:34:08,946 --> 01:34:09,482
Yeah.

1432
01:34:09,616 --> 01:34:16,594
So Greg thinks back to his time beginning at Infowars.

1433
01:34:16,642 --> 01:34:17,070
Right.

1434
01:34:17,180 --> 01:34:17,562
Okay.

1435
01:34:17,636 --> 01:34:22,880
And honestly, I think that what he does here is he isolates a real serious problem.

1436
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:31,074
When I first came here four years ago, I'm a very open minded, very skeptical, suspicious person.

1437
01:34:31,112 --> 01:34:45,754
And I've heard all the stories about controlled opposition and everything, so who knows? But when I got here, I was just basically told to try to pick a story that I think is important and do my best to get it right and stick to the truth.

1438
01:34:45,802 --> 01:34:46,986
And that was it.

1439
01:34:47,108 --> 01:34:57,006
And I remember asking Rob when he told me that, I was like, shouldn't I show it to anyone first to make sure that it's approved? And he just looked at me almost with disgust and said, we don't have time for that.

1440
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:57,870
And that's true.

1441
01:34:57,920 --> 01:34:59,466
Everyone out here, we're working.

1442
01:34:59,588 --> 01:35:00,426
Oh, my God.

1443
01:35:00,548 --> 01:35:01,434
We saw your work.

1444
01:35:01,472 --> 01:35:02,754
We chose you, believe me.

1445
01:35:02,792 --> 01:35:03,330
Oh, my God.

1446
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,022
We have no time for quality control.

1447
01:35:05,096 --> 01:35:05,598
Oh, my God.

1448
01:35:05,624 --> 01:35:08,794
You have no time to check anything to see if it's full of shit.

1449
01:35:08,902 --> 01:35:09,560
Wow.

1450
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:12,846
That's a bad process.

1451
01:35:13,028 --> 01:35:17,178
Is there an employee handbook or can I at least train with somebody? No.

1452
01:35:17,264 --> 01:35:18,678
Find a story, put it out.

1453
01:35:18,704 --> 01:35:21,214
Well, technically, there's an employee handbook, but it's just boilerplate.

1454
01:35:21,262 --> 01:35:22,038
We just copied it.

1455
01:35:22,064 --> 01:35:23,890
We stole it from reliable sources.

1456
01:35:23,950 --> 01:35:28,280
We did control F for reliable sources and put infowars in.

1457
01:35:30,690 --> 01:35:31,270
Yeah.

1458
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:34,570
I would think that one of the things that could aid Infowars the most.

1459
01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,450
Actually, I take that back, because it would completely destroy them.

1460
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:40,810
I was going to say, you're misunderstanding their business.

1461
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:47,902
Nothing would get on air if someone said, hey, hold on.

1462
01:35:48,036 --> 01:35:48,902
They would quit.

1463
01:35:48,986 --> 01:35:50,470
Yeah, definitely.

1464
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,242
I mean, that's the thing that they really are.

1465
01:35:53,376 --> 01:35:57,274
We talk about how they're lying and they don't give a shit, and they're making everything up.

1466
01:35:57,372 --> 01:36:05,938
But what we're really not talking about is if they did face any challenge on the way to publishing one of those stories, they would give up and they would do a different story.

1467
01:36:06,024 --> 01:36:06,970
That's probably true.

1468
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:16,030
And I think that they not only lie and make all this shit up, they've also constructed a system that AIDS that.

1469
01:36:16,140 --> 01:36:21,442
They constructed a system that is complicit and complementary to making shit up.

1470
01:36:21,456 --> 01:36:21,670
Yeah.

1471
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:32,830
No, it is a little bit like when you see apes put a stick in a tree and then ants come off it, and you're like, you guys figured that out all on your own? That's fucking amazing.

1472
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:37,310
You figured out that no quality control means you get ants from your stick.

1473
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:37,980
Exactly.

1474
01:36:38,730 --> 01:36:49,754
So greg's Dumb, I believe that this is the most divine inspired job I've ever had in my life.

1475
01:36:49,792 --> 01:36:53,174
I've never felt name your other job so purposeful in my life.

1476
01:36:53,212 --> 01:36:59,250
And it's interesting because the majority of my life, I was very aware that I was lacking a sense of purpose.

1477
01:36:59,310 --> 01:37:02,714
And for the past four years, I feel like I've been doing God's work.

1478
01:37:02,752 --> 01:37:04,550
And it's been extremely humbling.

1479
01:37:05,710 --> 01:37:11,238
We believe in humanity, so we believe you believe in humanity? We're fighting for our survival.

1480
01:37:11,394 --> 01:37:13,730
We think anybody should just join us.

1481
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:19,958
Why would you not join us? Right? Almost everything you say, that's why I wouldn't join them.

1482
01:37:20,044 --> 01:37:20,438
Wow.

1483
01:37:20,524 --> 01:37:25,502
Also, I think you're full of shit about caring about humanity, so I don't take much stock in that either.

1484
01:37:25,576 --> 01:37:28,730
Yeah, a lot of reasons not to join you, Alex.

1485
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:39,822
Lot of talk about divine ordainment surrounding various Infowars stuff on this episode that I find real troubling.

1486
01:37:39,966 --> 01:37:50,834
You know what? The thought occurs, all right, maybe Infowars doesn't have a handbook, all right? But there is a handbook that they're supposed to follow.

1487
01:37:50,932 --> 01:37:51,230
True.

1488
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:52,530
And that book is the Bible.

1489
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:56,990
And those motherfuckers haven't read that because the Bible with beef.

1490
01:37:57,310 --> 01:38:03,254
It's very clear on the story, isn't just stick to the truth as close as you can.

1491
01:38:03,352 --> 01:38:05,850
And we don't have time to work out the kinks.

1492
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:09,770
Well, I think they have not gotten past the beef part yet.

1493
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:10,790
That is a good part.

1494
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:11,198
Yeah.

1495
01:38:11,284 --> 01:38:12,606
It really sets the stage.

1496
01:38:12,678 --> 01:38:17,740
There's so much to get through brisket, right? We haven't even gotten it.

1497
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:24,806
Hey, later on, did you know that the Pope classified beaver is a fish? What? Yeah.

1498
01:38:24,928 --> 01:38:32,722
You know why Fridays couldn't eat fish? Had their fish.

1499
01:38:32,866 --> 01:38:34,402
So the devil.

1500
01:38:34,546 --> 01:38:38,900
What about them on loyal don't they get they're going to be left with the bill.

1501
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:45,738
Well, that's the thing that shows you how loyal the devil is.

1502
01:38:45,764 --> 01:38:57,126
Because all these people, a lot of these people, the pelosi and all these people, they've dedicated their lives to this evil force, and what are they getting returned? They're just getting put out to pasture and used.

1503
01:38:57,188 --> 01:38:58,062
One last thing.

1504
01:38:58,196 --> 01:38:59,658
They're having a great time.

1505
01:38:59,804 --> 01:39:05,970
There's no loyalty of $100 million and all there is is loyalty.

1506
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:08,586
They don't even get it.

1507
01:39:08,648 --> 01:39:09,018
No.

1508
01:39:09,104 --> 01:39:15,390
Where's David Knight? Where's Millie Weaver? Any of your old all there is is loyalty.

1509
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:19,534
And they were disloyal, so they must be tossed into the sud.

1510
01:39:19,642 --> 01:39:20,322
I see.

1511
01:39:20,396 --> 01:39:26,010
Yeah, you see, loyalty only flows one way, right? Loyalty does not go both ways.

1512
01:39:26,120 --> 01:39:28,722
Loyalty is not a two way street, my friend.

1513
01:39:28,916 --> 01:39:33,082
I think that Alex is not a good example of loyalty.

1514
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:36,010
Loyalty? Yeah, loyalty.

1515
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:38,994
Think about all the names that he can't get away.

1516
01:39:39,092 --> 01:39:41,698
Jakari calls him up every weekend.

1517
01:39:41,794 --> 01:39:43,018
Yeah, I'm so loyal.

1518
01:39:43,054 --> 01:39:44,914
I want to try and help you find a new gig.

1519
01:39:44,962 --> 01:39:46,410
Jakari? Yeah.

1520
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:47,494
Very loyal.

1521
01:39:47,662 --> 01:39:53,662
I mean, he couldn't even remember Jason Burmas on the sand.

1522
01:39:53,746 --> 01:40:01,678
Or when he's talking about his early career, his early broadcasting, metaphorically speaking, gun to his head, he could not remember Burman.

1523
01:40:01,774 --> 01:40:05,542
Yeah, sad, disloyal, somewhat safe.

1524
01:40:05,626 --> 01:40:06,126
Yes.

1525
01:40:06,248 --> 01:40:08,638
Devil's looking pretty nice in comparison, honestly.

1526
01:40:08,734 --> 01:40:09,174
Sure.

1527
01:40:09,272 --> 01:40:11,010
He gave Pelosi $100 million.

1528
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:12,630
Jakari didn't get shit.

1529
01:40:13,130 --> 01:40:21,150
So, Alex, I think some of this divine ordained business is going to his head a little bit.

1530
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:24,320
You think? Yeah, this is really fucked up.

1531
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:27,810
We're really at the peak of all this right now.

1532
01:40:27,860 --> 01:40:39,320
And the way I see it, total victory is going to be to where Infowars can exit appropriately to the point where we're no longer needed and we can bow out.

1533
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:42,222
That's my vision, company man.

1534
01:40:42,416 --> 01:40:50,734
So at this point is when we need the most support because they see our defeat as the defeat of the populist movement.

1535
01:40:50,842 --> 01:40:52,294
And so it's very symbolic.

1536
01:40:52,462 --> 01:40:54,198
And so that's how I see victories to work.

1537
01:40:54,224 --> 01:40:58,818
And I actually see us pushing all the way and being destroyed publicly as Christ side.

1538
01:40:58,844 --> 01:41:00,766
That compare myself to Christ, but it repeats.

1539
01:41:00,898 --> 01:41:18,610
I'm actually in exactly because that will repeat like the heads of the Hydra if they can cut us off, it's just going to create a legion of Info warriors pushing the truth because you can't stop the truth.

1540
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:20,770
Yeah, it repeats.

1541
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:22,086
Is fucked up.

1542
01:41:22,148 --> 01:41:23,206
It repeats.

1543
01:41:23,398 --> 01:41:28,054
It I'm not comparing myself to Christ, I'm just saying that the cycle of christness, it repeats.

1544
01:41:28,102 --> 01:41:35,010
Now, I would suggest that the it repeats, undoes whatever sentiment you're trying to convey with I don't think of myself like Christ.

1545
01:41:35,060 --> 01:41:40,986
Oh, yes, you think that that clause then negates the previous part of the Son.

1546
01:41:41,048 --> 01:41:48,738
Now I don't think of myself the same as Jesus, but yeah, now we're talking that, but really changes things.

1547
01:41:48,764 --> 01:41:48,918
Yeah.

1548
01:41:48,944 --> 01:42:04,746
So Alex views himself as somebody who will be sacrificed for the sins of the left or something, I guess, and through his sacrifice will bring about the cleansing that the Patriots need to rise or something.

1549
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:07,066
This is really unsettling shit.

1550
01:42:07,138 --> 01:42:09,666
If that's the case, just fucking get it over with, man.

1551
01:42:09,728 --> 01:42:12,346
Sacrifice yourself, jump into a volcano.

1552
01:42:12,418 --> 01:42:14,418
No, because I don't think he actually thinks this.

1553
01:42:14,444 --> 01:42:19,674
He wants the audience to think he looks at things this way because it's so noble and selfless right.

1554
01:42:19,712 --> 01:42:22,894
In reality, what Greg Reese is talking about is far more accurate.

1555
01:42:23,002 --> 01:42:27,742
It's like what we need to do is find a way to land this plane without a crash.

1556
01:42:27,886 --> 01:42:34,580
And so you all need to give us a bunch of money so Alex can have millions of dollars that he can disappear with or something.

1557
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:37,182
That's the great ending for this story.

1558
01:42:37,256 --> 01:42:40,530
Yeah, that's really more what I'm sure they all want.

1559
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:44,070
The ending for this story is a sequel to that McAfee documentary.

1560
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:46,402
Alex is on the lamb.

1561
01:42:46,486 --> 01:42:47,780
That's where this goes.

1562
01:42:48,170 --> 01:42:51,330
Well, the McAfee documentary.

1563
01:42:51,890 --> 01:42:56,922
Well, I mean, his life as a documentary did send well, I guess Alex thinks he got Epstein or whatever.

1564
01:42:56,996 --> 01:42:58,278
Yeah, I don't fucking know.

1565
01:42:58,364 --> 01:43:03,246
Anyway, Alex takes more calls with Greg Reese, and this call is awesome.

1566
01:43:03,428 --> 01:43:07,654
Craig's comment about the lesions of the info lawyers.

1567
01:43:07,822 --> 01:43:23,466
I'm thinking that maybe that would be something that is a response to Clash Schwab's 100,000 info checkers, so to speak, and that it might also be a way to add a little money to the checking account.

1568
01:43:23,528 --> 01:43:28,558
And infowars is if you had just a real not subscriber, just the basic membership.

1569
01:43:28,714 --> 01:43:35,710
$10 for that, we get a little decal that I can probably put in a little short class on our ethics.

1570
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:36,834
That's a great idea.

1571
01:43:36,932 --> 01:43:37,990
That's a great idea, brother.

1572
01:43:38,050 --> 01:43:39,030
That is a great idea.

1573
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:45,438
Because I think people are more inclined to take action if they invest in it.

1574
01:43:45,524 --> 01:43:48,106
This is just going back to what he did originally.

1575
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:48,606
Yeah.

1576
01:43:48,668 --> 01:43:50,490
He used to have memberships.

1577
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,762
This is going full circle.

1578
01:43:52,846 --> 01:43:56,866
Back to what he did when it was much smaller.

1579
01:43:56,938 --> 01:43:57,560
Yes.

1580
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:04,062
He took sponsors when he could when he was too toxic to have sponsors that went away.

1581
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:09,346
He sold gold with his weirdo friend until he lost his license to sell precious metals.

1582
01:44:09,418 --> 01:44:09,798
Right.

1583
01:44:09,884 --> 01:44:11,430
Sold a bunch of supplements.

1584
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:16,258
Maybe now that's too expensive, too much overhead.

1585
01:44:16,354 --> 01:44:18,126
Alex, I've invented this new idea.

1586
01:44:18,188 --> 01:44:21,010
It's called lowering your overhead and taking donations.

1587
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:22,074
This is brand new.

1588
01:44:22,112 --> 01:44:23,770
It's going to revolutionize the industry.

1589
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:24,394
Pretty sweet.

1590
01:44:24,442 --> 01:44:25,086
Yeah.

1591
01:44:25,268 --> 01:44:28,566
But get a smaller studio and then oh, no.

1592
01:44:28,628 --> 01:44:30,534
So Alex likes this idea.

1593
01:44:30,692 --> 01:44:31,494
Of course he does.

1594
01:44:31,532 --> 01:44:34,530
But he also has to make sure that this caller knows that he had it first.

1595
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,274
That's right.

1596
01:44:35,312 --> 01:44:36,546
I saw that this morning.

1597
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,206
It's just crazy.

1598
01:44:37,268 --> 01:44:40,926
You called most of it.

1599
01:44:40,988 --> 01:44:43,678
I was thinking we should launch an army to counter swab.

1600
01:44:43,774 --> 01:44:44,682
We've already launched it.

1601
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:45,654
We should make it very clear.

1602
01:44:45,692 --> 01:44:49,102
Now, basic directives are code of conduct.

1603
01:44:49,186 --> 01:44:51,234
They can't misrepresent it and then launch it.

1604
01:44:51,272 --> 01:44:52,110
Greg, help me do it.

1605
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:52,662
Yeah.

1606
01:44:52,796 --> 01:44:53,698
You're lovely Larry.

1607
01:44:53,734 --> 01:44:55,710
We love you lovely Larry.

1608
01:44:56,450 --> 01:45:00,178
Here's the thing, okay? 20 years ago, we created this army.

1609
01:45:00,214 --> 01:45:01,474
We called him info warriors.

1610
01:45:01,522 --> 01:45:10,066
And then two years ago, somebody did a podcast, and then yesterday I found out about it, so they called themselves 110,000 Info Warriors.

1611
01:45:10,138 --> 01:45:13,782
So we need to announce that we're 100, and you already were.

1612
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:16,534
Also, Jason Bermans didn't do a show called Info Warrior.

1613
01:45:16,582 --> 01:45:17,180
No.

1614
01:45:17,810 --> 01:45:24,200
Yeah, this is dumb, but I do love Alex's impulse to be like, I thought no this morning.

1615
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:28,950
Not only am I glad you called in, I had this idea this morning.

1616
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,966
So if I do it, I'm not stealing it from it is even dumber, because it's like, oh, no, it's a really new idea.

1617
01:45:37,028 --> 01:45:42,800
Have you thought about this thing that's got four wheels and you put a motor on it and propels you forward? What? Yes.

1618
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:44,574
I mean, it's a car.

1619
01:45:44,612 --> 01:45:46,126
You should really look into cars.

1620
01:45:46,198 --> 01:45:46,794
Okay.

1621
01:45:46,952 --> 01:45:49,122
I got to tell you, this is a great idea, and I love it.

1622
01:45:49,136 --> 01:45:50,478
Yeah, I thought of this this morning.

1623
01:45:50,564 --> 01:45:51,262
Oh shit.

1624
01:45:51,346 --> 01:45:53,826
You already thought of the car? Yes, I would do that.

1625
01:45:53,888 --> 01:45:54,222
Damn it.

1626
01:45:54,236 --> 01:45:55,030
You're a genius.

1627
01:45:55,150 --> 01:46:00,478
So Alex says something really weird to discuss and this is just grandiosity.

1628
01:46:00,574 --> 01:46:01,930
It's pretty remarkable.

1629
01:46:02,110 --> 01:46:09,080
Let me just go ahead and say this now and I don't make this announcement to try to act tough or powerful or any of this.

1630
01:46:09,770 --> 01:46:12,080
In fact, it's so big I can't talk about it.

1631
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:14,130
I'm not being dramatic there.

1632
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:17,720
I'm not ready to talk about this yet because it's such a big deal.

1633
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:20,370
It's actually quite frightening.

1634
01:46:22,550 --> 01:46:28,638
Everybody thought the cub movement was secretly in touch with army intelligence and the resistance movement and all the rest of that.

1635
01:46:28,784 --> 01:46:33,462
Most the Pentagon leadership are globalist, most our military control, the grassroots are great people.

1636
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:39,860
But I can tell you that over the years and here currently I don't get orders from these people.

1637
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,940
In fact I was always listening to for over 20 years.

1638
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:47,410
But now it's been recognized that I'm the leader.

1639
01:46:47,530 --> 01:46:49,138
And I don't say that to act powerful.

1640
01:46:49,174 --> 01:46:50,374
It's actually great responsibility.

1641
01:46:50,482 --> 01:46:52,290
It's not recognized on the leader.

1642
01:46:52,790 --> 01:47:01,546
And so whatever's left of the CIA and the military actually looks for us, for leadership and have asked us to be the leader.

1643
01:47:01,678 --> 01:47:03,298
And I don't say that again that powerful.

1644
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,098
It says a big deal.

1645
01:47:04,124 --> 01:47:05,202
The enemy already knows it.

1646
01:47:05,276 --> 01:47:06,618
That's why Clashwa was doing all this.

1647
01:47:06,644 --> 01:47:07,830
But God did this.

1648
01:47:07,940 --> 01:47:08,754
You did this.

1649
01:47:08,852 --> 01:47:10,486
Info wars is now seen as a leader.

1650
01:47:10,558 --> 01:47:13,446
Claushwab didn't do this and that podcast was from two years ago.

1651
01:47:13,508 --> 01:47:19,460
But look, there is a really fucked up delusions of grant are going on here.

1652
01:47:19,970 --> 01:47:26,814
Obviously, whether or not Alex believes it, one thing when he's expressing to his audience is fucked up enough on its own.

1653
01:47:26,852 --> 01:47:33,378
Yeah, the divinely ordained leadership nonsense that's going on throughout this show is fucked up.

1654
01:47:33,464 --> 01:47:44,840
And now Alex is saying that he has been selected by the good people within the CIA and the FBI to be the leader of whatever their insurgent nonsense is.

1655
01:47:46,790 --> 01:47:47,938
I mean I don't know, Alice.

1656
01:47:47,974 --> 01:47:53,454
To put it he's basically appointed himself a revolutionary general or something.

1657
01:47:53,552 --> 01:47:53,922
Yeah.

1658
01:47:53,996 --> 01:48:01,758
Can I ask you a question? Was it last week that Dave and Gareth were on yeah, it was one week ago.

1659
01:48:01,844 --> 01:48:02,538
Yeah, exactly.

1660
01:48:02,624 --> 01:48:03,282
From today.

1661
01:48:03,356 --> 01:48:03,666
Okay.

1662
01:48:03,728 --> 01:48:12,246
Now I recall last week we learned that Glenn Beck was the FBI and in fact was the entire United States government.

1663
01:48:12,308 --> 01:48:12,714
That's true.

1664
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:15,010
But he got overthrown at some point we have to assume.

1665
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:16,254
We have to assume that.

1666
01:48:16,352 --> 01:48:18,978
So that was treated as a bad thing.

1667
01:48:19,124 --> 01:48:23,842
And yet now in this time period, alex is the FBI and the CIA.

1668
01:48:23,926 --> 01:48:30,366
No, there are good people within the FBI and CIA and Alex is in charge of that.

1669
01:48:30,488 --> 01:48:33,738
Right, okay, that's totally different.

1670
01:48:33,824 --> 01:48:35,838
Everybody is always in charge of everything.

1671
01:48:35,924 --> 01:48:37,206
Well, here's the fun part.

1672
01:48:37,328 --> 01:48:38,314
It's all imaginary.

1673
01:48:38,362 --> 01:48:39,330
That is the fun part.

1674
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:41,480
That is the only part that is fun.

1675
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:46,270
I guess the consequences really are just in what effect it has on his audience.

1676
01:48:46,330 --> 01:48:46,914
Right.

1677
01:48:47,072 --> 01:48:53,422
What kind of emboldening or radicalizing effect it could have on people like Alex.

1678
01:48:53,566 --> 01:48:55,786
He is essentially George Washington.

1679
01:48:55,858 --> 01:48:56,480
Yeah.

1680
01:48:57,650 --> 01:49:01,558
I think the info should just start making themselves FBI badges.

1681
01:49:01,654 --> 01:49:03,454
Why not? Yeah, they're in the CIA.

1682
01:49:03,562 --> 01:49:14,646
It would be kind of like just a new Bill Cooper thing with his deputies, everybody as an FBI agent, his citizen corps of researchers or whatever.

1683
01:49:14,768 --> 01:49:15,658
Investigating.

1684
01:49:15,754 --> 01:49:16,230
Yes.

1685
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:17,070
Arms.

1686
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:22,402
We have one last clip here, and it's Greg swearing allegiance to Alex as the leader.

1687
01:49:22,426 --> 01:49:22,650
Sure.

1688
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:23,058
Great.

1689
01:49:23,144 --> 01:49:23,610
That's awesome.

1690
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:24,270
Trump is good.

1691
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,114
We need leadership.

1692
01:49:25,162 --> 01:49:26,094
We need a president.

1693
01:49:26,252 --> 01:49:31,460
But I see you more as a leader for this movement than Trump.

1694
01:49:32,930 --> 01:49:39,080
Well, actually scares me to think that the best we can oh, my God.

1695
01:49:41,270 --> 01:49:42,440
That's what I said.

1696
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:44,422
I said I'm not the leader.

1697
01:49:44,446 --> 01:49:46,280
They said, you're all we got.

1698
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:48,658
That's how bad this is, folks.

1699
01:49:48,814 --> 01:49:51,500
We're right back with your phone calls on them before stay with us.

1700
01:49:52,850 --> 01:49:56,062
This is why you can't have a show without continuity.

1701
01:49:56,146 --> 01:50:00,078
Okay, well, this is not okay, because I know we're in the future.

1702
01:50:00,164 --> 01:50:01,290
This is even in the past.

1703
01:50:01,340 --> 01:50:02,406
This is the 19th.

1704
01:50:02,468 --> 01:50:02,730
Yeah.

1705
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:06,370
The last time we talked, he wasn't the head of the CIA.

1706
01:50:06,490 --> 01:50:07,760
It didn't come up.

1707
01:50:08,510 --> 01:50:09,702
It should come up.

1708
01:50:09,776 --> 01:50:11,574
No, that should be a daily come up.

1709
01:50:11,672 --> 01:50:17,226
I mean, honestly, the last episode seemed like he was pretty excited about Elon Musk tweeted something.

1710
01:50:17,288 --> 01:50:19,950
I understand that this is an issue for me.

1711
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,760
Yeah, he's the head of the CIA or something.

1712
01:50:24,410 --> 01:50:25,618
Part of the CIA.

1713
01:50:25,714 --> 01:50:26,742
Part of the people.

1714
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:33,654
The real CIA people are pledging fealty to him, and then the next day, he's like, this is the most important tweet Elon Musk has ever had.

1715
01:50:33,692 --> 01:50:34,474
It's a great tweet.

1716
01:50:34,522 --> 01:50:35,182
It's a great tweet.

1717
01:50:35,206 --> 01:50:36,694
He wanted to run surge.

1718
01:50:36,802 --> 01:50:39,260
I got a message from God.

1719
01:50:40,250 --> 01:50:41,854
Also Elon Musk tweet.

1720
01:50:41,902 --> 01:50:46,594
I got a message from God, from the good people in the FBI, CIA.

1721
01:50:46,762 --> 01:50:51,274
I am ordained by both to be the leader of this patriot movement.

1722
01:50:51,322 --> 01:50:54,860
Because Trump won't go against vaccines, I guess.

1723
01:50:55,190 --> 01:51:07,758
So if Alex is the leader of all this, he gets to choose the president, right? You would assume, right? I mean, if he's now the leader of the deep state the deep state is who has chosen the stuff.

1724
01:51:07,904 --> 01:51:09,390
It's not the leader of the deep state.

1725
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,130
It seems like he's the leader of the deep state.

1726
01:51:11,180 --> 01:51:11,574
Deep state.

1727
01:51:11,612 --> 01:51:13,786
Or the other people in the FBI and CIA.

1728
01:51:13,858 --> 01:51:18,378
Well, yeah, but I'm assuming that the other people in the FBI and the CIA will call them the deep state.

1729
01:51:18,524 --> 01:51:21,630
You can call each other the deep state, but you're still both the deep state.

1730
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:26,842
Are you double bluffing again? I've always unless I'm triple bluffing.

1731
01:51:26,926 --> 01:51:27,402
Oh, no.

1732
01:51:27,476 --> 01:51:27,822
Yeah.

1733
01:51:27,896 --> 01:51:30,070
So this is dumb but scary.

1734
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:30,860
Yeah.

1735
01:51:31,370 --> 01:51:33,306
And we'll see where this ends up going.

1736
01:51:33,368 --> 01:51:35,686
It's dumb in scary places, I assume.

1737
01:51:35,818 --> 01:51:38,322
I would have to bet it would be that.

1738
01:51:38,396 --> 01:51:47,398
But it's really fun to know that there are those people in the world like Alex lee Moyer, Glenn Greenwald, Glenn Beck.

1739
01:51:47,554 --> 01:51:47,838
Yeah.

1740
01:51:47,864 --> 01:51:52,470
I mean, Glenn Beck is supporting Alex now, but Joe Rogan put a big stamp of approval on that.

1741
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:53,120
Yes.

1742
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:55,458
This is what you got.

1743
01:51:55,544 --> 01:51:58,318
This is a picture that was missing from that documentary.

1744
01:51:58,354 --> 01:52:08,554
