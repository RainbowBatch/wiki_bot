00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,472
Today Jordan age

00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,752
Still upcoming

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
But ever-closer

13
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
I finally found two

14
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:21,664
Finally going to be a movie

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,784
Look at mine is that I finally found veal Aqua Beach Plum flavor

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:31,136
I missed it a couple of stores look for it at

17
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
I finally got my hands on out okay

18
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
A pack of them

19
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:38,048
And they're Cooling in the fridge as we speak

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,376
We haven't tried them yet but it's gotten

21
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,168
The anticipation is building

22
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,776
It's bad

23
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
It's going to be an intense emotional experience

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
If you're going to be I'm going

25
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,432
To get like

26
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Beach Plum merch

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,904
I got hat and I got a reply

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,672
Recovered heads

29
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:09,024
Either that or you're going to see the other eleven of these

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,304
Thrown out my window

31
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,912
In fury because

32
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,960
Can't possibly just be okay

33
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,544
And the reason is not just because it couldn't be I'm sure

34
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Could be okay

35
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
Because it's so built up

36
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,968
Attention crack one way or the other is not going to just

37
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,992
Ben no

38
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,784

00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,576
Next episode of ours

So everyone can have the Delight of

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,544
Experiencing okay that'll be too much for not special drug number episode

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,480
Fuel pump brand

47
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504

49
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,976
Today or whatever so much you know

50
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,768
I suppose there's this I have a silver leg

51
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
My grandma passed away

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
Sorry to hear that a couple of days ago

53
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
And

54
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,936
You know it

55
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
It's it's tough but

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,728
For the past

57
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
3 years ago

58
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
It's been

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
A style of living that I would

60
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,384
Aspire to

61
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
So in the end you do it

62
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
It's not good that it's now but it

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,344
It's not

64
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
Bad that it's

65
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,160
You know 95 years

66
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
Think so

67
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,232
There is that

68
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
It could be it could be much much

69
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,352
So I got that

70
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
That's about as close to

71
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
A bright spot

72
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,960
Get this week

73
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,752
It's not great

74
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:02,432
Look up better maybe later it might be

75
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:07,040
A judge you for you know having these feelings

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,184
Dino

77
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,208
I guess I guess

78
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:20,607
You could frame it is a bright spot is that she's not in pain to nobody

79
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,471
Incredibly well

80
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,799
I didn't say it was a bright spot I would probably be more eloquent

81
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823
Bratz

82
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,639
I'm sorry for your loss Jordan it is

83
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,431
I understand where you're coming

84
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Jordan today

85
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,551
We have worked

86
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
Davido

87
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:46,207
I'm not really a human I don't I don't know how to talk to a human

88
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,839
We have work to be done

89
00:04:54,911 --> 00:05:00,287
They were talking about the past we're going to June 13th 2003

90
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,871
A reason is decided to its

91
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
At what one of the rights that I

92
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
Retained

93
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
For myself

94
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,271
Is that I reserve the right

95
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,039
To go back

96
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
And put Alex on timeout

97
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Whatever I feel it is appropriate

98
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:22,559
After our last episode was so white nationalist disgusting

99
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,631
The phobic I just felt like I don't I don't even want to

100
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
I don't even want a

101
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
Risk emotionally engaging

102
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
And that

103
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
I'm tired of vaccines

104
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:38,431
And I don't want to risk the audience having to engage with more of that with him the same week

105
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,455
We can be with this

106
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,039
Down the line but today we're going back to the greener pastures

107
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
2003

108
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,367
If they weren't

109
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,951
They weren't really that much bergner

110
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,743
Our last episode had to be like

111
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,559
I do

112
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,959
Harrison Smith isn't what am I am I looking for a more boring white nationalism right now

113
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,239
Disgusting to me so yes

114
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,103
Button-up white nationalism

115
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,151
Because I don't want my white nationalist

116
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
Ripping shirt off

117
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
Scream at me while riding down there

118
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,015
Greased up like a pig

119
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Buy I do not want that

120
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
So this is going to be an interesting

121
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:19,391
Episode we have some

122
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Some news stories that Alex's covering

123
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Possibly well

124
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,815
Possibly not well

125
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,167
And then I really funny thing happens when to call her calls in and W Alex

126
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,239
Superdude Source that'll be fun

127
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,663
The first Reverend shorty doo-wop thank you so much you're now policy walk

128
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,015
I would like to hang out with that

129
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,855
With that it's not a person that's a robot

130
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:55,231
Could be next squirrels thank you so much

131
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:02,911
I'm a policy wonk

132
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
Pretty please do more live streams

133
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
Very much

134
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,383
I mean have we ever done one that was hours

135
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,431
Watson way back

136
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,015
It's the way back yet you did some videos

137
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
Some games we can play Magic

138
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,367
We could

139
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
We could do some streaming of us could probably do it I can figure it out

140
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,535
If you can figure that out maybe we'll do that

141
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,095
Steven

142
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,287
Find Jay from the Mohawk Nation

143
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,335
MattyB on this level you turn up

144
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:45,663
Love Eric J from the Mohawk Nation

145
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,207
Heroin

146
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Yub

147
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,815
Freakishly large

148
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,055
I realize that it's been a little while since we've had an out-of-context drop

149
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Maybe it hasn't been

150
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
It feels like it has

151
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,943
Yes and so I'm thrilled to start today's episode

152
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
With an auto Conte

153
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,839
Oh

154
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,679
So that's why he doesn't

155
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:45,311
Mystery solved explain that

156
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
You know what I feel like he got it out of the way in 2003 he had those

157
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,343
So good

158
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:05,279
Sabaton

159
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,327
Depression

160
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,031
So we start off today show with Alex covering a story about a Massachusetts family

161
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
Got in trouble

162
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
Cuz I didn't want to take a standardized test

163
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Audible articles

164
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:31,135
Are almost grown up

165
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,927
They are refusing

166
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Threaten them

167
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,055
Purple

168
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,335
Were you going to wrap

169
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,271
I just

170
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
I don't know what

171
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
Story this is

172
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:06,207
I hear these details and I'm like

173
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
Nothing

174
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
And I noticed there was this pattern

175
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
It's kind of develop

176
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,167
In the past that is like

177
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
And it's like

178
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,983
I'm going to have to really dig

179
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
To figure out what the fuc

180
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
Well if

181
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,871
If there was

182
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
If his story was true

183
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
I feel like it would be

184
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,247
Easier to go

185
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,575
You know whenever you go back and look for stories for him is in the Paw

186
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:36,927
What are the easiest ways to know it's not true is that it's very hard to find

187
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
Because this story

188
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,327
Would be very easy to find true I'm not sure

189
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Easily be

190
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
A bit of a domestic

191
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
Family Court

192
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,847
Type of issue

193
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,407
Isn't there anymore on the website or something

194
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:59,711
Think of this local news

195
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,991
Organization

196
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
Impossible

197
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,879
You know whatever it is Peter a non-story

198
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Happen or the sum lie

199
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Very difficult

200
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
The track down

201
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Conversely

202
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
I will agree with

203
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,839
If you that like

204
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,655
This next story that I was talking about

205
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,679
If this happened

206
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
Ever want to know about the

207
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:26,847
Home

208
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:33,759
What

209
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,183
Again

210
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Grilled

211
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,103
That little

212
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,575
I have some thoughts

213
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
So so if I understand

214
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:12,927
What he's

215
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,695
Televator

216
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,231
Correctly

217
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:21,631
SWAT teams every four or five months about three times a year a SWAT team will go into a school

218
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,655
Andrews

219
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,191
Moe everyone down

220
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,751
And including themselves sure

221
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
So it's just a big orgy of bullets

222
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
And we don't know about this

223
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Yeah.

224
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,967
It's not making the news somehow

225
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,831
June 30th

226
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,391
Stories about this

227
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,543
Around

228
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
Drill

229
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
So at this point I'm kind of getting bewilder

230
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,087
Pretty rare that Alex talks about the

231
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:14,623
Specific incidents that I can just

232
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
I can't find any evidence of having happen

233
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,999
Usually there's some detail that he's getting wrong and it makes

234
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,863
More difficult to track down as I heard them

235
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,143
I was struggling

236
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
Beautiful story about the having the family having their children taken

237
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,519
Because they wouldn't take a task was intriguing

238
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,335
Short on details about school shooting in the kind of thing that

239
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,431
Everyone would have written an article about

240
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,735
They shoot a kid

241
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:47,135
What stop is something that would be drills for a while at least conversation

242
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,207
Maybe shooting drills are bad

243
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,071
According to Alex the SWAT team to come to the school in Detroit to do a drill and they shot a kid in the

244
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,655
Huge deal

245
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,959
Can't find any news stories about this happening

246
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,727
And that is

247
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:02,495
Did happen

248
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,335
But then Alex kept talking and it became clear that I think you

249
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
Well it's happened again

250
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,599
Ganja plant

251
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
Drill

252
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
The year

253
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Grill

254
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:42,431
So within a couple minutes now the story seems to be that a year prior

255
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:45,503
Cop shot another cop in the head of the school drill right

256
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,599
I don't know what this is the same story or like what I don't know what's going on

257
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
This still isn't good but you definitely can see that this

258
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,695
Doesn't appear to be the same

259
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:56,767
I think it's something that's very important to

260
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Who is involved in this is that

261
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327
0 zloty

262
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:07,519
True so the upside is now actually know what some of the details of that story are

263
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Chance of tracking down the store

264
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
The thing is

265
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
The only thing I can find that

266
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
The clothes doesn't even match the second

267
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Conversion of Alex's story

268
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,783
So I believe that Alex is talking about Corporal Joseph Kush

269
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,087
Men based on the details of the story that he's telling

270
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
Cushman was involved in a training exercise in an area junior high school and was engaged in a demonstration with another officer when

271
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,047
Are there gunfire Deadshot Cushman in the head

272
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,631
There's some really critical details that match up with Alex's narrative

273
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,495
Princess this was a police officer who was shot in the head within the general time frame

274
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,055
Of when Alex was saying this was supposed to happen

275
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Cushman was not named top of the

276
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
The year if that's

277
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Nothing but

278
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
He was the police

279
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
Rookie of the Year in 1999

280
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:54,879
And you've been promoted a day before he was killed 99 mile an hour fastball

281
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
But there are these details also that don't

282
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,279
For one that didn't happen to Detroit happened to Darling

283
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Texas

284
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,679
Second Alexandra's happened around children but that's not true the school district is on summer vacation

285
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,007
And there were no students on campus when they were doing the training

286
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,663
There were 200 students enrolled in summer school classes but those classes ended at noon and this exercise began at 3 p.m.

287
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:23,039
3rd Cushman didn't die on the spot he was taken by helicopter to John Peter Smith Hospital

288
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,599
It was pronounced dead at 7:30 that even

289
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,767
I'm fairly sure Joseph Cushman is a cop that Alex is talking about at least partially because the reference to the story as the is the

290
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
Fort Worth Star-Telegram

291
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,655
Which is a paper that would be much more likely to cover an accidental police shooting in

292
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,423
Denton Texas

293
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Good morning.

294
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Detroit

295
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:46,591
The story itself is horrifying and it's a good argument against many things like you know cops using real guns

296
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
The training exercises or having guns

297
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,967
Cops using schools to Stage training had it all

298
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
Guns at all yet

299
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,063
You can take the actual details of the story and use it to make the points you want but

300
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
How to basically just a dick

301
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:58,367
Adeline

302
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,927
He can't tell us straight version of the story even if it works

303
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:04,511
For some of his points yeah

304
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
Children being president

305
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
SWAT team

306
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,375
I want to see this because I feel like

307
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:10,911
I could

308
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Be bordering on

309
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,983
Offensive in some

310
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,287
I don't know

311
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
If there was an incident where a student got shot

312
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
School end

313
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Detroit by a cop

314
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,199
Dragonite

315
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,039
I will allow that there is a possibility that this is

316
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Strew

317
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
I can't

318
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
Find

319
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,647
Vic story that Alex is talking about

320
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:37,023
But I don't want to be like that didn't happen on the off-chance that there is some real incident

321
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
And there's real there's a real tragedy that Alex's

322
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,655
In some way mischaracterizing

323
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:43,423
In the world

324
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
That we live in

325
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
It is

326
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,775
More possible

327
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
That

328
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
Something like that

329
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,175
Or at least possible enough that were true everybody would be like

330
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
Okay

331
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,223
That happen

332
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
Is part of the story but Alex

333
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Can still be lying about it

334
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,599
Yeah if it even if it happened somewhere else

335
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,903
It's not like he remembers everything of that kind of

336
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,279
I can't tell what's going on in terms of what the stories are

337
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,303
Find

338
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,887
Clear case of what he's talking about the cop of the year

339
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,935
I can't figure out what he's talkin

340
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Sing about

341
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,751
In terms of Detroit and I don't know if there's

342
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Supposed to be the same story

343
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,151
I just don't want to be disrespectful on the off chance that there is a story that I met totally at night so

344
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:25,919
Yeah yeah

345
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Cupboard

346
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,295
So there's another story that Alex has that makes

347
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,343
The point that the SWAT teams are evil

348
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
They use special weapons

349
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
More cops being killed

350
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Throwing up

351
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,735
Video audio

352
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,519
But at least the innocent man

353
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
One of the things that I think it's really key to understand and recognizes the way that Alex uses vagueness as a weapon when he tells his

354
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,991
Stories any always has

355
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,039
He doesn't get into specifics

356
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
Even give enough

357
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,391
Detail for you to really know what story he's talking about because

358
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,231
These stories aren't here to be accurate representations of things that happen

359
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,047
They exist to evoke feelings that support his worldview

360
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,375
This case from Lubbock is about Sergeant Kevin Cox

361
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:53,215
Who was shot and killed during a July 13th 2001 standoff

362
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,007
Happy home of Richard Robinson

363
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,847
Robinson he barricaded himself in the house following a fight with his wife

364
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:03,967
Apparently also in the process of getting some small fires in his front yard

365
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
So the police

366
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,087
Gather information about the case and they learned that Robin

367
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,415
Benson head quote talk to a relative earlier in the day about suicide

368
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,975
Well the police were attempting to approach the house

369
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
Throw in some gas

370
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,535
Shooting broke out in attic

371
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Confusion of it all that it wasn't clear how it at all gotten started

372
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
When the dust settled Cox

373
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,471
Sipping fatally shot and Robinson was arrested and charged with his shoe

374
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
However

375
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,335
Upon analysis of the 13 guns he had which Alex

376
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
Cuz weirdly reporting a 0 gun

377
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,479
The police determine that Robinson did not actually fired any guns during the standoff

378
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,503
So he couldn't

379
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
Do possibly shock cock

380
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:39,551
Yeah

381
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,647
A week later on July 20th Robinson was released in the charges are dropped

382
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
His lawyer told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal quote

383
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,511
We're so pleased that the police

384
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,559
Didn't try to cover anything up and the Disco

385
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
Attorney's office did the right

386
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,655
Ultimately was determined that another op

387
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,679
Officers fired the bullet

388
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Who killed Cox

389
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
And there was

390
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:00,799
Good reason for the shooting to a broken out in the first place

391
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Except some kind of like

392
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,431
No conversations about in in

393
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Insufficient

394
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
Training

395
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
That kind of thing

396
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,271
Yeah I would like taking there

397
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
Their guns away but that's fine

398
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:17,952
The big message of this story is the cops need better training and maybe in a situation like the one Robinson was in militarized police

399
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,976
Police aren't the best approach

400
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,280
Possibly better outcomes could have been reached

401
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:23,840
Social workers are mental health professionals were dispatched

402
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Instead

403
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Maybe we'd all be better off

404
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,912
Who took some of that

405
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,984
That's funding that goes to the police and diverted it to better approaches

406
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Complicated situations like the one

407
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
That this man was

408
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:35,616
I be so cool if Alex at

409
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
Still hated

410
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,456
The police like

411
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:45,856
A lot cooler on a lot cooler term think so if he's still hated the police I think I think it would be

412
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,136
Easier for you to be tricked

413
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
Into believing that he wasn't

414
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:53,792
Horrible bigot or a horrible

415
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
The cops doesn't mean I'm not I'm going to forget you're a horrible big idea of it would make things a little bit smoother for me there's a whole lot of people

416
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
People who I think

417
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,752
Piles of s*** it have a distrust

418
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,568
Civilianaire

419
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Definitely true

420
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:12,224
Taking this story and fudge some of the details to make the central narrative about the police trying to frame this guy

421
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
With the information doesn't support that narrative at all

422
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
In order for Alex

423
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:21,696
To fit the square peg into a round hole he has to lie about things like whether or not Robinson had a gun

424
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:22,720
Disagree

425
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
Fiction about

426
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,584
The police planting a gun on him in a good guy cop on the scene blowing the whistle

427
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,120
Alex is a liar

428
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,680
But it's important to understand that he has to be

429
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,752
In order to maintain the political beliefs he holds

430
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:38,848
He could not deal with stories honestly and still have the same point

431
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,688
Zup

432
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:43,456
Yeah I mean

433
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,016
Part of what we're dealing with is that

434
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:50,368
As much as he's talking to everybody else on his radio show he's also convinced

435
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,904
Sing himself that he's not

436
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:53,440
Monster

437
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
So

438
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
But look dude

439
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
You are worried about

440
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
SWAT teams

441
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,280
I heard it on the news

442
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,096
Increase

443
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
Funding

444
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,704
Police departments are they going to increase the funding of them

445
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,776
Planting guns on you it when they kill each other

446
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
If

447
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
If this isn't

448
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,944
Specific murdering / covering up

449
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,320
The murder at training people they will need to allocate more funds for guns to leave at the

450
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:57,952
So I suppose they will have to dhs's probably don't have to increase funding for that

451
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,632
Yeah to have about the problems with policing

452
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,192
This is childish it's his bad

453
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,216
This is bad

454
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:12,544
Divert you from an actual conversation into like

455
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,360
But I kill you I plant I got on you okay

456
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Okay buddy alright

457
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Which is not to say that they don't do that

458
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,344
About every time

459
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:30,976
So what are the things that I think is really fascinating would you go back to 2000

460
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Jordan

461
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,888
As you start to see things but Alex has an awareness of it he doesn't

462
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,168
In the present

463
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
Maybe primary aspect of his brand

464
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,800
Our misunderstandings that he didn't have any

465
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
The past weird

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
Yeah it's very strange like

467
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:48,640
Princeton

468
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,688
This one caller calls in

469
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,736
On this side is here June 13th

470
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Shelton

471
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
And he's mad about G Gordon Liddy

472
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Right

473
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,368
Gordon lady

474
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,392
Is on the radio

475
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,184
Brightness guy calls in

476
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,024
I like how does it feel to be on a station that's full of censorship

477
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,352
And people

478
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:14,752
Better about G Gordon Liddy sure

479
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:20,384
What's the farthest they won't have Alex's show on there are proof

480
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,432
Alex understands that this kind of thing

481
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Is not censorship

482
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:27,552
Mister lady

483
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,976
I'll just wanted him to know that time

484
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,768
He was on the radio station

485
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,096
That would not allow your program to go on the air

486
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,144
All you talk about me

487
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
No I

488
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
That he was on a

489
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:52,896
Station that would not allow your program on the air

490
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
I wanted to get his feelings about that

491
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,760
Is alive and well

492
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,808
Islanders country we know.

493
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
Call format

494
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Local

495
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
Program

496
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,024
Lahore

497
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
Well you won't

498
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,408
So are saying it would be someone's right have someone on their

499
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Bamiyan certainly heat that seemed spelled out by the comments

500
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,832
Thingy there censorship

501
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
He knows that it's not that

502
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,696
Right leg is it if you have an internet platform that

503
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
You know you own

504
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:17,120
Right and you don't want somebody on there is a real piece of s***

505
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:22,240
You're right there country

506
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Weird

507
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,616
Strange weird

508
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,920
Alex gets it

509
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,712
Conveniently doesn't

510
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
It is almost like they're all making it up as they go along depending on what they think will benefit the most in the exact moment they

511
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:42,208
With no long-term plans whatsoever

512
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,792
So Alex gets another call and this actually charged me quite a bit

513
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
The paper

514
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
And what's Alex's house

515
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
I don't think he does a great job

516
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
But

517
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:06,528
He does do a good job of revealing a very quickly that he has no idea what the person is talking about

518
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,696
I'm writing a paper for my

519
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:17,280
School about the ethical arguments if there is one

520
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,328
Regime change in

521
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,912
Cake on the riots

522
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,728
24-hours there

523
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:29,824
Rehash

524
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
The 19th

525
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,360
53

526
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
CIA

527
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,856
Basically riding in the streets against

528
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,696
President khatami

529
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
Over there and trying to ask

530
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:51,584
The Muslim clerics better

531
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,264
People with incredibly brutal choirboy

532
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:10,784
Fascinating that response is so weird

533
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,904
He starts talking about like the present-day situation in 2003 and Alex

534
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Cut Her Off

535
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,464
And start stalking

536
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,304
You just get the two is talking point

537
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
Like the little bullets that he remembers

538
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
His

539
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,168
Move there

540
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Which she should have

541
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
Called-out immediate

542
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
You know like to talk about that why don't you explain what's going on

543
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
That it was an instant like

544
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
Dude you have no idea what's going on

545
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:46,624
Why don't you explain it for what's going on for the rest of the crowd obviously I know what you're talkin about

546
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,952
But you can explain it better than I could your more eloquent

547
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:56,352
Words for you not to explain it over by your calling in to ask for help with a high school paper

548
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,632
High School paper maybe College

549
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
You could explain it better than I can

550
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:05,568
There are people whose way of engaging is a little more

551
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:06,848
Socratic

552
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
That is something that I would believe from someone

553
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,760
What do you want to use explain what's going cuz then you can

554
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,600
Get a better sense of what their understanding of what's happening it is

555
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,648
Thanking figure out you know

556
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
What do play you'd like to

557
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Take the conversation

558
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
F****** foreign for Alex

559
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,792
He Rambles about everything

560
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,328
He let her talk for

561
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,216
5 seconds before you started talking about the shop

562
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,872
So y'all are also need the citation

563
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,152
What I want that in

564
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
Justice

565
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,968
Sixteen-year-old girl just like

566
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
I am writing a paper about one of the most concert

567
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:52,672
Sequential issues of our day I am going to call into the only man who speak

568
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
Speaks the truth

569
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:57,536
Cuz you can't trust the mainstream media so I'm going to get his take on it

570
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
Could you explain why you don't know and you don't know a f****** thing

571
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,032
Finally this is delusion

572
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
CIA badge

573
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:14,944
Also needs a little citation was on the Galaxy's talked about and it's

574
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
This is not good going to go out

575
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
Question

576
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
I'm I'm kind of right

577
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,648
About the meal times and I was wondering how

578
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
Where can I go to get

579
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,256
Some information on how to connect them to the gillioz

580
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,024
Sprouts

581
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Neocon

582
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:47,200
This is just an editorial article from the Asia times that Alex is telling a student to use as their primary source about the connection between

583
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Leo Strauss

584
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:48,992
Neoconservatism

585
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,088
An a****** teaching the Next Generation to do a bad job

586
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:55,136
I think you make a compelling argument

587
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,672
There's some connection between Strauss

588
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
The leaders of the nyoka

589
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,744
Conservative movement from at least an idea logic

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,512
Legal perspective

591
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
You'll find some overlaps but

592
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,864
You shouldn't rely wholly on the headline of

593
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,400
Op-ed to do so

594
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
Like if you know anything about the sub

595
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Pick your covering Alex should be able to

596
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,496
2.2

597
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,824
If you're a teacher and someone like

598
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Work cited page

599
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,152
Does an editorial like that

600
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
That's not good

601
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:20,992
It is

602
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,528
It is fascinating to notice

603
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,832
Respect any any right-wing

604
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
S******* liberal

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Wing s*******

606
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
Propagandist

607
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,720
Is absolutely going to

608
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,512
To fail any High School

609
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Yes like

610
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,816
Apps any anything

611
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Any

612
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,192
Hold them to the standards that you would hold a high-schooler too if you're doing

613
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,592
They will fail miserably Alex's head 15 years to come up with a bibliography for endgame and if I were in

614
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,384
High School teacher I would throw that of a

615
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,408
Trash

616
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
Get out of here

617
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
To get out of here

618
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,320
Yeah so Alex has another thing he wants a yell at this young lady about

619
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:00,416
Where he can prove that needle cons are actually communist

620
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
But you can find

621
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,816
Infowars.com

622
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,496
Walk The Halls in the White House

623
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,968
Thank you very much Alex

624
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,248
You better not really make

625
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,296
All around

626
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
I doubt it

627
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
I am confused yet

628
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,232
Just another iPad

629
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:36,512
Excuse me excuse me child

630
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,816
Where did you get this s*** sweet

631
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
Himself told you to do that

632
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
2003

633
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,776
Who's Alex Alex Jones

634
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,336
Why are you taking his advice

635
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
Dear God

636
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,992
This is just look really awful work being mirrored B being modeled for the

637
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,016
Like it's just

638
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
If they learn

639
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,368
From this like how you're supposed to

640
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
To present your information

641
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
Your work we're doomed

642
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,304
The deflation I heard a tone of deflation in her voice so I would think so

643
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,840
I would suggest that she learned

644
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:14,144
From this experience know not what she was hoping

645
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
And she will not be the last

646
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:19,776
Call her be disappointed by Alex on this episode

647
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:23,872
I'm so Alex bees like you know that teacher of yours

648
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
When you tell him

649
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
The f******

650
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:31,296
Mainstream media has admitted a neocon the communist

651
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,088
Breakout

652
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:54,080
Alex has no idea anything about this teacher and he doesn't know if it's a man he doesn't know it

653
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Did the Lefty

654
00:34:55,616 --> 00:35:01,248
Medication anyone in education does not compute

655
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:06,624
Oh man oh no oh no you showed me an op-ed I've got to

656
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:12,000
But is it is really funny that foundational mess that they they have about their knowledge of like

657
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
He's going to wake up people on the left

658
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
And their examples are always somebody who's like

659
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
I've never paid attention to politics

660
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:23,008
Show me YouTube video

661
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,312
Never somebody is like I

662
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Yeah I have a education

663
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:29,664
Not going to happen

664
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
Oh well

665
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,296
So Alex in the present-day loves Michael Savage

666
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:40,416
Don't talk about it awhile but he the last we heard he loved Michael said

667
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,952
Images of patriot

668
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
Brightness

669
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,304
Turns out 2003 hours

670
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,584
Hey does Michael

671
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,264
Programming

672
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,592
You find out

673
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Yard

674
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,840
So what I would like

675
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Is

676
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,728
Alex to wrestle with or have a discussion about what

677
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,520
Changed about Michael Savage

678
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,056
Between 2003

679
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,360
And what's a 2019

680
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Or

681
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,432
I would like him to have a conversation about what

682
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:40,320
He misread in 2003 and how wrong you was about Michael Savage being a wolf in sheep

683
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Clothing in it

684
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,392
A greasy hippie

685
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:46,720
I've never considered Michael Savage

686
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,304
I wrote it down a dirty oily slimy

687
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
He was

688
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,400
He was a beatnik kind of guy or Lyon

689
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:58,240
The 60s and 70s

690
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,288
I don't I don't get that into that

691
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,128
No he was hanging out with like Ginsburg

692
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,456
Wayback

693
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,016
Alex Azar

694
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,064
Like that piece of his history makes him

695
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,600
Dirty beatnik

696
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
But it's like a

697
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:20,256
So I wouldn't he wouldn't like to find out very well house

698
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,352
Beatniks especially the ones that were involved they're all kind of

699
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,376
Wound up being

700
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Nut bag

701
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,936
Interesting

702
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,216
So

703
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:32,800
Alex habit paper and

704
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,848
I think you realize like what happened

705
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,872
Pretended I was going to talk

706
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:43,040
Better figure out what I'm going to do and here is a great prediction on Alex's bar about what's going to happen in a run

707
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Now

708
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Call

709
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,544
Literal monarch

710
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
And now the fool again

711
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
I'm free lunches now

712
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,696
That's interesting I don't think this has come to pass

713
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:28,352
At this point the relatives of the shop come back in new monarchy

714
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,144
Like a King Arthur

715
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,448
Situation I imagine

716
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:35,264
Alright then like

717
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,800
All other news

718
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:38,592
Media stuff you use always

719
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:39,616
Is right

720
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:41,920
It's real tough to go from

721
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:43,200
Theocracy

722
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
Back

723
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
To a monarch

724
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,016
You know

725
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:49,600
Theocracy the religious people don't like going back to him and I

726
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
Monarchy

727
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,512
No not only a few years away from coming in

728
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:58,048
I was going to deal with that

729
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,072
Free election

730
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,656
So Alex just worried about everything

731
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,448
So so right

732
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
I don't know how he nailed this predict

733
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
But it was just

734
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
Spectacular

735
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:12,640
And they want to put my nose and now they have

736
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,920
Credit card as well

737
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:15,968
Real quick you talking about driver's

738
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,560
Work

739
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Yeah man

740
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:54,624
Mommy needs

741
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,928
I don't know how he was so ahead of his time

742
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,512
I love that I want more conversation

743
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,912
With collars like that where he's like they're going to do this whole thing with computer chips that I got to put in there

744
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:08,448
The Meltdown

745
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:14,080
To melt Those computer chips and you can put it in a microwave

746
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:20,480
Okay you can go through their butts

747
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:24,832
Just called

748
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,112
Also

749
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,392
Find this

750
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
To be stupid

751
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,048
Well one big reason is like at this point Alex

752
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,352
Is less talking about the devil

753
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:39,680
Being the big bad guy and it's the banks

754
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,960
Are the big bad guys

755
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,008
Why the f*** would the bank

756
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:49,152
Thanks destroy their own industry in order to make all state IDs credit card

757
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:55,808
Ruin the entire basis of their financial power

758
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,832
Realize it's about

759
00:40:57,088 --> 00:41:01,184
Power turns into power but we you when you have power you don't need money

760
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:04,000
Do you do

761
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
Are interconnected in a certain sub

762
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,608
You might say that

763
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,936
Yeah just feel like this

764
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:14,496
This era of the Schofield little bit more like

765
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
Sci-fi dystopia

766
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
We thought out

767
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:21,408
Scheme

768
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,504
Describe this app

769
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784

770
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,832
And like all right if I was going to torture

771
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:29,856
Everybody how would I do

772
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:33,184
Villains acting against their self-interest

773
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:40,096
So Alex gets another collar this guy has a great

774
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120

Computer addicted run off.

794
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,959

Floppy disk

812
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
The Farms

813
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:05,247
Okay

814
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:10,623
That's not what I was asking

815
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
Classic

816
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:17,279
Classic moves by people

817
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,095
Why don't you explain it and now we've also got the like

818
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,143
Look I'm just too busy

819
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:24,447
Can I can I ask

820
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,775
Also who the f*** are all these people they're interviewing Alex

821
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
TV shows on at the same day

822
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:40,575
Actually this busy into that he would love to put all of these World shattering

823
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,647
Floppy disk out then sell them to this guy

824
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
Haha

825
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
He's just

826
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,791
Very very very sincerely argue

827
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
732 that if Alex was

828
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:56,959
Sincere about what he was doing his State admission what do you

829
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,983
Pretending to be

830
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,263
Give the moral obligation

831
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,079
To make this floppy disk

832
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
Because if what

833
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:05,407
Keep saying is accurate

834
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Then everyone must

835
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
No

836
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,039
Do you know what I mean

837
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,831
And if this is the proof

838
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
Right

839
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,159
And the proof needs to be seen by everybody

840
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:18,975
The problem with that is once you reveal your proof

841
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:20,255
You review

842
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
What can be critiqued right

843
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,703
Once you lay your proof on the table if someone like Dan can come along

844
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,567
See this service representative

845
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:37,151
CU this is what happens when I pull myself out here

846
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
Damn shows up and makes me look like a fool had a 30-year long careers

847
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,575
I don't want to be a jerk

848
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,599
I want to be a jerk

849
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:50,207
And like honestly I be on your team if your first mention anything I really would

850
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:54,815

Okay. I hate those funeral order

852
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
Conditional love is what I get from you

853
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,263
Not love

854
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,079
You're mistaking believing and love

855
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:12,223
I don't think unconditional believe in his effort healthy

856
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:18,879
Let me know you're not for this place get out of here you're going to need to see your computer tonight

Shoestring budget here you know I'm paycheck-to-paycheck

And that's why you need to take something like this conversation like this it has been thoroughly embarrassing

901
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:56,063
And turn it into a money-making proposition

The solution is always something

That will benefit Alex within his Revenue

910
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
That is just

911
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,047
The direction that ship goes

912
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,607

With this collar he like

00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,471
I don't

917
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
Like I haven't seen nothing I would agree with

918
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,031

919
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,335
This color believes

920
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:51,871
But I do think

921
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,455
Did from everything that they're bringing to the table and everything

922
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
The way the conversation

923
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,015
Amtrak's

924
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:00,319
I think they're being sincere

925
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:02,879
Yeah yeah I know there's and that's why I

926
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,671
I hate it more than everything else is because he

927
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:11,071
He's coming with a certain level-headed monotone credibility to own a voice is like

928
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
Listen I believe you

929
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,143
I just want to

930
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
Get everything I want to do what's best

931
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:21,055
Tour the Infowars

932
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
I'll leave early

933
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Sure

934
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,711
And I just need these tools for how my supposed to get these manuals

935
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
But you have

936
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
And it's just sad

937
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:36,159
I've got that is sad that is that is one of those ultimate like

938
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,951
If that guy didn't lose cops

939
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
Copyright law

940
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,071
If that guy didn't lose confidence with that then your urine out

941
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,863
Screw forever because that's

942
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,167
Meet Your Heroes level of like

943
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:52,031
Oh no you're a you're a massive disappointment aren't you

944
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:58,943
So Alex gets back to the story about the family in Waltham Massachusetts and we can finally get some details on that

945
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:34,783
This is almost two hours into the show now where Alex finally gives details about the story that he started the show

946
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Show talking about

947
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,623
So it's going to this family guy got in trouble as they want

948
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Sure

949
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Seems like

950
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:43,487
On the second telling there's an additional

951
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,631
Bit of information there's some more details of the people's names and like you can just

952
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,703
Search for these sentences that he's cold reading you can find

953
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,239
He's talking about

954
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,519
Hit pretty hard to find

955
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:58,335
The actual article that Alex's reading but you can find the text

956
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:01,663
Copy and paste it on all kinds of right-wing message boards

957
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,247
Hopefully run mid-june 2003 right with this episode of therein

958
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
Alright if I had the gas I would say that

959
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:09,343
Probably just reporting this trade-off

960
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:10,367
15.com

961
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,671
The most full version of this article I can

962
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,463
Can find is on three republics message

963
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,279
Bored and I don't think that this is a real

964
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,559
Article

965
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,887
I mean I think it might be a real article but it's possibly like

966
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,191
I don't know how much of this is

967
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:29,311
Is it apocryphal kind of like that Meme where the soldiers in the

968
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:31,103
Professor's classroom

969
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:32,639
Professor says something Soldier

970
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,407
Stand up

971
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,455
I love America and the professor like

972
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,223
750 bucks

973
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,831
Have you ever seen those memes no it's the same thing

974
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,159
So what I'm talking about is this article quotes

975
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:47,999
The department of social service worker named Susan escovitch

976
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,815
We have legal custody of the

977
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,375
The children and we will do with them as we see fit

978
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:55,935
They are miners and they will do we tell him to

979
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:02,079
Okay I absolutely do not believe that's a quote but it's presented as such in this article

980
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,639
But if you look closely you'll see that this quote

981
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,967
What is actually the inner being reported in this article

982
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,247
Actually a second hand

983
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,391
No that's not a quote from eskovitz that was relayed to the reporter by the

984
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:18,463
The family but is being included in the article as if it's a quote

985
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:24,607
Presentation of the story

986
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,423
Do you think the family might have had like a

987
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:29,983
But I don't know maybe like a personal interest that might

988
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:33,823
Colored perhaps everyday

989
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
Quote

990
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,895
Yeah and it may have also it like it

991
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
The article might be a little bit one-sided

992
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:46,623
As best as I can tell this was one in a long string of incidents involving this family's approach to homeschooling

993
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,743
Apparently the district that they lived in the school district their policy about homeschooling requires that

994
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
The educational plans be filed

995
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,607
But there is a set grading system in place for the students

996
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:58,655
Two things that this family refused

997
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
Comply with

998
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,447
According to the art

999
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,359
So are also currently article Terrence lost legal custody of the children in 2001 but it doesn't say what

1000
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:09,663
For exactly an overall business

1001
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:16,319
And it's not just about attached I'm really I said it was about a test I was like let's see what

1002
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:18,111
Happens but now I'm starting to guess

1003
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
But there's more than

1004
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:23,231
What maybe the colonel of the present story has to do with this test Friday

1005
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,767
It's not about that

1006
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:29,119
What's going on is a much larger situation that

1007
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:35,519
You know a lot of that context the stuff that fills in the picture is stuff that Alex has conveniently

1008
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,287
We ignore it

1009
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,823
Because this story is Lupron

1010
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,151
For him and actually looking at the details and Reporting out the story

1011
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,175
As it exists

1012
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,223
How to make a less useful prop

1013
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,015
Yeah yeah

1014
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,319
They don't seem like the most sympathetic Heroes that

1015
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:49,087
But he's trying to pay

1016
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,135
Yeah and

1017
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:53,439
You know it mean it's just so predictable like

1018
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,719
Alex

1019
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,767
Read through the story of us

1020
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
Decline with it

1021
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
It's fine

1022
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
Larry it again

1023
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,439
We will do and Emily

1024
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,167
AR

1025
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,311
Close close

1026
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:46,431
I like that the clothes quote was still in the DS liquor with you

1027
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:53,087
That's commitment to the bed

1028
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,647
Spell probably

1029
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,719
Close

1030
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Cold

1031
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,535
Make sure you quote

1032
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:08,959
One of the things that's so important now we know why he did The Voice

1033
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,543
That has been cleared up but isn't

1034
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:14,079
It is nice to know now

1035
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:16,895
The only part of the story that he can

1036
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
Youi really latches onto inserted

1037
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:21,759
Can can really bring to life is this quote

1038
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,039
That the second hand thing

1039
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,183
It's just

1040
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:30,719
Trash this is just bad

1041
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:32,255
Yeah yeah this is

1042
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,791
This is that level of

1043
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,351
Dispute that you find on lyca

1044
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Did Judge Judy

1045
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
Episode where

1046
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:40,703
They're like telling you the story about moskovitz

1047
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Cement Judge Judy ass like 3 Quest

1048
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,567
And and I like okay well maybe she didn't say

1049
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,639
Maybe she didn't say exact

1050
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:54,783
Actually asked if you know maybe she didn't say that it word for word

1051
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,879
I find this

1052
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,671
Tubi

1053
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:05,535
Alex's Nisha is like at this point I mean you just fines like a couple of headlines

1054
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,863
And Rambles about them sometimes does some characters

1055
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
Easy job

1056
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,215
It's pretty sweet that's nice

1057
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,263
All you're doing is

1058
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,103
TV interviews and avoiding work that could help people on us

1059
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,919
If I were him I might have stayed right in that sweet Paca

1060
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,759
Sweetie

1061
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:29,087
Like Icarus he flew too close to the Sun with all those Upland

1062
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:37,791
Story it is actually the story that he was talking about earlier which is there as headlines about the shooting

1063
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
It schools

1064
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
By the SWAT teams

1065
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
Two stories today okay

1066
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,679
You got one

1067
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,351
Grill on

1068
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Brandon

1069
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,271
Fort Worth

1070
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
So again

1071
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,887
I find some of the details definitely wrong

1072
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
About to pass drills that Alex

1073
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
Does talking about and

1074
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,495
Some of them

1075
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,519
Questionable

1076
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,055
I'm not entirely sure

1077
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,103
And also for this drill

1078
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,383
That in the Florida

1079
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,967
I couldn't get a sense of if there were kids

1080
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,527
Around at all again it's during the summer

1081
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,807
Right so like

1082
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,367
I think I mean if the SWAT

1083
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
Teams ran in

1084
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:14,047
Started blowing children away and themselves then yes there would have had to be kids there in the article about

1085
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:17,887
This Florida drill there's a reference to the football coach who was having a

1086
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:21,215
Kamp-rite he couldn't he didn't even hear the gunshot

1087
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,799
So presumably there's like a summer football camp what's going on

1088
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:29,407
Outside in a way and maybe there is there in some areas

1089
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,199
The school where they're nobody nobody is at

1090
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
Yeah one of their guns went off

1091
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Because they didn't

1092
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,599
Yaki The holster empty the chamber without going into the wall

1093
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,367
Like

1094
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,183
Obviously awful and bad but not

1095
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:43,487
Rising to the level that Alex's

1096
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:50,911
It was not SWAT teams going in and blowing everyone and themselves away

1097
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,983
Dumb way to talk about this

1098
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:59,359
Alex gets another call and

1099
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:00,639
On the show

1100
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,943
Track that

1101
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
International

1102
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,367
Remember that article about a wolf

1103
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
In World War I

1104
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:14,719
That's still available your website you have any idea

1105
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Okay

1106
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
Wow

1107
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:26,751
What I like that

1108
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,543
Go

1109
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,591
Yeah

1110
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:36,991
I think he might have had a better answer if he hadn't have dealt with this same kind of thing twice on the ticket

1111
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:41,855
Dollars and eating some kind of like a what are you talkin about

1112
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,159
Look copyright law

1113
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Honestly

1114
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
I bet

1115
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,999
He remembers the show

1116
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:52,351
Three colors asking him for documents

1117
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:58,751
That must have been his worst show in the history of the world pretty nuts cuz it doesn't happen that often

1118
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:00,031
Specific day

1119
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,079
Is it that has nightmares about it

1120
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,431
People won't stop asking me for proof

1121
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,527
I find it interesting that he's hung up on copyright law when

1122
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:15,391
He without permission reposts other people's new stories on Infowars

1123
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,695
Andre headlines them

1124
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:24,095
He's paying them and exposure

1125
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:29,983
Pay the global is her exposure in a lawsuit

1126
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:34,847
Yeah 1998's very unconvincing

1127
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,127
Displayed

1128
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,663

1129
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Not good

1130
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:41,503
I'm not going to get over

1131
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
That dude was like oh well copy

1132
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:50,719
That was the one where he was like wow that bit that's International

1133
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,535
These people believe in weird

1134
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,815
Intractable laws

1135
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,167
For some reason maritime

1136
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:02,751
I would like it if Alex's was like alright

1137
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,055
The copyright law thing didn't work and then he just yells

1138
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,871
Tariffs

1139
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:11,967
CL something

1140
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
Voya request

1141
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:19,647
Yeah we got to the end of this and Alex still waiting on that floppy disk baby let's

1142
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,927
Look at that thing put together

1143
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,487
Microsoft

1144
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,511
That was

1145
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,535
Pretty heavily used in

1146
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,583
In endgame right

1147
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,423
Physical copy of the CD because I don't work anymore

1148
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,007
So yeah we'll be back

1149
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:41,151
You know I think it has episodes a little bit shorter and I've had a little bit of stuff going on this week

1150
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
I've been a little bit

1151
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:48,575
Little bit busy and also Alex impressed days on timeout and I think it's hilarious that to these collars

1152
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:52,159
Keep asking him for his got nothing so good

1153
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,231

01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,967
Not that good drink it before and then round it up

1159

You gotta bring it

1160
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
No

1161
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:23,903
I don't think I can I don't think I can do that. I can't artificially

1162
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,695
Look there might be artificial flavors

1163
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:28,511
I can't be artificial

1164
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:38,751
