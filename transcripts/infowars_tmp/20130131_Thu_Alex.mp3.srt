1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,260
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:19,920
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:37,040
Alex Jones

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,360
ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday the 31st day of January 2013 I am your host

5
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,280
Alex Jones we're going to be here obviously live for the next three hours

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
and each day it just gets more insane

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
Larry Pratt the head of gun owners of America had met on with us in a few

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,880
weeks

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,600
he's going to give us a update on the latest legislative developments that are

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,960
taking place with the attack on the Second Amendment we've got absolutely

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,920
key news in that area

12
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
Homeland Security has advised for confronting mass murderers in their new

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,920
training seminars they say fight back with scissors

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,640
that's right now government all has bodyguards with guns and billionaires

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,360
all have bodyguards with guns and Diane Feinstein has it and people like

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,720
Bloomberg people like Michael Moore but you need to fight back against someone

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,080
with a semi-automatic with scissors so I can't make that up

18
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,760
we've got thousands of Green Berets signing a petition and signing an open

19
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,560
letter to the White House saying we will not be part of taking guns over a

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,080
thousand Green Berets signed letters supporting Second Amendment

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,240
that's all up at our news websites infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,480
I'm going to cover that again next hour when Larry Pratt joins us

23
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,080
I'll get into some of it coming up the next segment Paul Watson's popping in

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,080
because we picked up earlier in the week on a report of a British defense

25
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:12,400
contractor thousands of pages scanned passports British social security

26
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,960
numbers I mean it looked like a real hack or if it was a forgery I mean it

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,640
was like you know writing a five-volume book it looked very accurate and the

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,000
companies come out and said yes it was a real hack but somebody inserted a few

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,160
emails claiming that we were getting offers to help stage a chemical attack

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,800
there in Syria to be blamed on the Syrian government well that fits in with

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,040
Israel saying if we think there's any nerve gas we're gonna start attacking

32
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,800
government facilities because we're worried about rebels getting them rebels

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,360
backed by the West and there's even a libertarian party blog out today saying

34
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,240
Israel and the Syrian opposition strange bedfellows because then as you know

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:02,800
Israel launched a bunch of airstrikes on facilities they claim were transferring

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,680
nerve gas to rebels I mean the last thing Assad would ever do who has no

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,160
history of aggression to outside countries would be to use or give rebels

38
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,240
nerve gas I mean that that's that's the pretext to attack them and then they've

39
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:26,920
said that this is all a setup this has been on going now for quite some time

40
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:33,200
23 months or so that the West has been funding al-qaeda as the leadership and

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,080
several other jihadi groups out of Saudi Arabia Qatar and a few other nations

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,120
against that country and they already of course handed Libya over to al-qaeda I

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,640
mean this is just unprecedented to have the United States NATO France right at

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,360
the head of it and now Israel openly involved trying to knock out the Assad

45
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,680
regime and then al-qaeda will come into command and then meanwhile they're

46
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,160
saying everyone will be fully groped by the TSA the TSA at the Super Bowl and

47
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,800
they're running checkpoints on highways and roads in every major city including

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,680
Austin now as of last week saying because of al-qaeda I mean it is just

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,880
absolute balderdash and they're now converting over from saying well it's for

50
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,680
al-qaeda it's for conservatives libertarians constitutionalists so we

51
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,560
are living in a twilight zone world Russia concerned with Israeli attack in

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,200
Syria reportedly a Russian MIG then went into some Israeli controlled areas until

53
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:42,240
warned off Syria Iran threatened consequences for Israeli strike Israel

54
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
jet blast arms shipment inside Syria that's what the Wall Street Journal just

55
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,320
just just goes with this as if it must be true this is a new level of brazen

you're listening to the Alex Jones show

00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,040
ladies and gentlemen you have got it frontline seats for the open birth of a

95
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,920
planetary fascistic world government that uses socialism at the grassroots to

96
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,840
basically enslave the population like flypaper while an international global

97
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,000
fascist elite writes the world laws and exempts themselves from taxation and

98
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,320
regulation designed to impoverish and destroy middle classes worldwide the

99
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:58,040
ancient enemy of all oligarchs corrupt kings and criminal syndicates is the

100
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,120
independent yeoman farmer that Thomas Jefferson talked about being the key to

101
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,760
any free society the free middle-class independent yeoman farmer has always

102
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,880
been the enemy of tyranny the yeoman farmer in the last hundred and fifty

103
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,640
years since the acceleration of the Industrial Revolution is the middle

104
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,320
class is the shop owner is the business owner is the small factory owner is the

105
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,640
restaurant owner but still the farmer is the number one enemy that's why you've

106
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,960
seen programs to bankrupt and annihilate the family farm now that is incredibly

107
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,320
incredibly rare okay just want to lay out the battle plan of the globalist

108
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,880
here world government is being openly announced again as the solution to all

109
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,840
our problems we're going to get into that incredible Second Amendment

110
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,920
development news some good news some bad news some ugly news and a lot of news in

111
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,400
between that is all coming up today as well Larry Pratt had been on in a few

112
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,080
weeks head of governors of America will get an update at the start of the next

113
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,160
hour constitutional lawyer Ron Paul's chief legal advisor advisor to Congress

114
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,480
Bruce fine was gonna be on yesterday he got stuck in court on an important

115
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
matter he'll be joining us today had been on in about four months to chart

116
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,760
the incredibly draconian developments that we've seen just since he was last

117
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,840
on I guess about three months ago so that is coming up as well just bizarro

118
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,960
announcements by Homeland Security on the Second Amendment here's one of them

119
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,680
Homeland Security has advice for confronting mass murderers scissors not

120
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,680
firearms you can't make that up we got a link to that New York Post article up at

121
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,920
info wars calm and prison planet calm obviously we're also going to get in to

122
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,480
a story out of ABC News that when I saw it I instantly thought of Spaceballs

123
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,440
where they have the canned air the president of the planet's baseball and

124
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,360
and he's telling the media oh no there's no air shortage don't worry and then he

125
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:09,000
opens a can of air they're now selling cans of air in Beijing because the air

126
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,520
has never been this bad except in 1954 now again folks the jet stream of China

127
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,360
blows right across the Midwest and dumps in over the United States and that's why

128
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,520
people are sick all over the Midwest okay there's major university studies on

129
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,960
it I'm going to pull them up again and do a report on that soon because the

130
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,400
media is not picking up on this they're saying we've got to shut down basically

131
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,360
everybody's cars factories you name it that are totally clean in many cases

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,040
because the particulate is going off the chart from from the worst area is from

133
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,680
about New Mexico over to Mississippi and then right up to as far north as

134
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,520
Chicago that's where that main jet stream dumps in it comes into about a

135
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,280
thousand feet over mainland China if you look on the globe we're lined up with

136
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:04,080
China the Midwest is and then it comes in and dumps in right over right over

137
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,760
the Midwest and right over Texas it's just that's what's going on that's why

138
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,600
everybody's so sick and China is just there's no controls there I saw an

139
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,120
article where their biggest river was bright red the other day it was so toxic

140
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,680
every week a major river set on fire there's there's there's hundreds of

141
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,680
riots a week by the people rebelling there's suicide nets being put up at

142
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,080
hundreds of factories people are finding any tall building and jumping off I mean

143
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:35,600
it is just cuckoo land over there and we are competing with that

144
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,320
they're kicking the Chinese off all their rural area where they were happy

145
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,800
and providing food for themselves and forcing them into compact cities they

146
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,720
chain their kids to power poles and then go in and work in the factories all day

147
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,640
now we're not going to compete with that there's no way and they're bringing more

148
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:57,720
regulations in on us we're done that's the plan totally shut us down now all of

149
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,720
that and I'm gonna get to it after Paul Watson leaves us at the bottom of the

150
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,480
hour all of that pales in significance there's something right out of biblical

151
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,920
revelation right out of the Bible where you've got Russia that's described by

152
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,960
the ancient name and Syria described by its ancient name Syria in a war with

153
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,160
Israel I mean this listen the Russians according to Israeli press we're going

154
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,880
to get into that sent fighter jets into the Israeli border the Russians are

155
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,040
saying they may respond openly the biggest part of the Russian fleet is

156
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,200
right off the coast one ship alone 2,000 Marines this is a 23 month proxy war

157
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,480
with the bankers that run America NATO and now Israel Turkey's the main

158
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,040
staging ground with u.s. bases training al-qaeda using heavy artillery to sweep

159
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,320
areas to insert more al-qaeda al-qaeda is cutting Christians heads off burning

160
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
churches Assad is no angel but compared to al-qaeda he is an angel he's never

161
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,280
attacked outside countries but he's not part of the New World Order his dad

162
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,760
wasn't more of a tyrant he's been probably ten times better than his dad

163
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,000
the point is this is a war crime being committed by the West but we're run by

164
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,720
the globalist and they have put al-qaeda in Libya they have now are trying to

165
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
take over Syria and Syria is fighting back with the Russians and again the

166
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,840
Russians are corrupt in their own way but they are not expanding worldwide

167
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,900
they're not launching 30,000 drones worldwide and 30,000 domestically they

168
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,440
want the next 10 years they're not putting cancer viruses in their vaccines

169
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,100
they're paying people to have children in Russia because they openly say we

170
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,400
were under eugenics under the Soviets it's even in Pravda that used to be

171
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,120
known for lying that the New World Order is running things the communists were

172
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,560
financed by Western banks to reduce our population the Russians at least part of

173
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,200
the Russian hierarchy who's also corrupt understands the program and they're to

174
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,600
be taken out as well but again I'm not again Israel's upon in this this is a

175
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,200
master game ladies and gentlemen and here's some of the headlines Russia

176
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,560
concerned with Israeli attack in Syria claiming chemical weapons we told you a

177
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:12,840
year ago they try to claim they had chemical weapons that we're going to use

178
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,160
them and they say rebels may get chemical weapons so we have to attack

179
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,200
them when the rebels and this whole conflict were started by the West

180
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,660
remember the first six months they called them peaceful protesters blowing

181
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,360
up police stations I mean this is so immoral that's why they've had so many

182
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,880
members of CENTCOM including the head of it being fired because they're not

183
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,200
going along with this our government gave weapons to al-qaeda and made them

184
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,560
the head of security in Benghazi they're the ones that killed the ambassador and

185
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,160
then and and the Pentagon was told to stand down for eight hours and not send

186
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,040
aid that was a mile down the street they had three drones overhead well one

187
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,840
manned gunship two drones that was a stand down that was a that was a hit why

188
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,760
why the White House wanted al-qaeda to kill the ambassador he was there

189
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,300
reportedly transferring the missiles maybe they want to get rid of how

190
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,520
al-qaeda is getting 10,000 heat seekers because when the al-qaeda blows up jet

191
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,160
airliners folks in Europe and here and all and it's already started in the

192
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,600
Middle East when they start shooting down jet airliners they're gonna have TSA

193
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,760
on the street and when the TSA wants to search my car I'm gonna say you are part

194
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,200
of the terrorists that armed al-qaeda you will not search my car I want to

195
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,600
search you I'm not playing this game anymore

196
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,640
Syria Iran's written consequences for Israeli strike there's that report

197
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,800
Jerusalem Post Israeli jets blast arms shipment inside Syria the West is now

200
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,120
another headline Israel attacks strange bedfellows on Syria LCR blog wise

201
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,000
Israel funding al-qaeda now Russia slams Israeli attack on Syria u.s. forces in

Jordan on alert debkah file Israel attack desperate bid to save failed

203
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:10,560
Syrian campaign yeah they want to get Iran and Syria to respond so they have a

204
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,320
preemie this is so incredible we I take you now to London and Paul Joseph Watson

205
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,000
who but with us this segment the next Paul you have been on top of this on top

206
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,480
in the last week saying there's gonna be a stage chemical weapon strike now it's

207
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,840
all happening what's happening Paul Watson

208
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:32,240
well good to be back Alex yeah there's still debate and argument about what

209
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,080
exactly the target of this Israeli air strike was because the Western media is

210
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,720
saying that it was this arms convoy that was traveling from Syria into Lebanon

211
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,120
for Hezbollah but the Syrians are saying that the actual target that was hit was

212
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,560
a weapons facility in a place called Jamraiya I'm not sure about the

213
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,040
pronunciation Debkah file that's basically Mossad is saying the same

214
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,120
thing but the two targets are far away from each other the web the supposed

215
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:08,400
weapons shipment was on the Lebanon border whereas Jamraiya is near

216
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,680
Damascus so it's a completely different geographical area so Israel hasn't even

217
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,360
admitted that they've committed any kind of air strike so far it's multiple saying

218
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:24,520
that it was a weapons facility and that it turns out that this facility is

219
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,320
engaged in long-range missile research so it looks like the Israelis have just

220
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,720
used an excuse created this lie about weapon shipments to target a facility

221
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
which was engaged in this cutting-edge research which might have been used to

222
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,280
target Israel at some point in the future and bottom line we have the

223
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,120
spectacle of 23 month attack by the West with al-qaeda and now even the LCR blog

224
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,560
the libertarians are saying why is Israel helping al-qaeda well it's

225
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,280
amazing isn't it because we had this story come out a couple of hours ago

226
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,560
Syria may respond to Israeli air strike says ambassador and everybody's freaking

227
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,520
out because they might defend themselves they might fight back so I I put the

228
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,480
comment out you know imagine if Syrian fighter jets attacked targets inside

229
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,400
Israel there'd be instant international condemnation be nuclear warm yeah I mean

230
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,920
Obama couldn't send the f-16s to bomb Syria quick enough cutting no they knew

231
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,840
come they'd nuke them yeah but Israel targets Syria complete violation of

232
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,640
their sovereignty and hardly anyone bats an eyelid and it's just like oh yeah

233
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,080
that's par for the and Syria took it and the media is like how dare you you we

234
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,760
bombed you you that's violent what you did I mean it's just la la land level

235
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,840
la la land stay there I want to get in when we come back to this report you put

all right we're back live Alex Jones here Paul Watson joining us from London

286
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:27,080
Paul you did a story what was it on Tuesday was it Monday well break that

287
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,400
down they got picked up by a bunch of British newspapers like the Daily Mail

288
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,320
they didn't do a retraction they just pulled the whole article what yesterday

289
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,440
when the British defense contractor that you contacted on Monday you know for

290
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,760
comment finally responded but to the Russian national news saying look we did

291
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,040
get hacked the thousands of pages of documents scans of passports that's why

292
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,360
we said it looked like a real hack but we pointed out could be that somebody

293
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,520
inserted fake stuff into the hack they're saying the emails where they're

294
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,000
discussing a staged chemical event which has been discussed by the news

295
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:09,040
everywhere that they were contacted by Qatar to be part of this and that they

296
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:14,160
had said no we don't want to be part of it now again sounds like something the

297
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,720
Russians would do hack it then add BS to it or it could be real Paul Watson

298
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,960
describe what was in there the plan to stage a chemical attack and then blame

299
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,320
it on the Syrians because that fits into everything we saw lining up this week

300
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,920
well I mean for months we've been tracking this plan to stage a false

301
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,440
humanitarian crisis the chemical weapons attack because Obama you know Francois

302
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,720
Holland all the NATO people have made it clear on several occasions that that is

303
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,040
quote their red line on direct military intervention in Syria so that's all they

304
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,960
need to justify it in their eyes so we were tracking it for six to eight months

305
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,480
before this all came out and then at the end of this last week it was a German

306
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,720
hacker that hacked into Britam defense which is basically a defense contractor

307
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,760
in their denial that these emails were real they claimed they were merely a

308
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,120
commercial outfit well if they've got information about their activities in

309
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,960
Iran and that was only commercial and that would be illegal because it's

310
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,200
illegal to do business in Iran they've got mercenaries in Iraq they work

311
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,720
directly with British Special Forces so their claim that they're only a

312
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:38,440
commercial company that advises people smacks of dishonesty is to my mind but

313
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:43,920
yeah they left it simmering for days this email communication supposedly

314
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,160
between the founder and the business director of this Britam defense

315
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,080
organization which talked about the Qataris proposing a deal which was quote

316
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,200
approved by Washington to basically deliver a chemical weapon to Syria that

317
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,400
was similar to the ones that Assad has and the implication was obviously to

318
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,320
blame it on the Assad government so they came out they let it simmer for days

319
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,400
they came out yesterday to voice of Russia because it was a big story in

320
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,480
Russia and said basically yes we were hacked these these all these documents

321
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,480
PDF files Word documents scans of passports they're all true but these

322
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,640
emails are false they're hoaxes and it is a potential that they are hoaxes

323
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:31,960
because the time stamps on two of the emails are the same the dates are

324
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,440
different but the time stamps are exactly the same which leads you to

325
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,800
wonder why would a hacker go to all that trouble and then leave the time stamps

326
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,120
the same and leave a red herring for people to later discover that it was a

327
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,480
hoax so whether it was the hack was not a hoax it was genuine and there's a lot

328
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,760
of documents in there but they're saying now that the emails were a hoax and

329
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,360
that's probably why the Daily Mail pulled it but as you said they should

330
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,960
have just issued a retraction I mean we added to our story that denial by

331
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,400
Britam that the emails were real but it's you know it's very interesting

332
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:16,680
Paul I mean this is this is so over-the-top I don't have words to

333
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,000
describe how insane it is to have the whole world including Israel ganging up

334
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,360
on Syria who's done nothing to to to massacre Christians and Muslim

335
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,320
minorities to put al-qaeda in and they've taken about a third of the

336
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,640
country and shoot mass rally videos where they say we blew up your towers

337
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,160
we're going to attack America after Syria and then the government you know

338
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,680
stages Benghazi and kills the ambassador and I mean it's just what's coming next

339
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:50,260
why is the government so mad dog arrogant I mean in the past they would

340
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,960
try to cover stuff up like this what what is going on why are they so

341
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,400
arrogant well because they know most people don't pay attention I mean when

342
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,160
they came they're trying to differentiate the terrorists like al-nusrah

343
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,200
the al-qaeda groups have killed us troops in Syria and the rebels like

344
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,520
they're different organizations when as soon as the u.s. designated al-nusrah as

345
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:19,040
a terrorist organization the 29 other Syrian rebel groups immediately came out

346
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,360
and pledged their allegiance to al-nusrah so they were saying yes where

347
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,920
with the terrorists then as the New York Times admits al-nusrah the terrorist

348
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,560
group coordinates all the bombings leads all the rebel groups it's the commanding

349
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,880
force in Syria so you can't differentiate it and say oh we need to

350
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,200
go into Syria to get al-qaeda in support of the rebels because the rebels are

351
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,800
al-qaeda they're all basically one group they've pledged allegiance to each other

352
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,880
all right Paul stay there do five more minutes with us I want to see where you

396
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,480
on the Second Amendment another Mazzaro behavior by the kleptocrats who who

397
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,640
openly have introduced bills at the state and federal level that are the

398
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:40,360
main bills and in the Feinstein case where the government officials not

399
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,480
servants are all exempt and can have whatever guns they want but we've got a

400
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,360
register ours and turn them in of the ATF feels like it I mean just absolutely

401
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,880
incredible and it doesn't really translate well on radio because it's

402
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:02,280
visual but MSNBC has been caught again just like with Trayvon Martin and

403
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:07,560
they're getting sued where George Zimmerman in the 9-1-1 call is like okay

404
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,540
the guys looking around walking around by cars what's he look like looks like a

405
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:18,320
teenager we've heard the tape he's wearing a hoodie he's walking around and

406
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,520
they asked him well well well what color is he looks like he's black well they

407
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,560
edited it to yeah there's a guy walking around looks like he's black and then

408
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,160
went on and said looks like he's black can you believe the racism of this

409
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,200
cracker they now say that all the time on MSNBC cracker Southerners are trash

410
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,440
white people are bad and it's white people saying this Chris Matthews and

411
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,740
Carlos Watson and that woman yesterday said it what's her name Finn Finney

412
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,200
Finney yeah these crackers you know these old crackers and you even got

413
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:55,640
Jindal you know the Republican governor going yeah these old white men are the

414
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,680
problem I mean again you're like well wait a

415
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,240
minute I mean whites have intermarried totally embraced political correctness

416
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,640
you know agreed that we're the worst people on earth and now we're told we're

417
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,160
the cause of all folks it's it's racial division the system wants racial

418
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,280
division and so this will make white people very racist and very suspicious

419
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,520
because they haven't been racist or suspicious

420
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,160
believe me I'm white folks I know okay I grew up the supposed south okay whites

421
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,520
totally bought the full guilt deal even though you know young whites had

422
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,080
nothing to do with any of this stuff there's been all sorts of oppression

423
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,320
throughout history they give a victim identity to the system they give a

424
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,920
victim identity to to impoverish and control and manipulate quote minorities

425
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,000
so they're under government control while their futures being destroyed

426
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,800
whites are being destroyed we're all being destroyed by the New World Order

427
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,160
we're all having our power prices increased we're all having our payroll

428
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,880
taxes go up we're all having the Social Security money stolen we're all being

429
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,440
screwed but meanwhile CNN and MSNBC are saying cracker white people Southerners

430
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,680
well I'll sharp and we got to overcome the white Southerners I mean it is folks

431
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,640
if white people talk like this it'll be the end of the world but now they go

442
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,400
authoritarianism where they have the moral high ground and then real racism

443
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,140
real real discrimination as the mega banks get 47 trillion dollars of taxpayer

444
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,180
money the last five years plus that's an old number and sign us on to 1.5 global

445
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,800
quadrillion in fake derivatives oh no no that's discriminatory having our

446
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,400
factories all shipped to China India and Mexico which doesn't even help those

447
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,760
people because it's so horrible they're living in you know dormitories where

448
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,440
they have forced abortions and suicide nets and hundred square feet per person

449
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,520
I mean it is it is insane the Chinese sky is so toxic it catches on fire

450
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,680
sometimes the rivers catch on fire they're having canned air we have the

451
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,440
canned air clip people aren't gonna believe this okay I'm gonna go back to

Paul Watson to finish up on the Syria issue but here it is China's filthy air

453
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:39,120
prompts mask rush and sale of fresh air in cans ABC News I'm not joking for the

454
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:43,360
fourth time this year a murky haze is descended over North China leaving

455
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,960
residents of Beijing choking on toxic smog China's air hasn't been this bad

456
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,240
since 1954 according to the state-run People's Daily because the winds have

457
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,600
kind of slowed down the prevailing winds the trade winds and above those the well

458
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:01,040
they're all prevailing winds but the the jet stream don't worry it's all coming

459
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,720
to the US anyways for whatever weird reason we're bound to China and we get

460
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,200
there of their smog the globalist smog but all there's no calls to clean that

461
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,280
up the globalists are using them having no environmental standards to leverage

462
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,040
out the West nobody can compete bankrupt everything oh I talked to Austinites

463
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:26,560
every couple days I ran into a guy last night just getting gas where he's got a

464
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,440
kombucha microbrew very popular I've actually heard of it well he's actually

465
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,360
connected one of our graphics people that's how he knew me but and he's had

466
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,240
to move out to Hays County because Austin would not let him would not let

467
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:50,400
him I'm gonna say that again would not let him make kombucha in Austin that

468
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,360
they just harassed him it's you can't build anything in Austin now unless

469
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,680
you're an insider globalist we're the model of this whole country just like

470
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,320
the Jersey coast nobody's allowed to rebuild but insiders are saying you

471
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,040
can't rebuild Gen 21 sell your property off ten cents on the dollar to big guys

472
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,920
if you want old family-owned little motels and hotels one of the most

473
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,520
popular destinations on the East Coast very beautiful Jersey Coast one of the

474
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,640
best things about you know New Jersey that people run down and talk bad about

475
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,120
all day Jersey Coast pretty nice you know they got shows about it making fun

476
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:24,960
of it but the point is is that you can't operate Ted Anderson moved out of

477
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
Minneapolis because of the code enforces harassing him I mean it's a radio

478
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,920
network and it's guys on the phone you know brokers selling gold and silver so

479
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,240

480
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,440
to Ted he's got some state agency in his office he says it's not just me

481
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,560
Minnesota's one of the worst he says it's everybody then he bought this big

482
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,760
house that had been up for sale for years that nobody could get near an

483
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,880
industrial park and they said don't worry we're gonna give you the permits

484
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,320
for this to be a business go ahead and move in he buys it he fights him for

485
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,920
four years they harassing they should basically shut him down he moves now

486
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,680
they're saying we're not gonna stop you can't have a business we're not gonna

487
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,600
let you sell it as a house or a business he was what do I do with this big giant

488
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,880
house you know before I had an office park they go hey do whatever you want

489
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,040
and actually laugh at him they want to destroy us they've been given the orders

490
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,740
you understand it's called agenda 21 it's in other big sociological papers

491
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,720
we've broken down for 15 years bankrupting us is the goal it is the

492
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,360
goal they don't want tourism they want nothing I was reading the other day I

493
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,160
was told about it a year ago by Michael's whirling that owns two stations

494
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,200
were on out in California MZ but then I actually saw it in the news where Noah

495
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,280
the Weather Service has now got guns and they go out and arrest surfers if they

496
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,600
get within 50 yards of a whale or a or a or a seal or anything and they're like

497
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,200
wait tourists are coming here to surf they're like we're arresting everybody

498
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,040
they just don't arrest dozens of people every day right off the you know coast

499
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,000
right there in the area that he's in I'm just ranting it's just a total

500
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,400
takeover okay I mean I'm down there at Big Bend watching illegal aliens go back

501
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,640
and forth all day and ride horses on both sides border patrol does nothing

502
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,800
they're ordered to stand down and I watched the park Rangers who most I'd

503
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,080
say hi to him and they would literally not talk to me I shot a video about this

504
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:28,000
one guy I said hi and he goes he was like a big huge guy he actually went

505
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,960
like Hulk Hogan and then I ran into other people who said man we ran into

506
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:35,760
this this guy and I describe they go yeah that's him and they go yeah he you

507
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,520
know we talked to him and he went so imagine hey I do it and then I'm down

508
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,120
there at the hot springs I'm going back to Watson right on the the Rio Grande

509
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,840
watching the illegals go back and forth we have video this we're finally gonna

510
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,440
premiere on the nightly news tonight just we've been so overwhelmed with more

511
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,280
hardcore news and we've got people on horseback riding back and forth broad

512
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,520
daylight and the border patrol is there with the park Rangers I'm sitting there

513
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,480
in the natural hot tub by the Rio Grande just absolutely gorgeous and I feel

514
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,200
somebody looking at me and I look up there's about 15 people in this big hot

515
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,760
tub and there's a there's a park ranger staring right at me like he wants to

516
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,880
kill me and I wasn't drinking we're gonna go on another hike after this we

517
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,880
just been on a long one like a I don't know four miles of a mountain and back

518
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,520
down and I'm sitting there and he's looking at me and I go why is he looking

519
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,600
at me I look over and there's a curves light sitting next to me and a woman in

520
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,920
a red bikini sitting right next to me and he's looking at me like it's mine

521
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,360
and I just knew what he's looking at I went you know the universal thing of my

522
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:44,000
hands like that's not mine and I said to the guys that we got to get out of here

523
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,840
they're about to raid all these people and they said oh no they're not it was

524
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,280
like a bunch of UT lawyer alumni like 40 year old guys out there and with their

525
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,400
girlfriends and and they're throwing a football back and forth they're having a

526
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,520
couple beers and there's a little bitty sound when you drive into that area

527
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:04,160
saying alcohol is not not permitted here a little bitty sound on the entrance

528
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,120
the run us we got to gather I'll call you're being paranoid Rob do and my dad

529
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,240
and others who were with us you're being paranoid and I said no get the stuff I'm

530
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,600
getting out of here I go they now arrest people who haven't even been drinking

531
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,320
I'm got no to get out of here they want to stay 15 more minutes and I didn't

532
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,840
get video this because I had a gut feeling we were gonna get arrested so

533
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,320
we're pulling out all sudden Border Patrol shoots in for the parking lot at

534
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:30,240
the hot springs there this is how crazy this country is I'm thinking oh my gosh

535
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,440
they do something about all the illegals you're right there coming them back and

536
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,440
forth across the border this romantic setting and they start putting body

537
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:45,040
armor on and then two two more park Rangers but the cop type pull up and

538
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:48,640
they're getting armor on and I walk over through a water bottle away in the trash

539
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,560
the recycler they go hey how's it going on what's going on and I'm okay and then

540
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,040
I hear him talking the guard I got my tickets ready you're gonna back me up

541
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:01,320
they're like yeah we're ready to back you up and they proceeded and again I

542
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,840
was on my vacation I'm usually I would have done something I just I can't handle

543
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,560
this anymore I'm like let's get out of here news like I'm getting the GoPro out

544
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:10,640
I mean I brought a camera we'll tape it I'm like no I just can't handle it we

545
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,280
got some of it I just can't handle it anymore man you can't go anywhere and by

546
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,200
the way there were illegals just crossing I talked to locals I said at

547
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,440
night hundreds come across there and get picked up by localities the Border

548
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,600
Patrol is obviously all paid off that's come out on record the citizens are the

549
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,760
target you know the government's arming al-qaeda but UT alumni guys can't have a

550
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,600
couple beers on the Rio Grande while felonies are being committed all around

551
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,920
them and they had big things of tickets rubber hand you know the plastic

552
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,480
handcuffs on their side and and and then we're driving out and more more Border

553
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:46,600
Patrol more guards more park rangers are pulling down the little road you know

554
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,880
the dead ends by the hot springs is like how did you know that I said I saw the

555
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,000
look in his eye man he wasn't about to give tickets the guys too scared he

556
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,200
wasn't about to give tickets to 15 people these guys see us as the enemy

557
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,000
he's not worried about the coyotes going back and forth literally 20 feet from

558
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,080
him I said they're gonna arrest these people

559
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,400
and later I ran into a woman at the lodge that night he said there were a

560
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,000
bunch of tickets being given out one guy was being put in handcuffs I just can't

561
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:17,520
handle it anymore man I can't even go down and just be at a national park I am

562
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,840
the prey I am the food I am the food and I knew I said we're food let's get out

563
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,280
of here I mean I can't handle it anymore I'm sorry Watson I've had John hold

564
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:33,800
finish up with Syria then I'll get into all the other news it's it's it's just

565
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:41,800
getting so bad oh I meant to play this China's filthy air prompts sales of

566
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,920
fresh air cans I mean I guess they got the idea from space balls let's play

567
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,800
that clip and go to Watson here it is planet space ball I can assure both you

568
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,680
and your viewers that there's absolutely no air shortage whatsoever yes of course

569
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,640
I've heard the same rumor myself yes thanks for calling and not reversing the

570
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:09,560
charges yeah bye oops I wanted to bleep that guys I said check it let's bleep

571
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:20,640
that we bleep that John it's a 40-second clip only various huffing out of a

572
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,320
Perrier air can okay there goes the clip we had to bleep part of it as I forgot

573
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,600
there was a cuss word in it okay there you go from space balls Paul Watson

574
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:34,340
going back to you my friend you finish up with the whole serious situation where

575
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,080
do you see it going where I mean they may start nuking Syria and and you know

576
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,680
the videos come out of them cutting Christians heads off and our media is

577
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,280
like the New York Times even praised the al-qaeda rebels and then the public

578
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,820
said boy but those are al-qaeda killing and blowing up churches and the New York

579
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,320
Times pulled the video I mean I guess they really want to sell us on this I

580
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,640
guess they think the public are total jellyfish Paul where do you see this

581
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:04,200
going well they'll end up giving those rebel commanders you know refugee status

582
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,120
in the United States like they did with Iraqis Iraqi terrorists after Gulf War

583
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,120
one that helped the United States and as he said they'll then start attacking the

584
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:18,640
United States and it'll be all forgotten that the United States created arms

585
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,800
funded them in the first place but there's a headline Syrian rebels steal

586
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,120
credit from Israel for attack now they're claiming that they hit the

587
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,800
weapons convoy so it looks like there could have been two separate attacks but

588
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,720
far as where it you know where's where's it going they've said that Assad's fall

589
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,920
is imminent about three times that the rebels are closing in on Damascus I've

590
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,840
literally heard that three or four times within the last year never happens now

591
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,840
it looks like it's a stalemate you know the country's completely destroyed

592
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:56,320
they've got thousands of refugees streaming out into Jordan but the

593
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,840
difference between Libya and Syria is that you know Libya had a 15,000 man

594
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:06,920
army Syria's got something like 150,000 ten times the amount Syria's got an air

595
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,160
defense system which Libya basically had no air defense system but if this

596
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,440
actually happened this incident today and Israel's flown a fighter jet all the

597
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,120
way nearly to Damascus and bombed a weapons facility then how good a Syria's

598
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:26,880
air defense is not very good if you know they can penetrate them with no

599
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,120
resistance whatsoever so that might be a test case for the pro bomber now to

600
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,200
send in the drones and for the fun to begin because obviously that was their

601
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,760
main concern that Syria's air defenses would be too strong and they will

602
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,800
actually get on the news and say how dare the Syrians not nuke themselves I

603
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,120
mean if the Syrians don't March all their kids out to al-qaeda and chop

604
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:52,120
their heads off their bad I mean how immoral has the West become that they're

605
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:57,000
doing this publicly Paul what do you predict coming I think as the Brookings

606
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,120
Institution report from March 2012 said the perfect opportunity for them would

607
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,680
be a massive humanitarian crisis which is already happening but I think they're

608
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,680
going to stage some big event they've already said they're going to do it

609
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,400
whether it be chemical weapons you know babies thrown out of incubators or

610
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,360
whatever some fake prison camp like a fake Serbian death camp that ever

611
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,760
existed they'll try and fake another stage humanitarian crisis and that will

612
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:30,240
be presented as the final straw and then the fun will begin incredible

613
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,440
incredible you heard me rant about all the stuff that's happening it's not even

614
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,560
the tip of the iceberg Homeland Security is officially saying everyone should

615
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:43,440
have scissors in their office or school in case there's a mass shooter that

616
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,760
that's been officially put out on recovering that I mean it's just they're

617
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,120

of people have been driven crazy by a lot of this and they can't differentiate

622
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,440
between fact and fiction but what's really happening is while the

623
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,480
Department of Homeland Security is doing that and saying protect yourself with

624
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,280

planet calm stay with us this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should

634
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,720
consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could

635
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,760
easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar

636
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,640
wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

637
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,680
true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid

638
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:24,080
technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid

639
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,280
is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only

640
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,060
compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

641
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:35,720
local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

642
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,080

643
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,200
insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

644
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,880
generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

688
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:37,240
to the info is while I'm talking about stuff the crew is putting the articles

689
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:42,760
up on screen to document things you know it's radio to the next level and I've

690
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:48,520
been doing this 17 years adding the video and things for about 10 and of

691
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,080
course it's now being duplicated by everyone else which I think is a good

692
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,960
thing it's good to show people what you got show people the facts so I think

693
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:03,000

700
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,960
work into at many levels it's much better than even the radio show that's

701
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,320
why we're playing a lot of the produced pieces here and we come back from break

702
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,400
in that little no-man's land the first five minutes that some stations carry

703
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,520
some don't we're gonna change our clock soon where we don't have that and come

704
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,480
out at 6 after but the point is we're gonna hear Aaron Dykes's report on MSNBC

705
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,520
hoax gun advocates heckled Sandy Hook father and they ran this clip all over

706
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:55,480
the news MSNBC put the hoax out a bunch of other TV networks picked it up all

707
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,160
the Democratic Party organs picked it up saying look at these fathers you know

708
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,780
this poor father lost his child he said you know and then look for no reason

709
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,540
they laugh and heckle at him and say shall not be infringed just out of the

710
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:11,380
blue they interrupt him the father really says can any of you tell me why

711
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,680
we need semi-auto can you and everybody's quiet people go oh yeah a

712
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,160
Second Amendment you know right keep their arms shall not be infringed well

713
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:25,920
they just cut the question out and MSNBC delays their feeds about 15 seconds

714
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:30,600
we've been watching this most TV doesn't do that so they acted like the feed cut

715
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,600
for a minute and then ran with it and even after it came out they said oh no

716
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,120
we're defending it no no that's what he said just like they got caught in Trayvon

717
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,880
Martin editing the tape to have him go yeah it's a guy with a hoodie it's a

718
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,920
black guy they're like what color is the person it looks like he black again

719
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,080
they're being sued over that this is what they think of you this is what they

720
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,800
think about you I mean it I make mistakes sometimes I get up on air and

721
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:00,520
flip a number or say a name wrong and I you know hear it later and I'm like oh

722
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,800
no it wasn't Thomas Jefferson said that it was Benjamin Franklin but most people

723
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,360
don't even catch my mistakes and I make them I hear him I can't stand it but

724
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,440
when you're up here without teleprompters it happens imagine

725
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,020
consciously editing feeds sitting there watching and this is the stuff we're

726
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:21,080
catching and then meanwhile going yeah gun owners are crackers white people

727
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,840
saying that in Al Sharpton yeah we got to overcome the south and whites yeah

728

waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network

744
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:10,360
Aaron Dykes here for info Wars calm now we've seen already how the gun grabbers

745
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,520
will stop at almost nothing to advance their agenda as long as they get to rain

746
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:18,240
in the Second Amendment right because the fact that individuals have rights is

747
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,600
very threatening to any authoritarian government whatever its stripes

748
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,360
political stances or colors but the latest hoax we saw on MSNBC is just

749
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:31,240
incredible they went out of their way to distort gun owners and advocates of the

750
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,560
Second Amendment right who were in testimony Monday with the parents of the

751
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,000
Sandy Hook victims and MSNBC deliberately edited testimony of Neil

752
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,280
Heslin the father of Jesse Lewis as he advocated restricting assault rifles

753
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,560
banning high-capacity clips which is fine you can understand his grief why he

754
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,920
would speak out on that even though I think it's a misguided position I

755
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,800
certainly sympathize with the families who lost children with anyone who's lost

756
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:02,800
children or family members in a tragedy but what's not okay is the way that

757
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,400
Martin Bashir Lawrence O'Donnell and other figures on MSNBC blogs across the

758
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:13,360
internet went with the hoax on purpose where Neil Heslin in the middle of his

759
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:17,760
testimony asked the rhetorical question who of you in this room can answer this

760
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,560
question why does anyone in this room need to have an assault rifle or a high

761
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:28,040
capacity clip and he waits a few seconds there's silence and he says no one can

762
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,280
answer that question in this room and so a number of gun rights advocates who

763
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,000
were there at the hearing spoke up saying that you shall not infringe on

764
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,920
the Second Amendment I asked there's anybody in this room that can give me

765
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:48,480
one reason or challenge this question why anybody in this room needs to have

766
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:53,920
an assault one of these assault-style weapons or military weapons or high

767
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,960
capacity clips

768
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,600
now one person can answer that question

769
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:13,680
all right and what they did was edited this part of the testimony edited out

770
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,520
the part where the father asked the question and just made it look like

771
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,480
people were interrupting this father's testimony who had just had children die

772
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,600
and Sandy Hook and obviously it's very sympathetic moment they were all

773
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,040
entitled to our own opinion and I respect their their opinions and their

774
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:37,760
thoughts but I wish they'd respect mine and give it a little bit of thought a

775
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,840
father's grief interrupted by the cries of a heckler that was the scene today in

776
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,960
Hartford Connecticut where the parents of children killed at Sandy Hook

777
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,920
Elementary testified before an audience that wasn't always friendly deliberately

778
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,440
distorted just like they deliberately out edited the audio of the Trayvon

779
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,400
Martin shooting to make it seem like it was racially motivated when in fact it

780
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,420
turned out that Zimmerman had often worked with the black community he

781
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,160
himself was a mixed race and really race shouldn't have been the main issue of

782
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:11,840
that certainly it's legitimate to question if his death was justified we

783
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:17,180
get that MSNBC is state-run propaganda for the Obama administration just as Fox

784
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:22,200
News was blatantly state propaganda during the George W Bush years and the

785
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,800
next time they roll out of president maybe they'll switch networks again or

786
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,100
maybe MSNBC will continue on its current track I get it what do you expect from a

787
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,800
pig but a grunt but what I don't understand is why they always paint

788
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:37,960
anyone who asks questions anyone who stands up for rights anyone who says

789
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:42,720
that we're being delivered hoaxes in the media to push an agenda why those people

790
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,680
are blamed and why they always say how dare you ask those questions or defend

791
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,600
those rights because of the families who have victims from this tragedy why don't

792
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:56,160
any of the parents from these tragedies whether it's 9-11 or Sandy Hook or any

793
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:01,000
of the Colorado shooting anything why don't they get mad at the establishment

794
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,120
using their tragedy to advance the establishment's agenda it's very clear

795
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:10,200
we know that Feinstein was pursuing the assault weapons ban before the Sandy

796
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,740
Hook shooting it's very clear that Rahm Emanuel said their policy that the

797
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:20,520
Obama administration's policy is to use crises don't let a good crisis go to

798
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:25,280
waste you never want a serious crisis to go to waste and what I mean by that it's

799
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,760
an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do but we know that

800
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,960
the Patriot Act was written beforehand and on the books and the ocean

801
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:35,580
administration was looking for the excuse to get it put into law we know

802
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:39,800
that the project for a new American century wanted a Pearl Harbor style

803
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:45,120
attack to advance an American Empire agenda a multi-theater war overseas we

804
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,680
know they have agendas they announced them they've been uncovered found by

805
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:53,040
researchers but they always say how dare the researchers question how dare you

806
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,760
question those in power who admittedly are just seeking more power and will use

807

the prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse

809
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:14,280

last day of January 2013 already about to go into the second month of 2013 hard

851
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,880
to believe 2012 went by in the twinkling of an eye this year is moving even

852
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,480
faster okay coming up at the bottom of the hour the latest on Israeli strikes

853
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:03,320
inside Syria and even the libertarian party is officially asking why is Israel

854
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,200
now backing al-qaeda rebels why is America backing al-qaeda rebels we now

855
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,760
know why the head of CENTCOM has been relieved and so many other top generals

856
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,520
they're not going along with this they have been voicing their concerns like

857
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,800
retired head of Special Forces general Boykin and others and that is the good

858
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:30,320
news up at info wars dot-com over 1,000 green berets sign letter supporting

859
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:35,440
Second Amendment and on the big special forces website that were linked to where

mal took the guns this is what tyrants do we're going into tyranny and they

863
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:55,960
basically talk about how our military is now being set up to be used against us

864
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,280
they're having drills all over the country to acclimate the troops the

865
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,000
police and the citizens for occupation it's in the new army manuals that they

866
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,400
want to use the military against the American people in there they said this

867
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,920
Monday at the law enforcement conference that big sis ran that the new threat is

868
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:15,440
not al-qaeda it is the gun owner the libertarian the conservative the

869
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:20,880
returning veteran and the quote radical extremists the malicious so they're

announcing you know this whole homeland security thing it's set up for people

871
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:29,720

872
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:33,960
this is public information let's go over some of the other Second Amendment news

873
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,520
is out of the New York Post when I saw this actually went and looked it up and

874
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:46,040
homeland security actually says said this homeland security has made just one

875
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,320
of the most ridiculous statements ever by these people homeland security has

876
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:55,320
advice for confronting mass murderers scissors is your workplace getting

877
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,120
shown up by a crazed gunman no problem just grab a pair of scissors and fight

878
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:04,640
back that's some of the helpful advice in a new and structural video from the

879
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,720
Department of Homeland Security that was posted on the agency's website just a

880
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:12,440
month after the massacre at Sandy Hook School in Connecticut yeah they had a

881
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:18,120
similar video last year that we covered where you know it said fight back

882
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,040
physically well how about with guns if you were caught this is a quote from the

883
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:26,920
video videos up at info Wars calm if you were caught out in the open and cannot

884
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:32,000
conceal yourself or take cover you might consider trying to overpower the shooter

885
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,280
with whatever means are available

886
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:48,480
says the narrator in the video which shows an office worker pulling scissors

887
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,640
out of the desk drawer we're gonna show you and play the audio of that video

state's getting legally let illegal aliens run around above the law how about

they just let the Constitution stay in place and actually follow their oath see

896
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,040
the oath means null and void stuff that's unconstitutional probably have

897
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,420
juries to to judge the facts as well as the law doesn't matter if the judge says

914

Amendment in this gun owners alert oh hi Alex it's really good to be with you

918
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:18,960
one thing I'd like to lead off with there's a an old saw among those of us

919
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,080
who fight to protect the Second Amendment that when guns are outlawed

920
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:29,660
only how laws will have guns well one of the examples that just popped up on the

921
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:37,120
blogs today the chat by the name of Jerome McCrory McCrory and he lives in

922
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:43,000
Ohio in the Dayton area and he's been rather prominent leading a demonstration

923
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:50,280
against the easy availability of guns at gun shows and yeah I can see what a guy's

924
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:56,880
concerned about folks like you and me having guns he's a convicted rapist

925
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:06,480
Jerome McCrory the face of the anti Second Amendment crowd I just had to

926
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:14,400
share that it just is sometimes a reality is just you can make it up right

927
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:21,040
anyway to the question of the bands at the I think it's pretty clear even from

928
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,320
the hearing yesterday in the Senate the the Senate doesn't have the votes to

929
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:34,520
ban neither guns nor magazines I think and it's I think it's actually more

930
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:41,560
sinister point of attack against us is to make universal the background check

931
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:47,960
that way if you can't even give to your neighbor sell to your neighbor give to

932
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:53,240
your son without going to a dealer and giving the dealer all that information

933
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:58,840
for the background check there's absolutely no way that we should be

934
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,040
trusting the government with that information it's the fact our

935
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:06,960
registration I went and bought a 50 Cal Barrett a few months ago and the whole

936
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:11,040
thing was in a computerized form I mean I feel most gun shops now it's

937
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,840
computerized in a government form you know they're getting that info I mean

938
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,440
you know the the next system is a background check and a registration that

939
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,040
you're a gun owner right there now they're legally required to destroy the

940
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:29,200
names after 24 hours and Alex if you know somebody that believes that real

941
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:32,800
estate office that I'd like to have them come over and do some business they've

942
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,000
been caught memory serves a few times actually keeping the names of course and

943
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:43,160
the fact is that they refuse to say that they are destroying the names they don't

944
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:47,920
I guess when I get caught in an outright lie so they just hardball the thing they

945
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:54,720
will not say well then there are times when yes they have done searches of

946
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,980
their data and it turns out oh yes we ran a search well how'd you do that if

947
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,760
you're not destroying the day if you if you are destroying the names after 24

948
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:09,280
hours so if they get a gun registry then it's all over baby if that's when they

949
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:14,460
can come the next time Rahm Emanuel has one of his crises well it's time to

950
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,060
collect the guns mr. and mrs. America we can't trust you anymore with your guns

951
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:24,360
and Diane Feinstein's dream would be fulfilled that if she'd had the votes

952
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:28,280
she could have gotten them all well she'd know where to go if she had the

953
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:33,240
registration system and frankly a government that'll send guns into

954
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:40,040
Mexico and get Mexicans killed hundreds of them at this point so we know of we

955
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:45,560
we're gonna trust them with our information about our guns protected by

956
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:53,920
our Second Amendment not theirs ours so yeah I think we're at a very crucial

957
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:01,080
moment and the fight Alex if I could ask people to make a call to their well

958
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,960
right now they're senators but also their representatives that soon enough

959
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:10,720
it's I think we've got the bands pretty well under control but where they're

960
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:14,600
going to try to rope us is on the background check that's where they're

961
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,520
going to make the big play if they get that they've got the whole enchilada

962
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:24,120
what about the issue of another mass shooting I mean they've already set it

963
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:28,440
up where we're bad because we own guns we are guilty of mass murder when

964
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:32,560
someone else does something wrong the collectivist Soviet-style well somebody

965
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,840
your neighborhood you know shot at one of the NKVD secret police show now

966
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,600
everyone in the neighborhood is being sent to a gulag I mean this is the new

967
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,160
Soviet model or we're collectivized with health care so now the government tells

968
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:47,680
you what you can eat what you can do and yes there's death panels for people

969
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:51,520
overweight and death panels for people with genetic disorders I mean you know

970
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:55,760
we know their plan what about what do we do with the next attack how do we get

971
01:18:55,760 --> 01:19:00,480
back on the offensive and point out that these people have bodyguards and that

972
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:04,360
these people wanted to be exempt where they can still own guns doesn't that

973
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:10,120
fully discredit them I think that's one of very very important counter-attack

974
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:16,720
and another one is kind of like unto it we've been calling for the dismantling

975
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:21,880
of the gun-free zones particularly in schools it's been in the gun-free zone

976
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:26,640
where most of our mass murders have occurred and it kind of makes you wonder

977
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:31,320
if maybe that doesn't have something to do with it you know and so happily

978
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:37,260
representative Stockman the first day within probably the first hour to put in

979
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:44,280
a bill it's HR 35 that would do away with gun-free school zones that would

980
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:49,520
take away the magnets that have drawn these maggots who want to rack up big

981
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:56,680
body counts children nobody to protect them what we've been urging it really

982
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:59,880
instead of a time let's stay there let's hear what you're urging to get on the

983
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:05,280
offensive looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive from

issues sold out in way before the month was over I'll tell you about this the

1039
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,960
next segment it's the tyrants why the tyrants want your guns of the new issue

1040
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:45,120
is about 80% Second Amendment key info the five minutes we've got left with

1041
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:50,280
Larry Pratt you were talking about Steve Stockman the Texas congressman that you

1042
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:54,240
said wait wait till he gets in Congress he's gonna go on the offense tell us

1043
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:59,080
about that legislation and how we get that rammed rammed through and grab a

1044
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:03,400
victory from the jaws of defeat well it took him about an hour the first day and

1045
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,440
he had HR 35 to show for it and this is legislation that would overturn the

1046
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:13,520
school's own gun bans and as we know it's every single one of our mass

1047
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:20,800
murders in the last 20 years with one exception was in a legally required no

1048
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:27,240
gun zone and it just kind of makes you wonder if maybe these dirt bags don't

1049
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,320
have that figured out going in so we got to get rid of them

1050
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:34,960
Stockman's right on that and we're just very grateful that somebody with his

1051
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:42,280
energy and determination is willing to lead on the fight now President Obama as

1052
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:46,960
you know last Sunday came out and we played the clips here and I'm sure you

1053
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,720
saw it he said look gun owners need to listen to me a little more carefully I

1054
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,040
support the Second Amendment I love to skeet shoot it's in the news today he's

1055
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:57,400
never gone skeet shooting except for one photo op it's kind of like his club was

1056
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,520
saying I'll never come after your handguns your rifles your shotguns your

1057
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:05,600
semi-autos none of it so the incredible disdain and lying how he tries to tries

1058
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:10,260
to play possum with people and we've also seen the red coat Piers Morgan say

1059
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:14,680
oh I've lost the gunfight I've seen them play possum more than once I mean we

1060
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:18,240
know what the bills do what do you make of this double game where they go well

1061
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:21,280
you don't want your guns we've just introduced all the bills to do it

1062
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:24,800
meanwhile Schumer and all of them are saying we need to lean on gun

1063
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,840
manufacturers and retailers not to sell semi-auto I've now talked to three

1064
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:33,840
separate gun dealers one of them I know personally who had the ATF come in and

1065
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,800
say why don't you stop selling these and we'll we'll go nice with you how do we

1066
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,720
deal with the extrajudicial attacks but that's B a what do you make of this

1067
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:51,160
playing possum that is just not to be believed and the word the operative word

1068
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:57,240
is playing it's not for real these guys clearly are on a crusade and when

1069
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,920
they're doing that to gun dealers they're also doing something else and

1070
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:07,120
this is why we've never agreed with the 4473 form being required we've never

1071
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:12,120
agreed with the background check being required that the ATF agents are going

1072
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:17,160
into we're getting multiple reports going into stores either making copies

1073
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:22,120
or scarfing up at 4473 forms that everybody has to fill out when they buy

1074
01:27:22,120 --> 01:27:26,240
a gun at a store and whether they bring them back or not we haven't heard but

1075
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:29,840
they're taking them so they can obviously make copies they want to make

1076
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:35,240
sure that nothing falls through the cracks they want a registration list

1077
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:38,880
and there's only one thing governments do with registration lists they don't

1078
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,880
fight crimes with them because they're not useful as crime fighting tools but

1079
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:49,920
they are useful for one thing they know where the gun owners are and you know

1080
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:55,600
maybe you only bought a say an ar-15 through a dealer and you bought handguns

1081
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:01,360
and shotguns privately from people you knew or at a flea market or whatever

1082
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:06,040
once they know you've got one gun they don't think they're going to stop with

1083
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:09,840
the one when they come to your house they're going to want to search the

1084
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:15,400
whole place they'll tear it upside down because we're criminals if we own a gun

1085
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:21,960
that's their mentality we must stop this drive for a universal background check

1086
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:28,720
Alex that is going to be the gunfight of 2013 whether or not they can complete

1087
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:34,200
their grab for every gun owners data through the instant background check for

1088
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:39,640
everybody even if it's father giving a gun to a son they're saying oh that's

1089
01:28:39,640 --> 01:28:44,120
gotta go have an instant background check it really Larry are you getting

1090
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:48,400
are you getting Intel on the same thing that I'm hearing that they're there and

1091
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,160
we know Schumer said let's go lean on the gun dealers and make them not sell

1092
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:55,000
these and that's public statements he and others have said that are are you

1093
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,360
getting the reports I'm getting that the ATF saying why don't you not sell these

1094
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:06,040
we're getting all kinds of reports the ATF seems to be in hyper activity such

1095
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:11,240
as they weren't even in the most of the last four years a lot of this stuff is

1096
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:17,680
now ramping up now that Obama has been elected doesn't have to ever run again

1097
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:24,440
for any political office it's pedal to the metal this is going to be a tough

1098
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,960
fight because this guy doesn't play fair he doesn't care about the

1099
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:32,800
Constitution he doesn't care about federal gun laws all he wants is to make

1100
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:37,200
sure that he can accomplish his socialist agenda and grabbing the guns

1101
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:42,520

01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:53,400
back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. with a live Sunday transmission because so much news

1142
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:57,720
always happens over the weekend that broadcast has become incredibly popular

1143
01:33:57,720 --> 01:34:03,680
and is on close to 100 a.m. and FM stations and many of the affiliates we've

1144
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:07,540
gotten now our stations that pick up the Sunday and get great response great

1145
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:11,400
ratings and then they move us to nighttime rebroadcast and almost every

1146
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:18,120
station then segues us to live during the day well over a hundred and fifty

1147
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:22,080
a.m. and FM affiliates right now very very exciting and we're very very

1148
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:26,920
blessed and thankful for all the listeners the a.m. and FM affiliates out

1149
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,840
there and our sponsors now speaking of people were thankful for I've read that

1150
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:36,880
now the NRA had a quarter million new members in the first month of this year

1151
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:41,280
well part of December into January and that now it's over three hundred and

1152
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:47,640
fifty thousand new members that's great okay but but the NRA was founded by the

1153
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:54,320
federal government and the NRA helped pass the 68 gun control act and I love

1154
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:59,480
Charlton Hessen interviewed him several times he was even manipulated into

1155
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,280
support of a 68 gun control act that's why he came out that's why he came out

1156
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:10,480
so so strong for the Second Amendment later because he felt guilty about that

1157
01:35:10,480 --> 01:35:15,440
and he talked about that gun owners of America's never sold out never made

1158
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:20,560
mistakes never back down in there I don't know 30-something years of history

1159
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,400
they're the second biggest gun group they're the group we don't need to hear

1160
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,760
about NRA as being the only group that represents gun owners and and and and

1161
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:33,960
you know is a default we need to hear about gun owners dot o RG and Larry I

1162
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:37,000
know you've gotten a lot of members I know you didn't come on for this today

1163
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,160
but we wouldn't probably have a Second Amendment if it wasn't for your

1164
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:47,200
organization and your members so many times it's you guys that actually get

1165
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:52,840
the job done and you forced the NRA to get more hardcore again and I've got to

1166
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:56,240
say the NRA has gotten better you don't like to talk about the NRA can you

1167
01:35:56,240 --> 01:35:59,520
briefly talk about the NRA talk about how many new members you've gotten and

1168
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,000
the history of this and where we are right now that I've got a few other

1169
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,000
questions for you well we've had probably I would say could be a 20%

1170
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:14,000
increase in our membership and there's the easiest way to understand the

1171
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:20,040
difference between the two groups is and you alluded to it the NRA was formed by

1172
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:26,720
Civil War veterans from the Union Army who were distressed about how poorly the

1173
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:30,800
Union recruits shot many of them have been Irish immigrants and probably

1174
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:36,560
didn't even know which end of a gun was which when they got drafted and so the

1175
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:42,840
NRA was set up to make rifle awareness and practice more commonplace so that if

1176
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,760
there were another war or when there was that the United States could draw upon a

1177
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,680
better trained pool of men so they were set up to help the government about a

1178
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:57,640
hundred years later we were organized gun owners of America to oppose the

1179
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:02,760
government to oppose the gun control that was beginning to be a regular topic

1180
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:08,720
of discussion in Washington and after the 68 gun control act and you alluded

1181
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:14,160
to the fact that the NRA really hadn't been very effective in opposing that

1182
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:21,200
that was kind of it our founder a former California state senator decided we

1183
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:26,200
needed a group that was going to oppose the government and so those those two

1184
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:31,040
different founding motives really kind of carried through even to today well

1185
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:35,880
time flies so how long has gun owners been around when was it founded we're in

1186
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:43,560
our 35th 36 year now yeah we're we're really delighted to see the way the

1187
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:49,240
growth has come in part I guess well for one thing a lot of your listeners have

1188
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:54,160
joined that's been a over the years that's been kind of noticeable somebody

1189
01:37:54,160 --> 01:38:00,120
who say oh you must have done Alex Jones today the numbers spiked again tonight

1190
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:06,640
when people go online and then Piers Morgan bless his British heart did a

1191
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:11,800
little it is fair share to increase our membership and we're very grateful to

1192
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:18,200
Piers Morgan I think I'm not quite grateful enough to form a fan club but I

1193
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:23,560
do have to acknowledge that even though he didn't intend it it has I think

1194
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:27,760
frankly not only did he help our membership and the NRA's membership but

1195
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,200
I think he provided what we may look back and say that was a pivotal moment

1196
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:38,080
when he started lecturing yours truly about how the United States ought to

1197
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:44,520
operate with that bloody supercilious British accent of his that just kind of

1198
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:50,480
fills most Americans right up to the gag point it certainly does well gun owners

1199
01:38:50,480 --> 01:38:54,000
dot o RG people need to go there and join or at least sign up for the free

1200
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:00,280
email alerts that are absolutely vital and again I have seen you for years I

1201
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:03,400
tried to get you to talk about the history of the NRA you finally went out

1202
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:07,920
of both barrels I don't know about six years ago and then they really have

1203
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,960
reformed themselves to a great extent but I've got to say I've studied

1204
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:16,840
history here gun owners of America without you we would have lost and I

1205
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:20,280
know you don't like to toot your horn you're a very you know restrained calm

1206
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:25,320
guy but Larry Pratt be honest would we have lost most of these big battles if

1207
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:31,180
it wasn't for the members of gun owners of America supporting your your system

1208
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:34,840
because I mean I mean you guys are I mean you guys are the soldiers that have

1209
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:37,480
kicked the New World Order's but I mean I got a I got to tell you that's why I

1210
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:41,200
support you and and and you know sit here and drive for people to sign up

1211
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,880
with you guys because if we didn't have you I think we would have lost am I am I

1212
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:50,440
incorrect I think our most successful lobbying accomplishment is when we can

1213
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:58,600
get the NRA to move in our direction and now they are opposing the expansion of

1214
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:03,560
the background check to private sales the back with the very background check

1215
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:09,040
that was their idea to begin with so that's that's right me that's progress

1216
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,240
that's right it's not where it ought to be but as long as we see forward

1217
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:17,480
movement it means that over in the Congress it's gonna make it a lot

1218
01:40:17,480 --> 01:40:21,440
tougher because they're not going to be able to say as easily well the NRA

1219
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:25,760
supports those piece of gun control so what's your problem well I mean I mean

1220
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,320
I've been following this the reason I got on air was because they were had

1221
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:33,000
bills to ban people under 18 being able to even shoot guns it was gonna ban

1222
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:38,280
shooting sports in Texas and then I I mean so many draconian shut down gun

1223
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:44,080
shows I got on the air I mean I had a hunger and went and took RTF and all of

1224
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,360
it because I wanted to defend the Second Amendment not because I even am obsessed

1225
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:52,360
with guns more obsessed with you know hiking and stuff than I am guns or

1226
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:57,520
fishing it's that I understand how important it is historically and so

1227
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:02,160
that's why I followed the NRA standing there or even supporting stuff at the

1228
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:07,560
Texas level in the mid 90s when you guys were there fighting tooth and nail with

1229
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:12,680
with you know ragtag money so that's why I'm just gushing over you because I can

1230
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:16,860
authoritatively say we would have lost most of these battles if it wasn't for

1231
01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:21,920
Larry Pratt and his leadership and what you guys have done so I I salute you in

1232
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:27,400
closing I appreciate that the gun free school zone was something supported by

1233
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:33,000
the NRA we opposed it now I think they've moved substantially not entirely

1234
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:39,760
but substantially to oppose that as well as you know our objective is to make it

1235
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,400
so a teacher a janitor anybody with a concealed carry permit could carry in a

1236
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:48,640
school they're not going to be identified with a uniform so a dirtbag

1237
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:53,040
comes in and tries to kill a lot of kids they're going to find out that they

1238
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:55,960
don't even know where the next gun is going to be coming from because there

1239
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:59,260
might be two or three in a school and they're all going to be pointed at the

1240
01:41:59,260 --> 01:42:03,640
dirtbag I remember many years ago they had concealed carry had just gone in and

1241
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:08,160
I was listening to Dallas radio and a guy that had a bunch of carjackings it

1242
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:12,560
was as violent as Chicago some years more violent and the carjacker on

1243
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:18,480
Central Expressway was stop-and-go traffic he he jumped out ramped the

1244
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:23,240
ladies sports cars have been a fancy car and and and and told her get out he was

1245
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:28,280
going to steal the car and he had a gun and a guy stopped behind him got out and

1246
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:32,280
pumped three rounds into him the guy fell over dead and that was like two or

1247
01:42:32,280 --> 01:42:37,160
three days after concealed carry officially went in so there's an example

1248
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,240
right there it people say oh you'll never have your gun ready when the

1249
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:44,440
attack comes concealed carry is about the criminals don't know where it is and

1250
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:49,680
it's I bet that was the point where carjackings took a nose dive in Dallas

1251
01:42:49,680 --> 01:42:55,080
oh yeah they went did they started dropping massively in fact they're unheard of now

1252
01:42:55,880 --> 01:43:00,640
the criminals get the message pretty fast that they're working environment

1253
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:06,800
just got a lot more dangerous that's the message we're trying to send to school

1254
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,040
mass murderers you're working we know you might want to commit suicide at the

1255
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,880
end but we're going to keep you to one or two shots how does that suit you

1256
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:19,640
exactly like you're not going to be able to kill 25 27 people how about you shoot

1257
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:25,640
one or two then we kill you that's exactly right and that I think is a time

1258
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:30,840
there's an idea is time hopefully has come and I'm just really excited that

1259
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:35,880
Steve Stockman did exactly what I hoped he would do he's taken leadership by the

1260
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:40,720
way there's another congressman Massey from Kentucky it seems to be pretty much

1261
01:43:40,720 --> 01:43:45,760
of one mind with Stockman he's got a I think a similar identical bill in so

1262
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:50,840
we've got more than one this thing has its own momentum already but what needs

1263
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:55,440
to be done now if your member your listeners would please call their member

1264
01:43:55,440 --> 01:44:01,360
of Congress and urge them to get on congressman Stockman's bill HR 35 that's

1265
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:05,320
the next step in building momentum to get this past the leadership of the

1266
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:09,480
Congress that never wants to do anything controversial and guns are always viewed

1267
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:14,600
as controversial even though that's what gets Republicans elected that dummies so

1268
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:18,580
get on the horn please call those members of Congress tell them to

1269
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:26,760
cosponsor HR 35 absolutely all right Larry Pratt final point here when do we

1270
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:30,840
really get on the offensive because you're hardcore in defending the Second

1271
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:35,840
Amendment but look I know the law of interview hundreds conservatively

1272
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:39,280
constitutional lawyers I've studied it quite a bit I know what racketeering is

1273
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:44,180
I know what torturous interference is I know what color of law is I know what

1274
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:50,520
harassment is if I tried to just verbally get people to pressure a bank

1275
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,760
to say get rid of all of their customers that are gun owners or if I tried to put

1276
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:58,600
pressure on a sporting goods store to not sell a particular product and I did

1277
01:44:58,600 --> 01:45:03,080
things and said things and and and and talked about trying to withhold money

1278
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,980
from them and lobbying against them that would be torturous interference when you

1279
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:12,540
have the mob boss of Chicago we're on Chicago right now talking to him

1280
01:45:12,540 --> 01:45:17,960
Rahm Emanuel and you've got the mob boss Bloomberg and you've got the velo groza

1281
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:22,980
the mob boss of LA all these guys and the mob bosses of San Francisco saying

1282
01:45:22,980 --> 01:45:27,060
disarm the American people take the guns while they've got bodyguards lean on the

1283
01:45:27,060 --> 01:45:30,480
banks and banks are saying we don't want gun manufacturers we don't want gun

1284
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:36,240
dealers Time Warner all their violent movies they're out there saying that you

1285
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:40,080
know we won't take gun advertising on any of our cable systems I mean they're

1286
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:44,920
really trying like not like the Nazis first embargo Jews and others that's how

1287
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:48,560
the tyranny starts not letting them have businesses or harassing them I mean this

1288
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:53,440
is this is criminal things that we can do to fight back and we've already seen

1289
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:57,880
a spate of bills go into a number of legislators around the country

1290
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:05,240
nullifying one and another and sometimes many anti-constitutional federal actions

1291
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:09,680
and some actually say that they'll arrest a federal official who's trying

1292
01:46:09,680 --> 01:46:15,160
to enforce an unconstitutional measure yeah what we need then is to have a

1293
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:21,600
state or even a county in where a sheriff is willing to take them on say

1294
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:26,600
okay in this bank we love firearms manufacturers and we'll be happy

1295
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:31,120
assuming assuming you've got a good balance statement to make you alone we'll

1296
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:34,800
be happy to do business with you we'd rather you not be with Bank of

1297
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:39,600
America just like Christians put the little the little fish on their company

1298
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:44,880
I think people need to start advertising their pro bill of rights period pro bill

1299
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:48,560
of rights would have a certified group meaning you support them all and and and

1300
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:53,000
have a little symbol of the gun on there I think it's saying welcome America I

1301
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,160
mean America was born out of self-defense now I want to play you a

1302
01:46:56,160 --> 01:47:01,400
short clip and then let you go Homeland Security has advisors running around

1303
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,520
putting out videos saying don't have guns have scissors in a new training

1304
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:11,080
video they're advising people in in in in not in federal buildings they have

1305
01:47:11,080 --> 01:47:15,880
guns but other office buildings and things to have scissors to fight someone

1306
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:19,080
that comes to kill them with a gun let's play a clip of that thank you from the

1307
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:22,960
view of the shooter quickly choose the best option if you are caught out in the

1308
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,160
open and cannot conceal yourself or take cover you might consider trying to

1309
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:30,760
overpower the shooter with whatever means are available show scissors to

1310
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:34,200
protect your hiding place lock the door if you can okay block but let's stop

1311
01:47:34,200 --> 01:47:37,160
right there let's block the door and then the person comes knowing they're

1312
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:42,880
all hiding and shoots them in a fetal position why not concealed carry holders

1313
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:49,200
statistically have dropped crime 49% in the last 20 years FBI numbers so we

1314
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:53,280
suggest you have a company shooting club to ensure that on the off chance one in

1315
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:57,040
10 million that someone goes crazy others are there to equalize their bad

1316
01:47:57,040 --> 01:48:02,160
activity I mean that's what they should be saying correct yes and when they

1317
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:07,400
encourage many people in the work excuse me the workplace to be armed they're

1318
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:13,040
really making it so that the person that might have quote unquote gone crazy will

1319
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:18,080
just probably be able to restrain himself because he'll realize that that

1320
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:22,640
kind of crazy isn't going to go anywhere absolutely and if you look at the mo of

1321
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:26,680
these guys they love the helplessness of little kids and knowing no one can stop

1322
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:30,760
them and on record a lot of times they urinate on themselves when the police

1323
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:35,280
get there and kill themselves or wait to be killed I mean these are it's the same

1324
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:38,960
they're always the last four or five guys were all devil worshippers in a row

1325
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,360
I mean why are we profiling devil worshippers devil worshippers who

1326
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:48,400
overdid video games and I did say overdid I didn't say use them at all but

1327
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:53,800
overdid video games it's just like you can overdo booze or food or anything

1328
01:48:53,800 --> 01:49:00,120
else and and so those are common elements in these attackers and I think

1329
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:04,320
we better come to grips with that make sure our kids and our grandchildren or

1330
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:09,520
if they got some of these video games that there may be an hour or two a week

1331
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:15,160
rather than three or four a day sure what about suing what about suing Rahm

1332
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:18,760
Emanuel and Bloomberg they're always suing gun makers and gun manufacturers

1333
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:22,680
and publishing our names what about what about suing them for torturous

1334
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,320
interference and I believe it's racketeering I mean I mean when they get

1335
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,880
together as cities to try to overthrow our Bill of Rights and Constitution and

1336
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:34,480
tell us we're bad and tell us they're gonna lean on gun dealers until they

1337
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:39,760
stop selling guns I mean that is a gangster tactic well and one response

1338
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:46,000
can certainly be what Texas has already done and it's told firearms manufacturers

1339
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,920
hey it liked up in New York and in Connecticut the environment politically

1340
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:55,080
they're pretty nasty for you y'all come down here yeah why doesn't Remington

1341
01:49:55,080 --> 01:50:03,720
leave Connecticut and come right down here Larry give out the number for folks

1342
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:07,000
that don't have computers so they can call and sign up tell them how much it

1343
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,320
is to support the tip of the spear in the defense of the Republic well for 20

1344
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:17,360
bucks you can do what Alex is saying folks call triple 8 double 8 6 guns

1345
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:24,120
that's 8 8 8 8 8 6 g-u-n-s and then for everybody else it's gun owners org and

1346
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:28,120
what is Ron Paul say about you the only no compromise second amendment lobby

1347
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:31,200
Larry Pratt thanks for the time we've got you back on the nightly news Monday

1348
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:34,920
have a great weekend coming up you too my friend thank you very much Wow

1349
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:39,560
amazing guy he's so polite tell him bye for me all right folks that is an

1350
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:44,080
amazing individual right there I've been in the fight for 20 years I can tell you

1351
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:49,520
I've been there a hundred times or more without that guy you would not have most

1352
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:52,600
of your guns right now they've already taken them all in Australia but bolt

1353
01:50:52,600 --> 01:50:56,600
action single shot they're now trying to ban them it's the same thing they take

1354
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:00,320
the semi-auto they register everything else then they take it all we'll be back

1355
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:04,360
if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but we're

1356
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:08,120
waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse then you're not gonna

1357
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:12,080
want to miss this exciting message here's why our solar generators provide

1358
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:16,640
life-saving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run

1359
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:21,080
quietly emit no fumes and produce electricity from the Sun so when the

1360
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:25,160
lights go out you'll always have the power you need now here's the best part

1361
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:29,880
every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as

1362
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:34,960
new we put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily

1363
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,760
at the end of each year we call them scratch and dead units but they're

1364
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:43,280
really just like new each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special

1365
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:47,880
bonuses you just won't believe don't wait they go fast go to scratch and

1366
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:52,600
dense solar.com that's scratch and dense solar.com for the craziest offer we've

1367
01:51:52,600 --> 01:51:59,840
ever made go to scratch and dense solar.com that scratch and dense solar.com

1368
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:06,640
hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could

1369
01:52:06,640 --> 01:52:12,680
wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn

1370
01:52:12,680 --> 01:52:17,800
that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a

1371
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:21,080
few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1372
01:52:21,080 --> 01:52:25,320
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe

1373
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:29,120
that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and

1374
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:33,240
the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a free

1375
01:52:33,240 --> 01:52:38,800
video at weird device.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the

1376
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:44,080

1395
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:53,080
where we reach the big massive audiences I just got the numbers on 590 a.m. and

1403
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:26,880
meters where people you know subscribe and sign up and they put a machine in

1404
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,840
your car to track what you're listening to they've got other ones that actually

1405
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:33,160
can dial into what you're listening to because every receiver actually

1406
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:37,000
broadcast at a micro level but those are intrusive so those aren't really being

1407
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:43,200
deployed but I mean it shows that truth is popular so let me just say this

all right I've got to get into the economy and I'm gonna do that about 40

1460
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:42,960
after after constitutional lawyer Bruce fine comes up and joins us for part of

1461
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:49,000
three segments two segments and part of the next segment man I tell you it's

1462
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:53,240
just looking at all the good things that are happening it is booing to my heart

1463
02:00:53,240 --> 02:00:57,800
and soul to know people are fighting back but at the same time the corruption

1464
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:03,680
is so ridiculously over-the-top that I mean it's just cuckoo land things have

1465
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:13,360
things have entered absolute total hell male complete cuckoo land and I know you

1466
02:01:13,360 --> 02:01:17,000
know that and it's because America and the rest of the Western world because of

1467
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,920
TV and the culture slowly incrementally getting more and more out of control has

1468
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,880
taught people how to not care how to not be involved and how to feel powerless to

1469
02:01:26,880 --> 02:01:31,240
where it's not even they feel powerless you know the zombie like jellyfish

1470
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:35,560
everybody talks about you're either awake or you're not it's that they don't

1471
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:39,600
even know they're jellyfish they don't even know they're spectators they don't

1472
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:46,200
even understand what that means to go through life and never really even be

1473
02:01:46,200 --> 02:01:52,240
conscious and I've got to be honest with you in the last few months I've been

1474
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:56,800
really wound up as you can notice and it's taken a toll on me mentally because

1475
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:06,720
I can't turn my brain off I I've gotten to the point where all I think about is

1476
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:11,280
this because you come to the realization of the global is saying humanity's

1477
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:15,880
obsolete and they made the decision to bring in robotics to replace human labor

1478
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:19,460
and drones or replace the military and they say well we've got to have an arms

1479
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:22,640
race somebody else will get it but you realize bad guys are running our

1480
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:26,880
political system and that they've just decided the general public's obsolete

1481
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,760
and not just a cheap human resource as we've always been to the establishment

1482
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:38,120
but now garbage that has to be taken out and that's really my message to everybody

1483
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:44,320
is that really corrupt elites are in dominant control and there's always been

1484
02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:49,080
different facets of society there's always been a different veins of society

1485
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:51,840
the good the bad the ugly the people that don't care the people that do care

1486
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:55,560
the people that are mean well but are misguided the truly evil the

1487
02:02:55,560 --> 02:03:01,460
opportunist but now it's just such a cold-blooded corporate global system

1488
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:06,240
where mega corporations tie into government and use government

1489
02:03:06,240 --> 02:03:09,480
regulation to shut down their competition government regulation to

1490
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:14,160
conduit banker bailout and corporate welfare to themselves and then they

1491
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:19,920
sick the government on corporations and companies that don't cheat to where you

1492
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,000
can't compete with it because it's a fraud you can't compete with suicide

1493
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,880
nets around the factories in China that have tax incentives 22 billion dollars

1494
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:33,480
in taxpayer money to ship General Motors to China I mean it was hard to kill the

1495
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:37,560
free market in America it was hard to kill jobs it was it was hard to kill five

1496
02:03:37,560 --> 02:03:41,840
percent of the population that had half the world's wealth I mean we were

1497
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:45,880
amazing but now they've got us where I was reading Wall Street Journal

1498
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:48,800
yesterday that you guys pull this out of yesterday's stack if you have a chance

1499
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:59,680
the financial stack where it said that we're set to have double the debt every

1500
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:06,200
year that we have GDP I mean that is just that's like making $50,000 a year

1501
02:04:06,200 --> 02:04:11,600
and you've got credit card bills every year of $100,000 I mean and that's where

1502
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,600
they want to take us that's where the collectivists want to take us they they

1503
02:04:14,600 --> 02:04:20,680
brag about it it's agenda 21 it's the different sociologists that have you

1504
02:04:20,680 --> 02:04:24,680
know that are popular that say bankrupt things to bring in socialism this is

1505
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:29,040
their plan and so I wanted to get a constitutional lawyer when I come to him

1506
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:32,120
in the next segment here would have gone to him now but some stations don't carry

1507
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:36,120
this segment that we're preparing to move the clock back to six after not

1508
02:04:36,120 --> 02:04:40,000

1510
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:49,040

the national debt be double double the G GDP just just absolute financial rack

1557
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:38,520
and room we're gonna be breaking that down because exposing it may may have

1558
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:43,540
the political system reverse course we've also got unprecedented attacks by

1559

Israel inside Syria while the West is funding the rebels in just unbelievable

1560
02:08:48,360 --> 02:08:52,880
information ATF's Milwaukee sting operation marred by mistakes and

1561
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:57,480
failures we're gonna be looking at some of that but for the next 40 minutes

1562
02:08:57,480 --> 02:09:03,680
we're joined by constitutional lawyer Bruce fine and he was the main policy

1563
02:09:03,680 --> 02:09:10,180
adviser obviously to Ron Paul during his presidential run as as weld and Bruce

1564
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:13,960

arms sales to Iran and on the American Bar Association's committee on

1568
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:28,200
presidential signing statements which we have some news on and also his recess

1569
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:32,600
appointments and he's a constitutional lawyer again he has been a visiting

1570
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:35,960
fellow for the constitutional studies at the Heritage Foundation an adjunct

1571
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,000
scholar the American Enterprise Institute mr. fine is the founding

1572
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:42,360
member of Bruce fine and associates Inc a law corporation is the principal of

1573
02:09:42,360 --> 02:09:45,920
public advocacy organization the Lynchfield group he is the author of

1574
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:50,000
constitutional peril the life-and-death struggle for a constitutional democracy

1575
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,080
and American Empire before the fall which I've read is an excellent book mr.

1576
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:57,600
fine presently serves a senior policy adviser again to the Ron Paul 2012

1577
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,520
presidential campaign that was the latest on his bio and he's advised

1578
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:07,840
Congress generally as constitutional scholar obviously the guns up front

1579
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:11,760
constitutionally I want you to get your take on the whole waterfront on this but

1580
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:16,840
they've now got state bills and the main Feinstein bill that says basically I

1581
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:21,400
call a violation of the Constitution because it's titles of nobility where

1582
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:26,840
where the all the government bureaucrats and the police are given immunity from

1583
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:32,520
having their semi-autos registered and then taken under the New York model but

1584
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:38,720
but then everybody else has to turn their guns in or can't buy these guns or

1585
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:42,440
can't transfer these guns you're the constitutional lawyer so to quantify

1586
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:47,120
just my crude understanding where am I correct in the Constitution Bill of

1587
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:49,720
Rights because I know there's some sections in there I want to make sure

1588
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:53,600
I'm right on these I mean that's like them saying you know blacks are

1589
02:10:53,600 --> 02:10:57,680
two-thirds humans so they don't have rights again and this is the fundamental

1590
02:10:57,680 --> 02:11:00,960
deal when you know you're in North Korea where they have a hereditary

1591
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:05,320
dictatorship it's royalty when the royalty is exempt the government is

1592
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:09,360
exempt is that not royalty constitutional lawyer Bruce fine and

1593
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:13,320
what do we do I mean you would think that would discredit Diane Feinstein

1594
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:16,920
immediately when she says well Congress will be exempt but they're already

1595
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,560
exempt on Obamacare they're already exempt on insider trading I mean how

1596
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:25,520
have we gotten to this are they only missing the gold crowns and how do we

1597
02:11:25,520 --> 02:11:31,640
redress this when the the Congress is all there at the trough where's fine

1598
02:11:31,640 --> 02:11:39,000
that's quite an introduction let's begin by I think articulating the fundamental

1599
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,400
issue that we confront and I guess it confronts all the nations that emerge

1600
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:48,080
from a state of nature and it goes back to what is the final end of the state

1601
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:52,200
and our founding fathers believed that the final end of the state was to make

1602
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:56,240
men and women free to develop their faculties and to seek their fulfillment

1603
02:11:56,240 --> 02:12:00,880
in their unique ways and that the exception to Liberty was a government

1604
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:06,280
intrusion but that required passing a very high threshold of need but the

1605
02:12:06,280 --> 02:12:09,880
final end of the state was not to make government big it was not to go abroad

1606
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:13,600
in search of monsters to destroy it was not even necessarily to have an

1607
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:18,680
unemployment rate that was low or GNP that was high but Liberty was the final

1608
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:22,800
end of the state for the individuals to choose to develop their faculties and

1609
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:27,360
what you've described is really an inversion of that understanding at

1610
02:12:27,360 --> 02:12:31,440
present because now the presumption is government should be permitted to

1611
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:36,440
regulate anything unless it would reduce you to complete serfdom like you know

1612
02:12:36,440 --> 02:12:40,600
citizens under Nazi Germany which is I say a total perversion of our

1613
02:12:40,600 --> 02:12:44,640
understanding of what we are as a nation and how the Constitution is intended to

1614
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:49,440
operate now with regard specifically to the Second Amendment right to keep and

1615
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:56,880
bear arms the issues vary depending upon what the statutes say but to give some

1616
02:12:56,880 --> 02:13:02,360
beef background the United States Supreme Court has held that both the

1617
02:13:02,360 --> 02:13:08,080
federal and the state governments are limited by regulating guns to permitting

1618
02:13:08,080 --> 02:13:15,160
those that are in common usage and and otherwise were relevant to performing in

1619
02:13:15,160 --> 02:13:19,800
the militia at the time of the founding it hasn't other than these two major

1620
02:13:19,800 --> 02:13:25,200
cases saying that there's an individual right to gun ownership and not

1621
02:13:25,200 --> 02:13:30,280
articulating all the scope of the regulations permitted this largely in

1622
02:13:30,280 --> 02:13:34,760
the aftermath it's gone down to lower courts to decide whether or not

1623
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:42,800
regulations for example forbidding any gun to be used in public or disclosed in

1624
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,640
public the courts have come out in different ways I think if we want to

1625
02:13:47,640 --> 02:13:52,820
try to break them down Alex in terms of the constitutional issues one is a due

1626
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:58,580
process and fair warning are the arms AK for assault rifles or whatever are they

1627
02:13:58,580 --> 02:14:03,040
described with sufficient particularity that somebody would know whether they're

1628
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:09,260
in or outside the box that's been a huge problem because it's not like doing

1629
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:13,920
Euclidean geometry and describing what is a so-called assault weapon and say

1630
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,800
that's you have a due process right to know what's what's being forbidden or

1631
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:24,000
not a second issue so they call it just compensation issue if you take handguns

1632
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:28,120
other firearms that are in common usage and suddenly say they can no longer be

1633
02:14:28,120 --> 02:14:32,120
used have you taken someone's property without just compensation do you have to

1634
02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:37,320
pay fair market value all the inventory that stranded in gun owners or dealers

1635
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:42,040
are taking a weapon that can be used now and then it's made illegal it's become

1636
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:46,120
worthless or its values been substantially depreciated it's another

1637
02:14:46,120 --> 02:14:52,080
one then the basic right and insofar as their absolute prohibitions the question

1638
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:57,160
is whether or not the weapon the firearms being banned are and have been

1639
02:14:57,160 --> 02:15:02,760
in common usage in the United States and that can vary of course from firearm to

1640
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:06,880
firearm so in the areas that I think that will be confronting in the

1641
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:12,360
aftermath of the Newtown killings in the burst of legislation certainly in a

1642
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:16,200
handful of states New York Maryland seems clear to follow California is

1643
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:21,240
always in that line for some kind of avant-garde prohibition on liberty and

1644
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:29,200
at the federal level it's it's still uncertain whether there will be some and

1645
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:33,400
the extent of any federal legislation but I want to go back to the basic point

1646
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:37,920
Alex and that's our understanding of where we are as a nation because the

1647
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:43,440
other items that you enumerated for discussion whether it's ATF invasions

1648
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:47,360
and the going abroad and having our military involved now with predator

1649
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:52,280
drones in Mali and in Niger and Burkina Faso places people can't even understand

1650
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:57,280
all of these are symptoms of the inversion of who we are as a nation from

1651
02:15:57,280 --> 02:16:01,560
one where the final end and goal of the state is liberty to one where the final

1652
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:04,880
end and goal of the state is bigger government attempting to control and

1653
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:08,760
dominate everything and I want to go to that big question because humans live

1654
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:13,680
75 years on average basically the Bible says they live that long 3,000 years ago

1655
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:17,200
the Old Testament said that's how long you're given 75 that's still the average

1656
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:22,640
today it's amazing on average worldwide we know humans act the same do the same

1657
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,720
thing over and over again the founders knew that they tried to tie down the

1658
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:30,880
tyranny and create checks and balances but I want to get into the fact that

1659
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:35,360
there's this race to tyranny and why empires always follow this exact paradigm

1660
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:40,960
that you've written about with such gravitas but you know I your latest book

1661
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:44,800
and and then how to stop it by understanding it or are we still going to

1662
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:49,600
be hoisted on our own petard you know reliving this Groundhog Day nightmare but

1663
02:16:49,600 --> 02:16:52,080
but I'm asking you as constitutional lawyer I know you spoke to it some

1664
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:57,400
obviously how does Congress exempt itself from everything it puts us under

1665
02:16:57,400 --> 02:17:01,720
isn't that grounds for impeachment of all of the scallywags that have gone

1666
02:17:01,720 --> 02:17:07,080
along with us impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors and you're

1667
02:17:07,080 --> 02:17:10,840
absolutely accurate that Alex that at the founding it was thought

1668
02:17:10,840 --> 02:17:17,120
inconceivable that that members would be exempt from the rules that apply to

1669
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:22,200
everyone else indeed one of their sense of assurance that the system would

1670
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:27,040
operate with the proper checks was the idea that the members would invariably

1671
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:31,880
at some time returned to the general citizenry and be subject to the same laws

1672
02:17:31,880 --> 02:17:36,360
they had passed and they didn't conceive of what we know today are professional

1673
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:40,760
politicians who remain forever in office and therefore are never subject to their

1674
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:46,080
own laws that they pass and that's a breakdown a important law should not be

1675
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:49,480
the ultimate sin should we make that into a bigger deal you don't even hear

1676
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:55,760
this discussed yes I I admit that that is something that could be considered as

1677
02:17:55,760 --> 02:18:00,040
a constitutional amendment as I say the founding fathers couldn't even conceived

1678
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:04,400
of a professional politician I mean George Washington left very clean after

1679
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:08,880
two terms and you had to yank him to to stay more than one term and if you look

1680
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:12,880
at the average longevity of the initial member of Congress of the Senate it was

1681
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:15,600
very short let me ask you that historically as you are historian not

1682
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:19,000
just constitutional lawyer from your research what what made our founders

1683
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,440
different they were the only revolutionaries to ever take over and

1684
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:26,240
not become tyrants everybody else does I mean why were we blessed with people

1685
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:30,800
this good and now they're demonized all over the news like the scum of the earth

1686
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:35,840
one is that I think the political culture was far different than at

1687
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:41,160
present and ears of the irony if you will Alex maybe irony is the wrong word

1688
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:45,880
maybe paradox is better that we had in some sense a much higher political

1689
02:18:45,880 --> 02:18:51,680
culture in 1776 1787 that understood that politics wasn't a football game

1690
02:18:51,680 --> 02:18:55,160
where you had the red team and the blue team and you hope one team lost and one

1691
02:18:55,160 --> 02:18:59,560
team won and everything was fixated on just remaining in power they actually

1692
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:03,600
thought of politics as the art of making everyone win and although there could be

1693
02:19:03,600 --> 02:19:08,160
differences the the unity of values would keep the country afloat they

1694
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:13,540
wanted to build a powerful wonderful society correct we were Liberty was the

1695
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:17,800
North Star not big government and empires and part of that too however

1696
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:25,040
Alex was because our founding generation was born knowing what tyranny felt like

1697
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:28,280
because they were the subjects of tyranny they were the ones who

1698
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:32,720
confronted George the third and the tyrannical acts no taxation without

1699
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:36,200
representation where the Lords were exempt from everything they were under

1700
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:39,320

1759
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:14,680
segment coming up we're just fine constitutional lawyers our guest are you

1760
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:18,280
got cut off by the break you were getting into a higher political culture

1761
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:23,120
people being more aware and then you were starting to get off into what we've

1762
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:29,560
become now I mean secret arrest NDAA checkpoints TSA in Austin searching

1763
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:34,720
people without warrants now my dad sent me a bill this morning I meant to get to

1764
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:39,320
where they're now going to levy a thing for it's a state bill where every

1765
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:44,000
medical examination you get a piece of money is sent in a fee for state

1766
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:53,160
teachers state teacher retirement funds I mean it's it's just turning into a

1767
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:58,640
total orgy of thieving all the government arms against us openly what

1768
02:24:58,640 --> 02:25:02,720
do we do when an empire starts doing this and and what do you predict is

1769
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:11,160
going to happen next in this insane orgy of tyrannical behavior start at the

1770
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:18,880
beginning our founding fathers had first-hand experience with subjection to

1771
02:25:18,880 --> 02:25:26,800
charity and overreaching and so they were much more embracing of libertarian

1772
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:32,760
ideas because they could see the temptations of tyranny taking a nation

1773
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:37,960
through a nation as it did Great Britain ultimately but the the founding

1774
02:25:37,960 --> 02:25:43,160
generation basically died off with John Quincy Adams presidency terminating in

1775
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:49,480
1828 and it became more and more situation where the leaders of government

1776
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:56,560
had never been subjects they'd never been the the brunt of tyrannical action

1777
02:25:56,560 --> 02:26:02,160
and they began to want government to be bigger because that meant their office

1778
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:08,400
holding had more stature and more power and it's been a steady trajectory since

1779
02:26:08,400 --> 02:26:13,000
really the Mexican-American war where the purposes of government have changed

1780
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:19,240
from liberty of the individual to power for the government and how do we change

1781
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:23,200
this because now we're sort of at the high-water mark of the Empire so I call

1782
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:26,880
it the psychology of Empire where the government does everything to try to

1783
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:31,800
make your you know a risk-free existence and in the name of a risk-free existence

1784
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:36,920
you lose all of your liberty and freedom and that's also true not only

1785
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:40,160
domestically where we'll have surveillance drones throughout the

1786
02:26:40,160 --> 02:26:45,440
nation probably before our lifetimes ends Alex and we go abroad in search of

1787
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:49,160
monster to destroy anything that moves anywhere in the world there's the United

1788
02:26:49,160 --> 02:26:53,360
States say in countries can't even be pronounced by most people how many people

1789
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:58,120
would know where Molly is or Niger or Burkina Faso or Yemen or things of that

1790
02:26:58,120 --> 02:27:02,880
sort and again it's this idea that government and strength and power and

1791
02:27:02,880 --> 02:27:06,680
domination coercion is who we are as a nation it's making us resented abroad

1792
02:27:06,680 --> 02:27:11,120
just as it's evoking resentment in the United States at home now how does this

1793
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:15,680
kind of psychology change it really can change in my judgment only with

1794
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:19,880
leadership because ordinary people don't quite understand that a risk-free

1795
02:27:19,880 --> 02:27:25,080
existence is an exchange sort of a Faustian exchange with vassals that you

1796
02:27:25,080 --> 02:27:30,360
can't have a risk-free existence without making everyone a candidate for prison

1797
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:35,120
for detention because we're all capable of evil even if the capability is small

1798
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:41,600
and someone has to stand up and say no we'd rather be free than risk-free and

1799
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:47,520
as a leader saying I want to renounce or scale back or downsize government not

1800
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:51,760
increase it government doesn't know better than you you are master of your

1801
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:55,840
soul you're a captain of your fate you have the pride and dignity of determining

1802
02:27:55,840 --> 02:28:01,040
your end point where you make of what your endowments are a government just

1803
02:28:01,040 --> 02:28:06,040
has a give you an even playing field but other than that we would destroy your

1804
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:10,480
own dignity if we attempted to give you a crush for it and the goal is to get

1805
02:28:10,480 --> 02:28:14,440
everybody on welfare in the system how do we reverse it then because we know

1806
02:28:14,440 --> 02:28:19,760
historically where the Empire goes next it starts imploding everything and as

1807
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:23,520
things get worse it starts confiscating more and more and then it only

1808
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:29,040
accelerates is there any way out of the nightmares that are caused when empires

1809
02:28:29,040 --> 02:28:35,760
begin to rot well Alex there have been about 72 prior empires tracing back to

1810
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:41,560
the Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire and all the Romanov Empire I don't need

1811
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:45,880
to identify them all and not a single one has been able to escape you know the

1812
02:28:45,880 --> 02:28:49,360
clutches of ruination as you've described them bigger bigger government

1813
02:28:49,360 --> 02:28:55,720
risk-free existence everybody's dependent that the tax receivers get

1814
02:28:55,720 --> 02:29:00,600
larger the taxpayers get narrower and the question is can the United States be

1815
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:05,480
the first empire in history that sees the precipice and walks back my judgment

1816
02:29:05,480 --> 02:29:10,440
can be done but only with extraordinary leadership I still think people given a

1817
02:29:10,440 --> 02:29:13,920
proper impeccable character and understanding of who we are and the

1818
02:29:13,920 --> 02:29:18,680
dignity that attends controlling your own fate taking moral accountability for

1819
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:24,520
your destiny is one that would resonate but at present we have no leaders with

1820
02:29:24,520 --> 02:29:29,880
that kind of character and ability to inspire individuals to make certain it's

1821
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:34,120
the better angels of their nature rather than the more sinful or vice prone

1822
02:29:34,120 --> 02:29:38,800
angels that become dominant sure constitutional lawyer Bruce fine final

1860
02:33:20,920 --> 02:33:25,880
we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us doing a few

1861
02:33:25,880 --> 02:33:29,160
more minutes with constitutional lawyer Bruce fine we've talked about the

1862
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:34,040
history we've talked about where we currently are is it that Obama is worse

1863
02:33:34,040 --> 02:33:38,120
than the last few presidents or is it that the power structure has just gotten

1864
02:33:38,120 --> 02:33:43,080
more accustomed to tyranny because historically you see where tyrants and

1865
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:48,360
tyrannies creep up corrupt systems do and then finally the bottom falls out

1866
02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:52,960
when they realize hey we've got our people in almost everywhere we've got

1867
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:57,720
the force we can just do whatever we want and clearly we're reaching that

1868
02:33:57,720 --> 02:34:02,880
that tipping point I hope as Ron Paul has said and as you've said and for many

1869
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:06,600
years use the tipping point to go back into Liberty and we do have the

1870
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:10,400
Constitution and Bill of Rights the power structure has been blaming for our

1871
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:14,320
problems when clearly when we followed it we had half the world's wealth and

1872
02:34:14,320 --> 02:34:20,360
5% of the population we leave it to our ruination I mean it's total cause and

1873
02:34:20,360 --> 02:34:24,680
effect so so so answer that question and then run through some of the other big

1874
02:34:24,680 --> 02:34:27,800
issues that are front and center for you the good the bad and the ugly I know

1875
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:31,960
there's been some victories against tyranny lately but also some defeats but

1876
02:34:31,960 --> 02:34:36,640
are we not approaching that flashpoint or do you think it'll just continue to

1877
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:41,120
be a creeping rotting because I see the power structure grabbing everything it

1878
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:46,360
can really I think out of a sense that they know we know Bruce fine

1879
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:51,720
constitutional lawyer you know your take on that I think that we have across the

1880
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:58,640
Rubicon into at least a psychological tyranny Alex I have regularly postulated

1881
02:34:58,640 --> 02:35:02,780
that if the current president or a future president called a press

1882
02:35:02,780 --> 02:35:06,240
conference in the evening and stated that the Constitution was being

1883
02:35:06,240 --> 02:35:09,840
suspended and the executive was asserting all power in order to make us

1884
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:15,320
safe and comfortable and prosperous that such an individual would not be impeached

1885
02:35:15,320 --> 02:35:18,960
by Congress there would not be calls like it Watergate for Nixon's ouster

1886
02:35:18,960 --> 02:35:25,600
that the people would accept a tyranny if you will and I don't believe that

1887
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:30,640
politically a president would find that necessary and wise to do at present I

1888
02:35:30,640 --> 02:35:35,120
don't think Obama is likely to do it but at some point we'll get Caligula in the

1889
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:40,800
White House and the precedents of unlimited presidential power lie around

1890
02:35:40,800 --> 02:35:44,400
like loaded weapons ready to be used by any successor in the White House and if

1891
02:35:44,400 --> 02:35:50,040
we just want to give as an example of the ultimate apogee if you will of

1892
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:54,720
tyranny just think of what the president is saying about his authority to use a

1893
02:35:54,720 --> 02:36:00,120
predator drone to kill the US citizens anytime anyplace anywhere he says on

1894
02:36:00,120 --> 02:36:05,460
secret evidence that you are an imminent threat the United States there's no

1895
02:36:05,460 --> 02:36:10,620
accountability all this is done in secret we have given one person in the

1896
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:15,640
Oval Office the ability to play judge jury prosecutor and executioner all in

1897
02:36:15,640 --> 02:36:21,640
secret now think of that Alex it is impossible to endow any one individual

1898
02:36:21,640 --> 02:36:25,860
with more power than to choose anybody on the planet for vaporization that's

1899
02:36:25,860 --> 02:36:29,600
where we are the other things that the president claims authority to do and is

1900
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:34,800
exercising like intercepting our emails and telephone calls without any warns

1901
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:39,660
without any suspicion it's incredible it is it truly incredible especially to me

1902
02:36:39,660 --> 02:36:44,100
because my baptism Alex was Watergate where a third-rate burglary ultimately

1903
02:36:44,100 --> 02:36:47,760
ended up being an impeachable offense that drove mr. yeah the president spied

1904
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:51,120
without warrants and he had to step down or he would have been convicted the

1905
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:55,040
Senate let me go back to the drone for a moment and then get back into the

1906
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:58,320
eloquent points you're making with constitutional lawyer here best-selling

1907
02:36:58,320 --> 02:37:05,600
author Bruce fine take take the drones Al Sharpton came out and said hey don't

1908
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:09,480
worry about your guns we're gonna take them we got predator drones and I see on

1909
02:37:09,480 --> 02:37:13,360
the so-called left who aren't really left in my view Thomas Jefferson was a

1910
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:18,480
liberal these people are authoritarians they say it on no exaggeration 2030 shows

1911
02:37:18,480 --> 02:37:23,680
I've seen and news articles they go hey forget your guns we got drones we've got

1912
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:28,800
artillery we'll use them on you and I feel worship by those gathered around

1913
02:37:28,800 --> 02:37:34,840
the state with a reflected glory they are getting off on executive power like

1914
02:37:34,840 --> 02:37:40,320
it's a god they're worshipping or a golden calf you are up there on Capitol

1915
02:37:40,320 --> 02:37:44,040
Hill obviously battling all this you have to be around these people but but I

1916
02:37:44,040 --> 02:37:49,800
mean I've been following this intensely for 20 years there is a demoniac glow to

1917
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:54,000
a lot of the minions activities now higher level globalists look scared but

1918
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:59,040
a lot of the minions Bruce look really really animated like dancing around

1919
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:03,520
their idol can you elaborate on that or have you seen them gloat on their

1920
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:08,960
military firepower and how they'll use it on us domestically I don't know

1921
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:15,360
whether that is widespread domestically except in metaphorical ways I will say

1922
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:21,000
this however that it's not a party issue the members of Congress are what I call

1923
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:25,640
you know invertebrates they do not want the accountability they do not want to

1924
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:30,480
accept the responsibility which the Constitution fastens upon them to

1925
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:35,800
oversee to check to block executive power when the founding fathers are you

1926
02:38:35,800 --> 02:38:39,400
know we're writing the Constitution they feared a bloated executive and they

1927
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:44,360
couldn't have imagined Congress being so so kind to voluntarily surrender the

1928
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:49,760
decisions to wage war or not you know to levy or taxes or to spend all this is

1929
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:53,080
now delegated to the president separation of powers you'd have power

1930
02:38:53,080 --> 02:38:57,600
hungry people in all three branches not letting the other have the power yes but

1931
02:38:57,600 --> 02:39:03,080
what they didn't anticipate Alex was the polarization created by the party system

1932
02:39:03,080 --> 02:39:07,280
they did not think that Democrats and Republicans in Congress would sell their

1933
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,800
souls for a mess of pottage with that they would believe their loyalty was not

1934
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:14,840
to the Constitution or their institution but to their party so you always have

1935
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:18,320
one party in Congress willing to block the other party's effort to check the

1936
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:22,240
president and in that way the presidential power simply grows it

1937
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:26,320
metastasizes like a cancer and it's been true under Republican and Democratic

1938
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:30,200
presidents alike and under Obama presidential power it has reached its

1939
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:35,200
apex it's never been this authoritative before and when we can ask a president

1940
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:41,000
who refuses even to explain to the public or to Congress why he thinks he

1941
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:45,680
has this legal authority to kill us all and all of it is a secret secret law

1942
02:39:45,680 --> 02:39:50,680
that even Caligula didn't practice in Roman times and he gets away with that

1943
02:39:50,680 --> 02:39:56,080
with a complacent public in a Congress that doesn't demand that he will have no

1944
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:59,520
money you will be impeached unless he explains why he thinks what he's doing

1945
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:04,320
is legal it shows you how can we give more power to an executive than that

1946
02:40:04,320 --> 02:40:09,920
it's a very very dismaying situation and unless we have a leader who comes to the

1947
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:13,280
White House and gives back the power because Congress will take it back only

1948
02:40:13,280 --> 02:40:19,400
a president who says I understand the folly of of tyranny and I don't want to

1949
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:23,520
exercise it if that doesn't happen we will not be a republic we will be

1950
02:40:23,520 --> 02:40:28,040
totally ruined as an agent in 20 or 30 years time we simply cannot go forward

1951
02:40:28,040 --> 02:40:33,120
with one person making all the decisions in secret and no one accepts accepting

1952
02:40:33,120 --> 02:40:38,120
constant I mean responsibility and plus no criticism being permitted because in

1953
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:41,820
the executive branch you descend from the president you are crushed you know

1954
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:47,520
they will attempt to badmouth you to assassinate your character and otherwise

1955
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:51,760
and there you can see it with a six espionage prosecutions for so-called

1956
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:56,480
whistleblowers and look at the CIA guy that exposed illegal torture and just

1957
02:40:56,480 --> 02:41:00,000
got 30 months he should be getting he should be getting a medal and a

1958
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:04,560
whistleblower award instead the secret torture continues and Obama's been caught

1959
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:08,840
lying about that and a guy that tried to work through channels and nothing stopped

1960
02:41:08,840 --> 02:41:12,720
lets them an investigative journalists know without even giving away you know

1961
02:41:12,720 --> 02:41:16,240
code names and things so that an investigation could start and they put

1962
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:19,760
him in jail and see that's the paradox people say all the tyranny is not that

1963
02:41:19,760 --> 02:41:23,520
bad we still have some liberty running but if you look at what they've put into

1964
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:28,560
law as you said the Nazis did all this stuff in basements and in secret

1965
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:33,200
facilities but they didn't put open stuff like this on paper the Soviets

1966
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:39,080
didn't I mean it's so amazing that they've put it all on paper and then the

1967
02:41:39,080 --> 02:41:42,960
mainstream media goes oh you're a kook you said we're going into tyranny we

1968
02:41:42,960 --> 02:41:48,120
need guns the parasols from the tyranny there's no tyranny well the gentleman

1969
02:41:48,120 --> 02:41:52,320
you spoke of John Kiriakou of a work where he's a very admirable person and

1970
02:41:52,320 --> 02:41:57,880
and it is an example of the one person who set the dynamic for prohibiting a

1971
02:41:57,880 --> 02:42:01,040
torture waterboarding is the one who goes to prison all the ones who

1972
02:42:01,040 --> 02:42:05,520
participated in the waterboarding the church or get off scot-free it is

1973
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:08,840
another situation I'm working with a fellow named Tony Schafer I used to work

1974
02:42:08,840 --> 02:42:13,440
at at DIA and they're trying to revoke his bronze medal because you know he's

1975
02:42:13,440 --> 02:42:18,080
in a retired status now because he's criticized the tactics in Afghanistan

1976
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:21,680
and elsewhere somebody who risked that last full measure of devotion for the

1977
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:25,840
country now has his bronze medal under attack because he has the audacity to

1978
02:42:25,840 --> 02:42:29,400
say you know maybe you're not omniscient in the White House and you're exactly

1979
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:33,560
right when those kinds I say these are the people who you and I read about

1980
02:42:33,560 --> 02:42:37,240
where the Sakharov's and Solzhenitsyn's getting sentenced to prison in the

1981
02:42:37,240 --> 02:42:41,200
Soviet Union but we're not supposed to be the Soviet Union and yet we are

1982
02:42:41,200 --> 02:42:45,480
aping their rather dedicated approach to government Bruce fine we've got to get

1983
02:42:45,480 --> 02:42:50,280
you back up soon and I mean our only hope I think is to point out why things

1984
02:42:50,280 --> 02:42:53,960
are getting bad point out historically why it's wrong and just stand against

1985
02:42:53,960 --> 02:42:58,600
them and I think there's enough enough vestigial liberty there not in the

1986
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:01,980
Congress but in the spine of the American people that if we all just say

1987
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:05,780
no and we all take action we've seen the court striking down the recess

1988
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:09,400
appointments and some I mean we are seeing a few good signs hopefully we can

1989
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:12,200
turn this around but we know this it's only gonna get worse if we don't stand

1990
02:43:12,200 --> 02:43:17,880
up so the only course is say no that is absolutely correct and remember the

1991
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:22,840
saying of Tacitus as the Roman Republic degenerated to the Roman Empire the

1992
02:43:22,840 --> 02:43:28,360
worst crimes were dared by a few willed by more but tolerated by all we don't

1993
02:43:28,360 --> 02:43:32,360
want to be subject to that kind of stigma it needs us to tolerate it and

1994
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:37,160
that's why they shout down I see articles where they go how dare the man

1995
02:43:37,160 --> 02:43:40,800
go to City Council and say you don't want to turn his guns in how extreme

1996
02:43:40,800 --> 02:43:45,960
they take normal behavior look a little girl said let's play with our bubble

1997
02:43:45,960 --> 02:43:50,040
guns after school so the SWAT team was called but the government's wearing

1998
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:53,600
stormtrooper outfits and saying they'll secretly kill you if you want oh that's

1999
02:43:53,600 --> 02:43:57,880
to keep us safe you know we should be totally horrified by that and resisting

2000
02:43:57,880 --> 02:44:03,060
it but instead they teach us Pavlovian Lee someone made a Lego gun at school so

2001
02:44:03,060 --> 02:44:08,680
we evacuated I mean this they're trying to turn us into gibbering mental

2002
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:12,680
patients and I have faith because of the internet and Ron Paul and yourself we're

2003
02:44:12,680 --> 02:44:16,480
going to defeat it constitutional lawyer Bruce fine author of American Empire

2031
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:43,040
articles about the economy contracted faster than they thought oh you didn't

2032
02:46:43,040 --> 02:46:46,440
think massive payroll tax increases would contract things and they said poor

2038
02:47:10,360 --> 02:47:13,480
to bring up Ted Anderson and yeah it's gonna be a gold pitch but that's not why

2039
02:47:13,480 --> 02:47:17,600
he's really here I saw some gold deals we're gonna talk about gold with the

2040
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:21,360
economy with Ted Anderson the founder of Midas resources and the Genesis Network

2041
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:24,960
and I got went and got he was a sponsor before he started this network because I

2042
02:47:24,960 --> 02:47:31,360
go out and get people that sell numismatics at at at bullion prices but I

2043
02:47:31,360 --> 02:47:35,480
called Ted this morning I said I heard a radio ad last night on one of the

2044
02:47:35,480 --> 02:47:37,760
biggest talk show hosts in this country and I'm not even gonna say names you

2045
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:41,200
know who it is they've been in trouble for this before I said what were they

2046
02:47:41,200 --> 02:47:44,840
really selling stuff for we're gonna skip this network break as I'm so far

2047
02:47:44,840 --> 02:47:48,520
behind I can do this plus it's important to get this out so station shouldn't be

2048
02:47:48,520 --> 02:47:56,280
going over this in about three months as a network break but Ted I call tick

2049
02:47:56,280 --> 02:47:59,280
because I know about the gold silver business pretty good I've been in it for

2050
02:47:59,280 --> 02:48:03,160
17 years and Ted started the network 15 years ago I've been working with him 17

2051
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:07,680
years about 16 he was a sponsor right away I was a local radio as I went out

2052
02:48:07,680 --> 02:48:10,840
and shopped and found the real folks and did some research and I've been with Ted

2053
02:48:10,840 --> 02:48:19,400
ever since and I heard this ad for a coin and I knew the coin was a hundred

2054
02:48:19,400 --> 02:48:23,280
and fifty percent higher than it should be it's great for a company to have five

2055
02:48:23,280 --> 02:48:26,960
percent maybe on something was hard to get a 10% markup that's great you gotta

2056
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:29,800
be able to make money to keep your lights on you know hold the stuff sell

2057
02:48:29,800 --> 02:48:33,400
it do all that on on average Ted's got about a five percent markup he's got

2058
02:48:33,400 --> 02:48:38,160
deals where he loses money where you can get two silver dollars at cost two films

2059
02:48:38,160 --> 02:48:44,800
and a book for free called a loss leader but I'm not differentiating the

2060
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:47,280
competition that's the oldest trick in the book saying you know that their

2061
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:50,920
hamburgers are crap we don't where's the beef ours are off beef patties check

2062
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:56,440
this out for yourself a lot of the big national talk show host one of them

2063
02:48:56,440 --> 02:48:59,920
lives right here in Texas move down here it's gonna leave it at that got in

2064
02:48:59,920 --> 02:49:03,080
trouble for stuff with a hundred percent markup this is a hundred and fifty I was

2065
02:49:03,080 --> 02:49:09,280
hearing and I just it just blows me away that Ted Anderson on average is about a

2066
02:49:09,280 --> 02:49:15,000
five percent markup and and and that Ted is it's got it's doing such a you know a

2067
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:19,920
good job at what he's doing and I just think people need to know people need to

2068
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:23,720
price check they need to shop and they need to call Midas resource we'll get

2069

2082
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:22,860
big runs on silver that are happening right now I've got some of those

2083
02:50:22,860 --> 02:50:26,640
articles rush to safety Americans by nearly half a million dollars of gold

2084
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:30,080
and silver in January but the media is trying to keep the price down with

2085
02:50:30,080 --> 02:50:34,360
different manipulations which is a great buying opportunity I mean ladies and

2086
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:37,560
gentlemen try to find two silver dollars especially these that are collectible

2087
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:41,600
but he's selling them to get bullion prices for seventy dollars with the free

2088
02:50:41,600 --> 02:50:45,720
shipping the shipping is included in that as they do bait and switches with

2089
02:50:45,720 --> 02:50:51,080
that and the films and all the rest of it I mean that is that is insane asylum

2090
02:50:51,080 --> 02:50:56,760
level deal eight hundred six eight six two two three seven but it's just that I

2091
02:50:56,760 --> 02:51:01,480
know Ted's got over a thousand affiliates Ted is getting with all his

2092
02:51:01,480 --> 02:51:05,080
shows most of our libertarian or constitutionalist in base he is

2093
02:51:05,080 --> 02:51:09,120
absolutely launched this show standing behind me for 15 years to the cover of

2094
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:16,040
talkers magazine to over 150 affiliates and exploding right now with this

2095
02:51:16,040 --> 02:51:19,480
hardcore message it's the truth but it you know imagine this is on the air big

2096
02:51:19,480 --> 02:51:23,040
stations now all over because people now know it's real they now know I'm not

2097
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:26,560
crazy I was ahead of my time I wish I wasn't being proven right this is this

2098
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:31,440
is a big deal folks my point is Midas resources is the place to buy your

2099
02:51:31,440 --> 02:51:35,280
silver and gold and if you want numismatics you want collectibles they've

2100
02:51:35,280 --> 02:51:40,240
got them okay and they've got the best deals on collectibles compare their

2101
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:44,320
numismatics to what you're hearing I hear some good deals on other radio

2102
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:48,480
shows but I mean some of these are just horrible you will get the best deals and

2103
02:51:48,480 --> 02:51:53,720
I stand behind what I promote okay I've been approached by big giant gold

2104
02:51:53,720 --> 02:51:56,880
sponsors and and and offered unbelievable amounts of money but I will

2105
02:51:56,880 --> 02:52:03,760
not sit there and sell old ladies a coin that should be $1,000 for $2,500 I will

2106
02:52:03,760 --> 02:52:09,240
not do it hell would freeze over plus people get mad at you because in the

2107
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:13,760
market you know it's gone it's gone from 300 bucks to you know 2,000 and then it

2108
02:52:13,760 --> 02:52:16,720
goes back down to 1,700 people get mad they're not looking at the long-term

2109
02:52:16,720 --> 02:52:19,960
graph it's only going up they get mad when you sell them stuff at a great deal

2110
02:52:19,960 --> 02:52:23,160
and then and then and then they manipulate the market and it goes down

2111
02:52:23,160 --> 02:52:26,600
they apologize later when it goes back up I don't buy it for an investment I

2112
02:52:26,600 --> 02:52:30,160
buy it as an emergency backup but it's been about the best investment out there

2113
02:52:30,160 --> 02:52:36,360
unless you're doing insider stuff in the last 12 years it's gone from 300 it was

2114
02:52:36,360 --> 02:52:40,680
even lower but I've heard about about 300 like 260 or something up to right at

2115
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:46,360
2,000 you know the point is and then drop back down some I got Chad on about

2116
02:52:46,360 --> 02:52:49,640
financial news but I'm just an honest person you know with a little gold pitch

2117
02:52:49,640 --> 02:52:54,080
in there as a sponsor I just start plugging what I believe in Midas resources

2118
02:52:54,080 --> 02:53:00,040
is the place and when it comes to bullion when it comes to bullion with

2119
02:53:00,040 --> 02:53:03,280
people that actually sell it to you see some deals occasionally because I've

2120
02:53:03,280 --> 02:53:06,580
looked around before I've seen deals where they claim something you call up

2121
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:11,320
over out of that we have this you don't get dealt with Midas resources Ted you

2122
02:53:11,320 --> 02:53:17,320
know hits the escape pod you know the ejection seat on brokers in about 10

2123
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:21,920
seconds when he discovers you know anything and it could because again the

2124
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:25,080
the whole gold and silver industry is people don't have the facts is a snake

2125
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:31,000
pit that's why I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen Midas resources 800 6 8 6

2126
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:36,520
2 2 3 7 and now is the time to support the biggest sponsor you not only get

2127
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:40,400
great deals you support the guy that stood behind me like nobody else you

2128
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:44,280
know I don't have the others of America as a sponsor I was thinking when he was

2129
02:53:44,280 --> 02:53:47,960
on I'll try to get him a sponsor because he says we're one of the biggest groups

2130
02:53:47,960 --> 02:53:50,120
getting a members but I'm doing it because they're a group defending my

2131
02:53:50,120 --> 02:53:54,360
Second Amendment you know they don't pay me to get them on and say join them now

2132
02:53:54,360 --> 02:54:00,160
Midas resources does but they're the sponsor I've got and they're already you

2133
02:54:00,160 --> 02:54:03,200
know sponsoring the website they're the sponsor I've got because they were the

2134
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:07,040
best group I could find and they're still the best group you know I've come

2135
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:09,800
to Ted before when he can't spend more money on can you spend more so I can

2136
02:54:09,800 --> 02:54:13,480
expand my operation he goes I'm sorry I just can't I'm like one being offered

2137
02:54:13,480 --> 02:54:16,680
three times more money by somebody else right now your contract but let me tell

2138
02:54:16,680 --> 02:54:20,040
you most you say well I would do the same really really somebody comes and

2139
02:54:20,040 --> 02:54:25,680
offers you millions of dollars to screw people would you do it see I say no and

2140
02:54:25,680 --> 02:54:30,120
does that mean everything's absolutely perfect and you won't get the very best

2141
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:34,160
deal the galaxy ever saw none of this is perfect but Ted has a great operation

2142
02:54:34,160 --> 02:54:42,840
and the best prices I found consistently 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 800 6 8 6 2 2 3 7 and

2143
02:54:42,840 --> 02:54:46,240
just like we stand behind gunners of America we just stand behind people like

2144
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:50,520
Ted because now is the time to get your gold your silver from Ted Anderson now

2145
02:54:50,520 --> 02:54:54,520
Ted I wanted to get you on about currency manipulation what's happening in

2146
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:57,960
the economy the statement by the White House that they're gonna go ahead and go

2147
02:54:57,960 --> 02:55:03,000
with dollar devaluation QE unlimited what this signifies but I know I talked

2148
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:06,000
to you this morning and I said well we got to do a report on this not nasty not

2149
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:14,640
even naming names but I'm morally have to just tell people that you know and

2150
02:55:14,640 --> 02:55:18,520
it's not that I these people attack me and I don't attack them is the point

2151
02:55:18,520 --> 02:55:23,320
because they see me as competition because they copy what we cover it just

2152
02:55:23,320 --> 02:55:28,480
blows me away the cutthroat crap I see and then to see you down there honest

2153
02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:33,240
and people running off and getting a hornswaggled I mean I guess it's legal

2154
02:55:33,240 --> 02:55:38,320
what people do it's just and it's okay to make a profit I just I just when

2155
02:55:38,320 --> 02:55:42,240
people advertise great deals I've got a right to say it's not a great deal

2156
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:48,080
Midas resources is the best deal out there consistently 800 6 8 6 2 3 7 I mean

2157
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:51,640
Ted explain to people this what I'm talking about here as much as you want

2158
02:55:51,640 --> 02:55:58,440
to say well the thing about it is Alex is that I see a lot of this advertising

2159
02:55:58,440 --> 02:56:04,200
for you know we've got this exclusive deal on a country coin that's brand new

2160
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:07,800
you only can buy it from us problem is you typically end up paying a big

2161
02:56:07,800 --> 02:56:11,280
premium for that kind of stuff and you're not going to get it back when you

2162
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:13,480
go to see you told me it was a hundred fifty percent on what you heard

2163
02:56:13,480 --> 02:56:16,520
yesterday a hundred fifty percent I've seen it all the way up to four hundred

2164
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:20,240
percent Alex it gets it goes out of this world you don't like to talk about this

2165
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:25,180
it's like Larry Pratt doesn't want to talk about the NRA you know it's you

2166
02:56:25,180 --> 02:56:28,320
know it's sort of the it's sort of the dark side of the industry but it does

2167
02:56:28,320 --> 02:56:33,320
happen and I I just need to tell people to stay away from that stuff I mean

2168
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:37,880
you're just because a country goes in and makes a new coin a lot of the times

2169
02:56:37,880 --> 02:56:42,040
it's the coin dealer that comes in and approaches the country's mint and says

2170
02:56:42,040 --> 02:56:46,060
hey you can make a lot of money on this we'll promote it and and they make up

2171
02:56:46,060 --> 02:56:49,880
the special deal and people end up paying a big price it's gonna be the

2172
02:56:49,880 --> 02:56:53,840
next greatest collectible folks the coins that are collectible are known and

2173
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:58,480
certified and whether it's a revolutionary penny which I happen to

2174
02:56:58,480 --> 02:57:03,400
have been gifted by a grandfather didn't even know I had it oh yeah I think I'm

2175
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:06,440
gonna probably sell even though it's an heirloom to fund the operation the point

2176
02:57:06,440 --> 02:57:12,080
is is that is that Ted here's an example let's not even what are some of the best

2177
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:15,160
numismatics and people are really into those I mean what are the classics that

2178
02:57:15,160 --> 02:57:18,520
are really are worth a lot that you could go to New Zealand and they'd open

2179
02:57:18,520 --> 02:57:22,520
a coin book and know what it was well I mean the the obvious coins are the

2180
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:26,760
$20 st. God and $20 Liberty $10 liberties 10 Indians I mean the stuff

2181
02:57:26,760 --> 02:57:31,320
that was used here as currency in this nation I even have a tendency to stay

2182
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:35,000
away from the higher premium graded stuff at this point just because I can

2183
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:39,040
see what's going on in the economy we're looking at a depression and because

2184
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:42,680
we're looking at a depression I think it's more important to have something

2185
02:57:42,680 --> 02:57:47,560
like a survival bag of dimes than it is to have one coin that's worth five six

2186
02:57:47,560 --> 02:57:52,720
seven thousand or I've seen coins go for 250,000 300,000 and there are

2187
02:57:52,720 --> 02:57:56,400
legitimate coins that so yeah I know there are a lot of great collectible

2188
02:57:56,400 --> 02:58:00,880
coins the thing is you better get a red book that Midas sells at cost you better

2189
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:05,080
learn your stuff you know it'd be like you know becoming a horse trader you

2190
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:07,960
won't start buying selling horses great you better spend 20 years learning about

2191
02:58:07,960 --> 02:58:12,320
it right exactly that's what I mean Alex it's more important that people get

2192
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:16,160
their core position something that they can fall back on I've got a million gold

2193
02:58:16,160 --> 02:58:20,240
and silver right now that's that's exactly where I think people should go

2194
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:23,880
or if you're gonna go into Numa stay close to melt that's the main thing

2195
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:28,120
that's the thing you sell a lot of coins that are collectible but that are

2196
02:58:28,120 --> 02:58:31,120
actually close to melt and that's the biggest winner folks for my research

2197
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:38,680
that's what I do 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 I want to look deeper into the

2198
02:58:38,680 --> 02:58:47,600
world economy when we come back thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live

2199

network network

2215

big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

2216
03:00:13,240 --> 03:00:20,880
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

2217
03:00:20,880 --> 03:00:24,320
Alex Jones

2218
03:00:24,320 --> 03:00:29,280
ladies and gentlemen last week and earlier this week we played clips where

2219
03:00:29,280 --> 03:00:33,240
White House advisors are telling top hedge fund managers that they're gonna

2220
03:00:33,240 --> 03:00:37,840
devalue the dollar that's their plan and I mean I'm already seeing prices explode

2221
03:00:37,840 --> 03:00:42,720
everywhere I don't know how people are paying their bills because you know I'm

2222
03:00:42,720 --> 03:00:46,040
what you'd call upper-middle class or whatever I invest most of capital back

2223
03:00:46,040 --> 03:00:52,040
in this operation but I mean I mean if these bills give me a sting and I'm

2224
03:00:52,040 --> 03:00:56,680
wondering how working folks are making it I mean this is hellish and you really

2225
03:00:56,680 --> 03:01:00,600
go places down you see less people and you see stores shutting down and we're

2226
03:01:00,600 --> 03:01:05,000
in a depression I mean that's what's going on and people that bought gold at

2227
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:08,320
three hundred four hundred five hundred a thousand fifteen hundred when we told

2228
03:01:08,320 --> 03:01:12,240
them to I didn't say do it as an investment they made out like bandits

2229
03:01:12,240 --> 03:01:15,640
because they didn't listen to the globalist Soros and all the elites are

2230
03:01:15,640 --> 03:01:19,000
buying gold Ted this is what I wanted to get you on how big is it that the

2231
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:22,720
Germans don't trust the private Federal Reserve and want their gold back and now

2232
03:01:22,720 --> 03:01:26,360
all these other countries that signifies the creep towards the exits are

2233
03:01:26,360 --> 03:01:32,720
accelerating well I mean if you have the Germans the central banks in Germany is

2234
03:01:32,720 --> 03:01:37,280
saying we'd want our gold back I mean what does that mean they don't trust the

2235
03:01:37,280 --> 03:01:42,000
United States they don't like the 85 billion dollars that we're making brand

2236
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:46,520
new money and putting into our economy every single month way too much stimulus

2237
03:01:46,520 --> 03:01:50,520
it's obvious that the handwriting is on the wall paper is not going to hold

2238
03:01:50,520 --> 03:01:55,920
value for the future gold is so is silver that's why they're asking for it

2239
03:01:55,920 --> 03:02:01,200
it's obvious it's just simple you know the Rothschild's taking on huge amounts

2240
03:02:01,200 --> 03:02:05,160
of gold and getting away from paper I mean these guys print the stuff and they

2241
03:02:05,160 --> 03:02:08,880
don't want it I mean why it is the people of the United States it's like

2242
03:02:08,880 --> 03:02:12,320
they're asleep at the switch or something it just doesn't make sense

2243
03:02:12,320 --> 03:02:17,040
that they're sitting here accepting the economy that we have looking at the

2244
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:21,040
numbers unemployment numbers shooting up you know like you said Alex you're seeing

2245
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:26,120
stores closing down we're walking into a depression and and and half of the

2246
03:02:26,120 --> 03:02:29,720
country thinks this president is so great because he's going to try to take

2247
03:02:29,720 --> 03:02:36,880
away our guns and and and to me it just doesn't make sense when you see the the

2248
03:02:36,880 --> 03:02:41,880
big traders in the marketplace getting away from paper money you better do the

2249
03:02:41,880 --> 03:02:45,480
same because these guys can see what's going on the handwriting is on the wall

2250
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:50,360
besides the fact like you say Alex they would just as soon destroy the United

2251
03:02:50,360 --> 03:02:54,800
States currency and force everybody to take their new world traded currency and

2252
03:02:54,800 --> 03:02:59,680
lose the sovereign the sovereignty of this nation absolutely we've got some

2253
03:02:59,680 --> 03:03:03,480
breaking news Ted just briefly here school officials confirm shooting in

2254
03:03:03,480 --> 03:03:08,560
Atlanta middle school sounds like a gang related deal 14 year old shot and it

2255
03:03:08,560 --> 03:03:11,720
goes on to say the parents even though the shootings been over a while are not

2256
03:03:11,720 --> 03:03:15,680
allowed to pick up their children so the government's setting that precedent

2257
03:03:15,680 --> 03:03:19,120
where you can't get your kids and they teach them to get the fetal position to

2258
03:03:19,120 --> 03:03:22,680
hopefully get a higher death count so they can take our guns that's Fox News

2259
03:03:22,680 --> 03:03:26,760
Fox News calm reporting that and obviously drugs report calm will have it

2260
03:03:26,760 --> 03:03:31,120
all have the latest at info Wars calm and prison planet TV Ted what about the

2261
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:36,160
two silver dollars for $72 with the two free films and the free book I mean

2262
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:43,240
that's like a $60 free retail value on top of the silver dollars at cost well

2263
03:03:43,240 --> 03:03:46,920
that's the thing I mean if you were to buy the silver dollars from you straight

2264
03:03:46,920 --> 03:03:51,760
you'd be paying over $78 for the two silver dollars plus you'd have to buy

2265
03:03:51,760 --> 03:03:58,600
the postage which is at least 10 bucks you know so that particular deal is I

2266
03:03:58,600 --> 03:04:02,120
mean nobody's got any nobody's got a deal like that out there in silver

2267
03:04:02,120 --> 03:04:06,880
period this is the greatest way to get a couple pieces of silver in your hand

2268
03:04:06,880 --> 03:04:11,000
especially if you can't afford to get into the marketplace in any great extent

2269
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:15,520
and you can use your credit card if you want to Alex it doesn't get better than

2270
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:20,560
that $72 for two silver dollars we all know that silver is trading in the 30s

2271
03:04:20,560 --> 03:04:25,280
you're not going to be able to find that anywhere else plus the video I mean your

2272
03:04:25,280 --> 03:04:30,720
