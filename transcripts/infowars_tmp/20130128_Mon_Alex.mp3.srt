1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:26,440
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,380
Well a senior Obama official says, quote, we're gonna kill the dollar. And CBS News

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,440
with a straight face has pundits on saying, it's time to scrap the Constitution. Quote,

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,640
let's give up on the Constitution as if it caused all the problems when we've been completely

6
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,040
allowing criminals to ignore it.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,040
Welcome ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, the 28th day of January 2013. And we don't

8
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:58,560
have any guests today, because I want to take your phone calls on all the things that we

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,480
see happening in this world. The incredible acceleration of tyranny. We'll get the number

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,400
out coming up in the next segment and just cover a ton of news.

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,600
Obama's meeting with police chiefs that are anti-gun and basically on the federal payroll

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,040
today. Acting like police wanna take the public's guns when national surveys show that

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,420
they can pull these up. Over 90% of sheriff's departments and police departments are actually

14
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,800
pro-gun.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,000
Because despite the fact that they're getting federal funds to say that the opposite, they

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,960
know guns frustrate crime many more times than they actually are used in the commission

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:40,400
of crimes. They know the FBI's own statistics garnered and the standard of good statistics.

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,320
That crime's gone down 49% in the last 20 years, 21% just since 2007. So it's accelerating.

19
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,540
They know that. And that's why you see this all out attack on the Second Amendment is

20
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,440
because the gun culture is gonna kill the tyranny culture.

21
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:06,740
It's like it killed the tyranny culture in 1775, 1776, 1777, 78, 79, 80, 81. Now, I've

22
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,640
really done some deep thinking and a lot of what I'm gonna say today I've already said,

23
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,200
but I'm gonna try to say it as clearly as I possibly can. My great frustration is I'll

24
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,920
be sitting there making my children eggs or I'll be walking the dogs or carrying the laundry

25
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,400
in the laundry room and I'll just have these clear, concise points I wanna make.

26
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,640
And then by the time I get here to the radio and engage in management on a half dozen issues

27
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,260
and scan back over another 20, 30, 40 articles and watch video clips, I get in here and my

28
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,140
head's spinning. But I am gonna attempt to just basically break down what we're facing

29
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,500
as a society and take your phone calls.

30
00:02:51,500 --> 00:03:00,100
We got a call yesterday about hacked emails out of a big British defense contractor. Paul

31
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:04,920
Watson's gone over the cash and it's scans of passports, you name it. There's thousands

32
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,360
of pages. If it is a hoax, it's an elaborate hoax. Watson, who's got a pretty good nose

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,240
for these things, thinks it's real.

34
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,340
At least most of it, they also mix garbage in. And the reason I think it has credibility

35
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,720
is it dovetails with something we've been covering for a year intensely the last six

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,360
months with our contacts like Syrian Girl and others. And of course, Israel said yesterday

37
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,880
they're preparing to strike Syria. They believe any of the rebels, including Western backed

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,960
rebels, they're calling the government rebels and the West rebels rebels.

39
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,600
If any of them get the chemical weapons of Syria that are guarded by Russia, that they're

40
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:47,600
going to use that as a pretext to attack the country. And hacked emails reveal Washington

41
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,920
approved plan to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria. We've actually seen al-Qaeda rebels

42
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:03,520
arrogant enough to shoot videos where they're testing sarin. Thank God they don't have VX.

43
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,880
Sarin's bad enough though. One whiff of that, you're dead. They send that up an assessment,

44
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:18,360
spray that over a city. Tens of thousands dead, bare minimum. And these are the historical

45
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,420
times where all the battle lines are drawn.

46
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,960
And when you see a World War I, World War II type event happening, and that's what all

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,400
the think tanks are saying. The CFR, others are saying get ready for World War III. I'm

48
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,760
not saying that, I'm reporting on what they're saying. And there's already just, I don't

49
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,040
know, five, six different nations in war in Africa with the West starting that.

50
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,840
Multiple Middle Eastern nations, just all sorts of craziness going on. We're on the

51
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,600
edge of some very serious things accelerating. So that's all coming up and they're getting

52
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,900
ready to legalize all the illegal aliens. Republicans are telling us this is the time

53
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,000
to submit to the new world order.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,720
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

55
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:11,320
immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

59
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,000
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

60
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,520
at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,600

64
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,060
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

65
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,640
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

66
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,740
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

67

69
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,040
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

70
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,800

71
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,380

75
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,080
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary

76
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,760
economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

77
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,920
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

86
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:16,280
Defending the Republic from enemies born and domestic. It's Alex Jones. It is Monday my

87
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:24,800
friends the 28th day of January 2013. I am your host Alex Jones and whatever time zone

88
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,920
you're listening to us day, night or of course in the morning whether you're a ship at sea.

89
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,800
Our folks even listening as they fly into their local airport. It is good to have you

90
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,160
all tuning into the broadcast today. We're gonna have wide open phones. Let me just go

91
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,280
over the headlines here. Then I'm going to give the number out and then we will drill

92
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,040
into this news and more throughout the day.

93
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,700
But we are gonna have open phones throughout the full three hours today on the economy,

94
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,460
the Second Amendment, the dollar. The news coming out at infowars.com that hacked emails

95
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:06,440
reveal Washington approved plan to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria. Obama administration

96
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:15,080
complicit in war crime. Also, Netanyahu deploy Syrian Iron Dome as Israeli minister claims

97
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,460
US preparing surgical strikes against Iran.

98
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,640
We also have Israel saying that they believe that Al Qaeda is gonna get chemical weapons

99
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,080
so they have to attack the Syrian government who's fighting Al Qaeda. That's Reuters. The

100
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Senate is reaching a deal to open the borders open completely. We're gonna get into all

101
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:43,440
that. In fact, it's amazing to see Jindal and to see even Rand Paul saying we've got

102
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,080
to get with the times as Republicans.

103
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:55,200
And just basically open the borders up. And the Pentagon's announcing they're taking any

104
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,860
crosses down out of chapels. Major denominations are taking the crosses down. I mean, the point

105
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,520
is it's all about social control and then and the Republicans are saying if we just

106
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,420
become the Democrats, then they'll vote for us.

107
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,920
And it's all a giant hoax. Conservatives and libertarians have said on record in the polls

108
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,160
have shown this. They didn't vote for Mitt Romney because he wrote the assault weapons

109
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:30,600
ban in his state and got it passed. The semi auto ban, Massachusetts. He was for open borders.

110
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:40,360
He was for the carbon tax, wrote Obamacare. Do I need to keep listing all this? Again,

111
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,400
people aren't voting.

112
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:48,200
They're voting by digging in and buying firearms. They're voting by stopping to pay income tax

113
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,080
the private Federal Reserve. I mean, they're reporting now 50 something million Americans

114
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:00,000
aren't paying income tax. Good, the illegal aliens don't.

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,840
This is what's happening. The American people, Congress has a 9% approval rating in the last

116
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:11,200
even fake Gallup poll. I'm sure it's lower than that probably. The only way they can

117
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,400
get you to support the government is by having a left right fake fight between Obama and

118
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,960
the Republicans to make you think there's an illusion, sucking you into the debate.

119
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:26,000
And having Obama come out for things so outrageous that then people are forced to go support

120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,060
the Republican establishment. Who then tells them, you know what, if we just give up and

121
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:38,780
basically act like a Democratic Party of the 1990s. And then now the new Democratic Party

122
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,760
acts like Mao Zedong, then we're gonna win.

123
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,240
Well, there's no point in winning that because the globalists have won. And this is how they

124
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,920
got Europe to give up their rights and have on average a 65% federal tax rate. You add

125
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,120
local taxes in, the average European's paying over 80%. The average European is paying over

126
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,360
80%, look it up. In one form or tax or another, that golfer was talking about leaving California

127
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,540
a few weeks ago and got demonized by the media.

128
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,840
So what of the media, the dying dinosaur media demonizes you? And he was saying, a Mickelson

129
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,840
was saying, I'm paying 63, 65% federal and state tax. Well, that's only your state income

130
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:31,520
tax and your federal tax, buh-buh. 40% federal, 13% state and then the property taxes and

131
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,880
the fines, the fees, the regulation taxes, the water taxes, the cell phone taxes.

132
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:43,600
The land use taxes, the hospital district taxes, the light bulb taxes. I mean, there's

133
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,880
hundreds of taxes. Most of them you don't see, they're built in to the bill you get.

134
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,000
Or if you do, it's a big list of fees and add-ons. It's a joke. But if you're a quote,

135
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,960
globalist stakeholder, a Fortune 500, you're pretty much exempt from those taxes because

136
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,600
you lobby and control and have your politicians in there.

137
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:11,240
It's designed so only they can flourish. That's agenda 21. That's royalty 2.0 where the mega

138
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,600
corporations and the old royalty and the big six global banks are all exempt from the rules.

139
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:24,880
Congress is exempt from the Obamacare taxes. They're exempt from the pension taxes that

140
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,520
are now law. They're exempt from insider trading laws. They're exempt from the gun laws in

141
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,840
the new bill.

142
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,000
Think of all the things they're exempt from. They're exempt from everything. Now, I was

143
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,900
reading where Congress people shove a congressional badge and they can walk through the checkpoints.

144
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,320
People ask, well, then why does Ron Paul get harassed? Why does Rand Paul? They refuse

145
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,940
to use the passes to make a point.

146
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:05,600
But this is the model. In fact, studying French royalty, British royalty, German royalty,

147
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,060
Russian royalty in the last 500 years, go study it. It's a fascinating study. There

148
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:19,840
had been reforms in Russia, in England, in the continent of Europe, in Austria, in France,

149
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,240
in the Netherlands in the last 500 years that our forebears fought and died for in huge

150
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,360
wars, huge civil wars so that government wasn't God.

151
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,960
Because before that, the king or any of his designates would simply say, I want your wife,

152
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,800
Prema Noctu, you gotta give her to me. I want your property. You couldn't own a dog unless

153
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,860
the half its digits were cut off so that it couldn't chase the king's game.

154
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:52,740
If you had a sheepdog, it was specially licensed and had several of its paws digits or pads

155
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,440
cut off. You couldn't have a knife unless the end was cut off. You had to have it as

156
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,880
a butcher. There was a tax on it and the end of it was cut off blunt. Death if you were

157
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
found.

158
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:14,120
That's up. Same laws in feudal Japan. Feudalism is what the Club of Rome, the CFR, the UN

159
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:19,720
says they wanna go back to. Take the biological diversity assessment 1996, covered in my film

160
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,000
Road to Tyranny 2001. And I show them, I show copies of the biological diversity assessment

161
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,120
saying neo-feudalism is what we want.

162
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,920
Making people poor so they can be managed and controlled. And so less resources get

163
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,960
used better for the earth. They consciously wanna go back to royalty and the UN, the City

164
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:51,520
of London, the Vatican, Israel to a great extent. And now the mega banks, look it up,

165
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,840
they're pushing to get diplomatic immunity for their carbon taxes.

166
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,620
They already have it at the IMF and World Bank when the mega banks are involved in those

167
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,560
transactions. Now they want it in all of their transactions and to make their derivatives

168
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,120
a global worlds, not national security, global world security operation where they cannot

169
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,920
be investigated. These are just criminals taking it to the limit.

170
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,040
They're con men, so they tell you we are now above the law. And this is what I talked about

171
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:26,480
yesterday. By every definition historically, they are extreme royalty. They are more royal

172
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,680
than a British king 400 years ago. They are more royal than Henry VIII. Henry VIII had

173
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,720
to at least go to kangaroo courts to get a divorce or to kill somebody.

174
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:45,100
Before that, kings would simply say, take him away, take them away, take whoever away.

175
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,460
And he would get lords over the different sectors. Because you might have a good lord

176
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:54,280
for a while, things would flourish, but always a bad one got in because of decadence. And

177
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,300
then they would never get out of power. And they would start marrying their horses about

178
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,040
Caligula or, again, I use the Nero example cuz it's so incredible.

179
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,560
On record, they had these big 24 hour feast. And he would dress up as a werewolf and they'd

180
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:17,800
chain little kids up. And Nero would run in and rip their throats out in a feverish thing

181
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,800
with blood splattering all over him. I mean, that's what you get. I have articles here

182
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:27,500
out of North Korea, Sunday Times of London investigation, confirming that the people

183
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,200
eat their children.

184
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:35,080
And that even the middle classes now go and at the meat markets buy people that have died

185
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,000
of starvation and then just eat the meager meat off the bones. And that was reported

186
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,160
by Vanity Fair like 12 years ago. I was sitting in a haircutting place and saw it and picked

187
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,360
up Vanity Fair. They had an article about it, strangely enough.

188
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,960
The point is, this is total government. This is what it creates, stagnation and collapse.

189
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:04,280
And so the most extreme royalty could just say, take him away to the dungeon. Our forebearers

190
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:12,280
in Europe fought for reforms in revolt after revolt against trained militaries that live

191
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,400
behind the walls of the castle.

192
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,920
And if you dared fight back against trained men in armor, because they killed your dad,

193
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,600
killed your mom, killed your sister. You dared jumped up on one of them, beat their brains

194
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,040
out. Out would come 500 armed men and they would kill sometimes your entire village.

195
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,160
Burn it to the ground, kill everyone. They would come and do inspections of the little

196
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,560
shack huts in the middle of the winter. In some cases when a third of the village was

197
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,280
dying from malnutrition, you gotta go read these accounts.

198
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:52,440
And they would come in and they would say, I smell meat cooking. You've got rabbit stew.

199
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,880
And if you had an attractive daughter, they'd say, I'm gonna sit here and eat the stew.

200
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,600
And then I'm gonna have sex with your daughter. And if you don't like it, I'm gonna kill you.

201
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,700
Now that's if you were lucky, if you were lucky. A lot of times they'd already raped

202
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:14,440
and killed so much, they just say, who do I wanna kill? I think I'll kill your wife.

203
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,840
And they'd come in, and they'd tie your wife down, and they'd slit her throat right in

204
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,960
front of you. How's that sound? You want royalty? You wanna live under royalty? You think that?

205
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:31,200
Cuz they got big flowing robes and big crowns. People magazine, it's so cool. America was

206
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,800
born out of hating this, okay? The enlightenment, the renaissance, all of it was about spitting

207
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,860
on royalty, okay?

208
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,720
And that's why they bad mouth George Washington. That's why they bad mouth our founding fathers,

209
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,840
all of it. Because we are the antidote to their poison. We are the republic. We are

210
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,600
the best there's ever been. And now we're going the opposite direction. And the traitors

211
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,060
in the globalist media everywhere bad mouth our country and our forebearers and the Second

212
00:19:56,060 --> 00:20:00,520
Amendment because they're bringing us back into slavery. The news is coming up.

213
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,380
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

214
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,960
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

215
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,920
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At e Foods

Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors

239
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,280
won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry

240
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,900
won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold has outperformed paper investments

241
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,680
yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

244
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,780
health, more well-being? Hi, this is Pastor Jenny. For 25 years I spent my life's work

245
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:15,120
teaching others how to achieve more. But in 2010 I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops.

246
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,020
I learned that there are millions of gene switches latent in every single cell of my

247
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,740
body that are waiting for an activator. I learned by taking RNA drops I could begin

248
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,400
to activate that power in my cells and achieve the more that I desire. I'd like to share

249
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,480
what I discovered with you and send you a free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at

252
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:08,440
the more that's waiting for you. Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to finish up on the

253
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,140
history lesson and then I'll get into Obama and Piers Morgan playing possum. They always

254
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:18,060
come after the guns then say, oh, they're not coming after them. So everybody settles

255
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,280
down so they can gauge the opposition and then they move forward against the guns again.

256
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,560
I'm going to be breaking that down. We have articles up in fullwars.com. And again, we

257
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,000
expected that just like they wrote the NDAA then said, don't worry, we're against it.

258
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,920
I'm going to veto it so that no opposition would form. Then he still signed it. Then

259
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:43,600
they bring out bills to repeal the NDAA, expanding it to actually get rid of posse commentatis.

260
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,760
So often now they go, oh, we'll pass a bill to ban insider trading. Then the bill legalizes

261
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,320
it. We'll pass a law to stop you being secretly disappeared, where the king says take him

262
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:59,960
away. And a black bag is thrown over your head and you disappear into a spider hole.

263
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,960
And then they have a new NDAA come out that says we just completely get rid of the posse

264
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,920
commentatis. And then it's not even an issue. I mean, we've entered a world of deception

265
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:19,040
where even though I'm focused on it, 16 hours a day conservatively, it's so over the top.

266
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:26,400
It's such a full hologram like spectrum of lies that it even makes me get dizzy.

267
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,060
And that's why a lot of people that trusted the system are now waking up, but they still

268
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,760
have childlike minds. And so they then just believe everything's fake. Again, just because

269
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,640
the media and the government lies doesn't mean that every alternative media is going

270
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,160
to have all the answers. It doesn't mean I'm going to have all the answers.

271
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:50,200
Just because the system is knowingly lying and twisting doesn't then mean that there's

272
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:59,160
some other perfect truth out there as well. Remember that. Now, back to the issue of,

273
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:07,180
let's just take European history because it's dominated the last 200 years. Feudalism settled

274
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:12,960
in in Mesoamerica. Feudalism settled in in China, starting of course with the Chen Dynasties.

275
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,680
It settled in in Japan. It settled in in Africa. Same system, you'd have royal chiefs with

276
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,760
the dominant tribe and generally slave tribes around them who weren't really slaves. They

277
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,060
were mainly light serfs compared to Europeans, but they still had to give fealty and basically

278
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,240
bow down to whatever dominant tribe was in the area.

279
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,720
Same thing with the Native American tribes. I mean, humans set up the same system over

280
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:46,840
and over again. Middle East had the same deal pre-Muhammad, 700 and something years ago.

281
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,840
And so when I say extreme royalty, generally it would be rule of God king where the king

282
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,600
is worshiped as God, the Pharaoh is worshiped as God. And if you criticize in any way, you're

283
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:04,180
not just seen as a traitor, you're seen as insane and as the devil and you are promptly

284
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:08,840
killed or thrown into a hard labor slave bed.

285
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,200
Now, that's been the norm. But Christians, if you go back about 550 years ago in Europe,

286
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,520
lots of different sects started popping up saying no to feudal slavery, no to kings being

287
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:29,840
absolute God men, no to the general public being total slaves, total slaves, total. And

288
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,760
so because some people started to fight back and got some basic rights, well, everybody

289
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,400
still wanted slaves.

290
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:42,560
So the Arab slave trade was going with Africans they were grabbing out of the North and off

291
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:48,360
the Gold Coast. And so these transatlantic slave trade began because nobody, the Christians

292
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,260
weren't gonna put up, the real Christians in different groups, weren't gonna put up

293
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,260
with slaves.

294
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:56,160
They just been slaves. There were revolts all over France, all over Spain, all over

295
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:01,520
what's Portugal, all over, just constant wars by people saying we're not gonna be slaves.

296
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,840
Just like Chinese are revolting right now. They have hundreds of riots a week. Look it

297
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,560
up. People with broom handles fighting troops with machine guns, okay?

298
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,240
So people say China's gonna take over, the globalists are trying to prop it up. It could

299
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,960
collapse at any time and that'd be a good thing for their people. Our government helped

300
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,580
put Mao Zedong in in 49. It's because our government is a traitor government working

301
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,920
for tyranny worldwide.

302
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,200
And we've been taken over for a long time. Now they've just gotten bold in this program.

303
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,020
And so when I say extreme royalty, extreme royalty could just say, take them to the dungeon

304
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,160
off with their head, have you disappear. Royalty would smother their own family members, so

305
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,800
that they wouldn't try to murder them.

306
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:48,160
I mean, it was just the standard. Our forebearers in Europe, if you're European, fought against

307
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:56,960
this, got some basic rights. In countless civil wars, the Dutch settlers, British settlers,

308
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,960
others came over here for religious freedom. And of course, it immediately set up the same

309
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,480
slave system with Indians and blacks and others.

310
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,440
Because just because some people tried to get away from it, the same thing still kept

311
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,200
getting set up. So it's an ongoing generational battle. Now they make you a slave through

312
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,720
a prison record. Or they make you a slave where you've got to work for the government

313
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,880
to have a job. Or they make you take vaccines to have a job.

314
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,000
You see, see, there's all these new forms of high tech slavery, but the biggest slavery

315
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,400
is over the mind. The globalists know how to control your mind and program you, so they

316
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,840
don't have to physically have you chained up out in the barn, knowing you hate their

317
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,340
guts and want to kill them any chance you get.

318
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,960
They have taught us how to love our servitude. And now they're trying to bring back absolute

319
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:44,120
rule of monarchs under the UN, under global national security. Governments are operating

320
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,720
with extreme royal signets. They're operating like tyrant kings.

321
00:29:49,720 --> 00:30:19,600
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

322
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:44,040

323
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:48,960

It really says that the state is God.

342
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:16,620
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states

343
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,860
on earth.

344
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,680
This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

345
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,520
expanded nationwide.

346
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:29,200
Each documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful

347
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,620
shadow state.

348
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,960
Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.

351
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,380
It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

352
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,420
The police state isn't coming.

353
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420

357

You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you

358
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:25,400
want to do, you take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the

359
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,960
rabbit hole goes.

360
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,880
Remember all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.

361
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,560
The answer to 1984 is 1776.

362
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:48,600
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

363
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,920
All right, we're going to have open phones throughout the transmission here today.

364
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,880
I'm going to get into some of the most important news right now.

365
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:03,520
First time callers are welcome but it's just an open free for all.

366
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:13,120
800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 and I did take a lot of calls yesterday once I got to your

367
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,880
call so I'm going to try to move quickly through people, 800-259-9231.

368
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:22,120
It's just the subject of understanding human history.

369
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,680
Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.

370
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,000
That's been said many, many times.

371
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,760
So no one knows who first said that give a man a gun, he can rob a bank.

372
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:45,000
Give a man a bank, he can rob the world but that's when banks use fractional reserve banking

373
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,360
where they loan out $1 for every 10 cents they have on deposit or $10 for every dollar

374
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,280
or $1,000 for every hundred.

375
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,320
Now they don't even do that.

376
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:02,300
They just create off derivatives a trillion off of $1 and then they buy the whole world

377
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,520
because we accept the illusion and the fraud.

378
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,000
The UN tells us they're above the law and that diplomatic immunity for narcotics trafficking,

379
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,920
mass murder, you name it.

380
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,760
The mega banks tell us they have immunity and are above the law.

381
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,480
The police tell us they have immunity and are above the law.

382
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
Not even true.

383
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,740
They tell you it's a privilege to travel.

384
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,740
No it's not.

385
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,600
Now they're saying it's a privilege to own guns.

386
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
No it's not.

387
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,320
But they just tell you over and over again.

388
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,200
Before I get to the news, we've launched two different big operations.

389
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,920
One of them is Operation Sleeping Giant at prisonplanet.tv, Infowars Nightly News.

390
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,360
You can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month, create one username passcode, give it to friends

391
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
and family.

392
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,560
11 people can be logged on simultaneously and we've really upgraded and worked out bugs

393
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
on the site.

394
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,760
We've got 17 years of material, it's been up now 10 years, prisonplanet.tv and I wanna

395
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,920
thank all of you that are members and watch the Nightly News and download the films.

396
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,920
It is an armory of resistance but look, there's no excuse.

397
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,500
Now is the time to go get a membership or to buy a couple memberships because we're

398
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,120
giving it to you at cost.

399
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,080
The goal is just to pay for the bandwidth and then to get people to watch it and say,

400
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,600
hey, here's your free documentary film site.

401
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,280
It's got ebooks, my book, Paul Watson's book.

402
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,400
It's got the daytime radio show so you can watch it.

403
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,780
All the radio listeners on XM, AM and FM.

404
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,440
You should also have prisonplanet.tv memberships so you can watch the high-def archive of the

405
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,200
day show, the nighttime show live, special reports on The Rogue, there's so much there.

406
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,340
Prisonplanet.tv or get a yearly membership and this is gonna end next month.

407
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,480
We do this every holiday season into the new year.

408
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,520
You can get 5.3 months, it comes out to 5.3 months free when you sign up for a year.

409
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,440
You get five plus months off the regular cost and again, 11 people can use it simultaneously.

410
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,300
And unfortunately, not everybody who's got a membership or has been given the code is

411
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,600
gonna use it so it's probably like 20, 30 people could use the same username, passcode.

412
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,980
You may get locked out if more than 11 go log in but that's great news at any one time.

413
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,680
So again, get the membership, I've built the platform, built the news operation.

414
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,680
It's incredible reporters, research, guests.

415
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,480
It's all waiting to go, hey, here's your free alternative real news platform.

416
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,360
You are the Paul Revere, Operation Sleeping Giant.

417
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,360
And then speaking of Paul Revere, we need your help to go to infoawars.com, to go to

418
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,200
our YouTube page, to go to prisonplanet.tv.

419
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,760
Go to infoawars.com forward slash contest, infoawars.com forward slash contest and get

420
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,960

422
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,600
10,000 second, 5,000 third place.

423
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,320
And again, I did this because the money we make goes right back into the operation to

424
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,320
expand.

425
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:11,280
I can't think of a better way, conservatively, I would guess 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 million people

426
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,880
will end up seeing the 1,000 plus films that get made.

427
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,840
It can be three minutes long, it can be fiction, nonfiction, drama, it can be up to two hours

428
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,420
long.

429
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,600
And again, all of you win by entering the contest.

430
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:29,520
We need your help to get infoawars.com forward slash contest to have all of you go on IMDb

431
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,520
who are members of that.

432
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,360
For all of you who are listeners to go on YouTube, for all of you to go to all the film

433
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,360
sites and say, hey, here is this contest.

434
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,120
And you don't know who's out there that's a filmmaker, I saw people saying, I wish I

435
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,640
had a film degree, I'd make a film.

436
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,720
Folks, you go out and show corruption in your area, it isn't even about the quality, it

437
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,040
may be about quality, it's about the heart.

438
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,760
Because I'll tell you the real reason we're doing this is cuz it's a win win.

439
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,720
We will reach tens of millions of people, conservatively, I mean, one film somebody

440
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,440
makes will probably get seen 50 million times if it's like the Obama deception or loose

441
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,040
change that I produced.

442
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,620
And what you do is you defeat the globalist by making a film and that's how you start

443
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,520
your journey of 1,000 miles.

444
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,720
It's the resistance and then we're gonna take the top pool of people, may not even be the

445
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
winners.

446
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,480
This is whoever we can work it out with and come up with plans to launch three films produced

447
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,840
a year with budgets of hundreds of thousands of dollars a piece and then hundreds of thousands

448
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,960
of promotion to put it in theaters and I know that model, we can do it.

449
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,640
We have the platform to promote it and make it work, okay?

450
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,320
Instead of Dinesh D'Souza type stuff out there, we will have our films in the theaters, it's

451
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,720
gonna be huge, absolutely huge.

452
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:56,080
So you get a chance to then have films produced by Infowars, that's the real prize for filmmakers

453
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
out there.

454
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,600
The $100,000 is only the gateway.

455
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,200
That's only the money to get the word out and to have hundreds of topics covered, okay?

456
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,400
It's a way to get you to take action against the globalist as Paul Revere's in your area,

457
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,700
whether it's the Second Amendment, Agenda 21, the New World Order, CPS, the open borders,

458
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,980
public corruption, the military doing drills, now with live fire in major cities every week

459
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:28,240
unannounced to acclimate us to military occupation, infowars.com forward slash contest.

460
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:35,960
And yes, we have the new pro one from Pro Pure, all in one fluoride and it cuts out

461
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,280
the other fluoride derivatives.

462
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:43,520
Nobody has a fluoride filter in one with a silver impregnated ceramic.

463
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Pro one from Pro Pure, discounted 10% off infowarsstore.com or 888-25-3139.

464
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,120
Okay, here's what's coming up after I take your calls and we start the next hour and

465
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,580
then go back into calls.

466
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,320
Law professor on CBS says, let's give up on the Constitution.

467
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,880
Senior Obama official, we're going to kill the dollar.

468
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,160
This is from one of the biggest money managers, hedge fund guys out there, Kyle Bass, who

469
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,160
I wanna get on the show.

470
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:12,160
This is chilling.

471
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,480
He says he met with them, that's what they said.

472
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,960
Brock's Glock in anti-gun DC media matters for America gave bodyguard illegal weapons

473
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,200
to guard founder David Brock.

474
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,800
Man, I tell you, these so-called liberal authoritarians are such cowards that every time I talk to

475
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,320
them, I run into them at CNN or wherever I run into them, they always admit they have

476
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,720
bodyguards.

477
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
Here's Morgan Light about it.

478
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,560
I've seen him on the news admitting bodyguards and being followed by three bodyguards.

479
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,440
They had bodyguards there, they had them following us, looked like detectives to me.

480
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,660
You know, all right, he's coming out, he's coming in, my gosh, there he is.

481
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,960
This is the type of stuff going on.

482
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,440
They have bodyguards, well, they're gonna exempt themselves where they can own guns.

483
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,980
Any government official, not servant, title of nobility, that's a title of nobility when

484
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,420
they're exempt from the laws and they get special perks.

485
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,640
That is what America was founded against.

486
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:14,260
See, you're all taught all day, black, white, Northern Southerner, Easterner, Westerner,

487
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:19,320
Catholic Christian against each other, male, female, gay, straight.

488
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,680
Meanwhile, the government is giving itself titles of nobility and corporations are exempt

489
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,760
from the taxes.

490
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,040
They lobby to get passed, I mean, so they get your tax money.

491
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,880
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they're throwing the kitchen sink at it.

492
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,160
I mean, I see articles where they go, all gun owners are white racists, they are Nazis,

493
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,680
we will defeat them.

494
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,520
Don't wage war against them.

495
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,520
Just bizarro stuff while Obama plays the good cop going, I go hunting, I want guns, I won't

496
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,960
take your guns.

497
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,200
He's back to saying he won't take his guns when they've got something like 15 bills introduced

498
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,000
last time I checked.

499
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,040
To ban ammo, tax ammo, make you turn guns in, banning thousands, not 158, it's 158 basic

500
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,360
designs and all their variants.

501
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,960
It's thousands of guns.

502
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Thousands of guns.

503
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,080
It's just all out and Obama's like, here's a quote.

504
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,640
He said that he's understandable that people are protective of their family traditions

505
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,640
when it comes to hunting.

506
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,880
It's not about hunting, buddy.

507
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,580
So quote, gun control advocates also need to do, quote, a little more listening than

508
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,160
they do sometimes in debate.

509
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,620
Did you hear that?

510
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:35,680
And see, Piers Morgan comes out and says, I've lost the gun control debate.

511
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,720
He's gonna be another mass shooting with the hype they've been doing.

512
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,040
They've got computer algorithms.

513
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,800
They know a nut's gonna copycat.

514
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,600
And if that doesn't happen, well, they'll have to help, won't they?

515
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:49,120
They'll just have to have somebody under a DARPA mind control contract for 30 something

516
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:56,560
thousand a year and with an Air Force psychiatrist over them, something will just have to happen,

517
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,560
won't it?

518
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Of course, they would stage Fast and Furious that killed thousands, which it came out to

519
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,760
blame the Second Amendment.

520
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,120
The memos were doing this, subordinates are complaining, but they've been told it's for

521
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,280
a gun control push.

522
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,400
Imagine the ATF people picked because they'll follow orders and are bullies.

523
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,080
The most nasty federal agency out there cuz it comes out of the whiskey regulators.

524
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Look into that whole story.

525
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:26,760
They were just mutineous, mutineous, a new word, absolutely out of control, piratical

526
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,080
group against the Constitution and the Whiskey Wars and all the rest of it.

527
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,520
That was one of the first federal agencies to go outside its jurisdiction.

528
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,040
Even they're like, why are we doing this?

529
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,200
They're like, well, we're gonna blame the Second Amendment.

530
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,920
Okay, I see.

531
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,520
See, there's no end to what they could pull.

532
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:47,760
So they're playing possum right now with Obama goes hunting, we go skeet shooting in Camp

533
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,480
David, everything's all right.

534
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,920
Come on, come on.

535
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,600
Would I lie to you, baby, when I say something that wasn't true?

536
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:03,240
Tell me, honey, would the government lie to you?

537
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,680
And the answer is, of course, they don't lie.

538
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
I mean, they're good.

539
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,080
Piers Morgan said there were no riots last year in London or in England.

540
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,080
He said, no, there weren't.

541
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,200
And he goes, I don't have bodyguards when I debated him.

542
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Why not?

543
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,360
He has nothing but disdain for you.

544
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,920
He's an enemy operative.

545
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,400
I had Time Magazine call me up the other day, and I just said, you're an enemy operative.

546
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,880
And I said, I know what you're doing, and the guy was laughing.

547
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:27,880
And I said, don't laugh.

548
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,880
You know it's true.

549
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,480
And I'm done talking to you.

550
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,480
You're an enemy operative.

551
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,080
See, we got to totally recognize it or there's no future.

552
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,800
You either see it for what it is and stop, I mean, look at the Republican leadership

553
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,040
telling you, we got to do what the Democrats say.

554
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,040
That's how we're going to win.

555
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,560
I mean, what a sellout mind game fraud.

556
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:54,360
What a psyop, because the very same mega bank interest that run the Democrats have all financed

557
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,920
them and they're telling them, you get this done if you want to be president.

558
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,720
You get this done, Senator.

559
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:06,300
You get this done, House member, if you want to be part of this, you play ball while they

560
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,760
gear up for the collapse of the dollar and all out.

561
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,280
See, that's what Congress is getting in line.

562
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,240
They're being told, yeah, there's going to be blood in the streets, martial law, just

563
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:21,720
like Paulson told Congress four years ago, four plus years ago now.

564
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:31,360
So coming up, but again, Obama says you need to do a little more listening than you do

565
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,360
sometimes.

566
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:37,440
Imagine, a known liar patronizing you going, I don't want your guns, I never want to come

567
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,440
take them.

568
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,880
You need to do a little more listening, he said in a speech yesterday, and he's saying

569
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:42,880
it again today.

570
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:47,040
I don't want your guns, how ridiculous.

571
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,040
There's no big government.

572
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,320
Now, I'm not going to raise taxes on anybody's payroll unless they make over a quarter million

573
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
a year.

574
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,180
They raise it on people making way lower than that.

575
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:05,360
They know exactly what they are doing.

576
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:09,240
All right, let's start going to the phone calls now.

577
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:16,280
I haven't even scratched the surface yet, DHS buys 7,000 full auto assault rifles, calls

578
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:24,160
them personal defense weapons, full auto, which you don't need unless you're mowing

579
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,160
whole crowds down.

580
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:30,080
I mean, by the way, there's this fetishizing full auto, I wouldn't want full auto unless

581
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:41,560
I was guarding a fortified emplacement expecting to face human wave attacks.

582
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:45,720
Was it good during Chinese human wave attacks in North Korea?

583
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,200
In the Korean War?

584
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
Yeah.

585
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:53,120
Would it be good in a foxhole with a heavy machine gun being charged?

586
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,600
Yeah.

587
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:58,880
But they're worthless anywhere else.

588
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,920
Anywhere else they are worthless, worthless, worthless, worthless.

589
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,480
They are only good, which the army's been training for, and the Marines, they put it

590
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,640
on the news, where they train to fight US citizens in human waves, they mow them down.

591
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,980
And we got footage of that, people couldn't believe it.

592
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,480
Now they just say, we're having a fun game.

593
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,800
We're practicing mowing down zombies wearing football jerseys.

594
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,520
That's how they, again, it's all a big joke on us.

595
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,560
And now they're getting weapons, the only thing they're good for, and even then they're

596
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:36,440
not good, in my view, especially with these handheld fully auto, is to hold the weapon

597
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,360
down or have it on a tripod and just shoot across a crowd of people running at you.

598
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:46,200
And even then you don't want that, you want to go double tap each person.

599
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,480
But see, this is what idiots thrown into marksmanship want.

600
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,440
This is exactly, you like the New York cops that shot nine people, and then the media

601
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,700
tried to cover it up and say, one guy done it, when it was one guy shooting somebody

602
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:01,400
else and the cops just shoot, well, at least it was more than nine, wasn't it?

603
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:05,440
Just start firing wildly, cuz they watch Hollywood movies.

604
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:10,600
That's their idea of how to use a firearm.

605
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:18,360
DHS buys 7,000 full auto assault rifles, calls them personal defense weapons.

606
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,640
And again, they're saying, we got a federal law where all federal employees and all police

607
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:28,120
period, you're exempt from gun laws even after you're out of government, you are now God.

608
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,920
And they say, well, we got to protect ourselves, criminals will have guns and it's all a big

609
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,920
joke.

610
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,160
We're gonna take your guns and we're exempt.

611
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,920
How's that sound, scum?

612
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,280
And we're exempt from insider trading.

613
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:43,080
And power plants owned by the globalists, they're exempt.

614
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:46,480
Everybody else's, a bunch of big power plants being shut down today, one of the biggest

615
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,360
in Texas.

616
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,920
Brand new power plants that were built will never be opened.

617
00:49:50,920 --> 00:50:00,520
And you're gonna pay more because see, the general public is literally in la la land

618
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,880
right now, and has no idea even what planet they're living on.

619
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,880
Here's some of the other ones.

620
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,960
Some of the other headlines we've got on the Second Amendment, Barack Obama, I go shooting

621
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,520
all the time, we're gonna get into that.

622
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,160
Big cities finance, war on guns may backfire, business week.

623
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,320
Bloomberg saying, well, I've already tried to sue gun manufacturers, it doesn't work.

624
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,320
And I've already tried to get money pulled out of them.

625
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:29,000
But these are such valuable stocks, everybody just buys them up.

626
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,920
Obama manual saying, banks shouldn't take any gun owners as customers, they shouldn't

627
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,360
take gun shops, that's called racketeering.

628
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,000
That's how a godfather would operate.

629
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,480
Yeah, you know what, you're not gonna be able to do any business.

630
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,480
We're gonna shut you down, it's outside of law, all right?

631
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,840
And I got articles here with the ATF showing up at gun shops and saying, it's legal to

632
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,200
sell semi-auto, but if you don't, stop selling, we're gonna shut you down, okay?

633
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:57,040
And they even tell him, quote, I'm not here to bust your chops, but don't make me hurt

634
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:00,480
yous.

635
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,220
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

636
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:09,160
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

637
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,160
Here's why.

638
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,240
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.

639
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,880
And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity

640
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,920
from the sun.

641
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,320
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

642
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,960
Now here's the best part.

643
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,640
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

644
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,800
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of

645
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,800
each year.

646
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,540
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

647
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,760
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

648
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,300
Don't wait, they go fast.

654

Those we should be able to depend on, let us down.

655
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,260
Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in

656
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:18,320
Bell Harbor say show me.

657
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,760

If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.

666

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,700

668

00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,480
byproducts from municipal water via the black Berkey and PF line of filters.

670
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,480

Big Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water.

684
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:14,440
The preacher man says it's the end of time In the Mississippi River she's a-goin' dry

685
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:25,640
interest is up and the stock market's down And you're only gettin' mugged if you go downtown

686
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:31,560
I live back in the woods, you see A woman and the kids and the dogs and the

687
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
blues

688
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,040
Alright, we got two plus hours coming up here, just chock full of globalist treason.

689
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,920
They've decided to go whole hog because they know everything's gonna collapse.

690
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:43,000
They've decided to destroy the dollar.

691
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,120
We've got them on record with that.

692
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:52,600
It's just gonna be unmitigated and the power structure knows this and so it's us or them.

693
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:53,600
They're committed.

694
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,080
You have to understand that in police and military, it's time to decide which side you're

695
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,400
on and not just go buy guns and get ready for a civil war.

696
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,840
You don't want that to happen.

697
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,140
We want to push to turn this around peacefully and the globalists may back off if we do that.

698
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:11,800
Right now they're so concerned, they're backing off going, we don't want your guns.

699
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:18,560
Okay, you win until they stage the next event or use the next event that they provocateur

700
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,980
or the next real event to say, see, we told you so.

701
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,000
We're the good guys against violence.

702
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,080
It's like saying, I'm the president and I'm against cancer.

703
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,320
And anytime there's cancer, it's the fault of libertarians.

704
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,760
Oh, another cancer case, see, you didn't give me more power to fix that.

705
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,600
I mean, they know out of 315 million people, there'll be more shootings.

706
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,360
And they hope the public doesn't learn that crime has dropped by close to half.

707
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:46,440
They hope the public doesn't, well, they just want to get up there and be emotional.

708
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,260
We care so much and distract you from what they've done to the economy, to their looting,

709
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,320
to their fast and furious, to Solyndra, to all the corruption, to all their bodyguards,

710
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:04,180
to them trying to pass a law where they're exempt, I mean, that's unprecedented.

711
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:11,800
And then the Chicago mob boss, I mean, unbelievably corrupt, called the Godfather by the great

712
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:19,860
people of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel says, quote, we need to lean on the big banks to not do

713
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:24,160
business with any type of gun business.

714
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,360
I mean, that's called torturous interference.

715
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,000
That's what the mafia does.

716
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,080
Bad things are gonna, I mean, the ATF, and I'm talking to the gun dealers right now,

717
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,200
I'm trying to get them on air, they're obviously all scared.

718
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,760
Folks, if you give in to fear, it's all over.

719
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,400
Start the second hour and go directly to your calls, I promise.

720
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,000
We're gonna break in about three minutes.

721
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,680
Folks, see, I don't have courage, I got instinct, okay, where I get upset by bullies and scum

722
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,720
and people pushing me around, okay?

723
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:55,780
You've got to find that American instinct again and just say, look, I don't care how

724
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:59,880
this ends, I'm not gonna get down and kiss your big, ugly butt.

725
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:00,880
You understand?

726
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,880
It isn't happening.

727
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,120
Do you understand that?

728
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,120
I don't care.

729
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,560
I mean, I'm telling you, it feels so good to be committed.

730
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:12,400
And if these people want a war, don't worry, they're gonna get one and they're gonna run.

731
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,600
That's why they don't care if there's a war, they've done it in other countries over and

732
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
over again.

733
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,800
It's in the IMF World Bank, 112-point plan leaked in 2002.

734
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,360
They'll all pull out while there's a civil war here.

735
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,960
But listen, when we get the country back, we're gonna come get you under law.

736
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,680
Just like there were Nazi hunters, there's gonna be globalist hunters, and we're gonna

737
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,480
take you back here for a trial.

738
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,320
You're not getting away with this new world order, and they're all buying houses in Switzerland.

739
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,480
They're all buying houses in South America.

740
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,440
They're all buying houses in the Cook Islands.

741
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,360
Most of these globalists have left the country, folks.

742
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,240
Does that sound like they're very confident?

743
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,320
They have already evacuated the Death Star, okay?

744
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,800
They've all evacuated the Death Star.

745
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,000
You know why they've evacuated?

746
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,240
Because they know we're gonna blow this thing sky high, politically.

747
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,920
The question is, how bad is it gonna get?

748
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,920
So that's one reason they're getting even more criminal, is they're realizing they're

749
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:05,920
not gonna make it.

750
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,040
I can see where this is going, folks.

751
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,720
They're not gonna make it unless they cause World War III.

752
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,280
They need a big enough, giant, crazy war with nukes going off and bioweapons where everybody

753
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,000
gets scared and goes, I'll do what you're saying, I'll do what you're saying.

754
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,160
And you're not gonna make it out of that either.

755
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,360
You guys are going down like Hitler.

756
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,160
I mean, the communist Chinese, Mao was so bad they finally arrested his wife and made

757
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,160
him step down.

758
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,840
The same thing's gonna happen to you guys.

759
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,040
You are bad for business.

760
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,640
Even the criminal syndicates are gonna bring you down.

761
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:50,480
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

762
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,440
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

763
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,040
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

764
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,880
by a disastrous economy?

At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

767
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,320
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

768
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,880
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

769
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,680
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

770
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,680
and niece.

771
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,480
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

772
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,720
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

779
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:10,040
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:39,320
I covered just a cornucopia of key news and information in the last hour.

01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,920
I am your host, Alex Jones.

787
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,920
Let's go to your calls.

788
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,120
We've got a Todd, Truth Raider, Terry, Danny, Anti-New World Order, and many others.

789
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:50,320
The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231.

790
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,120
Todd in California, you're on the air.

791
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,120
Go ahead.

792
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,440
Hey, good afternoon and good morning to you, Alex Jones.

793
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:59,640
I've been a long, long-time listener, first-time caller.

794
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,640
Thank you for taking my call.

795
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:01,640
Thank you for calling, brother.

796
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,640
I have several questions.

797
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,720
I would like to start an impeachment process here in California against Dianne Feinstein,

798
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,080
Boxer and Pelosi.

799
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:17,560
Obviously, they have implicated themselves in financial fraudery.

800
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:24,520
And I've looked up several places online on how to do that, and I might even just take

801
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:31,040
this opportunity also to start the process in my filming of the whole process.

802
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,200
And what would you recommend that I do?

803
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,960
I know Mark Dice is out here, and I would actually like to get with him as well.

804
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,360
Oh, yeah, he's a super guy.

805
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,360
Go work with him.

806
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:41,360
That's a great idea.

807
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:47,440
What great work he's done, like when he did the video, people ought to go check it out,

808
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:52,040
where he went and talked about how they were zombies on the Black Friday deal.

809
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:54,320
Just a great, great journalistic idea.

810
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,080
Todd, I think you ought to do that.

811
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:03,200
So what is your kind of, or not kind of, but what would your recommendation be?

812
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:10,180
And by the way, just to let you know, as I'm calling in, I have turned on a probably over

813
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:16,200
2,000 people to your website, to your radio show, so I know they're listening to me right

814
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,200
now.

815
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:22,480
So as I'm speaking to you, I know there's hundreds of people that know me that are listening,

816
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,840
and I want to start this process within this week.

817
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,920
Well, I mean, by the way, we need to just point out that just because they say it's

818
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,200
legal to insider trade, you know, again, Congress has said it's okay to own people before.

819
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,480
That doesn't mean it's really legal.

820
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:41,040
We need to just talk about Feinstein, went to Congress with less than a million, and

821
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,440
now some estimates are 150 million, some are as low as 76 million.

822
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,760
And we'd like to know why biotech companies with no employees or no money get a $25 million

823
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,620
bill she sponsored, and then she gets a couple million of it the next day after they get

824
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:57,620
that money.

825
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,960
So, you know, it's time.

826
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:04,200
I would make a documentary, that's an idea of going and being in front of her office

827
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,480
or her house every day, and just showing what she does.

828
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,200
I mean, it's time to let these gangsters know that we know where they live.

829
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:15,080
You think you're gonna take our guns and exempt yourself and you're gonna have the guns?

830
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:17,880
You think you're gonna walk all over us, you witch?

831
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,960
We're done, we're done.

832
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,920
We're not your slaves, you big bucket of pus, you maggot-filled rat.

833
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,760
I appreciate your call, Todd, thanks for the call.

834
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,800
Let's talk to Truth Raider.

835
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,800
You're on the air, go ahead.

836
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,320
Greetings, Alex, and to all the listeners out there in the info world.

837
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,320
Hey, buddy, go ahead.

838
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,000
Well, I'm no longer sick.

839
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,440
I've taken my Beyond Tangy Tangerine and I'm detoxing for freedom.

840
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,560
Good job, brother, very exciting.

841
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,560
Right, two things.

842
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:53,480
Today, let's stop and take a moment to reflect the seven people who lost their lives today

843
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:55,240
in the spatial discovery.

844
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:59,480
All right, I appreciate your call.

845
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,440
Let's go to Terry in Georgia.

846
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,440
You're on the air, go ahead.

847
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,440
Hey, Alex, how are you?

848
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,440
Good, go ahead.

849
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:12,160
Yeah, I got something for you.

850
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:18,840
We have, of course, the NDAA, which is totally unconstitutional, but they don't follow the

851
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,160
Constitution anyway, so it doesn't really matter.

852
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:29,600
The problem that I have is a judge says, hey, we're not going to, no, this is not a constitution,

853
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:34,520
we're not going to accept this, this is not for the American people, and then their lawyers

854
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,800
go around, turn around, and overturn it right away.

855
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:46,400
The problem that we have is that information is at the speed of light, and with that information,

856
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,480
like back in 1776, information didn't travel like this, they're spying on everything that

857
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,480
we do.

858
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:55,680
But that's good, we can turn that around against them.

859
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:02,560
So what if the criminals spy, they know about our numbers surging.

860
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:08,840

other harmful pathogens.

01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:41,560
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

We are back.

904
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:33,320
It is Monday, the 28th day of January 2013.

905
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:38,100
Hard to believe the first month of 2013 is almost gone.

906
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:45,400
And coming up, CBS News says it's time to, quote, give up on the Constitution.

907
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,700
Senior Obama official says we're going to kill the dollar.

908
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,700
That's a quote.

909
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,280
We're going to be playing video of that.

910
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:58,400
Act emails reveal Washington approved plan to stage chemical weapons attack in Syria.

911
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,400
Obama administration complicit in war crime, question mark.

912
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:07,120
Attack helicopters let loose with machine gun fire over Miami.

913
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:09,600
That's up at infowars.com.

914
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,000
This and much more.

915
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,200
Piers Morgan in Politico declares that the best interview he ever had was Alex Jones

916
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,960
and that this will be used to defeat gun owners.

917
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,820
He said that January 17th.

918
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:25,520
Now he's declaring they've lost today on his Twitter and that gun owners are all up in

919
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,520
an uproar.

920
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:27,520
Yeah, why?

921
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,960
Why didn't you have me back, Piers?

922
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,840
Why aren't all the other shows having me on it?

923
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,160
I'm so discrediting.

924
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,900
You see, Paul Revere rode and screamed arms to arms.

925
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:37,900
The redcoats are coming.

926
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:42,520
He didn't go up there and say, nah, nah, hi, I know it sounds like a conspiracy theory,

927
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,120
but the government's corrupt, you know.

928
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:49,400
That's why it was a big victory, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm not putting perfume on

929
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,400
a pig.

930
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,680
I analyzed it, what happened, and decided I did the right thing.

931
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,640
I prayed to God that I would do the best thing when I went in there against the enemy.

932
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:03,400
And I told him after the interview, I said, you are an enemy and I will rout you out.

933
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,880
You are a gangster thug and you will be defeated and all of you are on notice.

934
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,360
Those CNN crew, multiple women were crying and freaking out.

935
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:16,400
The men were hyperventilating and I said, I know who you are, traitors.

936
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,880
I marched out of there.

937
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,440
I didn't go in there and, you're so big, you've got such a big set, you're so powerful.

938
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,360
We're not gonna get this country back playing patty cake.

939
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,080
Does the dawn of Chicago Emmanuel play nice?

940
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,400
He's saying, we're gonna lean on gun manufacturers and banks, we're just gonna shut them down

941
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,000
outside of law.

942
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:43,120
That's called torturous interference, racketeering by any yardstick.

943
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,040
This is what we're talking about.

944
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,020
This is what we're dealing with.

945
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,280
And we're not going to get our country back playing patty cake.

946
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,320
We're gonna get it back going, we know who you are.

947
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,560
We know foreign banks have hijacked the government.

948
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,240
We know you're illegitimate and don't stage something.

949
01:10:57,240 --> 01:11:00,780
And even if something happens, giving up our rights doesn't keep us safe.

950
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:03,160
So don't you blow something up and blame it on us.

951
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,440
We're watching you.

952
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:09,200
You understand that?

953
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,320
We're watching you and we know what's going on.

954
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,020
The time for games is over.

955
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,200
People probably notice I'm a lot more serious on air.

956
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,620
I used to joke around, have a little bit more fun on air.

957
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,880
People notice behind the scenes, there's no more games.

958
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,320
This is game time, folks, in the battle for the Republican humanity.

959
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:27,140
This is a life and death situation.

960
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:30,520
This is the real world, this isn't a game.

961
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:32,240
I'm not up here playing games.

962
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:33,960
I know where I live.

963
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,920
I know where the world is.

964
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,320
I know where I stand.

965
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:41,320
I know how dark the times are.

966
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:45,440
That's just some of what's coming up, ladies and gentlemen.

967
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:52,380
DHS buys 7,000 full auto assault rifles, calls them personal defense weapons.

968
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,200
Government wants to exempt itself from gun laws.

969
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:58,600
All government officials will no longer be called servants, but officials exempt from

970
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:04,580
all their laws, from insider trading to senators with quote underage prostitutes.

971
01:12:04,580 --> 01:12:05,800
They're above the law.

972
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:10,560
And ABC News goes and talks to the senator in an interview never asked about the underage

973
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:19,000
prostitutes or the convicted sex offender for child abuse working in his office.

974
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,480
I mean, these people are sick.

975
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,120
Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in Tennessee.

976
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:25,120
You're on the air, Danny.

977
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,120
Thank you for holding.

978
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,320
Hey, thanks, Alex, for taking my call.

979
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,040
I've been listening about 15 years.

980
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,900
I think I called you once, maybe 12 years ago.

981
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:37,800
But anyway, no, I'm right with you as far as Piers Morgan.

982
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,720
I was very pleased the way you handled that.

983
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,480
I'm actually calling about a situation this morning.

984
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,920
I went to Walmart to pick up a 10-22.

985
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:46,920
They happen to have one.

986
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,840
I hold a valid New York driver's license and I live in New York and in Tennessee.

987
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:57,520
I went there and they were doing the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation check and the person

988
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,960
on the other line was giving my salesperson a hard time saying that he has a New York

989
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:04,560
driver's license.

990
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,800
He cannot buy a Ruger 10-22 in Tennessee.

991
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,800
I thank the Lord.

992
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,420
The woman was thinking and she looked at her chart and said, well, apparently you're wrong

993
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:19,440
or this chart is wrong because New York is a valid place to, you know, I can sell to

994
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:20,960
someone from New York and Tennessee.

995
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,320
They went back and forth.

996
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,800
She actually argued with the guy and finally the guy gave in and let me purchase the TBL.

997
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:27,800
Let me stop you.

998
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:33,940
I've talked to two different gun dealers and then I'm also getting emails from gun dealers

999
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:39,160
and I should wipe the phones out later and open it up for FFL, federal firearms licensee

1000
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,160
dealers.

1001
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:43,760
And I'm trying to get these guys on air, but obviously they get intimidated.

1002
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:44,760
The ATF comes in.

1003
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:45,760
They did this last year.

1004
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,040
Remember when we were given some documents that were then made national news?

1005
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:59,720
Were ATF in five western states, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California just

1006
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:00,720
said outside of law.

1007
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:01,720
They tried to pass the law.

1008
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:02,720
They couldn't.

1009
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:07,040
They put letters in and the ATF visited saying you will report to us and open a criminal

1010
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:13,160
file when someone buys more than two rifles or handguns at one time or two or more.

1011
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,200
And again, they're already when you call in, it's already in the next system.

1012
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:17,300
There's already a record.

1013
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,280
They just wanted to test outside the law.

1014
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:25,280
Now they say that and the ATF is now going in saying you're going to stop selling semi-autos

1015
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,080
or we're going to go through all your records and find a T that's not crossed and I that's

1016
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,080
not dotted.

1017
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,520
By the way, they arrest you for that.

1018
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,960
That's why now they're all going to computerize systems so you can't make a mistake because

1019
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,640
if there's a mistake, it'll kick it back.

1020
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:40,840
But then that also computerizes it makes it easier for the ATF.

1021
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:42,680
That's the problem.

1022
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:47,220
And so they're harassing good gun dealers, but they've ordered to give guns to drug cartels

1023
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:50,680
so they can blame all gun dealers and it's how this mafia operates.

1024
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:53,520
And so what you're experiencing is happening to everybody.

1025
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,080
I've talked to people who went to gun shows personally.

1026
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,860
I've had the calls where you're buying a clip, a 10 round clip, and they follow you out the

1027
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:05,960
door and ask you who you are like the clips that we're the new criminal class.

1028
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:12,640
The entire Homeland Security apparatus, they admit behind the scenes for a decade was going

1029
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:13,840
to be for us.

1030
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:14,840
People are like, how did you know that?

1031
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,100
You say Homeland Security is not for gun owners because it always was.

1032
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:21,280
It was never about Al Qaeda that these offshore banks run.

1033
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,280
I'm sorry.

1034
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,280
Go ahead.

1035
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,280
Oh, no, no.

1036
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,280
Continue on.

1037
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,480
I'm not definitely listening and I just, I was curious if other people have experienced

1038
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:29,480
that.

1039
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:34,080
But I am thankful for this woman who actually thought and defended what was true.

1040
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:43,520
Well, Emanuel and all of them have said Schumer, Emanuel, Pelosi, who's the other one?

1041
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:49,160
Bloomberg have all said, we're going to put pressure on the manufacturers and the sellers

1042
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,880
to just voluntarily comply.

1043
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:57,440
Well, that's like the TSA ran checkpoints all over downtown Austin last Thursday.

1044
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,220
And then I got reports again over the weekend, but I can't just stake out Lamar.

1045
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,600
That's where they're doing it.

1046
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,080
And on South Lamar and then up into the city.

1047
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,640
And they just show up with Austin police.

1048
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:12,480
They have guns and they say, lay your bags out, get out of your car, get off the train,

1049
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,640
and we're gonna search you.

1050
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:16,240
And then when they go, what about the Fourth Amendment?

1051
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:18,600
They told the news, well, they volunteered.

1052
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:26,040
Armed men have their lights on and armed feds with guns on their hip and guns on their,

1053
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:30,640
they wear them commando style on their thigh.

1054
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,220
Armed men, sure, I would say, Fourth Amendment, you can't search my bag.

1055
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:37,560
But most people literally cower.

1056
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:40,180
They're the royalty, we're the scum.

1057
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:43,280
And it's just color of law, gangsterism.

1058
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:49,820
America is, government at every level is teaming up against us, swarming us, dominating us.

1059
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:53,480
State police pull you over in Texas now, and I'm getting reports all over the country.

1060
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:57,920
They go, got any firearms in your car, no, but if I did, they're legal.

1061
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:58,920
What do you got at home?

1062
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,120
Where do you live?

1063
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,720
Is this your right driver's license?

1064
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:06,420
And folks, they're doing this to, again, totally clean cut people.

1065
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:10,880
They got a database on you, they know you have no record, and they look at you like

1066
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,240
a criminal cuz you're the milk cow.

1067
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:18,200
They get promoted, all of it's being recorded, they have a microphone on their tie.

1068
01:17:18,200 --> 01:17:22,760
And it's reviewed, they get promoted if they savage the American people.

1069
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,360
I mean, this is a revolution of secret police activity.

1070
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:29,600
Cuz you know, we have the article last week, they're announcing and they're putting in

1071
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:34,440
audio in major hotels saying, if you see bags, please call the police.

1072
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,880
The waiters are on a computer system at the hotel bars and restaurants, they're listening

1073
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:40,880
to you.

1074
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,920
They're filling out data, when the bartender's talking to you now, I mean, this is in press

1075
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,480
releases, they're filling out FBI files on you.

1076
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,360
I mean, it's stazzy out in the open.

1077
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:53,640
I mean, do you understand the magnitude of this, sir?

1078
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,040
I certainly do, I certainly do.

1079
01:17:56,040 --> 01:18:00,160
And I like to tell your listeners, too, that we have a group of people, we're friends,

1080
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:03,200
and we've listened to you for quite a while.

1081
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,880
And apparently, we're conspiracy theorists, too.

1082
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:10,680
But actually, I look at it as we're conspiracy realists, because for the Christians out there,

1083
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,400
Satan is the biggest conspirator of them all.

1084
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:20,440
When you have a massive amount of people who are against Christ, they side with Satan,

1085
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,560
and he is a conspirator from day one.

1086
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:29,580
So I like how our opponents make us look crazy, we're actually not.

1087
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:35,360
But another thing I'd like to state is, when it looks like there's no hope and that we

1088
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:39,800
are a minority, it doesn't matter, because I believe that the Lord is truly on our side.

1089
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:45,440
He is on the side of truth and righteousness, and as long as we uphold that, he will bless

1090
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,440
that.

1091
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,760
Amen to that, brother, and I appreciate your call, Danny.

1092
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:56,120
Yeah, the feds were involved two years ago in a sting at the Austin gun shows to try

1093
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:04,280
to shut them down, so the city could, outside of law, order the private owners of different

1094
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:12,360
facilities to not let them have gun shows there, racketeering.

1095
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,200
And it turned out they would send in illegal aliens with real driver's license the state

1096
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:22,040
had given them, and then they would present real licenses, fraudulently given by the state,

1097
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,520
a fraud.

1098
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,840
And then private sellers, their private gun, not a gun dealer, you have to have a federal

1099
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,720
license to be a gun dealer, they would do the private sale, people selling off their

1100
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:32,440
gun collection.

1101
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,760
And then they would put that person in jail with a kangaroo jury that was so ignorant,

1102
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:39,880
saying, well, he sold an illegal alien, yeah, but he had a real license.

1103
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:43,600
The judge would say, you are to convict.

1104
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,920
I mean, this is the racketeering.

1105
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,000
They are gonna persecute and fill the prisons with gun owners, and turning your guns in

1106
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
won't help.

1107
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:55,320
They're gonna take everything, pension funds, stocks, bonds, this is a criminal takeover.

1108
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:00,700
We'll be right back with more of your call, stay with us.

1109
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,680
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1110
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,260
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1111
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:12,120
by a disastrous economy?

1112
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,840
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1113
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:18,640
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1114
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,560
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1115
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:26,100
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

1116
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:30,920
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1117
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,920
and niece.

1118
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,720
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1119
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,960
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

1120
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:40,320
Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

1125
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,600
It's time for a home security quiz.

1126
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,600
Answer this.

1127
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:07,800
What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into

1128
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,400
thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is

1129
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:16,680
recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?

1130
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,280
Yes, it's fake TV.

1131
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:23,680
This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually

1132
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:28,120
picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.

1133
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:33,040
Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching

1134
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,120
TV by simulating the light from a real TV.

1135
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:39,120
It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.

1136
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:43,840
And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure

1137
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,120
house or one that's been ransacked.

1138
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:51,400
Go to faketv.com or call 1-877-5FAKETV.

1139
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:55,040
That's 877-532-5388.

1140
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,280
Or go to faketv.com.

1141
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:00,280
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

1142
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:04,240
Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the

1143
01:22:04,240 --> 01:22:05,640
last 90 days?

1144
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,800
Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your retirement plans?

1145
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,680
Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic?

1146
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:20,240
Put another way, who cares if your investments go up 10%, but you lose 40% of your purchasing

1147
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:21,240
power.

1148
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,960
Gold is the only monetary asset as no one else's liability.

1149
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,840
Gold still buys the same amount of stuff it always did.

1150
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,280
Gold does not require trust in a third party.

1151
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,900
You can possess it in your hand.

1152
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,360
You can take it with you.

1153
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,480
Gold is real money.

1154
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,800
Gold is honest money.

1155
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,120
My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources.

1156
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:42,420

1159
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,040
800-686-2237, extension 134.

1160
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,360
Don't throw away leftovers.

1161
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:06,000
Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,

1162
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,560
and more into the Bokashi.

1163
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,140
If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or

1164
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:15,880
the smell, then check out the EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Tereganics.

1165
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,080
Finally a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop

1166
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,440
using fertilizers.

1167
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,840
The EM Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.

1168
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,160
Rather than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste so it

1169
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:32,640
takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning and no

1170
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,000
obnoxious odors.

1171
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,600

Tereganics.

1178
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:24,600
Your life's getting better.

1179
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:36,000
You know, sometimes I do special reports and things, and I'm very calm and people like

1180
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
it.

1181
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,840
But you can't argue with success.

1182
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:44,600
I genuinely start hyperventilating and getting upset on air when I realize this is all real.

1183
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,740
I've studied history.

1184
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:48,800
It's not hard to figure out what's happening.

1185
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,920
The government now admits it's totally illegitimate and above the law.

1186
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:53,920
And we're in trouble.

1187
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,340
I mean, we're in trouble.

1188
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,320
Everywhere you go, the corporations are training all their employees to be spies.

1189
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,040
And they're not looking for all kind of terrorist folks.

1190
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,040
They're looking for the American people.

1191
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:12,520
They're looking for patriots and constitutionalists and veterans and gun owners and conservatives.

1192
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:19,520
And this is outrageous that they're calling us Nazis and criminals and baby killers, collectively

1193
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,120
putting the guilt on us to try to have a purge against us.

1194
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:27,080
This is just the setup when they blow up some federal buildings and blame it on us or stage

1195
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:28,080
a mass shooting.

1196
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,640
This is just the beginning, and that's what I wanna relay to you.

1197
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:38,160
The globalists are planning to use a civil war that they'll call terrorism, they'll call

1198
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:44,920
us terrorist if we resist going to FEMA camps, as a political cover to their implosion of

1199
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:45,920
the economy.

1200
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:48,160
Now, I don't think they're gonna get away with it.

1201
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:52,040
I think they're gonna back off because the police aren't buying it.

1202
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:55,260
That's why we've always targeted the police for the truth.

1203
01:25:55,260 --> 01:26:00,240
Because knowing that tyranny will come to your door in a uniform.

1204
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,480
And so we don't want this war to happen.

1205
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:06,760
And the police aren't stupid, they know what I'm saying is true and real.

1206
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:09,800
Some of them are dumb, that's why they're trying to hire dumber and dumber people, that's

1207
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,800
on record.

1208
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,260
Still, it isn't gonna work.

1209
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:15,880
But we've got to put the maximum effort out now.

1210
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,880
Anti New World Order in New York, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

1211
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:25,960
Yes, Alex, I just want to say thank you for basically what you've done for the truth movement.

1212
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:33,000
I've been following you for a long time, I started on 1310 a.m. in Rochester, New York.

1213
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,800
You actually inspired me to start a blog, and last year we hit over 100,000 views.

1214
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:43,920
It's the Anti New World Order party, and we are making connections all over the world.

1215
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:51,800
I believe that with what you've done, you set a fire in the hearts and the minds of

1216
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,800
American patriots.

1217
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,800
And I believe-

1218
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,440
But that's what you've got to do, and that's what you're doing.

1219
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:02,860
All of us are here like incendiary bombs to set brush fires in the minds of men and women.

1220
01:27:02,860 --> 01:27:07,640
We are the resistance, we are Paul Revere, we are victory.

1221
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,640
Absolutely.

1222
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:16,120
And you've inspired me that I'm actually going to start an online or a radio program, and

1223
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,520
we're getting sponsors, and it's all because of your work.

1224
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,520
Exactly, just attack the enemy on every front, info war them, use their own corruption against

1225
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:27,000
them, discredit them, expose their hypocrisy.

1226
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,560
I mean, that should be instant discrediting, that they're going to be exempt from the gun

1227
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:32,560
laws we're under.

1228
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:36,320
And then they say in the news, well, we need guns to protect ourselves.

1229
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:41,800
I mean, look at Charlie Sheen going, well, I've changed my mind about guns, no one needs

1230
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,200
to own these.

1231
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,400
Besides, I've got bodyguards.

1232
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:49,360
Well, yeah, you make $3 million a week, Charlie, come on.

1233
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:55,600
I mean, it's the disconnect of the ruling class living in their bubble.

1234
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,600
God bless you, my friend, good to hear from you.

1235
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,360
Let's talk to Phil in North Carolina, you're on the air.

1236
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:02,720
Alex, how are you doing?

1237
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:07,480
I just want to say thanks for everything you're doing, and me and my wife, we pray for you

1238
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:08,480
and your family.

1239
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,760
And that's a three-quarter, Alex, it's hard to break.

1240
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,760
You there?

1241
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:15,040
Yes, I'm listening to you.

1242
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:20,760
I just want to set the board for the media, and it's so far left.

1243
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:25,840
It just rips apart anything that has to do with this country.

1244
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:31,400
And it's really, it's hard, it's my job, it's how I support my family.

1245
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:35,360
When I've talked to them, they got me down as I'm a loony to them.

1246
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:38,520
And when I try to explain to them- Yeah, yeah, they dictate reality.

1247
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,240
They're the ones that are delusional, though.

1248
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:45,360
Uh-huh, you're funny, you think America's scary with secret arrest and checkpoints and

1249
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:47,600
bankrupting dollar and everything.

1250
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:52,040
Uh-huh, you think there's something wrong with our government funding Al-Qaeda publicly.

1251
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,920
What a weirdo.

1252
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,020
I mean, you ought to feel sorry for those people.

1253
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:00,380
They're nothing but cowards who do whatever they're told.

1254
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:04,040
And actually, it's one thing to go along with something cuz you got to, that's bad enough.

1255
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:10,080
But they actually buy into the lie because they think you just put on your political

1256
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:15,400
beliefs like a suit of clothes, that it's about whatever feels good to them, and that

1257
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,400
way leads to destruction.

1258
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,160
I'm gonna come back to you, Phil, cuz I wanna hear what it's like to work in a establishment

1259
01:29:21,160 --> 01:29:22,160
media.

1260
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:23,280
And again, let's break their terms.

1261
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:24,880
They're not liberals.

1262
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,480

1263
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,640

01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,440

G. Edward Griffin's a liberal.

1268
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:41,760
Keep our money, keep our property, keep our families, worship what god we want, do what

1269
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,760
we want.

1270
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,640
That's liberal.

1271
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:50,000
Liberal is not having the government tell you how much soft drinks you can drink.

1272
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,360
We're on the march.

1273
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,760
The empire's on the run.

1274
01:29:53,760 --> 01:30:02,720

01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:10,480
system then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

1289

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1305
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:08,560
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1306
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:14,580
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1307
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,580
to the global takeover.

1308
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:21,560

Are you InfoWarsShop.com coming up the videos up at InfoWars.com I'm going to play the CBS

1320
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:24,220
news saying quote let's give up on the Constitution and all these new TV shows bad mouthing the

1321
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:29,580
founding fathers whole shows about how they're trash situational comedies to make fun of

1322
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:34,320
them set in the Revolutionary War period shows where militias won't turn their guns in the

1323
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:39,860
new terror threat shows like founding fathers are Texans that think there's a new world

1324
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:43,480
order folks this was all in production last year.

1325
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:48,140
Now coming out now perfectly timed with the shootings all of it.

1326
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:52,340
This is all scripted to a great extent.

1327
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:57,600
And that's why I'm up here and I'm so focused and so hardcore because yes ladies and gentlemen

1328
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,080
they could easily set me up easily kill me.

1329
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:04,360
I've been physically attacked years ago I get death threats I've had dirty tricks you

1330
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:09,600
wouldn't believe but I pray to God.

1331
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:14,220
And I know I'm in God's hands and again that doesn't mean I'm some goody two shoes who's

1332
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:20,680
up here saying hey I'm this big great Christian I listen I'm a bad man.

1333
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,760
My flesh is bad.

1334
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,280
I mean I have bad thoughts.

1335
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:29,080
I think about you know literally gouging my enemy's eyes out sometimes but I repent of

1336
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:34,600
that and I want to be a good person and I don't want to hate my fellow man.

1337
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:36,040
The world is nasty.

1338
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:37,040
The world is hard.

1339
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:39,080
The world is bad.

1340
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:43,840
The Madison Avenue shows us the red carpets and the models and the helicopters and the

1341
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:49,520
money and we imagine that that's some wonderful heaven up there and our lives are dirt and

1342
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:50,660
squalor.

1343
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:57,680
It's not true folks recognizing beauty recognizing justice standing up for justice and helping

1344
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:04,000
others and not hating each other is what will bring us to the next level and fulfill you.

1345
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,280
No amount of money or power will do that and all the studies show that.

1346
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:16,280
What will fulfill you is the truth and it doesn't mean that sometimes you don't get

1347
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,540
mad at your family.

1348
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,960
It doesn't mean sometimes you don't get mad at your boss or your employees.

1349
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,840
It means that you understand the stimuli and the manipulation by the social engineers on

1350
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:33,660
record from Edward Bernays 80 years ago to Joseph Goebbels 70 years ago to right through

1351
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:36,000
to modern propaganda 101.

1352
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,160
It's all about divide and conquer and play us off against each other.

1353
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:49,560
I mean you turn on MSNBC it's like Kurt Vonnegut satire of a futuristic bizarro world where

1354
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:53,760
all they do is go everyone knows people that don't like the UN are racist and gun owners

1355
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:59,440
are scum and hate black people yeah and evil men had to be dealt with hey good news the

1356
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:08,060
family's falling apart I mean you tune into it you're like what is this and they're unhappy

1357
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:20,280
soulless mercenaries I mean I've been in MSNBC I've been in Fox I've been in CNN I've been

1358
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:28,320
in you name it and I've been around the people and man they are absolutely alone.

1359
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:32,240
They're all fake they're all trying to act powerful around each other everyone's trying

1360
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:37,400
to not say anything show that so that they don't you know put themselves out there so

1361
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,960
that someone can use it against them it's and then they go home to plastic husbands

1362
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:51,360
and plastic wives they have plastic kids that commit suicide and they're totally empty I've

1363
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:56,160
got the opposite problem I'm gonna just be honest with you I mean I I'm so tuned into

1364
01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:04,680
reality it is like unspeakably incredible and painful at the same time and I'm not saying

1365
01:37:04,680 --> 01:37:09,640
I'm at some high level I'm just at a basic human level I go read the writings of the

1366
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:13,920
founders I read the writings of philosophers I go read the writings of great literature

1367
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:20,600
and I see the same thoughts I've personally had that they had and and and and and and

1368
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:27,520
then surpassing my understanding I'm nothing special except in a day and age of universal

1369
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:42,200
deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act as Eric Blair said I love the sound of

1370
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:49,920
thunder going through the studio walls I just want to hike in the woods in the rain oh you

1371
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:59,480
know that's that's that's that's one reason that's one reason that I really get mad and

1372
01:37:59,480 --> 01:38:05,000
hate the globalist because they do steal our future they don't just steal monetarily they

1373
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,640
just don't steal culturally they steal our time and our energy serving their system the

1374
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:17,480
fact that we have to spend time on them and talk about all the stuff they're doing that's

1375
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:23,120
why if you attack them with a glancing blow and attack them within their paradigms you

1376
01:38:23,120 --> 01:38:27,840
only add power to them it's designed but you attack them from outside the box of how it's

1377
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:34,120
a false construct of how it's an artificial society a stage that they train us to basically

1378
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:42,120
be players upon when you realize that they do not like it when you go into the CNN studios

1379
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:49,800
and they're dirty and pockmarked and gross and all the people look demoralized good I

1380
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:55,800
was in CNN I don't know a decade ago and then three years ago and it didn't look like that

1381
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,160
I was in the exact same studios rotting it's like your soul is rotting it's good to see

1382
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:06,220
the enemy rotting it's good to see you weak look at info wars growing look at the rest

1383
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:14,780
of the alternative media growing getting stronger good it's war and if they destroy me I'm personally

1384
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:20,520
I'm not happy about that but it's part of the war it's part of the real the real thing

1385
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:28,680
the tree being watered it's holy it's strengthening the species it's honorable it's a struggle

1386
01:39:28,680 --> 01:39:36,440
it's real I went and saw a film I forget the name of you guys look it up I actually brought

1387
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:39,520
you in the ticket stub so you could know the name of it it's like flight of the monarchs

1388
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:44,260
I think fly to the butterflies I went and saw it it's got UN propaganda in it of course

1389
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:49,520
but that's like one percent of it very good film in fact I may go see it again with my

1390
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:57,360
children I they went with me Saturday with my wife probably the best nature documentary

1391
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:02,200
just for its simplicity but story I've ever seen because it was touching to me how the

1392
01:40:02,200 --> 01:40:07,400
four generations of monarchs start I'm not going to say where it starts because that's

1393
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:11,120
the I mean obviously anybody that knows science knows where it starts for your kids I won't

1394
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:21,080
tell them it starts let's just say starts around Texas and then goes all the way up

1395
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:28,400
into northern Canada and it takes four generations to get to Canada and then there's like a b-52

1396
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:33,800
version of the monarch that's like four times the size of a regular one that makes the long

1397
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:42,960
flight back then waits all winter flies back to Texas from the south and then lays its

1398
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:49,840
eggs and dies incredible and how that monarch uses electromagnetics to fly sometimes you

1399
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:57,080
know ten thousand feet in the air electromagnetic off the Sun and off the poles and the meridians

1400
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:02,600
and scans in flying everything calculated just perfectly they know to fly the three

1401
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:10,000
thousand miles four thousand miles whatever it is and this incredible death race to get

1402
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,800
down there and then four more generations to get all the way up to the top of the mountain

1403
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:26,600
and then back down again and it's that struggle and we're in that generation you know it's

1404
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:34,520
like the third coming the book that is that the name David Knight did a piece on you know

1405
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:41,040
that breaks down these cycles in in in humans and I was thinking of our generation the fourth

1406
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:45,640
turning excuse me the fourth turning teleprompter free here and I was just thinking about that

1407
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:52,400
how all the generations come and go and this is going to be not just from the fourth turning

1408
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:56,960
but other sociologists anthropologists historians this is the prime zone the globalists say

1409
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:02,760
that this next ten years is going to decide the next thousand I mean this is the most

1410
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:09,560
mega important point in all of human development this is everything on the line this is it

1411
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:16,160
I'm sorry I it's not that I'm a good guy I am not fulfilled being a greedy bastard and

1412
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:21,080
by greedy it's not even about money I am not fulfilled you know just to be able to sell

1413
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:25,760
out to the system and be chauffeured around and have bodyguards and live in New York or

1414
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:33,220
LA and prance around at parties with a bunch of fake people you know shelling out that

1415
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:38,640
I'm a winner I made it to the top you made it to the top of a pile of skulls meant to

1416
01:42:38,640 --> 01:42:47,800
the top of a latrine you meant to the top of a spider hole I want to see humanity make

1417
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:55,760
it to the stars and to really develop and I that's why I'm not worried about being killed

1418
01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,600
or destroyed or set up whatever I'm just a monarch butterfly man just like everybody

1419
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:05,440
else I just want my species to go on look at all of what our species has done those

1420
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:11,160
monarchs are picking up electromagnetic information in their DNA they're an antenna and so are

1421
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:16,520
we folks and my antenna says fight the New World Order it says I'm not going along with

1422
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:21,880
this everything I've got is to navigate me against these people I don't need all the

1423
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:26,960
high-tech computers and programming and fancy systems the globalist have got I just got

1424
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:32,120
to follow my spirit God gave me that literally resonates with my DNA and I got it all right

1425
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:37,800
here man I've got an electrochemical computer and and billions of cells all in Congress

1426
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:44,620
together literally that can recognize the beauty of the night sky and the beauty of

1427
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:49,680
my innocent children and the beauty of my wife and the beauty of literature and art

1428
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:56,280
and philosophy and friendship and everything honorable I don't just know when the sun's

1429
01:43:56,280 --> 01:44:02,620
coming up I don't just wake up as the Sun is about to crest because I my soul literally

1430
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:08,120
picks up its electromagnetic pulse as it passes over the rock of the planet blocking it I

1431
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:14,020
literally pick up what's good and evil I have discernment that's all it is we are a billion

1432
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:20,120
times with that monarch butterfly is a little tiny creature that can fly four thousand miles

1433
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:25,440
and navigate electromagnetically do you know what you are and these atheists tell you you

1434
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:29,920
don't have a soul these atheists tell you you're nothing special that you're crap that

1435
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:34,680
humans are ugly you hear it all the time we're a joke we're no good all day they tell you

1436
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:41,440
that because it's a lie ladies and gentlemen it's a lie this species is meant to go to

1437
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:47,080
the stars this species isn't it hasn't even gone to our next phase yet of what God has

1438
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:51,480
prepared for us eye has not seen ear has not heard and the preacher's jobs out there is

1439
01:44:51,480 --> 01:44:57,360
to keep you from knowing just how incredible you are we are made in the image of the creator

1440
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:03,480
of the universe look at how more advanced we are than that butterfly look at what we've

1441
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:10,760
already built this is nothing this is nothing and evil are people malfunctioning and people

1442
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:16,800
giving into destructive tendencies to dominate like cancer in a body you so-called elites

1443
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:22,480
are unhappy and you think making us unhappy will make you happy you're inbred your disease

1444
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:27,440
you're hateful you're unhappy so you want to do you want to poison us you want to pump

1445
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:32,080
heavy metals into us to damage our DNA you think bringing the species down will raise

1446
01:45:32,080 --> 01:45:38,480
you up you will never rise bringing others down yeah I know you're coming down fast with

1447
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:47,380
your miles above me I got it how about we all rise and then you can be rising fast miles

1448
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:55,360
above us that's real power that's real power real power is saying I am now one with the

1449
01:45:55,360 --> 01:46:01,040
universe and its creator I step in to the time-space continuum I follow my programming

1450
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:07,880
but I have free will I accept my programming I accept what I am I accept it and I telegraph

1451
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:14,240
my information into the future through my species that is the magic of the universe

1452
01:46:14,240 --> 01:46:19,960
that is the meaning of life that is everything that ever was is and will be that is your

1453
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:26,200
destiny those of you that serve darkness many of you there's still time to turn back there's

1454
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:32,840
still time to join humanity in the great race the great march towards our destiny but you're

1455
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:38,280
not going to partake of that destiny I'll assure you kneeling to the dark side you evil

1456
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:43,960
people think you have knowledge of the dark side if you really knew the true knowledge

1457
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:50,480
of the creator of the universe if you even had the spark the inkling of God if you even

1458
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:56,480
had one micron of that fire you would then have knowledge of all the evil and you wouldn't

1459
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:03,360
want nothing to do with it you dark practitioners think you have knowledge of evil I don't even

1460
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:09,360
want to look into the knowledge I have of it you have not seen it or I will assure you

1461
01:47:09,360 --> 01:47:15,340
you would not be running so happily towards it let's go to your phone calls I apologize

1462
01:47:15,340 --> 01:47:19,440
I said I'd take more but I'm on a roll today because I'm really it's just understanding

1463
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:25,120
how serious all this is this is what goes on in my mind 24 7 fill in North Carolina

1464
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:32,120
tell your media story go ahead what it's like working inside a group suppressing the human

1465
01:47:32,120 --> 01:47:42,120
potential well Alex they just they basically laugh at us we're too far out there and you

1466
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:47,400
know Alex they're going blind through a storm with a smile on their face they don't even

1467
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:53,180
know what's going on Alex I mean they're clueless and it's all they care about is their football

1468
01:47:53,180 --> 01:47:59,120
game and their six-pack of beer and I know that I have nothing against football and but

1469
01:47:59,120 --> 01:48:04,160
now it's stolen their manhood their manhood is raising their children strong being good

1470
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:07,720
teaching their children how to fix things teaching their children how to stand up for

1471
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:13,800
themselves not waddling around talking about the team all day it's stolen everything from

1472
01:48:13,800 --> 01:48:20,620
us you're right Alex and I just you know that's all I really had to say thank you very much

1473
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:24,840
for everything you're doing Alex uh don't thank me don't thank me yeah you're on the

1474
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:31,840
air go ahead it's you brother is um you know I'm a Christian and uh my Christian friends

1475
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:37,280
have always given me a hard time I'm a member of a gun range uh always go shooting they

1476
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:43,160
always ask me why did I like to go shooting and uh you know what I told them and then

1477
01:48:43,160 --> 01:48:47,440
they asked me if I'm a Christian why don't I depend on God to protect me and I told them

1478
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:52,800
I said God hasn't called me to be a martyr yet he hasn't called me to allow a car full

1479
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:57,440
of people to pull up my front yard get out come in shoot me in the head rape my three

1480
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:03,480
daughters shoot them and then or whatever I have take it with him he hasn't called me

1481
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:08,880
to do that yet he may someday do that to me Alex but right now he's told me to defend

1482
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:14,520
my property in my household in my family that's where I'm at right now Alex well listen listen

1483
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:19,280
a hundred years ago the Rockefellers with the National Council of Churches about 60

1484
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:24,000
years ago with the World Council of Churches I guess like 65 times flying they set these

1485
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:31,440
up and the churches got paid off and and brought in to be uh charities not under 501c3 and

1486
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,800
others not churches and so pretty much all the churches are saying turn your guns in

1487
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:41,480
now I don't care if they're Catholic Protestant Methodist I mean you know whatever it is they're

1488
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:47,440
state run basically clergy response teams these people call themselves Americans our

1489
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:53,440
country was born out of the preachers across the spectrum saying this is a tyranny government's

1490
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:57,980
not God government's abusing us we have a right and a duty to resist it the entire Bible

1491
01:49:57,980 --> 01:50:04,120
is the prophets different ways sometimes physical sometimes with information resisting corrupt

1492
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:09,800
governments okay and and not worshiping the God of the state not worshiping the king but

1493
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:15,520
worshiping God and so these people that say you shouldn't be armed trust in God God gave

1494
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:21,620
you a brain gone God gave you all of this to protect yourself and you know look at God

1495
01:50:21,620 --> 01:50:28,520
telling Israel get up and defend yourself look at that is so evil to sit there and say

1496
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:35,640
Christians should known guns I mean I see preachers on TV now saying the the early church

1497
01:50:35,640 --> 01:50:42,640
was wrong to not worship Saturn and being thrown the lions in Rome so I mean look those

1498
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:52,200
are cowardly demons or you know they may just be deceived people but listen I wouldn't be

1499
01:50:52,200 --> 01:50:57,260
going to a church where they say guns are bad God bless you my friend wow we're gonna

Hey there Frank Bates here have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out

1524
01:53:06,240 --> 01:53:12,960
280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn that this odd device

1525
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:17,980
poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a few weeks ago former speaker

1526
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:21,940
of the house Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about

1527
01:53:21,940 --> 01:53:26,800
this deadly threat I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may be

1528
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:31,220
because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend

1529

just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors

1535
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:30,920
picks its own targets but experts warn plane could mark the start of robot wars yeah the

1536
01:54:30,920 --> 01:54:37,020
Pentagon said back in the 70s that by 2010 they plan to have half the Air Force be robot

1537
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:42,340
drone and humans can do it pretty much whatever we put our minds to at a certain point and

1538
01:54:42,340 --> 01:54:48,620
guess what by 2010 half of the Air Force was drone by 2020 they plan to have over 90% of

1539
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:55,020
it be drone but the Pentagon totals got something like 30,000 predators totaled one of the branches

1540
01:54:55,020 --> 01:55:00,980
I think it's Air Force had some ridiculous amount like 18,000 of those and this amazing

1541
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:07,740
new drone systems similar to what the US is launching it's a system that picks and kills

1542
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:16,420
on its own and see then the globalist aren't going to need humans anymore the goal is to

1543
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:21,900
have robots working on robots working on robots with robot trucks and trains that even bring

1544
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:27,300
the parts in from the other factories and then humans that will oversee some of it but

1545
01:55:27,300 --> 01:55:32,420
almost all engineers will tell you now computer engineers electrical engineers that no one

1546
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:37,380
knows how the microchip works by themselves it's all these experts together no one I mean

1547
01:55:37,380 --> 01:55:42,820
it's already like something like 1600 times smaller than it was just 30 40 years ago 35

1548
01:55:42,820 --> 01:55:50,540
years ago the the size of the so-called etching the wiring it's amazing and it's going to

1549
01:55:50,540 --> 01:55:55,260
get more and more advanced and that's why the globalist are laughing they can have for

1550
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:01,420
a dollar in a few years a little robot with a weapon system that kills you with you a

1551
01:56:01,420 --> 01:56:07,660
shot designed to only kill you with your DNA sequence that comes into your house at night

1552
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:14,220
by in fact biologically it can even be biological not even metal bites you and then you die

1553
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:18,300
the clothes are coming out where they'll have nanotech vaccines which actually re-engineer

1554
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:22,580
your brain bill gates has announced that and they say don't worry you're not going to be

1555
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:27,420
stressed anymore we've decided humans are designed wrong you're not supposed to get

1556
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:31,940
upset you're not going to be upset anymore this is going to inject you with a virus that

1557
01:56:31,940 --> 01:56:37,620
goes in and eats areas of your brain and gives you a selective lobotomy just google brain

1558
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:42,000
eating vaccines you'll see a video I did two years ago on the subject or startpage.com

1559
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:49,100
you can find it there so anyways I'm ranting this is the type of stuff we're talking about

1560
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:55,820
but humans are going to beat this okay but the smart meters spying on us the electromagnetics

1561
01:56:55,820 --> 01:57:00,400
all the major new brands coming out have systems the smart meters dial into and then surveil

1562
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:05,940
you and the CIA chief brags yeah we're putting microphones in all the new dishes and dishwashers

1563
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:12,300
dryers computers there's nothing you can do we're watching you but still I'm a conspiracy

1564
01:57:12,300 --> 01:57:17,260
theorist because I told you 15 years ago MIT said that was the plan now what happens I'm

1565
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:22,380
even worse you see because the yuppies are like he's still bad it's not you know Alex

1566
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:27,500
is still bad okay so he's right it's good to have them watching us that's not bad it's

1567
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:31,820
good to have the laptops the school issues watching us it's good to have the NSA spying

1568
01:57:31,820 --> 01:57:36,420
it's good to have the government running al-qaeda it's good to list gun owners as terrorists

1569
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:42,900
I'm going to turn my guns in to prove I'm I'm see they're scared deep down and so they

1570
01:57:42,900 --> 01:57:47,860
submit to the system we're going to go to break and come back and go to John in Pennsylvania

well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

1592
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:30,260
Alex Jones alright I got a bunch of clips and a ton of economic news to get to in this

1593
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:35,420
hour but right now let's go to your calls John in Pennsylvania let's talk about troops

1594
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:43,320
in the economy he's watching at prisonplanet.tv welcome sir thank you Alex I took the red

1595
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:50,180
toe a couple months ago and I'm a happy man god bless you happy inside but aware of too

1596
02:00:50,180 --> 02:01:00,220
much I think all right I'm a Legionnaire and American Legion magazine coming in February

1597
02:01:00,220 --> 02:01:07,220
has an article not made in America now according to this military times reports although DoD

1598
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:18,460
is required to purchase clothing and shoes 100% made in America they're coming from China

1599
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:23,940
and I think that might be a big part of the problem why we have no money because nobody

1600
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:28,580
could nobody here is working and we should be doing this like in World War II World War

1601
02:01:28,580 --> 02:01:39,300
I we have two representatives are leading an effort representative Michael Michard Democrat

1602
02:01:39,300 --> 02:01:46,900
from Maine and Duncan Hunter Republican from California and absolutely this is how wide

1603
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:55,720
open we are did you know the components for the B-2 bomber and missile systems for nuclear

1604
02:01:55,720 --> 02:02:02,500
submarines are made in China and other areas on record most the military hardware is made

1605
02:02:02,500 --> 02:02:09,620
overseas now it's just put together here this has been a long-term strategic plan where

1606
02:02:09,620 --> 02:02:16,080
we give them worthless dollars then they buy real infrastructure with it this is how you

1607
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:21,500
get the u.s. conquered by Communist China the insiders went over there they put Malin

1608
02:02:21,500 --> 02:02:28,340
in 49 always had deals with him always had deals with the Communist in China not so much

1609
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:32,260
Russia that was early on but the Russians doubled across the globalist for a while they

1610
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:38,980
were just as bad but the point is is that yes I've seen the articles in fact guys will

1611
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:44,000
you print me that I meant to cover that a few weeks ago thank you in fact there's another

1612
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:50,740
one that the army is the Pentagon's pulling crosses out of chapels thank you but the issue

1613
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:58,820
is that think about it worthless dollars go out they still have value on the surface then

1614
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:04,380
the Chinese use it to buy up infrastructure and ports and but then nobody can have a real

1615
02:03:04,380 --> 02:03:09,540
job here unless they're select globalist companies that work with China I mean that's just an

1616
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:20,780
economic takeover plan you know Nixon started all this when he went to China and that was

1617
02:03:20,780 --> 02:03:26,480
the public oh we're gonna be friends now is it incredible yes yes it had been a setup

1618
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:33,980
since 49 is my point the u.s. hauled the bacon of the Chinese in World War two so they did

1619
02:03:33,980 --> 02:03:38,620
whatever they were told and shank I checked was like hey help me and they said no you

1620
02:03:38,620 --> 02:03:44,060
know the stories of them giving them firearms without the firing pen and stuff and shells

1621
02:03:44,060 --> 02:03:48,180
without the powder in them that was that's all been declassified now our so-called government

1622
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:53,060
put Mao in who then killed tens of millions of his own people greatest mass murderer in

1623
02:03:53,060 --> 02:03:59,380
history and you're absolutely on target what you say is the key to the globalist takeover

1624
02:03:59,380 --> 02:04:04,740
program and you can see it all and while we were worried about Russia the whole time China

1625
02:04:04,740 --> 02:04:12,420
was the one that was being set up for the takeover and now this gun thing comes up to

1626
02:04:12,420 --> 02:04:19,980
steer our eyes away from everything else that's right very well said John are people waking

1627
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:28,540
up over there at the VFW American Legion American Legion yeah I purchase one of your hats so

1628
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:34,340
every time I go out of the house I'm wearing info words on my head people people will stop

1629
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:39,220
and ask me what it is and I've been trying to spread the word Alex well god bless you

1630
02:04:39,220 --> 02:04:43,180
I can tell you love this country and you love the ideas of it and love the checks and balances

1631
02:04:43,180 --> 02:04:48,660
that have made us wealthy and powerful but with that came the decadence of the wealth

1632
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:53,940
so now we're falling apart and yeah the CFR every month brags that they're selling us

1633
02:04:53,940 --> 02:05:02,740
out to China not the Chinese people the Chinese government now that we have moved into the

1681
02:09:56,980 --> 02:10:01,620
us that they get waivers from their own gun control laws and have private security that's

1682
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:05,740

1691
02:10:57,440 --> 02:11:02,780
when one of the men guarding bloomberg identified as officer stockman nypd stops matera and

1692
02:11:02,780 --> 02:11:07,340
asked to see his photo id matera complies before asking is this standard procedure for

1694
02:11:11,660 --> 02:11:15,160
officer reaches inside his jacket and grabs a pen as if to write down the journalist's

1701
02:11:45,460 --> 02:11:57,780
received a treatment for asking liberal politicians tough questions and it just goes on there

1702
02:11:57,780 --> 02:12:04,220
in 2011 vice president joe biden warned matera let's get it straight guy don't screw around

1703
02:12:04,220 --> 02:12:08,980
with me when he confronted biden about the use of a rape reference when discussing republican

1704
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:21,940
opposition to obama's uh jobs bill the washington post uh covered that

1705
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:26,460
and again it's them all they're basically grabbing on him and stuff uh we'll go to some

1711
02:12:55,980 --> 02:13:00,500
thing that i would really like to see you do alex is i'd like to have you inform all

1712
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:06,420
of these people out here how obama is giving away everything of value in america to the

1713
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:13,380
flippin chinese you know when i say the chinese alex let's go bk on those sobs because if

1714
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:20,660
we don't buddy gun up because that's where we're going i have i'm a veteran from vietnam

1715
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:24,620
i have stood on the mountain praying to god and unfortunately i have felt the winds of

1716
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:29,940
war again i did not want to feel those again i am darn near 60 years old but i'm ready

1717
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:35,180
to die for the bring them back the constitution that our forefathers died for and i hope the

1718
02:13:35,180 --> 02:13:40,660
rest of your listeners feel the same way i do i know you woke me up in 2008 and i have

1719
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:45,860
probably brought more than 100 people more awake to your message well great job tim you

1720
02:13:45,860 --> 02:13:51,940
know in my first film made in 97 america destroyed by design i show the cfr plans that are public

1721
02:13:51,940 --> 02:13:56,420
that the chinese century doesn't mean the chinese people it means suicide nets and mass

1722
02:13:56,420 --> 02:14:00,860
enslavement and forced organ harvesting but the globalists went and made a deal they put

1723
02:14:00,860 --> 02:14:06,260
mao in they made the deal public in the 70s to have them have goods made so cheap nobody

1724
02:14:06,260 --> 02:14:11,620
could compete in slave factories you name it to then leverage out business over here

1725
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:16,060
where only select globalists can do business with the chinese factories through the chinese

1726
02:14:16,060 --> 02:14:22,940
communist party and now the chinese government's buying the roads the oil the infrastructure

1727
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:27,860
they're coming back with the dollars that are worthless once they devalue the dollar

1728
02:14:27,860 --> 02:14:33,420
buying up everything okay and it's also again about deindustrialization it's an economic

1729
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:41,320
warfare operation the chinese people china could collapse anytime so it's either it takes

1730
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:46,580
over it knows that in a big bubble or it collapses so the globalists are trying to prop it up

1731
02:14:46,580 --> 02:14:51,300
that's why they'll pay you know 22 billion dollars to ship the biggest general motors

1732
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:56,420
factories in the world to china last year starting two years ago cadillac and vault

1733
02:14:56,420 --> 02:15:00,700
and others because that's the deal that's the globalist investments they all get the

1734
02:15:00,700 --> 02:15:06,300
money off the top from that uh so the chinese people want freedom they're good people on

1735
02:15:06,300 --> 02:15:09,980
average just like americans are good people you know i talk about the british government

1736
02:15:09,980 --> 02:15:13,660
being corrupt i'm not bashing brits when i talk about the israeli government being corrupt

1737
02:15:13,660 --> 02:15:18,200
i'm not bashing the general israelis or the average iranian is a good person who wants

1738
02:15:18,200 --> 02:15:23,420
freedom it government tends to be bad throughout history founding fathers told us that history

1739
02:15:23,420 --> 02:15:29,140
shows that you better keep government small uh but yeah i know this china issue i mean

1740
02:15:29,140 --> 02:15:32,960
i remember military officers telling me 15 years ago the plan was to use chinese soldiers

1741
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:39,420
here and i'd be like what now they're talking in fema documents like nle09 about using foreign

1742
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:45,640
troops using chinese troops to disarm americans uh i mean it's just insane and the chinese

1743
02:15:45,640 --> 02:15:50,980
government says take the americans guns i appreciate your call tim i mean it's it's

1744
02:15:50,980 --> 02:15:57,260
it's it's just it's insane to have newsweek come out last week and say we need the communist

1745
02:15:57,260 --> 02:16:02,060
chinese to tell us what to do we need piers morgan to tell us what to do in that article

1746
02:16:02,060 --> 02:16:07,260
piers pressure and alex jones has to be dealt with let him prepare his flamethrower we're

1747
02:16:07,260 --> 02:16:14,280
preparing for him and it's openly threatening and the article is it's good to have piers

1748
02:16:14,280 --> 02:16:22,820
morgan a foreigner telling us what to do america is done get used to being run by china and

1749
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:30,000
the guy says it with pleasure and again people that say israel runs everything israel lobby

1750
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:38,340
is a is a big manipulator in there but i mean i've done my research the china lobby and

1751
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:42,740
the federal reserve lobby which is tied to israel is really at the top of the food chain

1752
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:50,540
that very writer at newsweek saying basically america's done and celebrating it and celebrating

1753
02:16:50,540 --> 02:16:57,680
quote our waning power the guy basically wants to end israel i was reading his writings

1754
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:04,180
he has a book out about it it's just like it's just crazy i'm not saying i'm not saying

1755
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:09,780
i'm not even debating israel okay because that's a trap designed to be a trap i'm not

1756
02:17:09,780 --> 02:17:21,180
stepping into it the point is newsweek gave this guy a whole section to run down israel

1757
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:26,840
and separately he's saying the chinese need to take over i mean it's just crazy and then

1758
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:35,940
israel selling our secrets to china my point of bringing that up is where is the continuity

1759
02:17:35,940 --> 02:17:38,740
in this where do all these globalists think they're going to go once we're turned over

1760
02:17:38,740 --> 02:17:48,260
to the communist chinese just very bizarre just very bizarre it's mainly just open the

1761
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:52,660
gates open the gates bring down our countries i'll sell out to you you know to the chinese

1762
02:17:52,660 --> 02:17:59,780
it's just like falling before the communist chinese just groveling to them and he says

1763
02:17:59,780 --> 02:18:04,340
it's good to get used to that they admit they're getting us used to foreigners telling us what

1764
02:18:04,340 --> 02:18:08,700
to do it's like i wrote the article but from a different perspective he's admitting hey

1765
02:18:08,700 --> 02:18:13,220
we're here to get you used to a world government and everything will be sacrificed for world

1766
02:18:13,220 --> 02:18:18,580
government the u.s you name it england let's jam in another call here doris and tennessee

1767
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:26,260
you're on the air thanks for holding hey um i was listening to uh you know i'm a real

1768
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:35,140
big fan just like you i liked john kennedy and um but i was listening to a 1961 uh speech

1769
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:43,220
you made at the un where he called for global disarmament yes early on this is a great point

1770
02:18:43,220 --> 02:18:49,940
he he pushed through state department memorandum 7277 it's a little 40-something page manual

1771
02:18:49,940 --> 02:18:55,180
of memory serves it's online i've got original copies here in the office uh it's actually

1772
02:18:55,180 --> 02:19:02,180
in those uh bernadine smith big files i don't know where we put those but the point is 7277

1773
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:09,180
says first all the individuals disarm then the militaries disarm except for paramilitary

1774
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:14,080
un garrisons of SWAT teams in every city and how they're going to disarm the police after

1775
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:18,780
they disarm us and yeah kennedy kind of bought into all that till he found out what it was

1776
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:22,700
really about then he pulled out of it i mean you know people were really chumps back then

1777
02:19:22,700 --> 02:19:28,460
they didn't they didn't know all that we know go ahead uh that's what that might be you

1778
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:35,220
know the the good old boy club wasn't ready for that back then uh aka is a new world order

1779
02:19:35,220 --> 02:19:40,460
so that might have bought into some of the reasons why they assassinated him yeah stay

1823

1829
02:24:40,460 --> 02:24:46,820
you were making uh go ahead okay the point i was making is i'd read a book called accessories

1830
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:52,460
after the fact that all the people that got killed after the assassination of john kennedy

1831
02:24:52,460 --> 02:24:59,980
then i went to listen to a speech about in 1961 to the united nations and he talked about

1832
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:05,860
global disarmament it sounded a whole lot like obama and no no that's it but i mean

1833
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:10,780
kennedy the difference was kennedy actually did do some good things he got sold on it

1834
02:25:10,780 --> 02:25:15,940
as a good idea but a year later he pulled out of all that a year later he he understood

1835
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:21,380
it was a con game uh he signed an order to abolish the fellow reserve i mean uh he didn't

1836
02:25:21,380 --> 02:25:25,720
want to give nukes to israel he did a lot of things that made the power structure very

1837
02:25:25,720 --> 02:25:33,780
very upset okay now now we have two uh people that represent us corker and lamar alexander

1838
02:25:33,780 --> 02:25:38,940
and i've noticed they've been getting really popular lately with the president uh corker's

1839
02:25:38,940 --> 02:25:45,780
from chattanooga chattanooga tennessee is the only place in a economic recovery around

1840
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:54,020
in that i see and um alexander walked out with the president the day of the inauguration

1841
02:25:54,020 --> 02:26:01,900
i don't believe we'll ever have another uh honest election um in my lifetime and uh well

1842
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:07,420
no listen that's why the fix is in they've told republicans you vote for open borders

1843
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:13,620
you vote for uh all of this or you're never getting back into office and and that's why

1844
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:19,240
we're sold out senate group reaches immigration deal and folks we're already bankrupt now

1845
02:26:19,240 --> 02:26:23,260
they're going to bring in they say 11 million it's more like 30 and just totally legalize

1846
02:26:23,260 --> 02:26:28,740
the illegals and then let them legalize their families and let them get welfare and again

1847
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:33,700
the goal isn't to actually empower people from mexico uh these people do contribute

1848
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:36,180
to the country well there's really two different types of immigrants there's the ones that

1849
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:39,460
come here and work and there's those that come here from mexico and just get on welfare

1850
02:26:39,460 --> 02:26:44,060
and become gangsters and that seems to be the kind our government wants uh and it's

1851
02:26:44,060 --> 02:26:49,220
just despicable god bless you man good to hear from you tona in uh arizona you're on

1855
02:27:12,260 --> 02:27:19,420
really believe me at first until he started talking to a marine uh from youtube this marine

1856
02:27:19,420 --> 02:27:23,660
was talking about um what the same things you're talking about and what's happening

1857
02:27:23,660 --> 02:27:28,520
but you don't have to believe me or the marine i have abc news admitting the army's training

last 14 months i mean they're they're arming and digging in like it's the end of the world

1867
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:28,760
i got a clip coming up where an obama administration official told a senior major fund manager

1868
02:28:28,760 --> 02:28:33,100
very well respected that they're going to kill the dollar well no kidding we know that's

1870
02:28:38,260 --> 02:28:45,220
to be chaos it's going to be real bad real bad the point i was getting is my brother

1871
02:28:45,220 --> 02:28:49,780
he started from a different perspective one of you you know because the marines he saw

1872
02:28:49,780 --> 02:28:55,180
it as a man that has fought a war and he said that my brother has said that oh well alice

1873
02:28:55,180 --> 02:29:00,220
jones you know he hasn't been in the war but not not that i'm saying that or anything like

1874
02:29:00,220 --> 02:29:06,020
that but he was basically he the marine kind of made him woke him up but so made me kind

1875
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:12,240
of thinking like oh i'm like uh alex jones right so i started kind of looking uh into

1876
02:29:12,240 --> 02:29:18,180
you your background and everything and and a lot of things like in secret societies and

so good they i knew it was posted a while back so uh it's from bright bart bright bart.com

1964
02:38:14,660 --> 02:38:18,380
now this is what needs to happen everywhere but i'm telling you if i was there i'd be

1965
02:38:18,380 --> 02:38:22,660
like hey get your hands off me i'm just asking a question that's assault and then i know

1966
02:38:22,660 --> 02:38:26,580
that the dc police wouldn't have done anything but i'd call the police to make a record so

1967
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:31,820
i could sue them by the way i'm still considering shooing the tsa and the apd and i don't just

1968
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:36,080
shoot my mouth off i've sued people before i don't like it but when i gotta do it i gotta

1969
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:40,220
do it the austin cop saying you go through or you're arrested and then and then blowing

1970
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:44,160
up and then trying to get them to not let me fly that guy was just like looking at me

1971
02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:49,300
like he wanted me to do something physical hey i got a big brain pal okay if i want to

1972
02:38:49,300 --> 02:38:54,940
i'm gonna go get the federal suit perfected and sue you and take away your jet ski okay

1973
02:38:54,940 --> 02:38:59,060
but you better know and better be lucky even though i was assaulted at that airport once

1974
02:38:59,060 --> 02:39:02,700
by somebody you guys tried to set me up with i don't know if he not him particularly but

1975
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:06,980
that it was clearly a setup rob do saw it grabbing on me and threatening me some thug

1976
02:39:06,980 --> 02:39:11,940
they had in there i didn't even let the police arrest him and they were ready to because

1977
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:15,920
i didn't want to deal with the trial and stuff i just said i forgive you in the name of jesus

1978
02:39:15,920 --> 02:39:20,280
but i wanted it on record you did this it was all on surveillance tape the point is

1979
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:23,560
is that if i threaten to sue somebody you better believe it's being looked at right

1980

2018
02:43:08,600 --> 02:43:15,480
it 51 52 they had organized crime hearings with jaeger hoover who they'd go you know give tens of

2019
02:43:15,480 --> 02:43:18,680
thousands of dollars anytime he wanted to go gamble at the horse tracks the mafia would

2020
02:43:19,320 --> 02:43:24,920
it was a famous way to pay people off and uh he said there's no such thing as organized crime

2021
02:43:24,920 --> 02:43:32,440
and he used the term congressional record conspiracy theory that's right that's right

2022
02:43:33,640 --> 02:43:39,960
the conspiracy theory i mean it's a game they play look i see through you it's a con game

2023
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:46,600
unbelievable okay on the jesuit thing uh the jesuits were set up what in was it portugal

2024
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:54,200
by what was his name liola uh and people obsess over is it the jews is it the jesuits is it the

2025
02:43:54,200 --> 02:44:00,760
muslims is it the masons is it all big powerful organizations become corrupt and dominant the

2026
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:08,840
nazis modeled their system of control with the ss off the jesuits i'm not saying the jesuits

2027
02:44:08,840 --> 02:44:16,200
taught them to be nazis they modeled the black uniforms and the power structure after uh the

2028
02:44:16,200 --> 02:44:23,000
system the guys asking me about them what else is it and you cannot deny that now the jesuits who

2029
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:29,800
even took over the papacy for a while till it crushed it uh that the jesuits now today you're

2030
02:44:29,800 --> 02:44:35,640
the pope promotes world government and catholics should uh you know really be concerned about how

2031
02:44:35,640 --> 02:44:40,760
world government and new world order is being promoted by the muslims the catholics so many

2032
02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:45,560
other groups but then it doesn't exist at the same time there's also a popular thing that people put

2033
02:44:45,560 --> 02:44:51,000
out to sell books with zero proof or facts that i am a jesuit and it all started about seven years

2034
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:56,760
ago i sent emails by prominent people that put forward the jesuit only conspiracy saying you will

2035
02:44:56,760 --> 02:45:02,360
have me on to promote my book or i will expose you as a jesuit now the way to get on the show is

2036
02:45:02,360 --> 02:45:07,800
here's my book i think i'd be a great guest not you will have me on or i will expose you i i

2037
02:45:07,800 --> 02:45:14,040
think they have a name for that i was like what kind of weirdness is this and um i have i mean

2038
02:45:14,040 --> 02:45:20,440
my family are famous protestants uh and i've told the story a million times but no one cares it's

2039
02:45:20,440 --> 02:45:27,320
easier to not have research or facts to just say alex's work is nothing i say he works for the pope

2040
02:45:27,320 --> 02:45:34,600
so it's true and it's beyond bizarre and they don't apologize to me nothing they they bear

2041
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:39,800
false witness and they lie and i forgive them because that's that's what jesus christ you know

2042
02:45:39,800 --> 02:45:47,800
as as you know my teacher and my god has has taught me to do um is to forgive petty people

2043
02:45:47,800 --> 02:45:56,600
that are all screwed up um just amazing you know my ancestors came into texas and did not like to

2044
02:45:56,600 --> 02:46:01,080
the fact that people were being forced to convert to catholicism to get mexican land grants and so

2045
02:46:01,080 --> 02:46:06,200
my ancestor was william airs and david airs there was also a bunch of others very famous you know

2046
02:46:06,200 --> 02:46:10,200
raise colonel travis's son the rest of it i'm not going to even get into my family in texas history

2047
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:13,240
because it's so over the top people wouldn't even believe it but you can actually there's been books

2048
02:46:13,240 --> 02:46:17,400
written about it if you'd like uh in fact people gone and got my people didn't think i was who i

2049
02:46:17,400 --> 02:46:21,720
said they went got my yearbooks they went and found somehow got my birth certificate which i

2050
02:46:21,720 --> 02:46:28,440
guess is fine the real spelling of emmerich not the wrong one on wikipedia um and now everything

2051
02:46:28,440 --> 02:46:33,240
else has the wrong spelling fans do it with wrong spelling so they give us the sites or facebook

2052
02:46:33,240 --> 02:46:39,240
has the wrong name you can't change it uh but they again cointel pro i don't think that's what

2053
02:46:39,240 --> 02:46:46,040
this is this is just opportunistic money making they always just put something out there that

2054
02:46:46,040 --> 02:46:52,520
can't be proved or disproved completely to to to to demonize someone and make it about the person

2055
02:46:54,120 --> 02:46:58,200
when it's not about alex jones the government's trying to take your guns

2056
02:46:59,320 --> 02:47:03,720
the government's trying to get rid of the borders and legalize 30 million illegal aliens right now

2057
02:47:04,440 --> 02:47:09,320
the government is trying to get rid of the bill of rights and constitution they're running tsa

2058
02:47:09,320 --> 02:47:16,760
checkpoints in austin right now and i told you that was coming and i was a coot now where i live

2059
02:47:16,760 --> 02:47:22,840
the army shows up at city events and the tsa is out there with guns searching people's bags

2060
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:34,120
illegally but it doesn't matter because i'm supposedly a pop-tart jesuit uh and uh again

2061
02:47:34,120 --> 02:47:41,400
uh people don't fight tyranny they just they just they just say i'm bad i mean they've said for 15

2062
02:47:41,400 --> 02:47:47,800
years that genesis gcnlive.com is owned by some saudi arabian when it's a hundred percent a

2063
02:47:47,800 --> 02:47:54,280
different genesis they've accused genesis of being the porno magazine genesis ted anderson when he

2064
02:47:54,280 --> 02:48:02,040
first started this network 16 years ago wanted to have a tv network later so he called the radio the

2065
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:07,560
beginning of it genesis and it's just mental illness and people say no you are owned by the

2066
02:48:07,560 --> 02:48:12,440
saudi arabians it's just it's just made up but then they don't get upset about current tv that

2067
02:48:12,440 --> 02:48:19,640
actually is run by the arabs now you see so that's how mass mental illness works all right so and

2068
02:48:19,640 --> 02:48:23,240
that's fine not everybody's gonna wake up to the tyranny and actually get in the game against

2069
02:48:23,240 --> 02:48:27,320
tyranny they're just gonna go down rabbit trails and you know this person's bad and that person's

2070
02:48:27,320 --> 02:48:32,920
bad and sit around anointing who's bad and who's good all day and it's sad for me not because i'm

2071
02:48:32,920 --> 02:48:42,920
being attacked but because it's sad because these people are just were never meant to have real

2072
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:48,200
discernment or to fight evil they're tools of corruption and don't even know it okay let's go

2073
02:48:48,200 --> 02:48:54,120
to this clip here this is a senior obama official we're gonna go to this one first senior obama

2074
02:48:54,120 --> 02:49:02,600
official we are going to kill the dollar and uh kyle bass who knows a thing or two about companies

2075
02:49:02,600 --> 02:49:07,640
and finance recently spoke to a senior member of the obama administration about their planned

2076
02:49:07,640 --> 02:49:13,560
solutions for fixing the u.s economy and bass is a top uh fund manager you know very well respected

2077
02:49:13,560 --> 02:49:18,520
uh the answer shouldn't surprise you and let's go ahead and go to that clip now you're in charge

2078
02:49:18,520 --> 02:49:23,320
you're in charge of this thing called the united states government budget and it gives you political

2079
02:49:23,320 --> 02:49:29,960
and fiscal authority to do quote unquote the right thing yeah would you mark to market balance sheets

2080
02:49:29,960 --> 02:49:37,080
today and create the economic downside that that would follow or would you put in place

2081
02:49:37,880 --> 02:49:44,280
or attempt to put in place some kind of economic policies to get you to a better place down some

2082
02:49:44,280 --> 02:49:50,680
theoretical road i mean how do you solve a problem where you're spending ten percent of you know

2083
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:55,640
you're running a 10 fiscal deficit you're not going to get growth in the absence of private

2084
02:49:55,640 --> 02:50:01,240
sector credit demand so the government's idea right now is we're going to export our way out

2085
02:50:01,240 --> 02:50:07,000
of this and when i asked a senior member of the obama administration last week how are we going

2086
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:12,520
to grow exports if we won't allow nominal wage deflation and he says we're just going to kill

2087
02:50:12,520 --> 02:50:18,600
the dollar and i said okay more you mean um so that i mean that's the only answer and you that's

2088
02:50:18,600 --> 02:50:23,720
a dead answer it's a dead answer but it's that's where that's where we're at but see folks that's

2089
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:29,960
the cover to all of this because they know nothing can ever compete with suicide factories with

2090
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:35,480
suicide nets up around them at the dorms no one can compete with forced abortions in the factory

2091
02:50:35,480 --> 02:50:39,960
no one they've got regulations here where we can't even compete with mexico or india

2092
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:47,400
okay you know they pay to ship the jobs overseas this is a way all we had left was our dollar to

2093
02:50:47,400 --> 02:50:52,600
buy all these goods that's going to go it's all been engineered it's all been planned out so the

2094
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:58,120
chinese money and the rothchild money and the globalist money can pour back in and buy everything

2095
02:50:58,120 --> 02:51:03,080
up we're going to come back with another stunning clip this is alex jones with five good reasons you

2096
02:51:03,080 --> 02:51:08,120
should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily

2097
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:13,080
double or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how much

2098
02:51:13,080 --> 02:51:18,440
power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity

2099
02:51:18,440 --> 02:51:23,560
in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the

2100
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:29,000
power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

2101
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:34,200

02:54:45,880 --> 02:54:52,200
land in san francisco uh hovercraft helicopters it had to be computer no way marines were training

2134
02:55:02,200 --> 02:55:11,240

2135
02:55:13,240 --> 02:55:17,880
of the boy scouts like 12 year olds training coming out to the marines and going what are

kids in white t-shirts riding around hebron maryland

2138
02:55:27,640 --> 02:55:31,800
and then the marines go over with guns and say turn your cameras off i mean this is america

2139
02:55:33,480 --> 02:55:39,480
and then i had the army try to set me up and it's so insane mike hanson saw it i mean who

2140
02:55:39,480 --> 02:55:45,640
would believe i went to heb to brooksville florida and you're in the woods and a guy

2141
02:55:45,640 --> 02:55:49,320
jumps out because you're trying to film the military do gun confiscation drills in the town

2142
02:55:49,320 --> 02:55:54,200
and a guy jumps out and tries to set the woods on fire to blame you and you're like stomping it out

2143
02:55:54,200 --> 02:55:57,800
and then having to grab the guy and say i'm gonna you know physically beat you up if you don't do

2144
02:55:57,800 --> 02:56:01,640
this and then doombuggies show up and all this stuff and then you go talk to locals they go

2145
02:56:01,640 --> 02:56:05,400
i've been told not to talk to you the army came door to door i mean it's like a movie

2146
02:56:05,400 --> 02:56:12,040
folks the government is evil okay i tried to expose all this and they were ready to burn

2147
02:56:12,040 --> 02:56:22,120
things down and blame me with special forces now the military isn't bad people i actually woke them

2148
02:56:22,120 --> 02:56:29,880
up by doing that the point is is that we're in trouble listen to this on cbs news they have

2149
02:56:29,880 --> 02:56:35,560
people on this is just this is just this weekend it's every day you see this saying it's time to

2150
02:56:35,560 --> 02:56:39,800
give up on the constitution well that's nothing some of these shows bad mouth the founders

2151
02:56:39,800 --> 02:56:45,400
these people are collaborators the full videos up at law professor on cbs says let's give up

2152
02:56:45,400 --> 02:56:52,520
on the constitution here's that clip i've got a simple idea let's give up on the constitution

2153
02:56:52,520 --> 02:56:57,640
how about you go to hell i know it sounds radical i know you're a traitor but it's really not i know

2154
02:56:57,640 --> 02:57:04,200
i'm a sack of crap disobedience is as american as apple pie for example most of our greatest

2155
02:57:04,200 --> 02:57:10,680
presidents jefferson lincoln wilson and both roosevelds had doubts about the constitution

2156
02:57:10,680 --> 02:57:15,720
and many of them disobeyed it when it got in their way to be clear i don't think we should

2157
02:57:15,720 --> 02:57:21,400
give up on everything in the constitution the constitution has many important and inspiring

2158
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:26,600
provisions that's enough but we should obey see see see this is the spin jefferson said it wasn't

2159
02:57:26,600 --> 02:57:32,360
enough protections and so did the others lincoln was the one that went absolutely hog wild and was

2160
02:57:32,360 --> 02:57:41,240
wild and was a tyrant it was abraham lincoln that arrested all of his opposition and let the army

2161
02:57:41,240 --> 02:57:48,680
rob everything even in the north i mean they use it as a power grab oh man and again i'm not saying

2162
02:57:48,680 --> 02:57:53,320
the south was good either it was all manipulated by british intelligence see it's not one side's

2163
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:57,880
good other sides bad usually usually it's more complex than that and lincoln actually thought

2164
02:57:57,880 --> 02:58:03,240
he was doing good i've actually read his writings the guy owned nothing wanted to own nothing he was

2165
02:58:03,240 --> 02:58:08,360
very very strange person his wife was into the occult i mean this guy's a weirdo man

2166
02:58:09,320 --> 02:58:11,880
probably the weirdest president we've ever had i mean a real weirdo

2167
02:58:15,320 --> 02:58:20,440
the point is go read oh it doesn't even matter people like what he ended slavery

2168
02:58:20,440 --> 02:58:25,880
he said i don't want to end slavery he did that at the end it was not about slavery slavery was

2169
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:30,680
already being phased out because whites in the south figured out slaves were being used to

2170
02:58:30,680 --> 02:58:36,280
leverage them and keep them as sharecroppers anyways oh my gosh i'm gonna go into overdrive

to choose our own party and the right to do our own things play america's so great but we shouldn't

2194
03:01:12,120 --> 03:01:16,200
you know we shouldn't um let the government control us the way they're slowly doing

2195
03:01:16,200 --> 03:01:21,160
actually rapidly doing now like you say well i mean so-called liberals are at the tail end of

2196
03:01:21,160 --> 03:01:25,480
the payoff the globalists are going to take everything they've got and it's important that

2197
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:29,800
they remember why they've been enslaved see that's why they got to have the physical clamp

2198
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:34,920
down because they know people aren't going to go along with this very soon right right totally and

2199
03:01:34,920 --> 03:01:39,720

03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:43,960
are democrats and even they are starting to open up based on the information i share with them they

2201
03:01:43,960 --> 03:01:47,800

2207
03:02:11,720 --> 03:02:15,080
a lot of people here in la think the second amendment isn't that we don't kill each other

2208

Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

2255
03:07:04,360 --> 03:07:09,880
I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan

2256
03:07:09,880 --> 03:07:14,440
requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President

2257
03:07:14,440 --> 03:07:20,040
could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around

2258
03:07:20,040 --> 03:07:25,080
the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age

2259
03:07:25,080 --> 03:07:31,400

He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2265
03:08:10,920 --> 03:08:17,480
Okay, let's race through your phone calls on this live worldwide broadcast on the 28th this Monday,

2266
03:08:17,480 --> 03:08:22,520
and I'm your host Alex Jones. Let's go to Braun in Alabama. You're on the air. Welcome.

2267
03:08:23,720 --> 03:08:25,000
How you doing Alex? Good, sir.

2268
03:08:25,000 --> 03:08:32,920
You know me, I run wtfroi.com. I was calling about the Katrina virus and to inquire if you

2269
03:08:32,920 --> 03:08:39,320
guys had heard about it because it's supposedly posing a big risk with the new norovirus strain

2270
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:48,360
and the flu spreading to all 50 states. Now he's talking about the guy that I interviewed on my

2271
03:08:48,360 --> 03:08:55,720
show, David Christiansen. He's a decorated Air Force officer and he's warning about the

2272
03:08:56,520 --> 03:09:03,000
possibility of a pandemic basically. I'll say this, I mean there was no heavy

2273
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:10,520
flu season four years ago with that whole hype with the H1N1. But this year I've seen more people

2274
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:16,840
sick, heard about more people sick. Overall, I've been super healthy the last few years and had more

2275
03:09:16,840 --> 03:09:23,640
energy since I got on vitamins and minerals. But despite that, I have been sick twice in the last

2276
03:09:23,640 --> 03:09:29,240
12 months or so, which is unheard of other than having allergies to hay fever and stuff that I've

2277
03:09:29,240 --> 03:09:37,240
pretty much had for about 15 years. And it has just been rough and we know that so many of the

2278
03:09:37,240 --> 03:09:43,000
flu shots they give actually turn into flu. That's admitted, it's such an incredible hoax

2279
03:09:43,560 --> 03:09:51,400
that people go out and take shots. But no, I actually just search engine Katrina like the

2280
03:09:51,400 --> 03:10:02,440
hurricane. He turns it Katrina virus, he was actually black bag NDA style before the first NDA

2281
03:10:02,440 --> 03:10:09,480
provision really came across. And he's documented all this in the federal court documents on his

2282
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:16,520
website. Very interesting, I mean look, we know the H1N1 itself was not even really a real virus.

2283
03:10:16,520 --> 03:10:23,000
It was a stimulant virus released the year before by one of those major companies. I forget which

2284
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:27,880
ones we had scientists on at the time. Again, it's truly amazing, I'll have to look more into that.

2285
03:10:27,880 --> 03:10:31,560
Thank you, Braun. James in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding.

2286
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:47,880
Hey Alex, how you doing? Fantastic job. Look here, I work on law enforcement. Some years ago I called

2287
03:10:47,880 --> 03:10:48,920
you to the station and you were just getting started on this Chinese stuff. Like say, we was

2288
03:10:48,920 --> 03:10:52,280
investigating a drug run and everything in Houston, right? So we stopped at 18 with a truck.

2289
03:10:52,280 --> 03:10:57,880
And lo and behold, we checked it out, it was a false bottom. Would you not believe that there

2290
03:10:57,880 --> 03:11:03,240
was a Chinese guy sitting up on a laptop inside of an 18 truck that was a false bottom. And this

2291
03:11:03,240 --> 03:11:07,160
was at the Port of Houston. People better understand that these guys are working on

2292
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:10,600
the port and lots of stuff we can't get out there. But I'm telling you, your port and these

2293
03:11:10,600 --> 03:11:14,520
containers and everything, the way they just typically want to bring the Chinese into your

2294
03:11:14,520 --> 03:11:19,400
particular country would be the containers. Because used containers are basically to have

2295
03:11:19,400 --> 03:11:25,240
bomb shelters and everything else and use it for apartments now. And also, Ted Gunnison before he

2296
03:11:25,240 --> 03:11:31,880
passed away, poor souls, said to y'all, even Mr. Navy Seals, and I'm a military myself,

2297
03:11:31,880 --> 03:11:37,320
that the military was going after Seals, Special Forces, because we knew how to fight.

2298
03:11:37,320 --> 03:11:42,040
And then voices came on to explain the same thing too, what you got to say. All these people

2299
03:11:42,040 --> 03:11:46,200
down in the world don't understand and listen to what these people are saying. Even the politicians,

2300
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:50,520
because if they come in here and take over Chinese, the politicians are going to understand

2301
03:11:50,520 --> 03:11:54,440
that there's going to be head on the chopping block too and left alone with us too. Because

2302
03:11:54,440 --> 03:11:58,520
like I say, once they take over, they're going to get them too. So they better wake up to the

2303
03:11:58,520 --> 03:12:04,760
fact of what's going on. And they're talking about a gun-free zone. Just put a sign up in

2304
03:12:04,760 --> 03:12:10,680
the United States, a gun-free zone, and any nation will take over us. But decide to come,

2305
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:13,480
and our government, and the ones that they'll need, that's going to be a consistent-

2306
03:12:13,480 --> 03:12:16,680
Sure, sure, sir, let me stop because you're making a lot of really good points. And I can tell you

2307
03:12:16,680 --> 03:12:20,600
on a cell phone, I'm getting about 90% of it. Can you talk right into the phone?

2308
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:23,240
Right, one second.

2309
03:12:23,240 --> 03:12:25,560
No, no, that's a lot better. Where's the phone now?

2310
03:12:25,560 --> 03:12:26,600
Okay, can you hear me now?

2311
03:12:26,600 --> 03:12:30,520
A million times better, I can tell that was a hands-free or something. Okay, start over,

2312
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:34,440
because you brought up General Boykin, you brought up Ted Gunnerson. Yeah, I remember Ted

2313
03:12:34,440 --> 03:12:42,840
Gunnerson, now that you mention it, on my show 15 years ago, it was like 1998, saying in the future,

2314
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:46,840
they're going to say veterans of the terrorists. And I remember going, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2315
03:12:46,840 --> 03:12:52,760
But it turns out now, again, imagine how over the top this is.

2316
03:12:53,480 --> 03:12:57,000
Now the Homeland Security manuals that they're giving police all over the country say

2317
03:12:57,000 --> 03:13:01,880
veterans are the number one enemy, bad mouthing the founding fathers. How obvious does this have

2318
03:13:01,880 --> 03:13:07,400
to get? A, B, you were talking about finding Chinese coming in in these containers.

2319
03:13:08,120 --> 03:13:12,760
That's actually come out in the news, AK-47s, drugs, and usually get swept under the rug.

2320
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:16,680
Start over what you were saying. I want people to hear all this really clearly now.

2321
03:13:17,240 --> 03:13:21,560
And then specifically down in Houston, I guess you're a police officer, it sounds like.

2322
03:13:21,560 --> 03:13:27,160
Are people waking up now when they've got a bill saying the government can keep its

2323
03:13:27,160 --> 03:13:30,120
guns but the citizens can't? I mean, how obvious is that?

2324
03:13:30,120 --> 03:13:37,320
Yes, everybody's waking up now. As a matter of fact, if you go on any network to try to find

2325
03:13:37,320 --> 03:13:41,720
ammo and try to find weapons and everything. We just had a gun show in Houston this past

2326
03:13:41,720 --> 03:13:47,080
weekend at the George R. Brown. And you can't find semi-automatic weapons and everything.

2327
03:13:47,080 --> 03:13:52,200
People are realizing that the government is basically leaving us out there to dry.

2328
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:55,480
And for anybody to come in, if people are saying right now, it's like, look here,

2329
03:13:56,040 --> 03:14:00,760
just put a sign in the United States to say, here, gun-free zone, come and take over and just take

2330
03:14:00,760 --> 03:14:05,320
over the whole thing. And like I say, the politicians better understand that we are the

2331
03:14:05,320 --> 03:14:09,720
first offense to help them because when it comes down to a long time ago, you remember a long time

2332
03:14:09,720 --> 03:14:14,360
ago when you had the sheriff's department round up a posse to say, we need the citizens to protect.

2333
03:14:14,360 --> 03:14:20,680
The same thing as we had back in the 50s. We had civil defense where everybody had weapons,

2334
03:14:20,680 --> 03:14:25,800
they had the civil defense training to actually go to help the country. Now it's been imported

2335
03:14:25,800 --> 03:14:29,720
where they've basically talked to giving us away. And the politicians better understand that

2336
03:14:30,360 --> 03:14:35,640
your people in America is the one that's going to be able to protect them if we get to the point of

2337
03:14:35,640 --> 03:14:40,600
getting overthrown. Because when we go, they go the same time too, and there's nobody to protect

2338
03:14:40,600 --> 03:14:44,280
them. They think they got redoubts, but like I said, again, they're letting them come in there

2339
03:14:44,280 --> 03:14:49,160
through the port. Listen, I agree, this is what crazy elites have always done.

2340
03:14:49,160 --> 03:14:54,200
They oppress their own people till the whole system collapses. That's why the third world

2341
03:14:54,200 --> 03:15:00,040
is the way it is. And it's just insane. And again, I go back to crime statistics. I don't

2342
03:15:00,040 --> 03:15:05,000
just believe every government statistic like unemployment or inflation. We know those are

2343
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:11,000
cooked, we've had experts on. Worldwide, the Bible of statistics is crime statistics

2344
03:15:11,640 --> 03:15:15,320
set up by J. Edgar Hoover himself with the card index system.

2345
03:15:15,320 --> 03:15:18,920
They get the local numbers, they put them in, they're not perfect, but there's some of the best

2346
03:15:18,920 --> 03:15:28,360
numbers out there. 49% drop in violent crime since 1991. Now, everybody knows more guns means less

2347
03:15:28,360 --> 03:15:34,040
crime. And so the fact that the police are hearing turn the guns in, they're not stupid.

2348
03:15:34,040 --> 03:15:37,880
And so that's good news, though, because what you're saying is what I'm getting.

2349
03:15:37,880 --> 03:15:42,520
Even police that thought patriots were loons are now going, wait, it's all happening.

2350
03:15:42,520 --> 03:15:44,920
I really think the establishment is miscalculated.

2351
03:15:44,920 --> 03:15:51,560
But the thing about it, Alex, they need to go back to the civil defense because

2352
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:56,920
we have given away our civil defense to, like I said, a long time ago. I'm 52 years old.

2353
03:15:56,920 --> 03:16:03,080
And we had that where we would defend the country, not put our country in harm's way.

2354
03:16:03,080 --> 03:16:07,720
So we need to turn the people around and say, look here, instead of us giving our guns away,

2355
03:16:07,720 --> 03:16:09,160
we need to protect even-

2356
03:16:09,160 --> 03:16:10,280
I mean, even-

2357
03:16:10,280 --> 03:16:15,560
Absolutely, and if we have a collapse, the good people need to be armed. The good people turning

2358
03:16:15,560 --> 03:16:20,280
their guns in during a collapse is the opposite of what you want. God bless you. Let me play this

2359
03:16:20,280 --> 03:16:27,560
clip for you and get your take on it, James. He's a police officer from Houston. This is Sheriff

2360
03:16:27,560 --> 03:16:34,360
David Clark of Milwaukee saying, hey, they're laying off sheriff's deputies. We're having cuts.

2361
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:39,880
And he responded down to the city council getting on to him for the city. He's outside the city.

2362
03:16:39,880 --> 03:16:44,760
He's saying, look, you guys have got bodyguards. The general public doesn't. Here is that clip.

2363
03:16:45,640 --> 03:16:48,680
I'm Sheriff David Clark and I want to talk to you about something personal,

2364
03:16:48,680 --> 03:16:53,560
your safety. It's no longer a spectator sport. I need you in the game. But are you ready?

2365
03:16:53,560 --> 03:16:58,360
With officers laid off and furloughed, simply calling 911 and waiting is no longer your best

2366
03:16:58,360 --> 03:17:02,840
option. You can beg for mercy from a violent criminal, hide under the bed, or you can fight

2367
03:17:02,840 --> 03:17:07,560
back. But are you prepared? Consider taking a certified safety course and handling a firearm

2368
03:17:07,560 --> 03:17:12,200
so you can defend yourself until we get there. You have a duty to protect yourself and your family.

2369
03:17:12,200 --> 03:17:15,720
We're partners now. Can I count on you? This safety message brought to you by the

2370
03:17:15,720 --> 03:17:18,040
Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office. What do you think of that?

2371
03:17:18,040 --> 03:17:24,520
Oh, that's fantastic. I saw that and I'm aware of him and it was good because think about it.

2372
03:17:24,520 --> 03:17:30,280
The citizens is the United States bodyguard. Not only the bodyguard for the United States,

2373
03:17:30,280 --> 03:17:33,800
but you and I, because you want somebody, basically when I get in trouble, I want a

2374
03:17:33,800 --> 03:17:39,240
citizen to protect me. And also these guys are so-called corrupt. Even to protect their

2375
03:17:39,240 --> 03:17:43,960
sorry behind because simple reason that they're sorry, but you have a duty to do so. But they

2376
03:17:43,960 --> 03:17:50,280
don't understand that. If you disarm your people, they actually put themselves in harm's way too.

2377
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:54,200
You're absolutely right. God bless you. Great points. Have a safe week.

2378
03:17:54,920 --> 03:18:00,520
Yeah, it's gonna backfire on them if we just hold the line and get back in their face.

2379
03:18:00,520 --> 03:18:05,560
They tell us, it's discrediting to get in their face. Baloney, they wanna keep you in a coma,

2380
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:10,920
folks. You've gotta get angry and get moving. And stand up and others will stand up who've

2381
03:18:10,920 --> 03:18:17,000
been waiting in the shadows. Let's go to Bertrand real fast in Canada. Go ahead, Bertrand.

2382
03:18:18,520 --> 03:18:25,720
Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I gotta apologize to you. I confronted you quite a few

2383
03:18:25,720 --> 03:18:32,280
years ago on your show and I doubted you and I thought you had a hidden agenda. But you know what?

2384
03:18:33,320 --> 03:18:40,200
I gotta apologize. I became a Prison Planet TV member back in 2010, in 2011.

2385
03:18:40,200 --> 03:18:46,200
I'm sorry I didn't renew in 2012. Credit cards maxed out, but I'm gonna hopefully

2386
03:18:46,920 --> 03:18:54,440
renew again soon. And after you did that interview with the guys that made the movie

2387
03:18:54,440 --> 03:18:59,720
Lamp in the Dark, and you sold that video? Yes. On your website? Yes.

2388
03:19:00,600 --> 03:19:08,200
And I just wanna rant to those idiots out there that create this propaganda,

2389
03:19:08,200 --> 03:19:14,520
that you're a Vatican agent? That's a load of crap. You guys are idiots.

2390
03:19:14,520 --> 03:19:19,000
Well, listen, listen, listen. They do it to make money, but that's fine. It doesn't matter.

2391
03:19:19,880 --> 03:19:23,640
They say on everything else too. Let's just, and God bless you, I gotta go to break here,

2392
03:19:23,640 --> 03:19:28,680
but let me just say this. Let's just say I'm a bad guy. Okay, let's get that debate out of the way.

2393
03:19:28,680 --> 03:19:34,120
They wanna make my supporters defend me so that they don't fight the New World Order and wake

2394
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:40,280
people up. Don't defend me, everybody. Okay, I mean, defend me if they ever falsely arrest me

2395
03:19:40,280 --> 03:19:45,160
or something, but don't defend me from made up crud. That's designed, the White House leaks

2396
03:19:45,160 --> 03:19:49,640
admit, with Cass Sunstein and others, to get us fighting with each other. Just ignore it.

2397
03:19:49,640 --> 03:19:54,600
Go wake people up about the New World Order coming down on us. Don't defend Alex Jones.

2398
03:19:54,600 --> 03:20:04,600
That's meant to divert you off. Let them have me, okay? Let them go after me.
