1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,120
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:29,920
Alex Jones

4
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:37,360
it's January 30th on this Wednesday edition 2013 we're gonna be live here

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,120
for the next three hours and we had him on last week and the hour went by very

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,480
quickly so I wanted to get him on for an hour today so you could question him Jim

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,560
Garo was talking about a quote retired military living legend saying that the

8
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,260
military brass that he knows has told them they're having a litmus test will

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,840
you fire on US citizens well the military's training for that and that's

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,920
in the news and General Boykin the former head of Special Forces he's been

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,240
talking about plans for a police state he's been talking about our government

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,360
giving al-qaeda terrorist weapons gee I wonder what general mr. Garo is talking

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,800
about but he has more to say today and he said the general not that we know

14
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,060
it's Boykin did not want to go public himself but wanted to go through Jim

15
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,480
Garo and I looked up Jim Garo he runs heavily in the big Christian circles as

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,120
general Boykin does the same circles but he will not reveal the source I'm smart

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,880
enough to know who it is and again people said well why are you revealing

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,560
it then you know 99% chance because the NSA and the government already knows I

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,400
don't live in a delusional world here ladies and gentlemen and I wasn't sworn

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,160

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,680
last month or two I mean there's got to be more than 20 where they say gun owners

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,680
Newsweek last week piers pressure I've talked about so much where it says the

47
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,520
fight is not only brown and black against white now but our friends the

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,720
communist Chinese will help and so will piers Morgan it's globalism against the

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:31,800
we are living on the edge of a designed controlled implosion they open three new

99
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:40,360
coal-powered plants a week in Communist China we are not allowed to open one new

100
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,800
one a year in fact just this week multiple coal-powered plants we covered

101
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,760
this on Monday were shut down more modern plants that are extremely clean

102
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,440
and a new one that had been built over the last five years has officially been

103
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,920
told they're not allowed to open on the Texas coast that was to supply Houston

104
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,920
Corpus Christi and surrounding areas we now have to buy our power from Mexico

105
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,480
that's on record who have completely dirty coal-burning plants but again

106
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,280
they're globalist owned you see everything is about shutting us down

107
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,720
with taxes and regulations and red tape so you can only operate in India and

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,920
China and Mexico and it doesn't build up those people it actually lowers their

109
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,160
standard of living on average as well don't look at it

110
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
China has a lower standard of living Mexico has a lower standard of living

111
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:45,880
India has a lower standard of living for the general population and they try to

112
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,480
cook those numbers but it's clear that's why just in 2011 something like 48,000

113
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,400
farmers committed suicide in India and it was some huge number last year as

114
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,880
well the official tallies aren't out yet statistics always come out six months to

115
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,320
a year later Mexico don't have to tell you about Mexico its economy just the

116
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,880
worst it's ever been close to 60,000 deaths the last five years this is the

117
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,920

in chaos and bloodshed that's the plan who runs the world solid proof a core

130
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,240

132
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,880
country when I've got to get to that article because it just goes through is

133
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,040
just just the latest amazing trampling of Liberty

front msnbc's Finney rips crazy crackers on the right for very hateful language

136
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,040
and again this is all about the so-called left who are really nothing

137
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:59,120
more than authoritarians absolutely going crazy and getting in everyone's

138
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,760
face and saying you're a racist you're bad if you don't accept higher taxes if

139
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,280
you don't turn your guns in if you don't take force inoculations they now call

140
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:19,800
racist for everything or everything and again it's a gang mentality and it's not

141
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,680
even so-called minorities who are really the majority in this country now who are

142
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,760
the ones pushing it it is the social engineers who want to divide Americans

economy is bad now and the GDP shrinking now folks you ain't seen nothing yet and

157
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,120
and let me tell you the social engineers it's all in agenda 21 it's all in the

158
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:54,480
big sociology papers that we covered you know last week with dr. Corsi in studio

159
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,200
there it is industry group 204 coal power plants to be closed in next five

160
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,960
years and what is that out of because that's a that's the environmental leader

161
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,800
and when did they come out with that report well that's September 20th 2012

162
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,400
they've already closed 200 plants what are they talking about I guess that's

163
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,560
just their their estimate on on what what more is going to be closed

164
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,800
regardless they've already shut down 200 they say they're shutting down 200 more

165
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,080
estimates I see as many as a thousand because see they say oh you can stay

166
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,240
open just do these things but then that bankrupts you which you've all seen the

167
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,560
clip or maybe you haven't in fact we're gonna play later the clip of the racist

168
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,280
stuff first but can you guys just pull up on YouTube the Obama we're gonna

169
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,000
bankrupt coal clip from five years ago thanks I don't want to just I'm getting

170
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,040
neurotic about I don't want to just say that and listeners go oh yeah right I

171
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,720
want to I want you to hear Obama saying you can have a coal-powered plant we're

172
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,880
gonna bankrupt you you know we've got enough clean burning coal that means

173
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,560
it's absolutely clean without even having all the expensive scrubbers to

174
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,160
run this country for over a hundred years and the studies they did in 1997

175
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,760
when Clinton laid off millions of acres in southern Utah and into one other

176
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,160
state of the only clean burning coal in the world other than a field in Mongolia

177
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
China that the Chinese developed and guess what the company that was given

178
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,760
the state rights to that a year before guess what happened to their stock in

179
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,080
the week after Clinton signed an executive order in 97 knocking it off

180
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:29,640
limits their stock doubled their stock doubled you see the real way the

181
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:36,200
globalist make money is they just shut down hundreds of plants not owned by

182
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,880
globalist and then that makes their profits go up because you've got to buy

183
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,000
it from them and they can gouge you I mean this is so elementary put rules on

184
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,560
where nobody can have a factory here in the u.s. it moves to China only globalist

185
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,800
insiders who made the deals when they put Mao into power and then officially

186
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,800
made the deal in 75 when Nixon went there 76 sent his minions earlier than

187
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,920
that

188
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,160
I guess Nixon went like 72 my point is is that even after that happened the

189
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,280
issue is ladies and gentlemen is that this is a full takeover and then they

190
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,720
can go and operate and and it's total and whenever Bush was in Republicans

191
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,160
were like I don't care if he tortures I don't care if there's secret arrest I

192
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,640
don't care what they do I'm feeling good my guys in and I'm like don't you

193
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,400
understand he's a globalist they had that same look of satisfaction shut up

194
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:30,240
liberal I'm like no no no he's a puppet it's an agenda we've got to get and now

195
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,840
the left is is I've got to say probably three times worse I mean they do not

196
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,200
care what Obama does they can he can raise their taxes he can go back on

197
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,160
promises and go after their guns he can do all of that and they don't care

198
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,400
because he's their guy and their winners through him reflected glory and it's the

199
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:59,160
creed of slaves it really gets to me we have the Obama cold video here he is in

200
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,800
2008 on television here it is so if somebody wants to build a coal-powered

201
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,440
plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're gonna be

202
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:16,160
charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted so

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,640
there you go

204
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,080
and so yeah they've shut 200 and something down they say they're gonna

205
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,560
shut down 200 more few months ago the numbers I've got is by some industry

206
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,720
analysts it's over a thousand because you won't be able to operate

207
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,160
and people like good I don't want those rich guys make money off coal folks and

208
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,120
then when I talk about this oh you must own coal stock or be with the coal

209
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,520
industry I've never gotten one red cent from anybody involved in any

210
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:52,520
petrochemicals coal distillates anything zero let me tell you though Austin is

211
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,680
the model of the Western world we get a UN awards were the official model city

212
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,040
of agenda 21 we even beat San Francisco out last year they'll look it up the

213
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,920
only other city was like one other Japanese cities our sister city they got

214
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,000
the Co award look it up

215
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,480
and our pro our our our power prices you can look this up have roughly doubled

216
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,120
the last four plus years and now they're set to double again we've got one power

217
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,960
plant that's very new just got upgraded about a decade ago the Fayetteville

218
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,960
plant one of the biggest in the state they're set to shut it down works

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,920
years ago when the carbon taxes that they're on corporations who don't get

226

waivers went in in California they went into a nose dive that's the plan when

275
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,600
lesson of my own about RNA drops I learned that there are millions of gene

276
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,120
switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an

277
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,760
activator I learned by taking RNA drops I could begin to activate that power in

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,320
my cells and achieve the more that I desire I'd like to share what I

the place is where

286
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,000
again if you're a new listener and you're like man this guy is like super

287
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,360
ultra negative if you go into the doctor and they say you've got a compound

288
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,080
fracture your bones sticking out of your leg we've got to do a surgery and fix

289
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,820
that it's not negative you're you're you're at the hospital you're getting

290
00:24:54,820 --> 00:25:00,440
aid and the politicians are like we're gonna get you more welfare we're gonna

291
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:07,120
get you more food stamps and their own official policies that we've covered at

292
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,400
nauseum are to de-industrialize us under the treaty that we're signed on to

293
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:21,840
agenda 21 and the cover is it's for the environment

294
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,600
and it's so criminal that my own City Council is the model of this number four

295
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,640
years ago they are three and a half years ago they couldn't get the carbon

296
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,600
taxes ran through officially at the Copenhagen Denmark UN meeting because

297
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,640
all those documents were coming out how they were really planning to destroy

298
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,280
economies and carry out eugenics and how the third world had to have right at

299
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,360
double the cuts even the West did and now it was a death sentence not just a

300
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,000
death sentence for the economy death sentence for people and Schwarzenegger

301
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,920
said I will lead you can pull this up I will lead the move and a UN plan to

302
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,120
take over the cities and the states if the nation states will not do it they

303
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,400
were already doing that program it's called UN muneal ization standardized

304
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,400
tied to federal HUD funds in our country similar funds in Europe and other areas

305
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,160
and they come in with hey here's a 50 million dollars for your little town if

306
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:19,160
you agree to pass ordinances that all these people can't build on their

307
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,760
property you can only build on this property and then the maps are drawn

308
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,080
with a local boss all good old boys so they get to keep their land and the

309
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:32,000
globalists get to come in and do deals with them I mean it's very simple you

310
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,320
shut off power plants your power plants make more money

311
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,760
you shut off industry but only your industry gets to operate now you've got

312
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,320
a monopoly you shut off other people's real estate your real estate increases

313
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,880
in price that's how the globalist make their money and their control that's

314
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,960
their big secret and so as things shut down they say don't worry we got

315
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,520
welfare for you Oh food stamps went from 25 million to almost 50 million now

316
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,240
they're going to be a hundred million and it's the same in Europe the same all

317
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,920
over the world this is an exact program

318
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,160
and we've talked about it forever but people need to understand it's now gonna

319
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,720
get very very bad I'm gonna come back and go to your calls in a long segment

320
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,840
that's coming up but look at this US economy unexpectedly contracts in fourth

321
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,800
quarter I mean give me a break folks they knew that all the things they're

322
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,560
doing with contract the economy and wait until all the payroll taxes increasing

323
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:38,280
goes into place wait until all the thousands of major businesses who wrote

324
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,320
the health care law lower people down to 25 hours a week

325
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,720
instead of 40 so they get out of the Obamacare yeah it'll show an uptick in

326
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,080
employment because they're gonna count people working extra jobs as new jobs

327
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,200
but you're not gonna have as much money and it doesn't matter though you can

328
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,200
just get starry-eyed and go but I got Obama in he loves me he hates the rich

329
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,200
people US economy unexpectedly contracts in fourth quarter the average person's

330
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,000
getting hundreds of dollars more out of their paycheck every month taking out

331
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,320
other paychecks some estimates are as high as $200 for people making like

332
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,800
30,000 a year I mean this is just this is the difference between getting enough

333
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,840
groceries and then people love their servitude though because they've been

334
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,440
dumbed down and it just goes on here it just goes on here with the headlines US

335
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:41,360
debt headed towards 200% of GDP even after fiscal cliff deal think about that

336
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:50,680
think about how think about how crazy that is

337
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:58,600
the debt yearly will be 200% of GDP that means you're making let's say $50,000 a

338
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:09,320
year and your debt is $100,000 are you gonna be in a good position no you're

339
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,440
gonna be a debt slave who was put into this position and it makes me so angry

340
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,800
to now see our country's credit rating being devalued just like they've done to

341
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,000
European nations like Greece and when they're done that's where we're going to

342
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,000
be and they'll be up there promising more government more taxes to give to

343
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,320
people who had their factories and jobs shipped overseas and their jobs here

344
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,680
destroyed with red tape with the streets teeming with paramilitary police

Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

385
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,160
all right we're going to your phone calls again Alex Jones here if you just

386
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:28,160
joined us last night I listened to a little bit of the rebroadcast of the

387
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,160
show via the streams the audio streams at prison planet calm I clicked on them

388
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,400
and I was listening to my 15-minute rant towards the end of the third hour about

389
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,880
the plan to fully convert our society over to an automated technocratic

390
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,280
technocracy that's in the words of Zbigniew Brzezinski back in the 70s in

391
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,160
one of his books I read I forget all the titles of them I think was the

392
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:03,760
technotronic age point is is that they planned all this and you got to hand it

393
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,000
to them what they envisioned 30 40 50 years ago they did I mean I read stuff

394
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,880
Bertrand Russell wrote Nobel Prize winner was it for literature wrote in

395
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,960
the 30s and I mean it's what's happening now

396
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:27,240
take Aldous Huxley he wrote in 1932 brave new world and then of course he

397
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,200
gave a speech in 61 62 before he died at Berkeley it's online you can go listen

398
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,240
to it just type Aldous Huxley's Berkeley speech where he said this book is what I

399
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,200
believe would really happen being in the highest levels of scientific

400
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,360
intelligentsia growing up in London and of course his brother founded UNESCO at

401
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,560
the UN which is the real head of the UN

402
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:57,360
Julian Huxley and I cover it in the endgame it's just this is not my opinion

403
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,160
and I go back to this caller who was calling about how they're replacing

404
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,000
their Air Force base with drones in Arkansas and he just said yeah they're

405
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,240
getting rid of the I guess his army base it was a tens and he just hung up

406
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,200
sounding depressed and I realized if you just tune in and you hear all this you

407
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,360
need to think it's crazy because it is crazy but it's I'm not the one doing it

408
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:24,000
I know it sounds crazy reality is crazy truth is stranger than fiction has been

409
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,800
said a billion times

410
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:34,400
and I don't go over all this just to demoralize people I do it so people know

411
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,600
about it so that we're not compartmentalized and so we can see

412
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,160
through the wall next to us and then through the next wall and the next wall

413
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,120
and realize we're all in this together

414
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:49,920
man I don't care if you're some foolish cop running an illegal checkpoint I pull

415
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,320
up to and it's happened

416
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,320
I'm not even mad at you anymore

417
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,920
I'm mainly frustrated because I know the whole program basically I know how

418
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,320
you're programmed

419
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,280
I know you're compartmentalized and if I throw a fit and start yelling at you

420
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,280
it's because I'm sick of it

421
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,480
it'd be like if I was trying to get out of a burning house and I came to the

422
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,560
door and you're there going I'm not gonna let you out

423
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,120
I'm like do you see the fire and the smoke no I don't conspiracy theorist

424
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,600
I'm like listen all oh I just I don't even know what to say anymore

425
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,600
they're unplugging our power plants

426
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,800
they're shutting our entire industry down that they're writing books and laws

427
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,520
and white papers about it

428
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,520
they're evil they're evil

429
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,520
I want to stop them don't you care

430
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,120
people say what do we do and you know I guess that's the point we've reached is

431
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,080
there's so many criminals in so many positions of power and then so many yes

432
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,080
men and women beneath them

433
00:36:53,080 --> 00:37:01,400
and I guess that's why they're so confident to now just be out in the open

434
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
with so much of this

435
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:10,240
I mean our country they are trying to hold us under the water and then

436
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,200
somebody else walks along says hey looks like you're trying to drown that person

437
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,120
oh no I'm trying to help get them out of the water sure looks like you're holding

438
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
their head under

439
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,240
and then I walk over and you'll pick up their notebook says here you plan to

440
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,000
drown them here today

441
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
you know you wrote you were going to oh no I'm not doing that you're and they're

442
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,600
holding them under

443
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,880
ok well I see you later Bob guess I'm have fun what you're doing

444
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,160
then later I walk back by there's a dead body floating

445
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,000
and I see Bob later he goes oh no he's not dead he's just relaxing

446
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,480
he's got gills

447
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,960
walk back by two days later there's buzzards over on the side of the water

448
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,000
eating the dead body

449
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
oh no he's not dead he's been liberated

450
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,240
I mean you have to be crazy to buy in to what these people are doing and

451
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,280
it just blows me away

452
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,280
to see them totally dismantling our entire country

453
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,360
and they're selling legalizing the illegal aliens as a way to fix the

454
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,360
economy

455
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,880
and again nothing against the people that are here I know most of these

456
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,880
people are hard-working smart folks who come from a great tyranny

457
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,040
the problem is when by the time they vote

458
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,360
over 90 percent in the polls and studies out there you look it up

459
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,440
vote for socialism because they see the government as their friend because it

460
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,120
told them they were their friend when they're really brought here to be brought

461
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:47,440
into the system inculcated and to get government services to be new dependents

462
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,320
and the illegals becoming citizens on average will vote to take our guns

463
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,600
and they will vote to collectivize and they will vote as long as they get a

464
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,920
goodie from the government

465
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,920
same thing with the domesticated American people

466
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:10,280
and conservatives and libertarians say well things will collapse

467
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,240
you're idiots they're not idiots the power structure is set up to consolidate

468
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,560
the control as we collapse and look I know I talk about this at nauseum but I

469
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,320
will not apologize for it

470
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,240
in closing and I'm going to your calls

471
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,880
so I'm listening to the show last night about 20 minutes of it or so just

472
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,160
dialing in on the iphone app singer of my smartphone laying in bed at 10 at

473
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,240
night or whatever it was

474
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,760
and I'm listening to the end of the third hour where I'm ranting about the

475
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,360
technocracy and I'm angry at myself because there's all these other points I

476
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,560
should have made and I could have if I was calm and I'm thinking about it all

477
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,080
but then I listen to the old guy calling in from Arkansas at the end of the call

478
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,560
signing just bummed out and that's not what I'm trying to do

479
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm just trying to get you to become aware of what's going on

480
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,640
because here's the deal the arcade I'm pro technology

481
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,920
the problem is the architecture of the way technology is being rolled out

482
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,520
through federal and global regulations in concert with the dozen or so major

483
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:25,240
15 or so major technology companies is to put back door trojan horses in to

484
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,240
control and track everything we do

485
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:31,160
outside of law

486
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,240
and that's why there's new articles out about all the wireless devices and

487
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,680
computers have security flaws back doors no matter what company it is these are

488
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,560
built in

489
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,800
how that happened they're designed for the NSA for the police for Google to

490
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,060
break into your computer

491
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,040
Google got caught two years ago driving around with cars all over the world

492
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,680
hacking your computers but they weren't hacking them they had the keys

493
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,400
they are the NSA

494
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:03,720
and again they're building this whole technocracy to phase out humanity

495
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,200
we are obsolete and and and in the words of the global technocrats

496
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,200
well I say the tyrants are obsolete

497
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,640
and this is a huge power trip for them to be building this huge program to

498
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,720
have envisioned this huge program and their their response is you know if

499
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,920
you're reading this is in some of their books and white papers

500
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,240
you're thinking it's immoral

501
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:34,800
notice that no one's opposing us because they're dumb animals

502
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,520
and then they built a system to make people act like dumb animals from birth

503
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,360
the television the dumbing down the chemicals

504
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:48,000
it's so diabolical and it's all for full control and to put this into full

505
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,880
control

506
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,480
I mean again I talk about smart meters 10 years ago more than 10 years ago with

507
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,120
with engineers and people and I would have retired engineers on who who were

508
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,440
young who had left these companies

509
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,720
I mean while you heard the interviews warning about me text Mars

510
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,600
who's a engineer

511
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:12,160
Air Force officer scientist your best-selling books ever on robots

512
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,720
I guess the technology futurist for the Air Force before I became a space and

513
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:23,960
aeronautics professor at UT I read his book project lucid like in 95 when it

514
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,080
came out and it was about the smart meters and microchips and smart dust and

515
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,480
RFID and and and and then you know I later people a decade later breaking the

516
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,240
news

517
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,360
I mean this is all very old stuff and you warn people about this

518
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:49,480
and they go that's never going to happen you know my laptop isn't watching me and

519
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,320
I've had family years ago 10 years ago at my house they'd say why is your

520
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,040
laptop computer covered

521
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,040
why do you have a piece of tape over it into the built-in camera

522
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,160
when that when they were first starting to do that I'd say because they watch

523
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,720
you

524
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,760
oh yeah yeah they watch me now it's just all admitted you know it's public see

525
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,240
see how far we've come and I know I'm ranting I'll go to your calls

526
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,880
it's just that all this evil is already there

527
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,320
and denying it only gives it power and now that you're not in denial I don't

528
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,800
want you to get scared

529
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,560
I want you to get aggressive because we can educate people there can be a huge

530
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,560
turning against this a flipping

531
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,000
and it's starting to happen and people can just refuse this you know women are

532
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,600
standing up the smart meters because at an instinctive level they know it's

533
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,080
dangerous and bad and they know that all the new appliances dial into it and

534
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,120
they're wondering why every new appliance they buy has smart meter

535
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:57,160
wireless pickups in it and your TV does and your computer does and they admit

536
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,320
they're using it to track everything you do and even controlling your thermostat

537
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,960
and they're doing test women are sitting there in their houses watching the

538
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,920
thermostat change they call the power company and they go we're just doing

539
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,040
some tests but you gotta some tests to see if you go along with it

540
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,240
I mean it's so diabolical the government's watching you

541
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,040
they're molesting you at the airport they're controlling your your

542
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,040
thermostat

543
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,040
and folks this is just the beginning

544
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,200
show again the people at the other end of these computers are very bad

545
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,680
and their plan is to build an electronic present around you for your orderly

546
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,160
death and I know that sounds incredible but it's on record that they plan to do

547
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,360
this and I'm begging all of you to realize none of you are safe they're

548
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,800
already attacking you all

549
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,880
they're spraying stuff it's in the food it's in the water everybody's sick even

550
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
when they're taking vitamins and minerals to fight it

551
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,200
people like that are doing okay those that aren't are walking dead

552
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,200
the cancer rates are exploding this is real

553
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,280
let's go ahead and talk to DC in Ohio DC you're on the air

554
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,560
hey Alex how you doing today I'm doing all right brother

555
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,320
all right hey first-time caller and a first-time listener of the show

556
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,040
I'm an ex-navy during the first Gulf War when Papa Bush was even talking about

557
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,160
the New World Order at that time

558
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,440
I'm an ex-mortgage broker when the government was giving away loans to

559
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,880
everybody with bad credit so we all get in houses before the stock market crashed

560
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,400
and now a father of three

561
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,400
I'm a byproduct of the economic disaster of the middle class

562
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:54,160
I can't if I'm on food stamps I can't afford gas had to take public

563
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,680
transportation and now I'm just super concerned about everything that's going

564
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,880
on with the billions of dollars taken out of the Federal Reserve the army

565
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,960
tactics that are going on in Miami and in Houston and and it's got to stop we

566
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,120
gotta fight the fight

567
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,540
well I mean I just want all the bureaucrats everybody else to know I

568
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,540
mean they're all on a power trip just like the Obama supporters

569
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:25,200
it's so infantile it's like when you're three years old and you know you you

570
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,680
feel secure around your dad and your dad's talking to the neighbor and you're

571
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,040
standing there by your dad's leg and you you look over and lean your cheek up

572
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,240
against your dad and just oh my daddy's so tough my daddy's so strong

573
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,640
everybody who's had a father remembers that feeling that's the same feeling

574
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,840
government lovers get is they just look at you with this satisfied look

575
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,960
I see it in the cops beating up people with video cameras on the street or

576
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,200
going in people's houses without warrants the cops just have this

577
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,960
satisfied look

578
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,560
there's nothing you're gonna do I'm back and you know I got the people back at

579
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,160
the headquarters back in me and it's a satisfaction well I want you to know

580
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,880
something

581
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,020
the people running this are killing you and your family you dumb government

582
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,840
bureaucrats you're walking dead

583
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,440
they're eugenicist they're killing you I'm sorry go ahead

584
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,480
oh no I was going to say I've been pulled over so many times in the last

585
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,400
two years because of the scanners that they put on the police vehicles the

586
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,200
senior they could stand hundreds of license plates as they go down the

587
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:29,240
street and then anybody who has a warrant they pull over or anybody who

588
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,880
has priors they pull over you know ask you to a breathalyzer for for what you

589
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,040
know and again and again they act like it's not there when I pulled through the

590
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,600
border patrol checkpoint at alpine I went down to I'm gonna play this today

591
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,840
we've had it ready for a week but I've been so busy

592
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,840
I'll either air it today or or on the nightly news tonight but but the point

593
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,160
is I pulled the board patrol checkpoint they obviously know who I am they're all

594
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,600
looking I've been through there before other checkpoints and they're all about

595
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:04,240
to pull me over to the secondary search area where I always refuse and he goes

596
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,120
why are you videotaping me and I said you're videotaping me and they're like

597
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,200
no we're not and I'm like really what are all these video cameras and the guy

598
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,520
smiles it's like a mind game and and and yeah they've got these these these

599
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,040
robot cameras scanning us but you listen you know the secret of Patriots now

600
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,840
Patriots are now going to Mexico or buying Mexican cars with Mexican plates

601
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:31,360
I'm thinking about doing it I'm gonna be honest and you become God they don't

602
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,040
scan you they don't read you nothing I'm serious I'm thinking about changing my

603
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,600
name to like Juan Gonzalez and getting a Mexican car folks I'm sorry I'm not

604
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:45,480
joking I mean I may do this as an experiment legally change my name still

605
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,800
be Alex Jones in the air but legally have the name Juan Gonzalez and I'm

606
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,240
gonna get Mexican cars and I'm God I mean I will be God level at that point

607
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:57,560
until they fully bring the u.s. down and then close the trap on everybody they

608
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,120
brought in but what is that five ten years who knows I mean can you believe

609
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,120
that illegal aliens are God and I'm going I'm serious I've advised my crew

610
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,440
because you try to stay outside the system you know your license expires

611
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,240
you try to stay out of their grid they attack citizens with a savage hate but

612
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,640
let me tell you you get the Mexican plates God level they're now putting out

613
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,280
fake Mexican plates that people are using and the scanners don't touch him

614
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,880
and the cops leave you alone because they've been told that is that's there

615
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,360
to bring down the economy drive down the wages and vote to take the guns that's a

616
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:32,200
god leave a god alone well I declare myself an Olympian God I declare myself

617
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,520
Juan Gonzalez and I am God I mean I am God of the police now I can start

618
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,680
drinking and driving I can start not having insurance it's over what do you

619
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,160
think of that plan that's an awesome plan and I'm a lucky one because I can't

620
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:54,160
afford the smart TVs and the smart computers and all the smart technology

621
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:58,200
that's oh yeah ten years ago Mercedes had the thumb scanners get your car you

622
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,220
pay to be a slave sorry go ahead no that's all right and look what the

623
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,200
Superdome is named after Mercedes-Benz Superdome now and I'm concerned about

624
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,760
the Super Bowl coming up because both of those army drills were held one in

625
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,400

00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,360
yes this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a

635
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:08,680
solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

636
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,060
or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how

637
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,320
much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government

638
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,680
control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number

639
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,720
three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and

640
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,280
now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

641
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,480
dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

642
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,120
families lose their power from weather related on edges number five a solar

00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,240
power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

644
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,920

658
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,440
time for a home security quiz answer this what effective home security device

659
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,160
is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home

660
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,480
at your house while you're away plugs into any wall outlet is recommended by

661
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,800
many police departments and sells for less than $35 yes it's fake TV this year

662
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,960
about one in every 50 u.s. homes will have a break-in with burglars usually

663
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:28,840
picking the easy target a dark house that looks like no one is home fake TV

664
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:32,760
is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home

665
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,560
watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV it's like a lamp on a timer

666
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,640
but far more convincing and for only $34.95 fake TV could be the difference

667
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:47,280
between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked go to fake TV

668
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,880
calm or call one eight seven seven five fake TV that's eight seven seven five

669

670
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:01,760
deterrent

671
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:29,440
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain

672
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:42,520
the only thing that's real the needle tears the whole the old by the way if

673
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,760
you're not from Texas or a southwestern state we're not joking we're just

674
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,080
talking the illegals can drive without catalytic converters no inspections no

675
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,160
insurance no registration and are just left alone and I think that's good I

676
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,320
mean I I think citizens should have the book thrown at them and be stomped into

677
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,440
the ground I support the New World Order I think it's good they're shutting down

678
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,600
our power plants our GDP is contracting we're about to have double of the

679
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:14,280
deficit every year than money we even bring in hey what happened in Greece is

680
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,400
a great thing we're going there government loves us I think it's great

681
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:22,080
Obama raised taxes on poorest Americans and their payroll taxes and I think it's

682
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:25,920
good everybody's gonna get cut basically part-time now because he loves you in

683
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,120
the government cares about you so let's turn our guns in and trust them don't be

684
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:35,200
an extremist Thomas you're on the air you say you support Obama or did support

685
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:43,440
them you're a wlu v 1520 listener they're in Chicago go ahead Thomas good

686
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,040
morning Alex how's it going sir I'm pretty good I just realized I'm about to

687
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,760
become above the law I'm about to anyway sorry go ahead no no no problem I

688
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,920
definitely would listen to the one gun dollar so you know I think that'd be a

689
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,520
god-level radio show where we bow kind of like a Muslim out towards Mecca we

690
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,120
bow towards the radio we'd all be immune from all via all the speed traps and

691
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:07,920
traffic tickets and parking tickets yeah see we have a big ol fiesta why not

692
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,400
while I'm gonna go hey I think all Americans can do it that's the answer of

693
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,640
course I can't go to Mexico and be above the law or go there and have my kids

694
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:22,320
paid for with free free you know birth and stuff but but that's okay but but

695
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:28,240
would Mexico accept me though if I had fake ID to Mexico has consul matricula

696
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,880
Center set up to give fake IDs out would they accept my fake ID I don't think I

697
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,120
think they put me in a dirt-bottom jail but well that's not fair why can't I get

698
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:45,040
everything free down there well Alex the reason why I'm calling because I was a

699
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,440
former Obama supporter I even went to the inauguration 2008 now and now that

700
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:54,680
I look back at it was just years of disdain with President Bush and I didn't

701
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,880
know too much about the left-right paradigm at that point so kind of like

702
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:03,560
Chicago Bears versus Green Bay Packers I root for one team my children or my

703
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:07,440
teeth down and you know I can admit that to myself as a man that I got caught up

704
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,680
right in that trip now when you when you start to feel really be uh the onion

705
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:16,280
skin you start to get dig a little deeper you realize Democrat Republican

706
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:20,120
two sides of the same coin the good Jordan Maxwell quote and you know I was

707
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,680
doing a lot of awakening in the last six years with mostly with your help and

708
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,880
then you can't do it on your own the person might be individual like myself

709
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,800
needs to go reach for themselves do the research on their own and that's when

710
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,680
you truly start to become awakened because you feel like you're doing it

711
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:38,200
on your own you know just listen to what someone's dictating to that's when the

712
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,520
stuff really starts to open up and again we will say well are you saying vote for

713
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:46,880
Romney no no it's to realize it's all fixed at that level and then it's the

714
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,280
same globalist it's just the understanding that it's a scam and they

715
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,040
know where people are gonna wake up to that so they want to get everybody

716
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:58,360
dependent so even though you wake up you're still dependent on them so they

717
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:03,000
can run your life correct that's absolutely correct and like the

718
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,080
Democratic Party's like the biggest Ponzi's political Ponzi scheme because

719
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,160
you got all these 18 19 year olds coming out of high school they want you know

720
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,520
do-gooders just like I was a blue blood a blue-blooded liberal and then by time

721
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:17,640
you hit your 30s you figure it all out they don't need you anymore they got a

722
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,840
million more 18 year olds the big Democratic Ponzi scheme and I just want

723
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,560
to say to all the people that are smugging it up all you fake liberals out

724

quick so we can clear the phones out at that point and take calls people that

749
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:57,400
have questions for Jim Garrow who has that high-level military contact I quote

750
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,360
living legend from the military who says the military is training to confiscate

751
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:04,640
our firearms I mean that's the litmus test will you fire on Americans well

752
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,280
that's publicly in the training stuff now so but the fact that he's a

753
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:11,920
respectable guy and this individual wanted to conduit this info through him

754
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,080
he has some more info for us today as well and China in the New World Order

758
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,040
better people just joined us I'm now Juan Gonzalez so I can be exempt from all

759
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,480
the taxes and regulations and drive and not be pulled over for no reason like a

760
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:46,840
US citizen four years away from the next inauguration of another selected

761
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,480
president of the United States but I think there's no time better than now to

762
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:56,840
call for a Patriot plan for presidential election reform I think you know we need

763
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:01,520
a comprehensive and look at the way elections are financed the whole primary

764
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,560
system and you've spoken to a lot of people over the years you probably have

765
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:09,800
a lot more ideas than I do you know what's your what's your take on it can

766
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:14,040
push off first off people need to have an awakening and realize whoever the

767
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:18,840
system pushes in the primaries from both big parties Republican and Democrat is

768
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,320
going to be a globalist when Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were the biggest

769
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:26,480
contributors to both guys and most of Obama's policies were actually written

770
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:30,880
up by by Mitt Romney I mean giving a break Mitt Romney said some good things

771
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,120
but he was a globalist pawn and so we had to realize that we get 60% turnouts

772
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:41,600
for national elections on average about 8% local locals where you can still get

773
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:47,040
in and kind of block the federal system and do some good things we need to get

774
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:51,520
foreign money out of politics the globalist only want to pass campaign

775
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,440
finance to restrict the small individual on powering offshore globalist and we

776
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,720
need to get integrity in the vote again most of the country has fraudulent

777
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:04,800
electronic voting machines in place now and there's a lot of evidence I've had

778
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:10,040
top election fraud people on like Bev Harris clearly the fraud was against

779
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:16,320
Perry I mean I mean was against having one of those mental Romney Mitt Romney

780
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:19,000
I was thinking about Perry because he's saying let's give people back their

781
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,840
unspent tax money which is another fraud I'm gonna talk about later but all of

782
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:29,080
that is going on and really it's just realizing this system's bad news but but

783
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:34,720
but it's also hey don't shut down our power plants while China gets to have

elected that won't enforce unconstitutional laws I mean I mean it's

787
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:55,200

788
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,960

Alex Jones

840
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:33,600
well since he first joined us last week dr. James Garrow PhD his information has

841
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,400
gone viral just millions of views on YouTube of our interview and Gary

842
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:41,840
Francis interview with him on his news program so the good news is this

843
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:47,080
information is getting out to people so I wanted to getting back on also take

844
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,920
some phone calls as well again I'm Alex Jones your host if you just joined us

845
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,200
the question of course is Obama has posed the top brass as the litmus test

846
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:06,880
will you fire on US citizens that is the litmus test Obama is saying to the top

847
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,720
brass will you fire on US citizens and again we already have this in the new

848
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:17,760
army training manual from 2010 that I'll go over the numbers for so you can pull

849
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:22,880
it up at army.mil you've already seen the drills out there where the military

850
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,820
practice is shooting large crowds of Americans that's going on in the news

851
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:32,560
almost every day now the urban warfare training you saw the gun confiscation in

852
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,160
Katrina you saw ABC News where they said yeah if you don't turn them in we shoot

853
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,880
an American and the police chief says all the guns will be taken no one will

854
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,760
be allowed to be armed and they're they're they're they're training the

855
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:46,580
military to engage us under brigade homeland I mean that was in the Army

856
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:51,240
Times three and a half years ago I've had colonels on from the army admitting

857
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:56,280
you know they were doing gun confiscation drills in Arcadia Iowa that

858
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:04,640
they now run army checkpoints in California Tennessee but a top retired

859
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,120
general quote living military legend and there's been another military legend

860
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:14,080
wink-wink general Boykin former head of Special Forces has come out and said our

861
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:19,080
government's arming al-qaeda in Libya and Syria we're going into a police

862
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,280
state our country's in deep trouble he's also in the film behold a pale horse

863
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:29,620
that we sell with Charlie Daniels as the host of at info war store.com that's a

864
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:33,640
side issue but general Boykin is in that I'm guessing it's general Boykin our

865
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,560
guests will not say that's who told him this but this is a credible guy that's

866
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:42,040
why we have dr. Garrow back on but I wanted him to recap go over the basics

867
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:47,200
of the gear up towards despotism I mean who can deny that this is really out in

868
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:52,560
the open now with our guest and and now he can also make some other points that

869
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:56,460
he didn't get to last week and some new information and of course he also runs

870
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:04,400
pink pagoda girls.com he's been over in China since 1968 with English language

871
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,040
schools and some of his staff the government was trying to forcibly abort

872
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:13,200
their kids also kill already born babies and so he started a group in 2000 that

873
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,440
saved over 45,000 Chinese girls and I could certainly vouch for him because

874
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:21,120
even a member of my crew has adopted Chinese girls out of China and is well

875
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:25,120
aware of the pioneering work of pink pagoda girls the group he founded

876
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,880
because they they'll die if they're not adopted you understand they kill them

877
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:35,040
they kill them so just amazing and of course there's more people wanting to

878
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,000
adopt kids every year in this country than there are even abortions but they

879
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,480
never tell the young women at Planned Parenthood you know there's Christian

880
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:45,120
groups that will pay for your whole pregnancy pay for your medical bill and

881
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:50,640
depending on the group give you 20 to 50 thousand dollars after after you have

882
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,440
the baby for not killing it you see those billboards up everywhere abortion

883
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:59,520
you know need alternatives that's some of the Christian groups and then they

884
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:06,720
even try to get you a job afterwards Wow so you want to go have a have a have an

885
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:10,720
abortion that doubles your chances of cervical and uterine cancer going off

886
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:16,360
the left field as always do now major studies have shown per abortion or get

887
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,960
paid to have the baby and not have it killed oh but Planned Parenthood won't

888
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:25,920
tell you that because their goal is to kill their eugenicist Margaret Sanger

889
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,440
they want to quote kill the black weeds they were founded for that but moved on

890
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:34,080
to everybody else of course but oh doesn't matter they get somebody up on

891
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,760
MSNBC saying we gotta deal with the white crackers she gets some street

892
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,200
lingo going out there cuz you know you talk about getting the white crackers

893
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,160
that's cool that's liberal but oh hey let's not chop up the babies shut up

894
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:51,520
racist okay let's go to our guest pink pagoda girls a founder dr. James Garrow

895
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,320
PhD doc recap the Intel you've got the other info tell people what we're facing

896
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:02,640
here you've got the floor well as you know and I stated last week the

897
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:07,640
difficulty is that this is something more and more true either I was a little

898
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,600
doubt for myself I have to be honest with you but more and more of the

899
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,280
evidence coming forward since you know since we were putting it out to the

900
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:19,880
public and of course you've known this for quite a while but it's just so

901
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,520
scary about what is happening and as you see them marched down the roadway to

902
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:30,880
despotism it is to me it's just mind-boggling but you know this army

903
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:36,560
senior army officer retired who came forward and asked me if I would help him

904
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:43,240
put the word out he was quite frightful of what was going on in America where

905
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:48,160
things were going in terms of the fact that the military we're now going to be

906
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:54,360
asked to take action against the American public and for doing what for

907
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:59,320
rioting for no nothing like that it had to do with a scenario of would you in

908
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:06,000
fact fire on people who had been in possession of arms had refused to allow

909
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,520
confiscation of those arms or to lay down those arms which was it you know

910
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,120
the right to hold under the Constitution the Second Amendment you're well aware

911
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:21,240
of that but now would you as an officer order your troops to fire if the

912
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:26,000
commander-in-chief you know who you have taken an oath to actually obey as

913
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,080
commander would you obey that order so many have said no I think it's going to

914
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,120
come out fairly soon that many people are saying no I've had so many phone

915
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,500
calls Alex I gotta tell you between interviews and all of that I had so

916
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:46,800
many people phoning me current military and retired military saying thank you

917
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:53,520
thank you for bringing it up well we just want to thank you now listen have

918
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:58,360
you talked to the retired quote military legend since he wanted you to warn

919
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:02,460
people about this because again I can separately figure out who it is myself I

920
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:06,080
can separately you know research the information to know that it's already

921
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:10,440
being set up I mean it's publicly being set up have you talked to that

922
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:16,440
individual anymore yes I have yes I have it was a very short conversation he

923
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,680
called me and just said thank you and that was the extent of it so if you're

924
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:26,040
if you're going into did you ask him to come forward again no I didn't get that

925
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:30,760
chance in fact all he wanted to do was say thank you that's it so he just

926
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:34,080
wanted you to get the info out and he thinks he's going to be safe having you

927
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:41,320
do it instead of him coming out yes yeah very much he believes that what he's

928
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:46,800
done is quite brilliant from from what I know of this person and and what we

929
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,440
talked about how it was going to come out and why me and everything and to me

930
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:57,360
it seemed to be not not as if he was a coward in any way and people have said

931
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:02,120
that you know and sent me messages you know that oh he has to stand up he has

932
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:07,600
to come forward actually no he doesn't watch Alex where things go in the in the

933
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,160
near future and I think you'll appreciate that this man was right on

934
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:16,640
with what he did let's face it he was not a dull-witted somebody who is

935
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:25,080
unable to who are unable to strategize quite a brilliant map sure now expanding

936
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:29,520
on that I never implied he was a coward I have seen some people say that but

937
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,840
after you were on last week I began to think actually it makes sense because

938
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:40,800
Smedley Butler when he exposed the Nazi fascist plan working with the bushes

939
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,560
Prescott Bush at the time but he was just mid-level in it and a bunch of

940
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:50,240
other people to have a fascist takeover in the 30s he went to Congress first and

941
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:55,880
then that's how they rolled it up and I've been noticing now that did you see

942
01:16:55,880 --> 01:17:01,000
former Senator Hagel say to Obama you can't trust the military you're not in

943
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,160
control of the Pentagon they're not doing what we say because I know the

944
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:08,200
military over and over again has actually stopped some of these wars a

945
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:12,280
lot of people say would lead to World War three possibly I mean does that tie

946
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:15,760
into what you're saying we should look for in the future well I was certainly

947
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,520
people are getting it aren't they if hey if this guy says you know this to Obama

948
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:27,600
by way of warning it's a good warning and you know the military folks got so

949
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,800
many of the rank and file phone me up and say you know what we would never

950
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,480
turn our guns you can't miss the office who said that to us we turn them on them

951
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:41,920
and that's the message that's kind of going out there Obama does not have the

952
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:48,880
support of the military at all he thinks he can command and control but the man's

953
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:56,760
living in la la land well he certainly is dr. James Garrow PhD joins us from

954
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:00,960
Toronto Canada right now run some of the largest English-speaking at training

955
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,400
schools in China and it's a 45,000 plus little Chinese girls that would have

956
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,160
been killed or used in medical experiments I'm not kidding it's very

957
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,840
macabre I want to talk some about how they kill those little girls before you

958
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,000
leave us so we can you know put a human face on this and not just have it be a

959
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,400
statistic but I've had countless military in fact I could I could scrub

960
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,920
the phone calls right now but we're gonna go to them later I'm so I'm not

961
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:27,360
going to and open the phones but we'll do that after we take some of these

962
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,280
calls and say military call in are you being trained to take our guns are you

963
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,560
being trained for for killing Americans and they'll call in and say yes indeed

964
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:39,480
we are but again I have the army training manual in fact I'll pull it up

965
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:44,000
here in a moment for radio and TV of yours I mean this is the new mission and

966
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,480
and we're hearing now we got to have troops on the streets and all of this

967
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:53,800
but I only see that serving to wake up the police and military oh amen that's

968
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,380
exactly what's happening that's the result there's been a total

969
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:02,000
miscalculation on the part of Obama and crew who don't have a military mindset

970
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,840
they don't understand what loyalty really is and the fact that the military

971
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:11,240
a lawyer to the American people they really are they believe in the role of

972
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:15,880
being a protector to the American public and they've torn an oath of Constitution

973
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:21,720
but listen who's behind the Constitution it is we the people nothing short of

974
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:25,160
that that's it so bottom line these people are understanding it there's a

975
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:30,680
huge as I said again I'm gonna say it it's a huge miscalculation and I mean

976
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,560
if if there were people who had bad intent looking to control through the

977
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:39,200
military the country this would be certainly a way to march toward that

978
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:44,080
but mr. Obama has thought that he would be the one that would be able to have

979
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:50,280
the loyalty of the troops and I'm sorry the troops are not stupid I want to find

980
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:56,040
out of the retired military legend the general talked about false flags is he

981
01:19:56,040 --> 01:20:00,580
concerned from his sources about the globalist staging something show they

982
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:05,000
would buy this looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive

983
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,960
from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought

information what else do you think is important to relay to people that we

1045
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:04,120
didn't talk about last week or that people aren't aware of this week because

1046

you know these reports that you're putting out that I'm putting out are

1047
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:15,760
again really getting picked up online people are paying attention to it and

1048
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,560
people are really concerned you know there's not much we can do about corrupt

1049
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,160
politicians now or globalist selling us out but look at all the bullets sold out

1050
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:27,320
in almost every place in the u.s. look at 10 million guns a month being sold

trust them anymore yes absolutely and I'm glad you've given me the opportunity

1053
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:43,160
to do this there is a warning a real caution when people ask me you know what

1054
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:46,800
is it that we can do to safeguard ourselves well I'm going to warn you

1055
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,960
right now let me read something too and this is coming from the diagnostic and

1056
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,600
statistical manual of mental disorders this is what the counselors

1057
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:59,880
psychiatrists the doctors use to look at you as to whether you're crazy or not

1058
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:03,480
I'm just throwing out a crazy word there but there it is and here's what I've put

1059
01:26:03,480 --> 01:26:08,840
online get ready for the new onslaught of insight we'll call it a insight from

1060
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:14,520
Obamacare the new mental illness it will fight itself into DSM-5 since the late

1061
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:21,400
nineties DSM-4 has been that manual of diagnostic of diagnostics so now we have

1062
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,920
a new one coming out in May well we we have a precursor here of what's what's

1063
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:29,200
going to be in it whatever it defines it'll allow the government to lock you

1064
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,960
up for an indeterminate length of time label you as something which will result

1065
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,560
in your inability to own or possess a firearm and allow the police unlimited

1099
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:24,040

01:33:55,080 --> 01:34:00,160
Dorian Yates six-time mr. Olympian one of the most famous bodybuilders in

1156
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:04,600
history I guess only next to Schwarzenegger even I know that I don't

1157
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,320
even follow about a bodybuilding has come out against fluoride and talked

1158
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:11,400
about how deadly it is in the water supply and and that's good because then

1159
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:14,560
people like that will get to the bodybuilders and then famous soccer

1160
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,680
players have come out against fluoride and then people wake up there and then

1161
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:23,320
a teenage girl in Mississippi spends three years exposing a deadly very toxic

1162
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:28,680
chemical and Gatorade linked all sorts of problems cumulatively and and now

1163
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:33,320
Gatorades pulling it out I mean there is an example of solutions and the

1164
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:37,560
government is going to try to get more power and then sometimes you're gonna

1165
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:43,240
get real tyrants in charge that want to go for it all and that's why we need to

1166
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:47,920
say no warrantless checkpoints aren't to keep us safe it's to set up a police

1167
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,080
state and now they're saying the warrantless checkpoints aren't for

1168
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:55,440
al-qaeda now they're for gun owners and everything our guests was announcing I

1169
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,520
had to really bite my tongue and not interrupt a bunch about how we're gonna

1170
01:34:58,520 --> 01:35:01,760
have more ankle bracelets that were found mentally ill how they can just

1171
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,960
announce it now under these new federal edicts they're saying and the Soviets

1172
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:10,960
and the Nazis did this Hitler the first people they killed had been grabbed and

1173
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:16,000
ordered mentally ill by psychiatrist and and just like in China they said all

1174
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,240
your kids got a clubfoot we're gonna kill your two-year-old they would take

1175
01:35:19,240 --> 01:35:22,560
them into the doctor's office and then say oh they died of a heart attack

1176
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:26,600
there's actually documentaries on this they killed hundreds of thousands before

1177
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:31,640
they even started arresting political dissidents and it's eugenics it's like

1178
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:36,360
why are we seeing the same thing because Hitler didn't get it from Germany he got

1179
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:40,360
it from England and from the United States that developed modern eugenics

1180
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:45,160
and then he took it to an extreme level and quote discredited it so the Journal

1181
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:49,920
of eugenics switched over to the Journal of population and things like that and I

1182
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:53,040
covered that in our film in game blueprint for global enslavement

1183
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:57,400

just basically every vitamin mineral trace element huge amounts of vitamin C

1187
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:14,520
huge amounts of the B vitamins they did a big Clemson study that they've been

1188
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:19,000

tangerine it has some of the others as well you can go read the results in a

1197
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:08,640
scientific study went in and did not hurt the healthy cells and killed the

01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:11,880
unhealthy cancer cells now the reason I knew when I did this probably what was

1199
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:15,520
gonna happen is Linus Pauling got a Nobel Prize for this folks I don't know

them I'm looking for men and women who will go no we're gonna stand up against

1236
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:09,280
this and I want to I want to go back to our guest dr. Jim Garo who again is one

1237
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:13,200
of the largest chains of English-speaking teaching schools in

1238
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:19,400
China since 2000 save over 45,000 little Chinese baby girls who would have been

1239
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:23,880
killed after birth which they're now promoting here the big bioethics journal

1240
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:27,720
last year people didn't believe it when we published an article linked to them

1241
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:33,400
saying let's kill kids up to age three even if they're healthy that it took

1242
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,480
three days for mainstream media to pick it up saying it couldn't be true and

1243
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,840
they called it was a real study put out in their journal we're gonna get to that

1244
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:43,440
coming up we're keeping a little bit in the next hour if you can do it because

1245
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,720
again constitutional lawyer Bruce fine was stuck in court he apologized we

1246
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:50,800
appreciate him he's on tomorrow talk about the constitutional attacks that

1247
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:55,640
are going on and how to strike back against it but dr. Jim Garo is our guest

1248
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:01,240
right now what about my point because I'm not a tough guy but you know if

1249
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:07,840
tyranny is coming down on me I know instinctively or in my spirit to to say

1250
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,800
no and stand up against it now if I can get out of the way you know short term

1251
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:16,880
you know I sometimes I do try to back down but it depends on you know what the

1252
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:20,800
gut level decision is and I know giving into tyranny historically intellectually

1253
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,320
but also my gut tells me my gut says you will not back down like it's the

1254
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,960
opposite it's like I have absolutely no fear which is like Ezekiel you know

1255
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:31,760
saying in the Bible God they're gonna kill me but it burns in my bones I can't

1256
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:35,120
stop I mean it's the opposite of fear it's not courage I don't want to be

1257
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:39,480
thanked for what I do I can't control myself my whole gut my spirit my

1258
01:41:39,480 --> 01:41:44,500
intellect intellectually it confirms it you stand up to moves to intimidate you

1259
01:41:44,500 --> 01:41:48,840
and set up checkpoints and secretly arrest people and NDAA and all this you

1260
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:53,360
don't you don't get scared but so many people email me and write me and go what

1261
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,640
you say is true but I'm scared I've got ulcers I'm an officer in the army I

1262
01:41:57,640 --> 01:42:02,120
don't know what to do and I don't know about that spirit of fear you know good

1263
01:42:02,120 --> 01:42:06,720
thank God we know thank God people spoken up thank God this has come out

1264
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:11,440
thank God what do you say to those that don't get this and think oh my gosh

1265
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,880
what's the point of knowing this it's so negative isn't it positive to know so

1266
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:22,040
that we can contend and wrestle with this evil absolutely you know what I

1267
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:25,720
would do with those people who aren't willing to listen you you're you're not

1268
01:42:25,720 --> 01:42:30,320
responsible for them you're really not you're responsible for your own belief

1269
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:34,720
system and then you're responsible for your own family so you know very much

1270
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:39,240
like planning for anything else in life you plan for the survival of yourself

1271
01:42:39,240 --> 01:42:42,600
and your family that's what you've got to do that's what we're looking at we're

1272
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,560
not we're not just this isn't theory now these people are moving they're making

1273
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:50,840
moves forward that will take away your freedom they take away the guns remember

1274
01:42:50,840 --> 01:42:54,480
the first thing that the Germans did was declared that Jews were not quite people

1275
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:58,960
and then the first people to lose the right to own a gun were the Jews and of

1276
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,480
course that made them the easiest to be rounded up let's be careful here again

1277
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:10,760
the caution should be think plan figure out your escape route figure out what

1278
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,800
you will do when they come knocking on your door at night do you have something

1279
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,320
to back you up if that happens or are you just going to be a ready victim

1280
01:43:17,320 --> 01:43:21,880
they'll just march in your home and take you and your family confiscate the guns

1281
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:25,960
and take you and your family away do you have a plan for that that's what you

1282
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:30,640
need to do let's start planning and I mean there are people out there who who

1283
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:34,960
are accused of being you know the crazies the tinfoil hat kind of people

1284
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:40,600
but and conspiracies theorists well you know conspiring together that's what law

1285
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:45,800
is all about we make a social contract we conspire together to come up with the

1286
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:50,240
laws and a way to handle and control society well this is going beyond that

1287
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:54,440
and now they're going to handle and control us now what are you going to do

1288
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:58,520
about what it is going to be your plan for your family I think you need to look

1289
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:02,360
to that first and foremost responsibility and get it very clear

1290
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:06,760
have plans know what you're going to do know what you're going to do in the long

1291
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:14,880
term I agree with you but my point is they won't get away with this if we

1292
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,280
simply challenge him and you know folks have always said the archival image of

1293
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:22,200
the crazy guys he's yelling well we're yelling to get people out of their coma

1294
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:26,520
some people are smooth like you other people like myself get upset I also

1295
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:31,360
sometimes I'm calm but I found I've been successful not on purpose I didn't do

1296
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:35,200
this on purpose by being upset sometimes to get people out of their learned

1297
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:41,600
helplessness out of their mass Stockholm syndrome out of their normalcy bias

1298
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:46,720
because I mean things have gotten so crazy I want to read this quote but if I

1299
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:51,680
say I will not mention him or speak any more in his name his word is in my heart

1300
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:58,480
like a fire a fire shut up in my bones I am weary holding it in indeed I cannot

1301
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:01,880
because my uncle about 15 years ago I'm sitting across the coffee table from

1302
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:05,360
he's a big Bible scholar probably listening right now my mom's brother

1303
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:10,320
great guy Vietnam vet helicopter pilot patriot lived all over the world and I

1304
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,280
said you know I can't help it when they death threat me I can't help it when

1305
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:16,640
they get my face I I don't understand people that are afraid of the new world

1306
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:21,760
order I can't shut up it's a burning and then he quoted the scripture to me which

1307
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,720
I've never read but I mean I just wish other people had the burning in their

1308
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:30,120
bones I mean I guess you're saying if someone's not called to fight evil I

1309
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:35,640
guess that I mean you're saying just triage them no no I'm saying look to the

1310
01:45:35,640 --> 01:45:39,800
first responsibility that you have which is to your family make a plan for them

1311
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:44,120
but make sure that your plan is thorough that you understand they will come when

1312
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:47,440
you least expect it they're not going to come in broad daylight they'll come at

1313
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:51,280
night when you're asleep they'll bang it on your door when you're least prepared

1314
01:45:51,280 --> 01:45:55,240
to react properly that's when this is going to start to happen they've already

1315
01:45:55,240 --> 01:46:01,680
you know done the groundwork they've got the evidence on you test last year where

1316
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:05,440
Brandon Robin all these Marines honorably discharged officers no

1317
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:09,040
criminal record would mildly criticize Obama and they would have the police

1318
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,360
come and mentally commit them it's happened to a bunch of talk show host

1319
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:15,560
already last year yeah and look what they're saying they're saying that

1320
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:20,000
anyone who's been a veteran it's been overseas comes back you're you're

1321
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,280
immediately suspect of being a terrorist or a terrorist threat what's that about

1322
01:46:24,280 --> 01:46:28,520
you mentioned Hitler first they went after a group who'd been demonized and

1323
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:32,440
unpopular the Jews but it but then they went after every group you know the

1324
01:46:32,440 --> 01:46:35,480
famous quota they went after the Jews I wasn't a juice I didn't stand up they

1325
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:38,200
went after the Methodist I wasn't a Methodist I didn't stand up I mean by

1326
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:43,760
the end of it the Nazis my grandfather became an inventor because in Dallas

1327
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,360
growing up he lived next door to a famous inventor had been involved in

1328
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:52,880
venting indoor refrigeration or taking those systems indoor air conditioning

1329
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:57,720
and so and this guy was a German immigrant since he was a little kid but

1330
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:01,360
he spoke German and my grandfather you know had a lot of German ancestors so he

1331
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:05,440
spoke some German Germans that came into Texas so they became friends he worked

1332
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:10,360
with him some the Germans extorted he told me this story when I was a little

1333
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:15,720
kid all the money out of that guy before and then right up to World War two

1334
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,600
threatening to kill his family and the guy wasn't Jewish so I mean that people

1335
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,920
that say all the Nazis you know didn't really do all this stuff baloney and

1336
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:27,200
I'm telling you it's the same organized crime system that we're now seeing

1337
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:31,920
unfold I mean this is a great danger oh amen and the fact that you've been

1338
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:36,680
cautioning people for years to me is like wow you've been thinking ahead you

1339
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,360
know you've been that that's the problem though you're so far ahead of the curve

1340
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:44,600
of the reality of today like like everyone's secure it we're snug as a bug

1341
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:49,240
in a rug things are working well society is great we got power we got water we

1342
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:53,320
got gas in our car we can go on holiday we got money in the bank we got a job

1343
01:47:53,320 --> 01:47:59,280
yeah well wait until all of it is cut off what's your plan that's that's what

1344
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,360
I'm I keep coming back to it like we're not talking about what what my officer

1345
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:08,560
friend cautioned beyond but basically where he went with the whole the whole

1346
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:13,000
scenario was what will the public do when they finally pulled the plug on

1347
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,300
everything and well that's the deal they're there they're deriding the banks

1348
01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:21,560
they're deriding the country they're saying we're gonna go double the the the

1349
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:27,720
the the debt to our GDP they're doing it on purpose to make us dependent and what

1350
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:30,480
will happen when they drop the hammer I guess they're gonna say do what you're

1351
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,840
told or starve to death and I want people to know when the global is take

1352
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,960
down America it's not gonna be creeping anymore they're gearing up for an

1353
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:42,760
all-out assault and scream yeah yeah that's great absolutely a lightning war

1354
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:47,640
I mean it's incredible against us and man I tell you folks don't be afraid

1355
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:52,160
speak out now I believe it's gonna backfire and they may back off if here's

1356
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:55,800
the problem they've committed to an economic collapse they may not be able

1357
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:59,880
to stop but but I see every sign they're trying to just accelerate the collapse

1358
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:04,400
while posing as the Savior Alex you're absolutely right the signs that I'm

1359
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:08,160
getting and the word that I'm getting back is that when I was told this that

1360
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:13,680
last Monday morning that since we put it in to the public view look at the things

1361
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:18,800
that have happened bang all of a sudden we've got well you know better what's

1362
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,640
going on I don't know the list of things that are going on but things are

1363
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,520
accelerating I think what we've helped to do is push them through fear and the

1364
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,640
purchase of guns and ammo that's the big thing for they weren't counting up they

1365
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:34,320
didn't count that the American public go in that direction you know what they

1366
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,280
were hoping for was that everyone would just you know everything business as

1367
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:41,840
usual you know it's only the government doing this doing that Obama you know if

1368
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:47,480
they're kindly at the comedy father the great smile that he's not people he's

1369
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:52,600
he's not gonna do anything to us this is all for our good sounds very much like

1370
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:58,600
how Hitler was viewed as well the night that's coming and I keep saying it's

1371
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:02,960
night because actually scripture talks about a night it's not when you're ready

1372
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,040
for it it's it's at night that they're going to come and this is all going to

1373
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:11,800
happen it's in that night when you will need to be prepared so what are you

1374
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:14,640
doing to protect your own family what are you doing to network your

1375
01:50:14,640 --> 01:50:20,000
neighborhood so that there is a group of people to protect one another because

1376
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:23,840
remember something it's overwhelming force that they're being taught to use

1377
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:29,240
overwhelming force what happened at Waco and I bring up Waco as an example

1378
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:34,520
because here was overwhelming force and in the end they just brutalized and

1379
01:50:34,520 --> 01:50:38,760
murdered all those women and children and then the military posed with the

1380
01:50:38,760 --> 01:50:42,040
skulls they were very very proud of the work they don't they could have arrested

1381
01:50:42,040 --> 01:50:47,040
Koresh in town who went into town every day and had a business in town we're

1382
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,600

1414
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:12,160
wipe out 280 million Americans this is really scary stuff defense experts warn

1415
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:17,280
that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a

1416
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,560
few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1417
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,680
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe

1418
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:28,600
that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and

1419
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:32,720
the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a free

1420
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:38,300
video at weird device calm that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the

1421
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:43,120
conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device calm right now to

1422

1426
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:35,400
and again the way tyrants work is they just ease you into it but the general

1427
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:39,240
population out there inside this giant reeducation camp that has become America

1428
01:54:39,240 --> 01:54:42,360
need to ask themselves do you want to be slaves under this now again we got a

1429
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,840
bunch of calls for our guests they'll be all over the map some of them were

1430
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:49,680
holding before he got on with us but then as each person hangs up we're only

1431
01:54:49,680 --> 01:54:55,200
taking calls in the next hour of military and police I mean again in fact

1432
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:58,120
we put the army manual back up on screen if you haven't taken it down to people

1433
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:02,840
the 2010 army manual internment and resettlement operations how to scan your

1434
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:06,640

01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:12,140
confiscate the guns how to lock down u.s. cities three dash three nine dot forty

1436
01:55:12,140 --> 01:55:16,520
internment resettlement operations so there's more proof of what our guest is

1437
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:23,520
saying or the Army Times admits it Brigade homeland the big police chief

1438
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:28,440
summit that they had Jan Napolitano at shed the new threat is an al-qaeda just

1439
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:35,480
just this week but Monday the new threat is returning veterans gun owners

1440
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:39,960
conservatives and libertarians we are violent radical extremists because we

1441
01:55:39,960 --> 01:55:43,640
know that globalists have taken the country over and again our guest is dr.

1442
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:49,360
Jim Garo let's go to Diane then we'll go to Jeannie and others Diane you want to

1443
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:54,200
talk about martial law go ahead well I got a couple things first of all I think

1444
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:58,200
I'm in good company I guess I'm mentally ill because I believe there's an evil

1445
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:02,200
plan but I'm not gonna get in fear it's gonna be scary but I've read the book

1446
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:07,400
and I know how it is it's gonna be good I was wondering if you could confirm on

1447
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:12,320
one of these sites you've had on before it's news.com but there was evidently a

1448
01:56:12,320 --> 01:56:16,720
truck pulled over that they found the martial law signs in the truck in

1449
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:20,440
Houston and then I've been reading more and more articles I'm trying to keep

1450
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:24,040
moving for you more I've been reading more and more articles about martial law

1451
01:56:24,040 --> 01:56:28,360
just being inflicted in the home where when we finally run out of food and

1452
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:31,440
supplies will come out and submit and I was wondering what you thought about

1453
01:56:31,440 --> 01:56:35,640
that I have an uncle that's retired from the Air Force that thinks we're total

1454
01:56:35,640 --> 01:56:40,600
crackpots that there will not even be a problem with the economy or anything

1455
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:44,520
against our guns for 10 or 20 more years and he just retired in the last six

1456
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:49,320
years and yeah notice people that are delusional think it's all gonna happen

1457
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:53,560
after they die it's always and see it's the old-timers that held all this back

1458
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:59,720
and see that's the the paradox Patriots hold it back but still we're sliding so

1459
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:04,480
we slowed it down and then as everything starts to happen like we said oh it's

1460
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:08,360
supposed to be worse than this as we battle to win the war against these

1461
01:57:08,360 --> 01:57:13,360
people I mean it's such a mind game now that's been played but no unfortunately

1462
01:57:13,360 --> 01:57:17,400
that martial law sign thing I've been hearing for 17 years it's a proverbial

1463
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:20,760
deal they're not gonna call it martial law it's gonna be called civil emergency

1464
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:24,840
and they're already look it's martial law when the TSA sticks their hands down

1465
01:57:24,840 --> 01:57:27,920
your pants it's martial law when the police have checkpoints in your town

1466
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:33,200
it's martial law when the TSA is down on Lamar right now running checkpoint

1467
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:36,840
searching people without warrants in Austin where I live it's martial law

1468
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:40,840
when the military does drill in cities every day I want to go back to our

1469
01:57:40,840 --> 01:57:45,000
guests thank you for the call ma'am you know what about her point about martial

1470
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,440
law we're always looking for martial law martial law if there is a big martial

1471
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:52,720
law it's what about false flags I asked that question earlier you never got to

1472
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:57,640
it what about Obama staging things well you know and by the way I didn't hear

1473
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:05,240
any of the the caller's words at all I'm sorry I was so but in terms of what he

1474
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:09,920
does let's face it I think I said this before he's an incrementalist that's

1475
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:13,720
what he does it's by small increments that he sees what he can get away with

1476
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:19,440
and continues to go further and further and further at every turn so in terms of

1477
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:24,200
martial law remember he's looking for a crisis and then he will as they said he

1478
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:28,840
we will manage the crisis so the management of that crisis may be that

1479

just unbelievable evil going on to play a clip of that for our guests coming up

1500
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,960
and we just had a phone line open there for a moment for current serving

1501
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,040
military are they training you we know they're training you to confiscate guns

1502
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:52,480
other showed the army manual where it says that but are they saying if you

1503
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,600
won't fire on Americans you're in trouble that's coming up after the break

1504
02:00:55,600 --> 02:01:01,240
but our guest Jim Garo before we go back to calls again don't let a good crisis

1505
02:01:01,240 --> 02:01:04,880
go to waste but they staged fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment

1506
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:09,200
shipping guns to Mexico what about them actually staging something I mean if

1507
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:12,120
they're willing to do all this why wouldn't they stage something they've

1508
02:01:12,120 --> 02:01:17,320
done it before but wasn't Benghazi also something was staged basically it was

1509
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:21,280
meant to be a kidnapping I suppose it a quasi pseudo kidnapping of the

1510
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:25,960
ambassador and then he would work it through the details so that in the end

1511
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:31,800
you had the blind sheik being released so that the dear leader could once again

1512
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:39,000
look heroic to the Muslim population and instead he got killed instead the whole

1513
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:45,080
thing and you know what two gentlemen stood up and put their lives on the line

1514
02:01:45,080 --> 02:01:50,840
and held back 500 people for how many hours Alex eight hours and screamed for

1515
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:56,000
help and were denied it even though they had what a gunship up there they had two

1516
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:00,840
drones and a gunship up there over the eight hours and the help was denied why

1517
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:05,000
did they want him dead and you know this is all this is all information it's

1518
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:09,840
available that we know that they had the gunship we we know that they had the

1519
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:14,120
drones there we know that they had the laser targeting and these people were

1520
02:02:14,120 --> 02:02:18,320
left whatever happened out you know don't leave any man behind I mean this

1521
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:23,640
this man in the White House is and I cannot believe no morals no scruples

1522
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:27,600
well he gets away with anything and that's what's so scary he's been given

1523
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:32,720
word he can move forward Janine in Wisconsin thanks for holding her on the

1524
02:02:32,720 --> 02:02:39,000
air hi how you doing good thank you hey I just wanted to share some ideas that

1525
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:43,040
I'm currently using to spread the word and actually I got the information and

1526
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:48,020
idea from you I think you had said once that we need to like go out on the

1527
02:02:48,020 --> 02:02:53,120
street corners with a sign that says you know 9-11 was an inside job or whatever

1528
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:58,480
you know whatever you wanted to put on it and I actually have 16 signs that

1529
02:02:58,480 --> 02:03:04,520
line my front yard almost like the old political signs from useless people that

1530
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:08,920
are running for city councils and stuff I actually have 16 signs that have

1531
02:03:08,920 --> 02:03:15,640
different various things from 9-11 to vaccines I have a six-year-old grandson

1532
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:21,120

1592
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:13,240
of the info war

1593
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:15,300
you

1594
02:08:24,440 --> 02:08:27,960
ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna do a special report on this this week I've

1595
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:33,000
talked a lot about it over the years and shown the news articles but it's close

1596
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:41,520
to 59,000 when I checked last week people have died since 2007 in Mexico

1597
02:08:41,520 --> 02:08:45,840
it's approaching 60,000 and and I believe there's tens of thousands they

1598
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:50,080
don't know about that have been buried there's some estimates over 50,000

1599
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:55,800
missing so that could be a hundred and nine thousand but more people die every

1600
02:08:55,800 --> 02:09:00,840
year in Mexico than died in the decade of the Vietnam War 58,000 Americans died

1601
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:06,960
roughly over that decade-long plus conflict we're talking about 59,000

1602
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:13,400
since 2007 so five and a half six years and we need to get that number out

1603
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:19,260
because all guns have been taken in Mexico from the people and the reason I

1604
02:09:19,260 --> 02:09:23,920
raised that is at least three shot at office complex in Phoenix Arizona this

1605
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:30,880
is just breaking the last 15 minutes or so and an employee at a law office in

1606
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,160
the area told newspapers he had seen four people take him in on stretchers

1607
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:38,680
that's we've also got helicopter shots of that television footage shows dozens

1608
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:43,280
of officers entering a building where police say people are injured and again

1609
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:48,320
it's either gangs it's somebody going postal or it is a Prozac head it's

1610
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:52,680
always the same mo the answer is have guns in there because there's a bad

1611
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:56,040
person with the guns gonna kill you just like Mexico they got the highest crime

1612
02:09:56,040 --> 02:10:00,380
rate in the world they don't have the highest city though Mexico City is at

1613
02:10:00,380 --> 02:10:03,760
number one Chicago is by the way the Chicago Police Chief I've got that in

1614
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:08,560
the stack he's saying don't worry you know we've had a 530 something killed

1615
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:12,080
last year we've taken all your guns highest crime rate for any city in the

1616
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:16,400
world it's not that bad that's the quote the Associated Press fact I have even a

1617
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:20,080
video clip of him I was seeing this morning it's not that bad though he's in

1618
02:10:20,080 --> 02:10:23,960
press conferences wanting you to turn your guns in where he's taking the guns

1619
02:10:23,960 --> 02:10:27,920
the murders aren't that bad oh but it's sandy hook terrible that this guy got

1620
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:32,760
guns illegally and and now you got to turn your guns in but when people get

1621
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:38,920
killed in his gun-free zone it's a no big deal so numerous emergency vehicles

1622
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:41,720
are at the scene video footage showing a person being taken on the gurney I

1623
02:10:41,720 --> 02:10:46,440
reached at the scene and it's gotten the point with more kids built a Lego it

1624
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:50,520
looked like a gun with a Lego so the SWAT team was called that happened today

1625
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:54,120
it's this total hysteria people drive by and see a kid with a nerf gun bright

1626
02:10:54,120 --> 02:10:59,200
orange helicopters police foaming at the mouth hyperventilating bubble

1627
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,400
projectors now the police are being called and there's nothing more deadly

1628
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:06,840
than a pink Hello Kitty bubble gun I want to go back to our guest Jim Garrow

1629
02:11:06,840 --> 02:11:10,320
and he want to talk about some solutions and standing up he's somebody that knows

1630
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:16,200
how to stand up and we're gonna go to James in Colorado who's a marine who can

1631
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:20,840
comment on has he been told you know are you ready to fire on American citizens

1632
02:11:20,840 --> 02:11:24,800
and the lines are open just for military people now we've got some others that

1633
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:28,640
are holding from before I'll get to you as well but eight hundred two five nine

1634
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:33,440
ninety two thirty one our guest of course let's talk to a quote living

1635
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:37,200
military legend who says he's talked to other officers who are being told now as

1636
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:41,200
a litmus test will you fire on citizens well I have the Army manual where they're

1637
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:45,960
now training for gun confiscation and shooting us and the drills are waves of

1638
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:50,880
protesters being mowed down by full auto Homeland Security's bought 1.6 plus

1639
02:11:50,880 --> 02:11:55,080
billion bullets the last 14 months as you know and now a new purchase order

1640
02:11:55,080 --> 02:11:58,880
for Homeland Security quote personal protection weapons we had that up at

1641
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:04,440
info Wars calm yesterday from the Federal Registry for 7,000 fully auto

1642
02:12:04,440 --> 02:12:09,480
308 for personal protection just just you know that every week there's more

1643
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:14,400
purchases so they're they're gearing up for World War three against us but make

1644
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:18,280
your point about solutions standing up in your words then we'll go to that

1645
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:22,680
marine well let's face it in your in your local community that's where you

1646
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:27,160
have your biggest fear of influence generally that's just a normal joke like

1647
02:12:27,160 --> 02:12:30,920
just you and I and in our in our little neighborhood so what you do is you run

1648
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:36,120
for office you run for dog catcher you run for police chief you run for

1649
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:40,000
whatever's I want to give an illustration of the use of a linsky

1650
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:45,960
tasks tactics I ran for school board in my local town I want I got on there I

1651
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:49,520
started you know putting the boots to the the people who were just rubber

1652
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:53,760
stamping whatever the administration wanted in the school district and it

1653
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:59,480
meant spending money like like a drunken sailor so what they did is utilize the

1654
02:12:59,480 --> 02:13:04,240
media media fully socialist Marxist up here in Canada where I am at the moment

1655
02:13:04,240 --> 02:13:09,720
and I was back then and so they use that a linsky method they freeze you they

1656
02:13:09,720 --> 02:13:14,080
demonize you and they cause it that no one will listen to you because the media

1657
02:13:14,080 --> 02:13:19,320
of course tells the tale and controls the message and that's what they will do

1658
02:13:19,320 --> 02:13:23,960
you must have a vehicle some way of getting your message out if you're

1659
02:13:23,960 --> 02:13:27,960
gonna run for anything so that the truth is always available to the public the

1660
02:13:27,960 --> 02:13:32,440
public you serve but make sure that you have that vehicle if you don't have it

1661
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:36,860
you're dead because the media will cripple you they will freeze you they

1662
02:13:36,860 --> 02:13:41,240
will demonize you they will put you out of business so no one listens to you but

1663
02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:46,240
now governor Cuomo who wants to basically ban all our guns total gangster

1664
02:13:46,240 --> 02:13:52,600
his his brother is now the morning CNN anchor but CNN's top show has half a

1665
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:56,560
million their average show about 90,000 they are an illusion they are imploding

1666
02:13:56,560 --> 02:14:00,600
in fact there's news today when I was there and I've been to their studios

1667
02:14:00,600 --> 02:14:07,080
three times it looked like a third world facility I don't want to describe it but

1668
02:14:07,080 --> 02:14:10,440
I mean the the bathrooms because after I saw one I said they put me in this on

1669
02:14:10,440 --> 02:14:15,360
purpose I went and checked a few more the carpet light bulbs out dirt on the

1670
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:20,120
floors in the studios horrible morale I mean these guys are falling apart but

1671
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:26,560
here it is Cloward Piven strategy and of course that's the 1966 sociologist that

1672
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:30,440
I first told people about 15 years ago that books have been now written about

1673
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:36,720
by others my greatest success is even though you know I'm I'm not Rush Limbaugh

1674
02:14:36,720 --> 02:14:40,400
and Glenn Beck they just I make stuff popular and they pick it up which I

1675
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:46,280
think's great you know I force it out there but it was a plan to bankrupt New

1676
02:14:46,280 --> 02:14:50,600
York City and other cities to make you accept socialism the plan is to get you

1677
02:14:50,600 --> 02:14:55,680
dependent and this is published and officially used by the Democratic Party

1678
02:14:55,680 --> 02:14:58,840
that's why they're gonna shut off your power plants they're gonna raise taxes

1679
02:14:58,840 --> 02:15:03,160
on working poor until you give up and go on welfare they want to run your life

1680
02:15:03,160 --> 02:15:07,520
let's go to some Marines here we've got James in Colorado we'll go to him in a

1681
02:15:07,520 --> 02:15:13,640
moment but first JC in Montana marine with news on general so we'll see what

1682
02:15:13,640 --> 02:15:17,200
that's about and then we've got Army National Guard Matt and Florida again

1683
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:22,200
you just joined us our source a top general retired told him that they're

1684
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:26,480
they're doing a litmus test now will you fire on US citizens and if not you're

1685
02:15:26,480 --> 02:15:30,080
ordered to resign your Commission I have all the background proving that's

1686
02:15:30,080 --> 02:15:33,760
already happening I found that in the news and in Army manuals the last three

1687
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:39,200
years it's changed but what's unprecedented is totally unprecedented is

1688
02:15:39,200 --> 02:15:46,520
the the new sec def nominee Hagel came out and said you cannot trust the

1689
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:50,600
military they're not on your side Obama you've got to have a purge of them if

1690
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:55,480
you want your new world order that was Washington Post yesterday okay we wrote

1691
02:15:55,480 --> 02:16:00,800
an article about it at info wars calm I mean this is going on and it's a big

1692
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:07,640
deal so let's go to JC JC well what can you tell us hey Alex hey Jim how's it

1693
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:13,440
going that's going all right um first of all General Mattis mad dog

1694
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:22,040
Mattis from CENTCOM was fired and I'll read you what the blaze put on it's like

1695
02:16:22,040 --> 02:16:28,400
United States Marine Corps general James mad dog Mattis was notified he was being

1696
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:34,160
replaced as commander central command not by a phone call from Washington but

1697
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:39,720
by a note by his aide according to foreign policies Thomas E Ricks general

1698
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:43,560
Mattis was traveling in a meeting when an aide passed him a note telling him

1699
02:16:43,560 --> 02:16:47,120
that the Pentagon had announced his replacement as head of Central Command

1700
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:52,120
and I saw that a while back for generals in the last month have been relieved and

1701
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:56,880
and the CENTCOM folks are angry because they begged the White House in the

1702
02:16:56,880 --> 02:17:00,720
eight-hour Benghazi operation to let them bomb the targets and were ordered

1703
02:17:00,720 --> 02:17:07,920
to stand down that's come out CENTCOM general Mattis is loved he's a good man

1704
02:17:07,920 --> 02:17:14,640
he's a he's a marine I mean I'm a marine I mean everyone loves this guy I mean I

1705
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:21,440
don't know if Jim's force was referencing Jim he's probably referencing

1706
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:26,080
someone younger the way he talks that it was mentored by the general that he

1707
02:17:26,080 --> 02:17:30,960
knows but when Mattis is out of Central Command something's wrong I mean there's

1708
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:40,800
no reason I mean and some of the some of the stuff I read was general Mattis said

1709
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:45,600
he doesn't have the balls to come down here and tell me himself I mean this was

1710
02:17:45,600 --> 02:17:50,960
kind of man he is well you don't get a name like mad dog for being diplomatic

1711
02:17:50,960 --> 02:17:58,160
but I mean this was a man that protected America loved America and well that's

1712
02:17:58,160 --> 02:18:03,920
probably the reason he's not in CENTCOM no more but uh well no there is a look

1713
02:18:03,920 --> 02:18:08,560
look the military purge is already confirmed but but the but the the new

1714
02:18:08,560 --> 02:18:13,360
Secretary of Defense are trying to confirm that the nominee says you can't

1715
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:17,040
trust the military and they're purging them all around us I appreciate your

1716
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:22,400
call god bless you this just backs up everything Jim Garo Dr. Garo sang from

1717
02:18:22,400 --> 02:18:26,240
the MO and I looked it up and I know these guys run in the same circles I

1718
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:29,280
believe it's General Boykin the former head of Special Forces because he's

1719
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:32,400
already speaking out already know people that know him well he's anti New World

1720
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:37,200
Order he's in the film that we sell Behold the Pale Horse with Charlie

1721
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:41,520
Daniels he's speaking out right now about tyranny I believe it's General

1722
02:18:41,520 --> 02:18:45,920
Boykin but yeah what about the general purge of the military and the new

1723
02:18:45,920 --> 02:18:50,400
Secretary of Defense is a top globalist Hagel a fake Republican a fake

1724
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:55,200
conservative saying that you know that Obama can't trust the military well to

1725
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:59,520
do that what an admission here are the people that are ready to lay their life

1726
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:04,560
on the line I mean think about this the difference here you got the military

1727
02:19:04,560 --> 02:19:08,240
ready to lay their lives on the line you got the politicians what are they ready

1728
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:13,040
to lay they're ready to go out and have a great wine and cheese at your expense

1729
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:16,560
and supposedly your purport to be representing you and they're the ones

1730
02:19:16,560 --> 02:19:20,160
that are afraid of the military well they should be afraid of marriage

1731
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:24,000
military because they have not lost their sense of priority

1732
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,080
politicians have lost the priority and Leon Panetta remember last year he

1733
02:19:28,080 --> 02:19:32,160
wouldn't go to any bases with any of the even the officers armed

1734
02:19:32,160 --> 02:19:36,720
remember that yeah could it be that they really uh would

1735
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:40,720
rather not see him well I mean that's why they want to go

1736
02:19:40,720 --> 02:19:45,680
to robots and drones because despots have always hated

1737
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:49,600
having to have real men do the killing for them and so they despise them that's

1738
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,200
why as soon as they're out of the military

1739
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:54,400
they're the number one enemy of homeland security you heard me again this is

1740
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:57,840
public this is admitted our government says the military is the

1741
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:01,600

1802
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:09,680
by the way one of the many generals that they've

1803
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:13,280
kicked out is it's way more than four in the last few months it's been four

1804
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:19,680
uh james mattes he said in order to kill the enemy you have to kill

1805
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:22,960
an innocent don't take the shot don't create more enemies

1806
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:26,880
than you can take out by some immoral act see that's what they don't like

1807
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:29,680
though they want people who think it's tough to

1808
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:32,560
just you know put al-qaeda in charge and then

1809
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:36,000
later go in and fight al-qaeda after you give them control of syria

1810
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,800
and a lot of the generals have been saying we should not be given missiles

1811
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:41,280
to al-qaeda we should not i mean obviously you

1812
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:43,840
shouldn't be doing this and the system doesn't care

1813
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:47,360
they're going full speed ahead they think the public is so dumb

1814
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:51,920
our government centcom had to put al-qaeda in charge of libya

1815
02:24:51,920 --> 02:24:55,600
now in syria and that's why they've removed

1816
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:59,920
it's three top officers out of centcom alone so when i say four

1817
02:24:59,920 --> 02:25:02,960
total it's way more than that i mean they're they're kicking people out

1818
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:08,240
everywhere there is a purge there is a purge of the military

1819
02:25:08,240 --> 02:25:11,440
because they don't want to be used domestically and they don't want to work

1820
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:17,120
with al-qaeda and we're forcing that public debate and

1821
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:19,920
that's a good thing uh let's uh talk with our guest who's

1822
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:22,320
going to write shotgun with us for the rest of the hour

1823
02:25:22,320 --> 02:25:26,880
let's go ahead and talk to kevin the marine in texas

1824
02:25:26,880 --> 02:25:30,960
uh and then we'll go to uh james who's a marine in colorada

1825
02:25:30,960 --> 02:25:34,240
and national guard folks matt and bob who was in the

1826
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:38,000
rob who was in the coast guard uh with an internal survey

1827
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,360
on gun confiscation we know they've been creeping around with that for a while

1828
02:25:41,360 --> 02:25:44,720
but let's go to kevin kevin you're on the air go ahead and give us your point

1829
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:48,400
hey thanks um just to go on with what you're saying about that whole purge of

1830
02:25:48,400 --> 02:25:52,720
the military well the marine force reserve is

1831
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:56,480
actually doing a fizz rig where every unit's getting realigned

1832
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:58,640
and a different mls which is going to

1833
02:25:58,640 --> 02:26:02,720
actually bring up you're going to have thousands and

1834
02:26:02,720 --> 02:26:06,960
thousands upon marine being dropped dropped out kicked out of

1835
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:09,760
the military you got to make places for the new women to fight in the front

1836
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:14,080
lines well right but like at my unit we don't

1837

what you were saying you know about uh how the military's not on your side

1843
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:39,600
blah blah blah this is gonna i guess the way i'm the

1844
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:42,240
way i'm thinking is it's gonna actually have a

1845
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:47,200
a effect on you know how you say did you hear als charpton basically say we don't

1938
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:26,960
footage on fox we'll put it back up your tv viewer of guys that look like

1939
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:29,680
they're in army outfits look like they are army

1940
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:32,080
so they don't look like they're doing too good with all that gear so those

1941
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:34,880
must be police you can tell they hadn't been carrying

1942
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:38,400
they can't carry gear 100 yards much less 50 miles

1943
02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:44,720
punch that back up that is amazing and and and and they're saying that that

1944
02:33:44,720 --> 02:33:48,320
they think a man with a gun did something to the driver and grabbed a kid

1945
02:33:48,320 --> 02:33:52,000
off the bus i mean this is just getting bizarre

1946
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,720
folks and if they keep hiding uh you know all this brainwashing out

1947
02:33:56,720 --> 02:33:59,600
there alabama police and hostage standoff with suspect

1948
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:04,160
in fatal school bus shooting kidnapping

1949
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:07,200
and i mean who knows if that was somebody's

1950
02:34:07,200 --> 02:34:11,760
dad who wanted his kid back or something who knows this country

1951
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:16,160
the alabama man police they shot and killed a school bus driver

1952
02:34:16,160 --> 02:34:19,760
to uh well that was tuesday so i guess they're going back to it we just saw

1953
02:34:19,760 --> 02:34:22,640
that breaking and i thought not a new thing and now i guess they've

1954
02:34:22,640 --> 02:34:24,240
tracked him down and they're going after him

1955
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:28,320
but again there's 315 million people our crime rate

1956
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:36,960
violent crime rates down 49 since uh 1991

1957
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:42,160
you can pull those statistics up at fbi.gov 21 of that just since 2007 so

1958
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:47,520
it's accelerating but the media can take the events of 300

1959
02:34:47,520 --> 02:34:50,880
300 well this is saying moments ago i guess they've tracked him down where

1960
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:52,800
he's at yeah that's what's happening so the

1961
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:55,600
school bus thing happened yesterday now they've tracked down where they

1962
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:59,520
believe he's at that's why they're it's it's it's new breaking news that

1963
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:03,200
this happened just as we were going back live uh here on the radio

1964
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:06,720
uh again right he was our guest the last hour he's riding shotgun when we take

1965
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:11,040
your calls in this hour uh and he's dr jim garrow

1966
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:15,280
he heads up www dot pink pagoda girls dot com

1967
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:19,520
that's a group that saved since 2000 45 000 plus

1968
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:22,880
chinese newborn babies that would have been infanticided

1969
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:27,920
killed which the major journals bioethics journals are now basically

1970
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:31,280
saying is a great thing to do here in the united states just

1971
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:35,200
absolutely hellish they say kill the old people kill the babies nobody needs them

1972
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:38,160
you'll get more tax money if we kill people once they

1973
02:35:38,160 --> 02:35:41,040
communalize and get things collectivized then they

1974
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:44,560
can tell you how to live your life it's it's and then people dying

1975
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:48,560
as bill gate says you kill grandma that's a death panel that's a quote

1976
02:35:48,560 --> 02:35:51,520
then you hire 10 teachers and the teachers clap

1977
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:55,120
that's the sick collectivist model instead of grow the pie

1978
02:35:55,120 --> 02:35:58,720
and then you become north korea and everything collapses but they love it

1979
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:02,640
but uh going back to the caller who was a

1980
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:06,160
marine i think in colorado did he hang up

1981
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:09,040
because he said he was a marine but i couldn't really understand yeah he

1982
02:36:09,040 --> 02:36:12,640
dropped off he was talking about

1983
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:15,600
i couldn't really tell what he was getting into and then i said i'd come

1984
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:17,760
back to him but i guess he didn't understand that

1985
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:22,320
uh let's talk to matt in florida army national guard

1986
02:36:22,320 --> 02:36:26,960
matt in florida uh wants to comment again we know the army manuals who just

1987
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:30,000
joined us in the last three years now trained for

1988
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,960
gun confiscation and we know the military is being

1989
02:36:32,960 --> 02:36:35,120
prepared for domestic operations that's admitted

1990
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:38,640
they're saying the new enemy is not al-qaeda it's conservatives libertarians

1991
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:43,440
gun owners but now we've seen that the incoming if

1992
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:46,320
it gets confirmed secretary of defense former senator

1993
02:36:46,320 --> 02:36:49,520
hagel saying the military can't be trusted

1994
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:53,120
you know that obama if he wants his new world order has to deal

1995
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:56,400
with the pentagon that they're not following orders

1996
02:36:56,400 --> 02:37:00,640
we know what the orders are give al-qaeda missiles set up checkpoints on

1997
02:37:00,640 --> 02:37:03,120
highways the military's been saying no so there's

1998
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:06,800
a huge purge going right now if you're a new listener folks it's

1999
02:37:06,800 --> 02:37:10,400
mainstream news the government gives all kind of weapons now publicly

2000
02:37:10,400 --> 02:37:14,240
well why not they can take our liberties when they attack i mean i mean this all

2001
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:17,680
is is so diabolical uh but let's go to another caller here

2002
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:20,560
matt in florida you're on the air go ahead

2003
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:24,560
yes um i've been commissioned for you know almost 11 years now

2004
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:28,000
um i've been in the guard double time and i will

2005
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:31,360
smile my up front i will never confiscate anybody's guns i will

2006
02:37:31,360 --> 02:37:34,480
fight that order i will never shoot on my fellow

2007
02:37:34,480 --> 02:37:38,880
of citizens i'll fight that's why they got the guys in katrina from another

2008
02:37:38,880 --> 02:37:41,680
state because they knew their guys in their own state their own

2009
02:37:41,680 --> 02:37:44,640
neighborhood wouldn't confiscate their fellow neighbors

2010
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:49,440
guns see that's ridiculous if i'm from texas i wouldn't take new yorkers guns

2011
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:52,400
i mean how is it different from a different state

2012
02:37:52,400 --> 02:37:56,240
well it's just it's just it's mental i think i mean if you're sitting there

2013
02:37:56,240 --> 02:37:58,960
right in your own city and that's why they originally got these guys that's

2014
02:37:58,960 --> 02:38:01,680
why a lot of them now i've come back and said well that's

2015
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:05,200
ridiculous why did i do that i you know a lot of them were brainwashed a lot of

2016
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:08,240
the young guys that just didn't know any better by the way that's what the soviets

2017
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:10,240
did and at tiananmen square the same thing

2018
02:38:10,240 --> 02:38:13,440
that's why they had to wait eight hours they brought troops in from 300 miles

2019
02:38:13,440 --> 02:38:15,600
away from another province that spoke a

2020
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:19,760
different type of chinese yeah and so my concern right now is this

2021
02:38:19,760 --> 02:38:22,560
whole dual status commander thing and i know you've tried to talk about

2022
02:38:22,560 --> 02:38:26,320
before but it's where a general in the in the national guard can command

2023
02:38:26,320 --> 02:38:29,680
troops from um the active duty so they can come down

2024
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:32,800
as long as the governor says yeah it's good they'll come in and they'll be able

2025
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:36,000
to basically be on the street with our soldiers you know shoulder to shoulder

2026
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,560
with our national guard troops and that's you know

2027
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:40,800
and then the round on posse comitatus and

2028
02:38:40,800 --> 02:38:45,680
it's ridiculous i mean it's it's just another way of them creating in that

2029
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,960
active duty component they you know they don't know the rules and regulations of

2030
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:52,160
the national what do you make of the new army manuals that

2031
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:55,600
train for gun confiscation and lockdown of u.s cities

2032
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:58,880
it's ridiculous and i've showed that to some guys and they're like holy cow the

2033
02:38:58,880 --> 02:39:03,040
guys in my unit they're like this is this is unbelievable where's this you

2034
02:39:03,040 --> 02:39:06,240
know and so the the reason i'm staying in and i've

2035
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:09,680
last few years my wife has always asked me why are you staying in you know you

2036
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:12,720
had the you know thing that you say about the military well it's like i stay

2037
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:16,320
in because i want to warn people i want to wake people up that's why

2038
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:21,520
that's my beautiful um and then every time i go to drill on my weekend

2039
02:39:21,520 --> 02:39:24,400
every month i i talk to them about what's going on i wake

2040
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:27,920
to wake people up all the time that's why they want to have the litmus test

2041
02:39:27,920 --> 02:39:30,400
purge is to get the good people out and again

2042
02:39:30,400 --> 02:39:34,320
the military itself is individuals it's who's in command of

2043
02:39:34,320 --> 02:39:36,320
it people say well you're anti-military you

2044
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:41,120
don't want checkpoints on the highway no i'm pro-constitution it's like saying

2045
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:43,680
i'm anti-ford truck i'm not anti-ford truck

2046
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:47,120
i don't want a crazy person running me over with a ford truck it's just like

2047
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:51,280
i'm not anti-gun i'm anti bad people with guns but bad people

2048
02:39:51,280 --> 02:39:55,120
always have guns so i'm gonna have my gun don't blame me

2049
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:59,680
for what somebody else does beautiful comments i want to bring up dr garrow to

2050
02:39:59,680 --> 02:40:03,360
bring up any points he's got well you know the whole psychological

2051
02:40:03,360 --> 02:40:07,040
breakdown here of loyalties because of familiarity

2052
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:10,800
uh... that's a classic as a classic move to break down

2053
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:12,600
uh... not only the

2054
02:40:12,600 --> 02:40:13,440
uh... the loyals

2055
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:16,800
he won two another for for example you know that the guy you've worked with

2056
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:18,120
been trained with this dinner

2057
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:20,680
look after you and and and have your back

2058
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:24,400
in a combat situation and you know that you're going to be loyal or they know

2059
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:28,360
that you're going to be loyal to the guy who trained you at the officer above you

2060
02:40:28,360 --> 02:40:29,840
uh... or overall

2061
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:35,040
policy the general uh... who has uh... showing themselves to be honorable and

2062
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:37,120
uh... and very loyal to their man

2063
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:40,440
and been a real leader i mean that's that's real loyalty well they want to

2064
02:40:40,440 --> 02:40:43,820
break that down they want to break it down because if if they can break the

2065
02:40:43,820 --> 02:40:45,680
familiarity pattern

2066
02:40:45,680 --> 02:40:49,800
uh... yes one another and knowing what the expectation is they can bring in

2067
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:51,320
somebody new and guess what

2068
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:53,880
you'll do what they say why don't know any better

2069
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:58,040
but but then that actually destroys the military but they don't care the heart

2070
02:40:58,040 --> 02:41:01,600
of military is the honor and taking care of each other because they don't care

2071
02:41:01,600 --> 02:41:04,800
they want you to act like robots because they want robots

2072
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,240
they'll follow their orders that's why they're going to robots

2073
02:41:08,240 --> 02:41:12,400
no man left behind happened we've just seen a huge demonstration of the fact that

2074
02:41:12,400 --> 02:41:15,120
that no longer exists with the commander in chief

2075
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:17,000
well it wasn't just left behind

2076
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:20,440
a lot of evidence shows they were he wanted actually that ambassador killed

2077
02:41:20,440 --> 02:41:23,120
because he wasn't playing ball they were transferring missiles

2078
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:26,540
to al-qaeda we know they stood down for eight hours

2079
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:30,720
with troops right down the street at a substation base in order to stand down

2080
02:41:30,720 --> 02:41:32,720
and only two navy seals

2081
02:41:32,720 --> 02:41:36,600
refused to not follow orders and went down and held off five hundred guys for

2082
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:40,040
eight hours i mean this is just incredible

2083
02:41:40,040 --> 02:41:42,720
it is this is that

2084
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:46,000

yes the most that

2093
02:42:05,580 --> 02:42:08,640
the most that were going to tell you about a little most of the road is that

2094
02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:09,880
that's happening right now

2095
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:11,200
there's a lawsuit

2096
02:42:11,200 --> 02:42:13,380
uh... it's against unlawful

2097
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:15,360
tyranny filed against uh...

2098
02:42:15,360 --> 02:42:16,620
mister obama

2099
02:42:16,620 --> 02:42:20,640
at the united states government for acting like a king

2100
02:42:20,640 --> 02:42:22,020
uh...

2101
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:25,960
and it's here has been filed as a lawsuit uh... is to set us in who is

2102
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:28,160

02:42:28,160 --> 02:42:29,880
uh... approach the court

2104
02:42:29,880 --> 02:42:31,360
uh... made his case

2105
02:42:31,360 --> 02:42:32,100
in fact

2106
02:42:32,100 --> 02:42:35,400
the judge wanted to throw it out but for the wrong reason

2107
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:37,560
and so he's come back refile

2108
02:42:37,560 --> 02:42:41,560
and uh... having he's having her removed because she's an obama appointee

2109
02:42:41,560 --> 02:42:44,620
uh... who was obviously trying to protect obama because

2110
02:42:44,620 --> 02:42:46,120
this is kind of

2111
02:42:46,120 --> 02:42:48,180
it's about the natural law

2112
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:50,840
uh... and uh... having an unnatural

2113
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:52,120
uh... born citizen

2114
02:42:52,120 --> 02:42:56,720
by the way uh... obama has uh... two courts have slapped him down

2115
02:42:56,720 --> 02:42:59,820
for doing unconstitutional things on recess appointments

2116
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:02,880
uh... and other areas uh... caller matt in florida

2117
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:06,460
a uh... national guard officer anything else you'd like to add

2118
02:43:06,460 --> 02:43:10,420
yeah the other thing is um... guys that are in the army war college

2119
02:43:10,420 --> 02:43:14,300
you know as a national guardsman and they're basically being

2120
02:43:14,300 --> 02:43:17,000
talking about this whole dual status command thing

2121
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:21,520
almost all the guys and luckily the guy that i know we've been there

2122
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:25,360
was against the dual status commander they were actually trying to do regional dual status

2123
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:27,160
commanders which they have a

2124
02:43:27,160 --> 02:43:30,940
as they have a commander that would be in charge of federal states

2125
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:34,080
and uh... yeah what they're doing is they've created the ten

2126
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:37,520
yeah they've created the ten regions with the governor saying you don't need

2127
02:43:37,520 --> 02:43:41,160
fifty so oh we we have governors the the governors

2128
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:44,440
we appointed yeah they're they're trying to totally get rid of any

2129
02:43:44,440 --> 02:43:48,240
state control of the national guard when it's always been state go ahead

2130
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:51,520
that's what i said i was like you know he said that that basically goes against all state

2131
02:43:51,520 --> 02:43:53,280
sovereignty law i mean that's just

2132
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:57,880
basically he says the law of that governor and i guess they would have to be in on it

2133
02:43:57,880 --> 02:43:59,460
but still it's just like

2134
02:43:59,460 --> 02:44:02,700
you know the state sovereignty doesn't exist anymore at that point i mean

2135
02:44:02,700 --> 02:44:06,160
the final thing was i know you talked about this before as well but that that uh...

2136
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:10,520
guard experience magazine that came out that comes out and i get it and i got it

2137
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:13,160
since it was the middle of uh... year last year

2138
02:44:13,160 --> 02:44:16,640
and they had on the front cover the thread at home and they had a guy

2139
02:44:16,640 --> 02:44:20,600
his face was blacked out and he was in military uniform full battle gear

2140
02:44:20,600 --> 02:44:22,600
and it's like the thread at home talks about how

2141
02:44:22,600 --> 02:44:27,640
our returning veterans and he's on a guard national guard magazine and like

2142
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:28,480
this is

2143
02:44:28,480 --> 02:44:33,100
i mean i i don't know if you're trying to every angle they're trying to you know

2144
02:44:33,100 --> 02:44:37,440
throw this at us and it's like it's completely ridiculous when they send our guys over

2145
02:44:37,440 --> 02:44:42,480
three four five six times huffed up on painkillers and depression medicine and they

2146
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:46,640
and they come back and they wonder why they're upset or angry or they come back and

2147
02:44:46,640 --> 02:44:50,440
you know life is totally flipped upside down and they wonder why these guys are

2148
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:54,820
are you know a little off you know it's completely ridiculous

2149
02:44:54,820 --> 02:44:58,000
absolutely god bless you and i appreciate your call we're gonna go to more military

2150
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:01,160
calls but first get another comment from uh... doctor jim garrow

2157
02:45:21,080 --> 02:45:24,000
well it actually says veterans

and let's continue the latest edition of the guards experience

2160
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,640
the national guards official magazine features a cover story titled the threat

2161
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:35,800
at home

2162
02:45:35,800 --> 02:45:39,340
and it is a guy in a national guard uniform

2163
02:45:39,340 --> 02:45:41,460
with explosives tucked in

2164
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:44,340
who and what are the biggest dangers to homeland security

2165
02:45:44,340 --> 02:45:47,340
now if you're a foreign megabank that took over america

2166
02:45:47,340 --> 02:45:48,980
you're getting ready to fully gut it

2167
02:45:48,980 --> 02:45:52,520
you're gonna say the veterans who were patriots and willing to fight they're

2168
02:45:52,520 --> 02:45:53,780
the enemy

2169
02:45:53,780 --> 02:45:58,260
i mean imagine if it is out of a simpsons episode with the spaceship lands

2170
02:45:58,260 --> 02:46:01,960
what's the name of the simpsons town

2171
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:03,020
springfield

2172
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:06,400
uh... it's one of the few episodes i've seen and and and uh...

2173
02:46:06,400 --> 02:46:09,200
the spaceship lands and ugg and gugg these big

2174
02:46:09,200 --> 02:46:10,920
fourteen foot green aliens

2175
02:46:10,920 --> 02:46:13,420
we are your rulers and the mayor and the

2176
02:46:13,420 --> 02:46:14,840
rockefeller guy

2177
02:46:14,840 --> 02:46:18,840
uh... comes up and says yes you're right we bow to you which is exactly how it

2178
02:46:18,840 --> 02:46:19,700
would work

2179
02:46:19,700 --> 02:46:23,420
this would be like a giant flying saucer landing announcing will destroy your

2180
02:46:23,420 --> 02:46:24,660
planet from orbit

2181
02:46:24,660 --> 02:46:26,180
if you don't bow to us

2182
02:46:26,180 --> 02:46:28,640
and by the way the new enemy is anyone that says

2183
02:46:28,640 --> 02:46:32,480
that the planet booble bapper or whatever isn't in control

2184
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:35,740
and uh... you know now here's your new guard magazine

2185
02:46:35,740 --> 02:46:38,960
anyone that says aliens don't have a right to rule you as the enemy i mean

2186
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:42,020
you know founding fathers are bad george washington's bad

2187
02:46:42,020 --> 02:46:44,740
uh... bill of rights is bad private property bad

2188
02:46:44,740 --> 02:46:47,800
a mouse a tongue good tyranny good i mean this is what they teach at the

2189
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:49,060
colleges

2190
02:46:49,060 --> 02:46:50,720
and now they're saying that

2191
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:54,320
alex jones and they say in articles on a terrorist i'm a radical i'm gonna kill

2192
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:56,900
people cnn said they need to kill me

2193
02:46:56,900 --> 02:46:59,680
because i'm gonna kill them and they would want to be in a room with me

2194
02:46:59,680 --> 02:47:02,260
because i might kill on my have no criminal record

2195
02:47:02,260 --> 02:47:05,240
i mean these are mad dog tyrants

2196
02:47:05,240 --> 02:47:07,980
and you know since the guy mentions that see when i'm listening to a guest or

2197
02:47:07,980 --> 02:47:09,680
caller i know they're for real

2198
02:47:09,680 --> 02:47:12,200
cuz i'm immersed in this stuff

2199
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:15,460
okay i'm not bragging i mean i live this i'd read this

2200
02:47:15,460 --> 02:47:18,020
so that they're saying things i know they're true or not

2201
02:47:18,020 --> 02:47:19,940
truth is already know almost all the stuff

2202
02:47:19,940 --> 02:47:22,220
i just have folks on to give their views on it

2203
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:24,940
and different perspectives i'm here to get you to be aware of it

2204
02:47:24,940 --> 02:47:28,800
but the callers like it's so ridiculous they're teaching us the military or the

2205
02:47:28,800 --> 02:47:29,960
number one terrorist

2206
02:47:29,960 --> 02:47:31,600
in our own magazine

2207
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:34,880
that's because they really are in power i'm sorry go ahead

2208
02:47:34,880 --> 02:47:38,720
they're stealing the last thing which back to that i think i think about that

2209
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:40,080
uh... you've got a fact

2210
02:47:40,080 --> 02:47:43,360
you've got all about the man who's given service to the country and he's the

2211
02:47:43,360 --> 02:47:47,000
terrorist okay now the public's looking at terrorist

2212
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:48,080
redefining

2213
02:47:48,080 --> 02:47:49,700
redefining the language

2214
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:51,720
are we not

2215
02:47:51,720 --> 02:47:54,040
yes i mean i mean it's incredible

2216
02:47:54,040 --> 02:47:57,320
okay connect and do we have some time to talk just for a second about about

2217
02:47:57,320 --> 02:48:00,920
something that goes way back to this whole notion of redefining things is

2218
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:02,160
stealing the language

2219
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:03,340
absolutely

2220
02:48:03,340 --> 02:48:06,160
can we do that don't let me go

2221
02:48:06,160 --> 02:48:10,340
yes go give it to us let me let me go way back way back let's go into the

2222
02:48:10,340 --> 02:48:11,520
bible for a second

2223
02:48:11,520 --> 02:48:12,400
do you remember

2224
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:14,320
do you remember when all of the disciples

2225
02:48:14,320 --> 02:48:16,060
polls first came together

2226
02:48:16,060 --> 02:48:17,600
remember it says something about

2227
02:48:17,600 --> 02:48:18,640
and they had

2228
02:48:18,640 --> 02:48:21,660
they held everything in common

2229
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:23,960
they held everything in common

2230
02:48:23,960 --> 02:48:26,200
it meant that the rich people brought in

2231
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:29,320
uh... the goods and services that they had in the dollars that they have

2232
02:48:29,320 --> 02:48:31,280
because god had blessed them with it

2233
02:48:31,280 --> 02:48:32,280
what was the notion

2234
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:35,240
they were going to share it they were going to have it in common

2235
02:48:35,240 --> 02:48:38,420
not a redistribution of wealth it's a big difference here there's a huge

2236
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:39,360
difference between

2237
02:48:39,360 --> 02:48:42,560
as sociological kind of thing that marxist kind of thing

2238
02:48:42,560 --> 02:48:43,760
that they're talking about

2239
02:48:43,760 --> 02:48:45,020
obama and crew

2240
02:48:45,020 --> 02:48:47,520
so they held everything in common

2241
02:48:47,520 --> 02:48:51,180
later on we have the english or the british common law

2242
02:48:51,180 --> 02:48:52,160
what's it come out of

2243
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:54,660
it comes out of the scriptures

2244
02:48:54,660 --> 02:48:56,220
what has obama dot

2245
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:57,540
he has taken

2246
02:48:57,540 --> 02:49:03,700
common ism common ism and turned it into communism two different things

2247
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:05,240
gives glory to god

2248
02:49:05,240 --> 02:49:06,640
for the balance

2249
02:49:06,640 --> 02:49:08,940
further blessings that he has given

2250
02:49:08,940 --> 02:49:11,820
and the responsibility do you have one to another

2251
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:15,540
as christians or citizens one to another

2252
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:17,520
you hold things in common

2253
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:18,480
that's black

2254
02:49:18,480 --> 02:49:22,940
and if you notice boston common it what that isn't that that piece of land that

2255
02:49:22,940 --> 02:49:25,340
everyone has in common

2256
02:49:25,340 --> 02:49:29,340
is to be the principal park in the downtown of all the little villages

2257
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:32,420
that were around the little towns there were comments

2258
02:49:32,420 --> 02:49:36,200
they were areas where they've been it was happy in common it was a privately

2259
02:49:36,200 --> 02:49:40,800
owned it was probably out it was held in common for the good of the common man

2260
02:49:40,800 --> 02:49:42,580
the common man

2261
02:49:42,580 --> 02:49:46,500
obama and crew are doing and and they're teaching this universities is stealing

2262
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:51,320
the language so you think that because you give something away to someone that

2263
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:53,760
that's being a good socialist

2264
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:57,840
giving into those who have to have me because you have

2265
02:49:57,840 --> 02:49:59,340
well that's not what it is

2266
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:01,580
the original christian message was that we

2267
02:50:01,580 --> 02:50:03,400
polls all things in common

2268
02:50:03,400 --> 02:50:08,000
from the bounty of god who gave it to us so we share that bounty of god as a

2269
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,260
responsibility

2270
02:50:09,260 --> 02:50:11,100
not as a social nightmare

2271
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:13,680
but defined by marxist

2272
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:16,540
i'm just bringing that up for for uh... short message

2273
02:50:16,540 --> 02:50:19,820
there now you're absolutely right and right now on screen for t b viewers

2274
02:50:19,820 --> 02:50:23,320
i'm showing the p d f of the national guard magazine

2275
02:50:23,320 --> 02:50:26,720
and it says the number one threat in here is gun owners veterans and things

2276
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:27,420
like that

2277
02:50:27,420 --> 02:50:30,460
next al-qaeda it puts malicious

2278
02:50:30,460 --> 02:50:32,100
next al-qaeda

2279
02:50:32,100 --> 02:50:34,000
next a counterfeiting

2280
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,140
next to loan groups

2281
02:50:36,140 --> 02:50:38,880
and says it's the military's job

2282
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:40,340
now to operate

2283
02:50:40,340 --> 02:50:42,020
domestically

2284
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:45,900
and it's in search of the hidden enemy look everywhere but washington

2285
02:50:45,900 --> 02:50:48,140
with the globalists that have taken over

2286
02:50:48,140 --> 02:50:49,120
trust

2287
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:51,820
no one

2288
02:50:51,820 --> 02:50:55,720
the government again that is the message they hammer home

2289
02:50:55,720 --> 02:50:59,060
more calls for military jason marine robin others

2290
02:50:59,060 --> 02:51:01,780
national guard straight ahead

2291
02:51:01,780 --> 02:51:04,860
if you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators but we're

2292
02:51:04,860 --> 02:51:08,620
waiting for an offer so crazy you couldn't refuse that you're not going

2293
02:51:08,620 --> 02:51:11,240
to want to miss this exciting message here's why

2294
02:51:11,240 --> 02:51:15,340
are solar generators provide life-saving electrical power and unlike gas

2295
02:51:15,340 --> 02:51:17,940
generators solar generators run quietly

2296
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:22,540
amid no fumes and produce electricity from the sun so when the lights go out

2297
02:51:22,540 --> 02:51:26,140
you'll always have the power you need now here's the best part

2298
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:30,420
every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as

2299
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:35,740
new we put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily

2300
02:51:35,740 --> 02:51:39,300
at the end of each year we call them scratch and dead units but they're

2301
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:43,780
really just like new each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special

2302
02:51:43,780 --> 02:51:45,980
bonuses you just won't believe

2303
02:51:45,980 --> 02:51:49,980
don't wait they go fast go to scratch and then solar dot com that scratch and

the president is by that action

2368
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:28,480

02:55:28,480 --> 02:55:29,760

back in the early nineteen nineties

2379
02:55:53,680 --> 02:55:58,360
i'm going back maybe nineteen ninety two ninety three they did surveys back then

2380
02:55:58,360 --> 02:56:00,120
with the u_-s-military

2381
02:56:00,120 --> 02:56:03,720
and a lot of servicemen says no we won't fire upon american people you know

2382
02:56:03,720 --> 02:56:06,680
carpet if there was ever marshall you know that was in the news actually about

02:56:06,680 --> 02:56:08,480
ninety four it was clinton

2384
02:56:08,480 --> 02:56:11,240
uh... yes so they tried this before the good news is

2385
02:56:11,240 --> 02:56:13,820
they try we fight they try we fight

2386
02:56:13,820 --> 02:56:16,420
it's an eternal battle go ahead

2387
02:56:16,420 --> 02:56:20,900
right exactly so what they did was since the united states military said no

2388
02:56:20,900 --> 02:56:22,020
faces okay

2389
02:56:22,020 --> 02:56:25,300
will bring in foreign troops on the united nations

2390
02:56:25,300 --> 02:56:29,560
that they did and yep and they hate them in the united nations biosphere is

2391
02:56:29,560 --> 02:56:31,480
around the country

2392
02:56:31,480 --> 02:56:34,440
well they don't even hide and they do the open training now under n l e and

2393
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:36,540
all the rest of the god bless you great points

2394
02:56:36,540 --> 02:56:39,220
uh... your comments on that doctor garrow

2395
02:56:39,220 --> 02:56:42,820
well i mean let's face it uh... these people are planning to get a long range

2396
02:56:42,820 --> 02:56:44,060
plan in place

2397
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:47,300
uh... i think that they don't think it's a rather big groups

2398
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:48,000
moment

2399
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:49,140
until you think

2400
02:56:49,140 --> 02:56:50,680
figures honesty covered out

2401
02:56:50,680 --> 02:56:53,380
but don't you think that uh... poor obama's got a going out

2402
02:56:53,380 --> 02:56:55,420
you shouldn't have said that in public

2403
02:56:55,420 --> 02:56:58,940
but we have the benefit of honesty for a change

2404
02:56:58,940 --> 02:57:02,340
well i mean hagel has been a builder burger hagel is somebody they really

2405
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:06,260
like a you know ninety plus percent of the votes when he won the senate

2406
02:57:06,260 --> 02:57:08,340
work out on a company he owned

2407
02:57:08,340 --> 02:57:12,340
so that you give an idea about all all mister hagel let's jam in one more real

2408
02:57:12,340 --> 02:57:13,260
quick

2409
02:57:13,260 --> 02:57:16,620
captain briggs in illinois i go ahead

2410
02:57:16,620 --> 02:57:20,980

2411
02:57:20,980 --> 02:57:22,520
and doctor garrow

2412
02:57:22,520 --> 02:57:26,860
and i have a lot of back and forth between texas illinois and new jersey

2413
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:30,300
and uh... actually spoke to my son is on active duty in hawaii

2414
02:57:30,300 --> 02:57:33,260
uh... the words from the troops around those three specific areas is no they

2415
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:34,980
will not find the american people

2416
02:57:34,980 --> 02:57:36,360
and when things go down

2417
02:57:36,360 --> 02:57:39,780
the national guard guys will melt back into the populace

2418
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:43,300
and for those guys like the young marine called in earlier

2419
02:57:43,300 --> 02:57:44,680
do the right thing

2420
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:47,180

02:57:56,660 --> 02:58:00,880

2426
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:03,100
crisis to come after everybody and

2427
02:58:03,100 --> 02:58:05,820
i don't think they're going to get away with it and for those who just tuned in

2428
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:09,600
senator hagel was in the washington post they were quoting him in a meeting

2429
02:58:09,600 --> 02:58:12,700
saying you can't trust the military that under your command

2430
02:58:12,700 --> 02:58:14,060
that's because

2431
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:16,960
we know for the military's actions they've been refusing

2432
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:18,560

well that's because homeland security is wired into all the local police

2499
03:01:47,720 --> 03:01:49,100
departments now and

2500
03:01:49,100 --> 03:01:52,100
but we need to time that because this won't be the first time they screwed up if that's

2501
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:55,220
what happened sometimes they reported before it even starts and that's how we

2502
03:01:55,220 --> 03:01:56,460
catch them

2503
03:01:56,460 --> 03:02:00,160
yeah and it but he was knowing that there was multiple

2504
03:02:00,160 --> 03:02:04,220
multiple injuries and it's called it's called jumping the gun

2505
03:02:04,220 --> 03:02:07,920
uh... i'll have to look into that we were recording it this morning

2506
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:11,480
and so we'll look into it thank you so much great point by the way aaron dikes

2507
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:12,940
ran in with this report

2508
03:02:12,940 --> 03:02:14,060
msnbc

2509
03:02:14,060 --> 03:02:17,780
uh... edit portrays gun owners as heckling father

2510
03:02:17,780 --> 03:02:19,540
of sandy hook victim

2511
03:02:19,540 --> 03:02:21,980
remember msnbc is being sued

2512
03:02:21,980 --> 03:02:24,300
for editing the the zimmerman tape

2513
03:02:24,300 --> 03:02:27,940
or zimmerman's going uh... okay there's a guy with a hoodie walking around okay

2514
03:02:27,940 --> 03:02:29,380
uh...

2515
03:02:29,380 --> 03:02:32,060
what's he doing he's doing this uh... what color is the uh... looks like he's

2516
03:02:32,060 --> 03:02:32,980
black

2517
03:02:32,980 --> 03:02:36,620
they added it to yeah there's a guy walking with a hoodie he's black

2518
03:02:36,620 --> 03:02:38,460
and then got caught doing it so

2519
03:02:38,460 --> 03:02:39,500
this is breaking

2520
03:02:39,500 --> 03:02:42,420
uh... cable propaganda network deliberately edits out

2521
03:02:42,420 --> 03:02:45,420
sandy hook family member asking audience a question

2522
03:02:45,420 --> 03:02:48,840
which gun rights advocate responds to and makes it look like

2523
03:02:48,840 --> 03:02:50,300
heckling

2524
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:52,220
uh... we're going to uh...

2525
03:02:52,220 --> 03:02:54,740
let's add the part about zimmerman in here

2526
03:02:54,740 --> 03:02:57,540
i think that's very very important to show they have a

2527
03:02:57,540 --> 03:02:58,500
history of this

2528
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:00,340
speaking of msnbc

2529
03:03:00,340 --> 03:03:01,980
uh... let's go to a clip

2530
03:03:01,980 --> 03:03:05,100
of one of their people uh... on there

2531
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:05,860
uh...

2532
03:03:05,860 --> 03:03:07,620
saying uh... crackers

2533
03:03:07,620 --> 03:03:11,640
again get white people to think everybody who's of color is racist this

2534
03:03:11,640 --> 03:03:16,540
is open race-baiting this this is racism to create racism for divide and conquer

2535
03:03:16,540 --> 03:03:17,660
here it is

2536
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:22,020
those you know crazy crackers on the right like if they start with their very

2537
03:03:22,020 --> 03:03:23,700
hateful language

2538
03:03:23,700 --> 03:03:28,040
that is going to kill them in the same way the death knell for republicans is the

2539
03:03:28,040 --> 03:03:33,180
tone of the conversation they absolutely have even have a white woman

2540
03:03:33,180 --> 03:03:36,560
uh... this uh... finney come out and say it

2541
03:03:36,560 --> 03:03:40,200
and and it's led by that you don't turn your guns in your races cracker

2542
03:03:40,200 --> 03:03:43,500
you don't turn your guns in your southerners are trash al sharpton

2543
03:03:43,500 --> 03:03:46,900
that overcome the southerners and the constitution i mean it's just

2544
03:03:46,900 --> 03:03:50,940
it's it's absolutely we're northerners we're gonna get the southerners

2545
03:03:50,940 --> 03:03:54,340
trying to get northerners act like that when others are like that it's

2546
03:03:54,340 --> 03:03:55,940
we have the all sharpened about drones

2547
03:03:55,940 --> 03:03:59,900
here's al sharpened about door your guns mean nothing we got the drones now

2548
03:03:59,900 --> 03:04:03,380
here it is i mean if you look at the second amendment

2549
03:04:03,380 --> 03:04:06,980
it was that you would have a militia to protect yourself

2550
03:04:06,980 --> 03:04:11,180
in case the government came and attack citizens first of all

2551
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:14,480
if the government were to come to disarm you

2552
03:04:14,480 --> 03:04:17,660
you would not be able to use an automatic weapon to defend yourself

2553
03:04:17,660 --> 03:04:19,740
let's be serious we're in a world

2554
03:04:19,740 --> 03:04:21,780
of drones now so

2555
03:04:21,780 --> 03:04:26,740
the second amendment would not help you in that area we're talking about people do

2556
03:04:26,740 --> 03:04:31,940
not have the right to unregulated rights you see and everybody's really smiling when they hear

2557
03:04:31,940 --> 03:04:35,100
about the drones oh those are our drones the government loves us yeah the

2558
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:37,580
