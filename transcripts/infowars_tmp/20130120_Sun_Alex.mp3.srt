00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's Sunday, the 20th day of January 2013.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Here's an important report filed by Melissa Melton.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Melissa Melton reporting for Info Wars Nightly News.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Last week, Alex Jones appeared on the Piers Morgan show on CNN

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
to discuss his views on gun control.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The following night, Piers decided to host a panel regarding Alex's appearance,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and he had on Daily Beast sports columnist Buzz Bissinger,

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Huffington Post's Abby Huntsman, and lawyer Gloria Allred.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And Mr. Bissinger made what can only be described as a threat against Alex's life.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's take a look at this clip.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It is pathetic. It is ridiculous that you are allowed,

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't care what the justification is,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
that you are allowed in this country to own a semi-automatic weapon,

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
much less a handgun, but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The only reason I think you need it is, Piers, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally, and pop him.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'd love to see that. In uniform.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll borrow my brother's uniform.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, as you saw in that clip, Bissinger tells Morgan

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
the only reason he would need a semi-automatic gun is to, quote,

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
pop Alex Jones, to which they all laugh, and Abby Huntsman actually says,

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'd love to see that, and Morgan even says he would borrow his brother's uniform.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And this isn't the only time during that television show that a threat was made on Alex.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Earlier in the show, one of Piers' guests also made the comment

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
that he hoped Alex's children would not be killed.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't want Alex Jones to get the phone call at 3 o'clock in the morning

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
that one of his children have been shot and killed by somebody who shouldn't have

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
a handgun or a rifle.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This kind of talk from supposedly anti-gun activists is abhorrent.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
They're making a threat on national television to shoot and possibly murder someone,

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and it's no joke either.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
As you'll see in this next clip, private investigator Doug Hagman

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
came on the Alex Jones show just a few weeks ago

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
and talked about how he has an inside source in the Department of Homeland Security

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and that the DHS is actually keeping a list of pro-gun activists

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and political activists who will be taken out.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Anyone reporting on journalism speaking out against government policies,

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
anyone who protests, anything that is antithetical to this regime

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
will be shut up and censored, if you will.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And not only that, but according to my source, put on a list

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
because when the money supply or when the economy collapsed,

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
when we can no longer buy anything and the riots break out,

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
the very first people to go, according to my source,

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
the very first people to be rounded up,

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
the very first targets, if you will, on the radar of this regime

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
are the people that are speaking the truth about what's taking place.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
On Hagman's site, he relayed in detail that there are lists of political dissidents

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
maintained by DHS and vocal opponents of the politics of the global elite,

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the bankers, and the opponents of anything standing in their way

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
while they are on the top of the list to be, quote, handled.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
In the days following that broadcast, news broke that Keith Ratliff,

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a man behind FPS Russia, a gun show on YouTube that made the channel

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
one of the top ten most popular on the entire site,

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
was tied to a chair and shot execution style in the back of the head.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Then John Noveske of Noveske Rifle Works, a gun manufacturer known for his AR-15s,

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
was mysteriously killed in a car crash just days after he posted a list on Facebook

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
linking mass shootings and horrible acts of murder and suicide

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to antipsychotic medications.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
In the wake of these threats against Alex on the Piers Morgan show,

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
it would seem Twitter fans picked up Piers' sentiment and also threatened to shoot Alex.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
One Twitterer wrote,

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I hope Alex Jones gets taken by terrorists who shoot his arms and legs off

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
starting at the fingers and toes and work their way up.

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Another, for the first time I see a good reason for guns in the USA.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Alex Jones, someone please shoot this Muppet.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I wish somebody would shoot this Alex Jones guy in the face.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then another responded, please and thank you.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
As the system ratchets up this war on our Second Amendment rights,

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
we are seeing some unprecedented attacks against pro-gun activists

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and political activists who are just trying to fight for our freedom.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are we going to see another false flag next?

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Are we going to see another mass shooting, another Oklahoma City,

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
another systematic takeout of a group like we did in Waco?

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, Doug Hagman left us with this chilling warning.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
By the way, Alex, according to my DHS source, expect more.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Expect at least one more.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One more incident to really solidify in the minds of people that these big, bad assault rifles,

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
that misnomer to be sure, are not to be in the hands of the American people.

80
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:09,000
For InfoWars Nightly News, I'm Melissa Mountain.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
We'll see you next time.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Well, it's our first visit with Ron Paul of 2013.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He is now the former congressman.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The first time I interviewed him, he was running for Congress again, I guess back in 95, 96.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And he'd been in Congress once before as a libertarian and, of course, went back as a Republican.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And he has been our greatest defender of liberty, worldwide loved and admired.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He's got big announcements coming up soon.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've heard the rumors and I'll see if he'll give us any hint.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But he joins us, obviously, to talk about the fiscal cliff that he said we've already gone over a long time ago.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's happening with that?

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The Sandy Hook shooting, the announcements of the NSA openly spying on us.

92
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Something Ron Paul talked about 15 years ago and got called a conspiracy theorist is now just out in the open.

93
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And former congressman and really omni-budsman of liberty worldwide, thank you so much for spending time with us.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Good, good to be with you.

95
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Did you have a good Christmas?

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yep, very good. Family got here.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We had a lot of fun and didn't solve any world problems.

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I wish I need to learn how to unplug as well.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Wow, you heard what I threw out there, sir.

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Where would you like to start first?

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, the things that I've talked about is mostly, well, the general, you know, deterioration of our individual freedoms and our liberties and our arkets.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But I think the big thing, as I wound down my career, dealt with, you know, financial and the economy.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I think both major parties and most members of Congress are in total denial as to what the real problem is because they think it's just a budget.

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You know, well, if we change this number, raise taxes, cut spending, you know, pretend to cut spending, we solve the problem.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And I think it's much bigger than that.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I think, first off, the country is bankrupt.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're insolvent.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We can't pay the bills.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And they won't admit it.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I mean, we have these obligations of $220 trillion in national debt of $16 trillion.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We're the biggest born debtor nation ever.

112
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And that is ignored, and they talk about, you know, what they're going to do with tinkering with the tax code.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And they talk about cuts, which aren't cuts.

114
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's just all deceit and trying to fool the people into believing that they can tinker with a budget.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
But I think the problem is, is government is too big.

116
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They don't follow the Constitution.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They don't know what the rule of government ought to be in a free society.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And they don't admit we're bankrupt.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And oftentimes I've used this saying that, are we going to go over the cliff?

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, in many ways, we're over the cliff in that we're not going to retrace ourselves.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you're over a cliff, you just don't have a chance to climb back up.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And we really don't.

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We're not going to have enough people in Congress in the next go around, or do we have them now?

124
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We have better people now, and we're going to have some people speaking for us.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But we can't go back and all of a sudden balance our budget, remove the regulations, and protect our liberties.

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
All we have to do is listen to our president, what his plans are.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:23,000
But the Republicans aren't doing a whole lot more because we're facing a situation where it took 100 years

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
for our governments and our schools to indoctrinate our people to accepting the idea that the rule of government

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ought to be to take care of us and provide perfect safety and make sure nobody falls through the net

130
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
and take care of people and the whole world.

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And I think we have to address the subject, what should the rule of government be?

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The founders made an attempt at it.

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
They wrote a constitution.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We don't obey it.

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And to me, if we would accept the notion that the rule of government is to protect our freedoms,

136
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
provide some national defense for us, provide a sound currency, and protect our liberties,

137
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
there would be no warfare state and there would be no welfare state.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And nobody wants to address that.

139
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know, in all this talk, neither Republicans or Democrats would even suggest about cutting the militarism.

140
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The only talk was, should we increase the military expenditures by 18 percent or 20?

141
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The people who wanted 18 percent were castigated for slashing national defense.

142
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Instead, they were, you know, unpatriotic.

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So that is where the mess is.

144
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I see the mess that we're in, a problem of education, a consequence of 100 years of control

145
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
of many generations indoctrinating them into bad economic policy and bad foreign policy.

146
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Congressman, you've talked about globalism, the Bilderberg Group, people like that,

147
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
but it's now in the Financial Times of London.

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's in hundreds of papers that we can probably pull some up and put them on screen

149
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
where they announce global government by the six mega banks.

150
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And I listen to Bloomberg Financial on XM and they brag that they've conquered Europe with debt,

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
they've signed the Europeans onto derivatives, they've got them dependent on socialism,

152
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
but most of the debt is actually the central bank's debt that are really private.

153
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And now I see them wrecking us, Congressman, on purpose to make us debt slaves while also making us dependent.

154
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I mean, surely they know the facts, even the Congressional Budget Office, as you know,

155
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
three or four years ago said we were bankrupt.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
All these other government economists have admitted this.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So you're not just somebody who studied economics, you're also a medical doctor.

158
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's kind of like a patient that's got cancer all over their body.

159
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is already a done deal.

160
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So what's your take on my statement that we've been maneuvered into rack and ruin by loan sharks?

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I mean, I think it's important to not just say there are a bunch of buffoons in D.C.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and others in my research are just mafia organizations

163
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that want us as basically debt slaves on a sharecropping plantation.

164
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I think it's partially true, but it's also involved indoctrination through education.

165
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's just not 10 or 15 people who get together and all of a sudden they can change people's minds.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
People endorse Keynesianism.

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
They endorse the Federal Reserve.

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They endorse us being the policemen of the world and we should have these wars in the Middle East.

169
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So they have been indoctrinated.

170
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And yes, there are a few who are going to benefit.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You know, I can't read into their minds.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They sit back and say, you know what, we're going to bankrupt the country and cause us chaos.

173
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I think they try to get away with manipulating and maneuvering

174
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and benefiting themselves both with power and money.

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And philosophically it doesn't work out, so they have to react.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So they take advantage of it.

177
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's sort of like taking advantage, don't let a major crisis go to waste.

178
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I mean, they create the problems.

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
They think they're going to get away with it.

180
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then when the crisis hits, they make use of it and they say, well, we have to do.

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
They're motivated by money and power and they have to have control of politics.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Sure, sure. I'm talking about...

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't think they're smart enough to on a daily basis say, well, we're going to do A and B is going to be results.

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I think there are mostly unintended consequences that occur and they react.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'd like to get people to react differently.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I agree with you that at the mid-level and even the upper levels, obviously,

187
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
it's just a corrupt system people have been born into now.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But I'm talking about the 112-point plan that got leaked out of the World Bank

189
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
when Joseph Stichlitz resigned the Nobel Prize winner in economics in 2002.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It talked about how they manipulated third-world countries into bankruptcy to take control

191
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
and it discussed doing it to the West.

192
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So at Bilderberg, from our sources, but also at Davos, I've got Herman von Ruppe, head of the E.U.,

193
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
saying we're going to use the financial crisis to bring in the new world order.

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That may be, and I don't know every individual who makes these plans,

195
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
but I do know that I meet a lot of people who believe...

196
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I mean, you take a guy like Bernanke.

197
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think Bernanke actually believes that chunk.

198
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You know, I think he really believes that he's been sent here by the Creator

199
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
to make sure we never have a Great Depression before

200
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
because they didn't print the money fast enough.

201
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't think he sits and says, and goes much further than this,

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
because he has invested a lifetime into proving this ideology.

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think he's wrong. He's determined to prove he's right.

204
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He creates truth.

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And then these people that you're talking about,

206
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
they know what's going on, and they line up, and they get involved,

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and they learn how to manipulate the system for political reasons.

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
So we know that our president has an agenda, and it's very, very clear,

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
so he works his agenda with the system that exists.

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I agree with you.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There's different factions who only care about themselves,

212
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and together they're the perfect storm.

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But you're saying he thinks he's right, you think you're right.

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Sir, I watch a speech that's in our film Matrix of Evil you gave in 2003 at McKinney-Ruffs

215
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
right outside Austin, here in South Austin,

216
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and you laid out everything that was going to happen,

217
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
how they'd use the drones here, how they'd have the NSA spy on us,

218
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
how they would use the Patriot Act on the citizens,

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
how, when they collapsed things, they would use that to take full control,

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
how the derivatives bubble would work.

221
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I mean, it's like you're a prophet, but you're not.

222
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You were in there in the committees, you've studied history,

223
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
you knew what was going to happen.

224
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You said the stimulus would work.

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You said all these things wouldn't work.

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You said that the Republicans would vote to raise taxes.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
One dollar of cuts for every 41 in spending increases.

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Seventy-seven percent of Americans with tax increases on payroll.

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I mean, it's like the lying.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What's happened is we've been eased into this tyranny,

231
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
and so now you're here saying, well, we'll see who's going to be proven right.

232
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You've been proven right, Congressman.

233
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Toot your own horn.

234
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
We'll be right back with a conclusion of our important interview with Congressman Ron Paul.

235
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
As well as our all-natural silver soaps.

236
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,

238
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

239
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel

240
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

241
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

245
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive

246
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy?

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough

to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

251
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote,

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Almost all the grocery stores are closed,

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

254
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.

255
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

264
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The globalist model is to shut down societies

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

266
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items

Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

295
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And I'm not taking this moment to bash Glenn Beck.

296
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I've tried to be nice to him, but he says he's now the leader of the libertarian movement.

297
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes, I saw that. I'll have to check him out. I wonder what he believes in.

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, because he told me that your supporters four years ago were going to blow us up with bombs

299
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
and that we did Oklahoma City.

300
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And then he keeps saying that we shouldn't get in the government's face.

301
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I mean, my only deal with Glenn Beck is he says I'm dangerous and basically shouldn't be on the air.

302
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Piers Morgan basically says that as well.

303
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And then now he tells me that he's my leader

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and that he's now going to become Ron Paul and Alex Jones, I guess, mixed.

305
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Do you have any comments on that?

306
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Not too much because I don't know exactly what he's talking about.

307
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
All I can do is speak for myself on what I believe in and what I'm trying to do.

308
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And I've been pretty much up front on what the principles are and which direction we should go and effort.

309
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I think I do one thing differently than others, and that is I try to stick to ideas rather than personalities.

310
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Of course, we've already mentioned the president and I mentioned George Bush.

311
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But over the years, I basically don't attack the individuals.

312
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't generally attack Bernanke.

313
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sure, but you did call him a demagogue when he said that your supporters wanted to blow up buildings.

314
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yeah, that's for sure.

315
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But generally speaking, I don't do the personality thing.

316
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That doesn't mean that, as a matter of fact, if you do the personality thing, you get a lot more attention.

317
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
But I don't want it to distract.

318
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If people want, they'll try to entice me to say, what should we do with Bernanke?

319
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How should we punish him?

320
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Remember what our governor said that we should do with him.

321
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I might agree with it.

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I might even say things along that way.

323
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But most of the time I'll go and say, it's the system, it's the system of the federal reserve.

324
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No, no, no, I agree, I agree, I agree.

325
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And that is what I want to concentrate.

326
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Some people will concentrate on different things.

327
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They'll have different tactics and different viewpoints.

328
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And I think that's fine.

329
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
No, no, listen, I think Glenn Beck does a lot of great work and has gotten better and better.

330
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He is just systematically, I don't infight.

331
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You'll never hear my show talking about other people that are in the liberty movement.

332
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He just routinely says, he said, I made up the 1.6 billion bullets, even though that's AP Reuters direct federal purchases.

333
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm making up the police state.

334
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm making up NSA spying.

335
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Your supporters want to blow buildings up.

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I mean, he is trying to gate keep, and I'm just warning you that unless you join with Sauron, Dr. Paul, he's going to stab you in the back.

337
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And I'm only saying that kind of like a chart when you're coming into a bay in a boat.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm just marking the chart, Dr. Paul.

339
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
But you're a smart guy, you know that.

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We've only got about six, seven minutes left in closing.

341
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Sandy Hook and now the Feinstein bill and others to make us physically turn them in, not just go back and re-register with the ATF at their pleasure.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Now they want to just open where they decide law-abiding citizens turning their guns in.

343
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What is your take on that?

344
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And are you concerned about a purge or persecution of gun owners?

345
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Well, I'm concerned about their inconsistency.

346
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
They want to get rid of guns because somebody used a gun and did some violence.

347
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But we all know that more people are getting killed with hammers and fists and knives.

348
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So they're not very consistent.

349
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
They see an opportunity.

350
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
They want to get rid of the guns.

351
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Some people believe they're dangerous and want to get rid of them.

352
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
And other people want to get rid of them because they know that guns can resist a government tyranny.

353
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
And some people like the idea that governments become tyrants and they should run things.

354
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
As long as the government kills children, it's okay.

355
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So they want to protect that.

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You know, all that scandal and outcry, which much of it was justified seeing kids getting killed is a horror.

357
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
But at the same time, how about those people who are saying, okay, this is an excuse to take away the rights of people who use guns to defend their family.

358
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
How many of them are shouting and screaming about the children that our drones are killing on a daily basis?

359
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Because they're Muslim kids in different color and they're overseas and nobody has to line them up and shoot them.

360
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
We can do it by directing drones from this country.

361
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That doesn't even count.

362
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So that's what their whole goal is, is to distract us from some of the horrors that governments perpetuate and the way they destroy our liberties.

363
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
And they perpetuate the violence.

364
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I mean, compared to the violence that governments have perpetuated on the people versus what the people do to each other, there's no contest.

365
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Historically, government's the number one killer, as you know.

366
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
University studies out of Hawaii and others, 292 million people killed in the 20th century, non-military combatants.

367
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
We have a red alert, sir, that just came out while you were on with us.

368
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
DrudgeReport.com, Weekly Standard, AP, you name it.

369
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Obama White House threatens executive action to physically confiscate the firearms.

370
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Biden has now given a speech, sir.

371
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
They've got a bunch of state reps and federal reps.

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I've literally got over ten articles.

373
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
They're all calling for executive orders.

374
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
And Obama is saying now that he'll do everything in his power, including executive orders.

375
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we feared.

376
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Congressman, constitutionally, that's beyond a constitutional crisis.

377
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
As a constitutional expert, sir, if he signs an order ordering we turn in our guns, what does that mean?

378
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Well, it should go without saying that he's gone way too far.

379
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It also should go without saying that he's acting with the use of illegal violence.

380
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
And he becomes the violent person to say that if you don't – and this is not new.

381
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
He's been doing this.

382
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,000
You know, an environmental – if Congress moves too slowly, well, I'll write an executive order.

383
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But he didn't invent the executive order and the signing orders.

384
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You know, I'll ignore this.

385
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's a bipartisan thing.

386
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But it's accelerating and getting dictatorial.

387
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
They now sell our militaries.

388
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yeah, it's been going on.

389
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What do we do if Obama orders us to turn our guns in?

390
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Doesn't that make him a dictator if he just says I'll do whatever I want?

391
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
There's certainly a dictatorial move on that.

392
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,000
If the American people had been a little bit better versed, maybe they wouldn't have reelected him.

393
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:25,000
So I do not say that he is a dictator like some of the 20th century dictators that killed 290 million people.

394
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
But these are dictatorial moves.

395
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
They're very, very dangerous.

396
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And people say to me, well, how are you worried about, you know, the military arresting American citizens,

397
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
National Defense Authorization Act?

398
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Because only one or two people were involved.

399
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah, but the principle is 100 percent when you establish a principle.

400
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,000
So what he's doing is perpetuating a principle of putting more power into the presidency.

401
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And it's very, very dangerous.

402
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Setting the precedent under NDAA?

403
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
We're almost out of time.

404
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Sir, will you turn in your semi-autos?

405
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Well, I might not even have anything to turn in for that purpose.

406
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But I don't think the American people will.

407
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I've always assumed that the line in the sand may well be drawn.

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,000
If the federal agent marches in unannounced and they say, well, give me your gun and give me your gold,

409
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I don't think that we'll do that, you know, in a calm way.

410
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think the American people will highly resent it and resist.

411
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,000
So you think I was right, then, telling Piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns, it will start 1776, Part 2?

412
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Well, I don't know whether I put them in the same words, but I think I said something very similar to what you're saying.

413
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Well, God bless you, sir.

414
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I hope we can get you back again in a month.

415
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What are any other websites that are important to plug?

416
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Just campaignforliberty.org?

417
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Do that, and then we'll be listing some new things there because we're making some other web pages.

418
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I'm going to have a home page.

419
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Unfortunately, I didn't have ronpaul.com, so I'm going to have to have ronpaulshomepage.com.

420
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
That'll be coming up, but it's not ready yet.

421
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
All right, big announcements coming soon. We'll talk to you and say hi to the family. God bless you, sir.

422
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Thank you.

423
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Great to talk to that man during this dark time.

424
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I told you executive orders were coming. They're getting us ready to see if we'll take it.

425
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this could be it.

426
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Well, that concludes my interview with Congressman Ron Paul last week.

427
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Just incredibly important information where he agrees with me that most Americans' line in the sand is the Second Amendment.

428
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
That's how our country was founded, and this is nothing but pure tyranny we're witnessing right now.

429
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
So I pray we can fix this peacefully through the courts, through the states, and through the Congress,

430
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,000
and a lot of people are standing up against this tyranny, including our next interview,

431
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:52,000
former state rep and, of course, Luby's Massacre survivor and mother and all-around just amazing patriot, Susanna Hupp.

432
00:28:52,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I talked to her and here are some excerpts of this incredibly important interview.

433
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,000
The new year is a great time to take charge of your health and wellness.

The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

446
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
It really says that the state is God.

447
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on earth.

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000

Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

457
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000

460
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000

Coast to coast, direct from Austin.

477
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

478
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

479
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You want answers? Well so does he.

480
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

481
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,000
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

482
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Representative Susanna Grasha Hupp, former representative.

483
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
She's a survivor of the Luby's massacre. Some of her family was killed.

484
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,000
She famously testified before Congress to Chuck Schumer that, hey, our guns aren't for duck hunting.

485
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The full testimony is up at infoawards.com right now.

486
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
We just reposted it up there.

487
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
She said it's to protect us from you guys up there.

488
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,000
And I wanted to get her on the air because she was instrumental nationwide testifying before legislatures everywhere,

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
not just the Texas legislature that she later chaired committees on, to get concealed carry-in.

490
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And we've seen 25, 30% or more reductions in every state that's done it.

491
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So she'll be joining us to the bottom of the hour here in just a moment.

492
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Here is just a short excerpt of her testimony before Congress.

493
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The Second Amendment is not about duck hunting.

494
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
And I know I'm not going to make very many friends saying this.

495
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:41,000
But it's about all right, all of our right to be able to protect ourselves from all of you guys up there.

496
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Man, and boy, that was what back in the mid 1990s.

497
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And here we are in 2013. Great way to kick off the new year with a champion of liberty.

498
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Who, I've got to say, if any one person got concealed carry-in, you can say what you want about it turning a right into a privilege.

499
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The point is, is that it put guns on the street in law abiding citizens' hands and the criminals are keeping their heads down.

500
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Violent crime down over 20% nationwide on average since then.

501
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We've shown the new FBI statistics, except in areas where they've taken the guns, crime is up.

502
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Former representative, talk show host on 590 AM, you name it, best selling author.

503
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Mrs. Hupp, good to have you on with us.

504
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hey, happy new year to you, Alex.

505
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Wow, I am excited.

506
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:34,000
What's your take on everything that's happening and the open calls now and the Feinstein bill to physically make you turn guns in?

507
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
It's a scary thing, isn't it?

508
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,000
You know, I've talked to a lot of friends of mine who, we all kind of talk big, you know, you hear the from my cold, dead fingers comments.

509
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But the truth of the matter is, if a bunch of jackbooted thugs show up at my door and put a gun to my child's head and says,

510
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,000
turn over all your guns or else, I'm probably going to turn over my guns.

511
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You know, so I think it's really important and I think this is why so often revolutions are mostly about young people and young people without extended families.

512
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You know what I mean?

513
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
It's a scary world right now.

514
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
It certainly is.

515
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,000
But there's one hundred and sixty plus million gun owners.

516
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,000
If one percent fight back, that's one point five million soldiers.

517
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I agree.

518
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Most people are going to turn them in, at least in the first wave.

519
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
But the tyranny that follows is going to result in a civil war.

520
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And if you notice all the branding of Obama as the new Lincoln and how he's going to kick the butt of the states is pretty creepy.

521
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It is.

522
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's very frightening.

523
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And, you know, when I talk about people turning in their guns, I think there are an awful lot of people that are going out of their way to purchase guns that don't have a track record.

524
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
You know, that are that can't be traced to them.

525
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And those guns are going to be hidden and buried all over the place.

526
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
And, you know, we might be we might be some of those people.

527
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Alex, you and I are going to be the first doors that they knock on.

528
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
You're right.

529
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
They're going to try to make examples of people.

530
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Why do you think for listeners to just join us?

531
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
We have the club.

532
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Diane Feinstein and others are saying Mr.

533
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
And Mrs. America, get ready to turn your guns in.

534
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Why do I think she's doing that?

535
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I think because she's she's absolutely clear that she has the backing of the president and she now has, I would say, 70 percent of the media firmly behind her.

536
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I was I was actually sitting, getting a manicure a few days ago.

537
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And it was a lady kind of across from me, somebody I didn't know at all.

538
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
And she got to talk about the guns and the shooting in Connecticut.

539
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And she turned to me and said, well, I just think we should get rid of all the guns.

540
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What do you think?

541
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Of course, that was a mistake, right?

542
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
No, I took it very easy on her and I didn't tell her any of my background or anything.

543
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I said, well, you know, I've thought about it.

544
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:09,000
And it seems to me that not one single one of these mass shootings has ever occurred where guns were allowed.

545
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And she stopped and she kind of blinked and she got up and she went and washed her hands and then came back and sat down and looked at me.

546
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
She said, you know, I never thought about that, but you're right.

547
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,000
So I think I think there are an awful lot of people out there that you can't grab with statistics.

548
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You can't grab with with logic.

549
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:36,000
I think there are a lot of people out there that you have to put them in a position of being, you know, as close as you can,

550
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:44,000
put them mentally in the position of being completely helpless and then ask them if they would rather have somebody with them,

551
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
even if they choose not to have a gun, if they would rather have somebody with them that knows how to use one or not.

552
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,000
You know, even if they won't defend themselves, most people are willing to defend their child.

553
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
So I do my best to talk about that sort of thing.

554
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I know it's hard for you to talk about it, but you do to save other lives.

555
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And I've got to commend you again.

556
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
As you know, people can pull up the uniform crime statistics since concealed carry became ubiquitous in most states.

557
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Crime rates on average around 24 to 25 percent national.

558
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
It's only about 20 because of some of the gun free zones like Chicago and New York.

559
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:27,000
But the Luby's massacre was a mass murder that took place October 16th, 1991 in Killeen, Texas, United States,

560
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:36,000
when George Hennard crashed his pickup truck through the front window, got a band pickup trucks on a Luby's cafeteria and shot 50 people,

561
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,000
killing 23, exchanged shots with responding officers and then hid in a bathroom and fatally shot himself.

562
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
You were there. You lost your parents.

563
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I know it's tough to talk about, but we've now seen fathers that lost children in the last few shootings come out and say,

564
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,000
don't use this to take people's guns. But the media tries to ignore them.

565
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
You as a survivor, I mean, you more than anybody have a right to lay out the record.

566
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Can you, for people that don't know, describe what happened and what would have happened if you would have had a firearm?

567
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Well, to try to keep it brief for you folks, my parents and I, I was about 31 I think at the time, or I just dated myself.

568
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:24,000
My parents and I had gone to a local cafeteria and we were actually eating with the manager of the cafeteria.

569
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
The place was packed. It was Boss's Day. It was the day after payday, middle of the day, beautiful day.

570
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
And this guy drove his truck through the window.

571
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:43,000
It was a floor-to-ceiling window and crashed into a number of tables and came to a jerking halt pretty much in the middle of the restaurant.

572
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And, of course, you think it's an accident.

573
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And we began to rise up to go help people he had knocked over and we heard gunshots.

574
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I was on the passenger side of the vehicle and it was maybe 15 feet away from me.

575
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
My father and I immediately got down on the floor and put the table, turned the table up on its side in front of us.

576
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
My mom was down behind us.

577
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
And the shooting continued.

578
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I realized this was 1991 and these mass shootings weren't occurring back then, so it wasn't the first thing that comes to your mind.

579
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,000
We were waiting for him to say something like, all right, everybody put your wallets up on the table, or something like that.

580
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
But that didn't happen. He just kept shooting.

581
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,000
And when he worked his way around the front of the truck and he was working toward us, a full, I'm going to say 45 seconds had passed.

582
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And I realized he was just executing people.

583
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And it took 45 seconds.

584
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Alex, 45 seconds is an eternity.

585
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
When I did realize that I reached for my purse that had fallen on the floor next to me, I thought, I've got him.

586
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I've got this guy.

587
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:03,000
I used to carry a gun in my purse illegally because an assistant VA out of Houston that was a patient of mine convinced me to carry it illegally.

588
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
But I did like most people.

589
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You know, you think, eh, what are the odds?

590
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
If I need a gun, it's going to be if I break down on a back road somewhere.

591
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
It sure as heck is not going to be in a crowded restaurant in the middle of the day.

592
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,000
But my gun was 100 yards away in my car where I had begun dutifully leaving it.

593
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So long story short, at that point, my dad started to break free from my grip and said, I've got to do something.

594
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
I've got to do something. He's going to kill everybody in here.

595
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:40,000
And he made a run at the guy and the guy just turned and shot my father in the chest.

596
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Again, I apologize. I'm trying to make it a short story.

597
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
No, it's important. Thank you for sharing it.

598
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,000
We'll be right back with more of this powerful testimony from Susanna Hupp.

599
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'm Alex Jones.

You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.

629
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

630
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000

645
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Again, thanks for tuning in on the Sunday transmission.

646
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We're also here weekdays, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern.

647
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And of course, the website is infowars.com.

648
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Let's go back to this amazing testimony by Luby's Massacre survivor, Susanna Hupp.

649
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
The good news with that, my dad was mortally wounded.

650
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I mean, he had covered maybe half the distance, he was seven, eight feet from me.

651
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
But he was still alive.

652
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,000
The good thing about that was it made the gunman change directions and he had to go off to my left instead of continuing directly toward me.

653
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Somebody way at the back of the restaurant broke out one of the windows back there and began to escape through that window.

654
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
People were able to escape that way.

655
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
We were kind of up in the front corner and couldn't get out.

656
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
When I saw what I thought was the chance, the gunman had his back turned toward me.

657
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I stood up, I grabbed my mother by the shirt collar and said, come on, come on, we've got to run, we've got to get out of here.

658
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
And my feet grew wings.

659
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So, circle it back around, my mom did not follow me out and I didn't know that.

660
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Until after, literally, I was outside of the restaurant.

661
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
She was staying with your dad, wasn't she?

662
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
The police officers later told me what happened to her.

663
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:42,000
They said that, and a number of them were patients of mine, and they took me and my family to lunch about a week later and told us.

664
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:49,000
They said that when they got into the front, they saw a woman on her knees cradling a mortally wounded man.

665
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
And they didn't know who the gunman was.

666
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And they saw this 30-something-year-old man walk up to her, they said, he put a gun to her head, she looked up at him, put her head down, and he pulled the trigger.

667
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And they said all they had to do was fire a shot into the ceiling and this guy rabbited to a back bathroom alcove area.

668
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
As he said, exchanged a little gunfire with him and then put a bullet in his own head.

669
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,000
My parents had just had their 47th wedding anniversary a couple of weeks prior to this, and it just didn't occur to me while I was running.

670
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Mom, mom wasn't going anywhere without dad.

671
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So I was really angry, Alex. I was really, I was really angry. I felt very guilty.

672
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I was very angry, and I know people think I made this up later, but you can check that the newspapers from the second day, I said I was angry at my legislators,

673
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:40,000
because they have legislated me out of the right to protect myself and my family.

674
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
And you can say, well, Susanna, you could have missed.

675
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yeah, I could have. Your gun could have jammed.

676
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Well, okay, it's possible. It was a revolver, not likely, but it's possible.

677
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
But the one thing you can't argue with is it would have changed the odds.

678
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it is to sit there and wait for it to be your turn and having no way, no means of defending yourself.

679
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I can't imagine being in that position again and having my children or my grandchildren with me and having no way of defending them.

680
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Makes me physically ill.

681
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Well, we now have countless cases since you went public back in 91, 92, 93, where people have at churches and everywhere else stopped gunmen.

682
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Just happened down in San Antonio. It's just happened to other places just since the Sandy Hook shooting, and the media will not cover it nationally.

683
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:43,000
And we see these countless local news videos of gunmen coming in trying to shoot people for no reason at shops and concealed carry folks that know how to use them take them out.

684
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:52,000
And I see the gun grabbers rushing in to try to ban guns right now because they know the gun culture and the self-defense culture is taking over society.

685
00:50:52,000 --> 00:51:00,000
All the top rated TV shows, women out buying guns, liberal women's magazines show women with guns now.

686
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Not because they want guns, the liberal owners, but because they realize women have woken up.

687
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
They're losing. That's why they're launching this offensive against the Second Amendment.

688
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Can you elaborate on that statement? Do you agree or disagree?

689
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I agree with you, but I do think that they see an opportunity here because of the Connecticut shooting.

690
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You know, it's so hard for any of us to imagine that all those little children being just executed like that.

691
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
It's just, you want a way-

692
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
And they put the guilt onto us.

693
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Have you ever seen such demonization of gun owners where they say we're Klan, we're Nazis.

694
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:48,000
We helped kill those children when it was a gun-free zone and the media advertising crazies go to schools and kill people.

695
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
If anybody has blood on their hands, it's them.

696
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Isn't that the truth? That's something that I've advocated for for years is for teachers to be able to carry.

697
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And of course, here in Texas, individual schools can make that decision.

698
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,000
My school does not allow the teachers to carry, but I can tell you that I know a few that carry anyway.

699
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
They just keep their mouth shut and do it, thank God.

700
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
You know, the bad guys, I don't know why people don't get this.

701
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Bad guys like that want a high body bag count.

702
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,000
They're going to go where they think they can shoot as many people as possible without anybody shooting back at them.

703
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Nobody knows these cowards like you. No doubt your father saved your life.

704
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Nobody knows these evil people like you, Susanna Hupp, a survivor of the Libby's Massacre, are with us.

705
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And really, you know, the grandmother of the concealed carry movement, no doubt, not to use the term grandmother like she's old,

706
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:45,000
but she's the person that really started it, thank God, and saved countless lives.

707
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Why do these cowards always commit suicide as soon as the cops show up?

708
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I mean, it just shows they really are ghoulish demons, that they all act exactly the same.

709
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
You know, I'm trying to teach my children. I have two boys, 16 and 14.

710
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:09,000
And I think society, in general, tries to teach people that these bad guys are just misunderstood,

711
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
or they've had a hard life, or, you know, all the various sundry excuses that you can come up with for them.

712
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
I mean, I've actually literally had people asking me, why didn't you try to talk the guy down?

713
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Like, really? I mean, I can't even argue with that. It's such a stupid statement.

714
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Yeah, just shot your dad in the chest, and then you're going to go talk to him.

715
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Let me go talk to this guy about his childhood.

716
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,000
What I'm trying to teach my children is that, you know, there certainly are criminals.

717
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I would say the vast majority of criminals in the world that were created.

718
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
You know, they did have bad childhoods and whatnot.

719
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But there's also evil. I honestly believe there is absolute evil that exists in the world.

720
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,000
That's my next point.

721
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Have you noticed that with Son of Sam, Ramirez, the Night Stalker, Harrison Kleibold, Lanza,

722
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
and the guy that just shot the firefighters, they were all admitted devil worshippers.

723
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Shouldn't we be profiling them?

724
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I did not know that, but I'm not even slightly surprised.

725
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Okay, maybe mildly surprised, but not shocked.

726
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
How about that?

727
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It's incredible.

728
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Evil exists, and I believe that you must do your best to stand between evil and innocent evil.

729
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,000
And it doesn't mean, again, I want to make this clear because, you know,

730
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'll tell you what one of my biggest fears is, Alex.

731
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:35,000
One of my biggest fears is that I'm going to be in some position that I get shot and killed by a bad guy,

732
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
and I'm not able to get a round off for some reason.

733
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
And I'm so afraid that the other side is going to say, see, her gun didn't help her.

734
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And I've said it a million times, it's not a guarantee.

735
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It changes the odds.

736
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
It means you're not a helpless prey animal to be fed upon by devil worshippers and psychopaths.

737
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
At least I'm not going to be an easy target.

738
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I'm going to do my best.

739
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm going to do my best to bloody them.

740
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
You know, they might take me out, but I'm going to do my best to put them in the hospital at the very least.

741
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Everybody's going to know who the bad guy is.

742
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,000
You know, in the time we have here, because I know you've got to go, Shane,

743
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
maybe you can do five more minutes with us after the break to talk about your book,

744
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:18,000
which I need to carry at the Infowars online bookstore, because I know it's so important.

745
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
We all need to reach out to the dumbed-down people that really think turning their guns in is going to protect them.

746
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Looking at Dianne Feinstein, have you seen the testimony in Congress where she admits she has a concealed carry

747
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
but doesn't want you to be able to?

748
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I have seen written quotes from it, but I have not actually seen it, no.

749
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It's amazing, though.

750
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
How can they all have bodyguards and she can be worth $100 billion, but then we're not supposed to have guns?

751
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I remember being on CNN or one of those shows when Rosie O'Donnell,

752
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:55,000
there had been some incident with one of her adopted children, a bodyguard protected the child.

753
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You know, and I went on the air and said she must be horribly, horribly, feel awfully silly at the moment,

754
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,000
because she's telling all of us to disarm, and most of us don't have the kind of money

755
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
that we can hire personal bodyguards for our kids, and she must be terribly embarrassed.

756
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
But I feel that way pretty much about Feinstein and most of them.

757
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,000
It's just an elitist attitude. It's okay for me, but it's not for you, because I don't trust you.

758
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Well, if you notice, I've even got Christian Science Monitor admitting,

759
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I have an article that our government's trying to restrict free speech online and going the way of China.

760
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
I've got an article after you leave us we're going to go over where top Georgetown professors saying,

761
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
yeah, go ahead and kill old people, death panels.

762
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I mean, they're not just going after the Second Amendment.

763
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Do you see it as a big canary in the coal mine that they are this open and brazen right now?

764
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Here's what I really think, Alex.

765
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I don't think Obama is the problem. I don't think Feinstein is the problem.

766
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I honestly believe that our public education system is the problem,

767
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:03,000
because those are the people that are growing up to run for office that think socialism and Marxism is a good thing.

768
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
They're the ones that grow up and vote for the Obamas and the Feinstein's.

769
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:17,000
So I truly believe, you know, you and I tend to attack this and a lot of partisans tend to attack this at the top.

770
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
You know, we have to get so-and-so out of office or into office.

771
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And I really hope that the problem is down in the school system.

772
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
All right, folks, that's all we've got time for with Susanna Hupp.

773
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,000
We're going to go to break and start the second hour with special reports.

774
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.

775
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And, yes, ladies and gentlemen, we discovered her.

776
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,000
We found her identity, the Obama phone lady.

777
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Obama got us a phone. He's going to do more.

778
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
That's right. I had her in studio last week.

779
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
That's coming up as well.

780
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

781
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

782
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

783
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.

784
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

785
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
We've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

786
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The Ktor Hand Crank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.

787
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Strategic Relocation Third Edition by Joel Skousen.

788
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000

789
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.

790
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Hand Crank Shortwave AM-FM radios.

791
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000

We're getting prepared. Are you? InfoWarsShop.com.

794
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy

795
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,000
and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy?

796
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

797
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:11,000
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

798
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,000
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote,

799
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

800
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.

801
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

802
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000

Coast to coast, direct from Austin.

808
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

809
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.

810
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Our reporters went out on the streets of Austin to get people's take on the attempted gun ban.

811
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm here to not only talk about voting no on some of the legislation that is loosening up registration and re-registration of gun owners,

812
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
but more importantly to ban assault weapons.

813
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:42,000
An assault weapon is a weapon full automatic.

814
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's allowed only the military and the police.

815
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
It's only for the military and police and for a special trust where you can buy a class-free weapon.

816
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I don't think that taking away a person's right to bear arms is the answer, but I do believe that there should be restrictions.

817
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I have a clean record, so technically I could go to a gun show and purchase as many guns as I want to, have them in my house.

818
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
I have a four-year-old daughter. Why should I have an assault rifle?

819
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,000
A gun show, a shooting range, you never see mass shootings there.

820
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
There's all kinds of ammo and guns and people walking all around them.

821
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Yeah, I don't support the assault weapon ban.

822
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,000
What I do believe is a good alternative would be like my colleague here mentioned,

823
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:32,000
is strong restrictions when it comes to evaluating the people's mental health, psychiatrist's exam or something.

824
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Now what about in China where a gentleman I believe is around the same time slash 20 children with a knife,

825
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
what do you say to people who may bring that up?

826
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Well, I can tell you that I'm a citizen of America, and in America we're a civilized people,

827
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
and as civilized people we need to set our own rules in place to govern our country.

828
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
What do you say to people who say, well, maybe the Sandy Hook guy had a gun but this guy had a knife?

829
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
A person with a knife is a lot easier to subdue.

830
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
What do you think about gun-free zones at schools?

831
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Oh, free massacre zone.

832
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Say the principal had a gun in her office, would she have had time to even pull it out, take off the safety and use it?

833
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And to that extent, so I don't think that's a good argument.

834
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
How long do they have to wait until someone got there to stop this guy?

835
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Because no one in this quote-unquote safe school zone or no gun zone was there to defend the children.

836
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Obama's kids, they go to a school with 11 guards.

837
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Now besides assault weapons, are you for any other type of legislation such as banning high-capacity magazines

838
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
or certain types of ammunition, anything like that?

839
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes, but I think the core of it is to get rid of the weapons.

840
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
People say they don't want you to have more than 10 rounds in your magazine.

841
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You know, it's just another incremental step.

842
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,000
I mean, okay, is it 10 rounds a day? Is it five rounds next week?

843
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
One of the alternatives I really, really would push for would be raising the price on bullets,

844
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
raising the price on bullets, raising the taxes on bullets.

845
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Okay, you realize that a deer rifle or an AR-15 are basically the same thing, just one looks spookier than the other?

846
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Well, it should be a weapon that shoots one bullet at a time.

847
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
The federal government recently just spent, you know, just purchased 1.6 billion.

848
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
I believe it was in the past calendar year.

849
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Well, if it's the federal government purchasing it, then it's probably going to go to our law enforcement.

850
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I think that's something that our law enforcement people need.

851
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Not too long ago, the Empire State Building, where the police opened fire on one guy

852
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
and hit eight or nine other people who were not their intended target.

853
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So what do you say to that?

854
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Well, I mean, we can have no comment on that.

855
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Don't you want to defend yourself against tyranny?

856
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yes, sir, I do.

857
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Somebody that wants you put down like this, wants to make you a slave,

858
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
isn't that the freedom of the Second Amendment?

859
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
No, as far as the Second Amendment, it has the right to a well-regulated militia.

860
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Do you think a well-regulated militia could use something like assault weapons?

861
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
And the Second Amendment is the right to bear arms.

862
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And it also has for a well-regulated militia, that's also in there as well, miss.

863
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Well, it's our military is our militia, not our common everyday citizens.

864
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Now, sir, there are people out there that say,

865
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,000
why do you need a semiautomatic rifle such as the one allegedly used in the Sandy Hook shooting?

866
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Well, just once again, it's not about my need, it's about my right.

867
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
If I can ask you a question talking about the blood of children on our hands,

868
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
the Obama administration, and it went back to Bush as well,

869
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
had something called Operation Fast and Furious

870
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
where they gave fully automatic weapons to Mexican drug cartels.

871
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Now, they said it was a sting operation,

872
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
but it was used to kill a Border Patrol agent, policemen, as well as other children.

873
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Do you think anybody should be held accountable for that?

874
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Okay, I'm not going to comment on that.

875
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
When seconds count, police are only minutes away.

876
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
And I carry a 1911 because the police was too heavy.

877
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
Now that we have moved into the winter season,

878
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

879
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

880
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,000
by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

881
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano silver solutions,

882
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
our 2-ounce nano silver nasal applicators,

883
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
as well as our all-natural silver soaps.

884
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

885
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents,

886
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

887
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel

888
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

889
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin

890
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
while delivering the silver more effectively.

891
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000

892
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000

That's www.silverlungs.com.

895
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
From the front lines of the Information Ward,

896
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
it's Alex Jones.

897
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now the top story

898
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
at mfullwars.com and drudgereport.com.

899
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
With the video, we played it earlier,

900
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
White House threatens executive orders on guns.

901
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
I told you that was coming.

902
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Larry Pratt, executive director of Gunners of America, told you that.

903
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
There have been a lot of tweets sent out

904
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
calling for my death, calling for Larry Pratt's death,

905
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
calling for Wayne LaPierre's death at the NRA.

906
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
They say we killed the children.

907
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
They say it's our fault.

908
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I guess we killed the people that died

909
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
or been injured in that big ferry crash.

910
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
We've got to ban ferries now.

911
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Bad things happen.

912
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
There's 7.5 billion people in the world or close to it.

913
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
315 million here.

914
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
They wave the bloody shirt of 20 poor dead children

915
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
who we pray for and their families

916
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,000
and then tell us we did it.

917
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
When they're the ones that made them victim disarmament zones.

918
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
And I told you, they're going to use an executive order.

919
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
The ATF last year started telling gun shops what to do outside law

920
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and they told them, hey, don't argue.

921
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
When he's reelected, we'll do whatever we want.

922
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I talked to multiple gun show people

923
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,000
in Tennessee, in Arizona, in California, and Austin.

924
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
We broke that they were being given memos

925
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
and they said, well, there's no law.

926
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,000
This law didn't pass.

927
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
They said, well, you do what we say or we're going to shut you down.

928
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We found an eye that wasn't dotted, literally.

929
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
And now when you go in to do your background,

930
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
it's all put in a computer.

931
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
When you call the feds, it's all computerized.

932
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You're already registered.

933
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,000
They're now saying they're going to physically take the semi-autos.

934
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Like Dianne Feinstein said,

935
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Mr. and Mrs. America, get ready to turn your guns in.

936
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
That's a quote.

937
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And then Piers Morgan says, I don't want your guns.

938
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I just want you to turn all these in.

939
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
And then I get angry at him.

940
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
And then he says, I'm dangerous and shouldn't have guns

941
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
when I have no criminal record.

942
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
And then the next night, last night,

943
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
and the man we're about to talk to is scheduled to be under tonight,

944
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Larry Pratt.

945
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Piers Morgan doesn't have a big audience,

946
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
but when it's a gun debate, it goes in all the other news

947
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
and tens of millions, probably a hundred million.

948
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,000
I mean, this is the biggest story in the last two days

949
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
is what I did with Piers Morgan.

950
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And that wasn't my full plan.

951
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
It was part of it.

952
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
If he pulled bull, I was going to get in his face

953
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
because all he ever does is bully people.

954
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
So I gave him his own medicine back

955
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
and put him on notice because I realized what Ron Paul said last hour.

956
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
He said, the line in the sand is the guns.

957
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
There will be a revolution.

958
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,000
He agreed with me.

959
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
If they come to take the guns, it will happen.

960
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Folks, I don't want this to happen.

961
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm not planning to physically resist.

962
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I'm a media person.

963
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I'm a general.

964
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Okay.

965
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
They're going to use this to purge and persecute gun owners.

966
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
And it is going to be an unmitigated nightmare for police and military

967
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
who even if you try to carry it out, I mean, it's a death sentence.

968
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,000
And that's the globalist plan.

969
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,000
They've been preparing for this and police are like, you're right.

970
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
If this happens, it's going to be horrible, but they wouldn't dare.

971
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Yes, they will.

972
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
And they're getting it ready for another executive order

973
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,000
where the next mass shooting, you know, will happen with all their hyping.

974
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
And now we have them saying, Larry, I called you this morning to get you on

975
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
when you were driving into work.

976
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Have you had a chance to see the CNN clip now

977
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
where the host and his two guests talk about shooting me

978
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and agree it's okay as long as they wear a uniform?

979
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Alec, I haven't had a chance to even look at a clock.

980
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
I've been so nonstop.

981
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,000
But I'll tell you what, you were just discussing this executive order.

982
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:36,000
That is something that I believe I might have even talked about on your show

983
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
because you've been nice enough to have me on so many times.

984
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But sometime well into last year, it occurred to me,

985
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
these guys don't have the votes in Congress.

986
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
And after the election, it was clear they didn't have the votes in Congress

987
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
for the next Congress either.

988
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
But Obama has shown by what he's done in other areas, such as immigration,

989
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
he'll just bloody well do what he wants

990
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
and issue an executive order against the law, against the Constitution.

991
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Hey, when you're socializing the country,

992
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
what's a few broken laws here and there?

993
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
They were only put on the books by a bunch of dead people

994
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
that aren't here anymore.

995
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
It's our country now, and I want it because I got elected.

996
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And so I think he believes he might have been elected king,

997
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
although even the British king has far less power than what he's presuming.

998
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But I saw what they would do.

999
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
If you assume the guy is lawless, then you don't have to be a prophet,

1000
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
and I'm not a prophet, but I could see that that would be, for him,

1001
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
the course of least resistance.

1002
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
That's where his water would flow, if you will.

1003
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And he's doing it.

1004
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Well, I had Ron Paul on, and you just heard me basically paraphrase what he said.

1005
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
He agreed that they want a civil war.

1006
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
They know what they're doing.

1007
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,000
If they think they're going to get 160 million gun owners to turn their guns in,

1008
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
there will be a percentage that's not going to go along with it.

1009
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Well, it's very, very, very critical that if anything bad comes down,

1010
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
that it be very clear that it was the government initiating violence.

1011
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Remember Lexington and Concord.

1012
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
That day's battle was started by the British

1013
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
because I think his name was Preston or Prescott.

1014
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
The captain on Lexington Green said,

1015
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Hold your fire until fired upon.

1016
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And if I recall correctly, there were a couple of guys that died almost immediately

1017
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
following that order because the British did fire first.

1018
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Yeah, quite a few of them, but that gave them the moral high ground.

1019
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:52,000
And I think it's absolutely essential that we hold our fire,

1020
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,000
that we even be willing to perhaps be the first one down

1021
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:05,000
because we are in a war of ideas, a monster culture clash,

1022
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
and it's absolutely essential that we be perceived as the law-abiding ones,

1023
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
as the lawful ones.

1024
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:18,000
We need to make it understandable that there are two kinds of rebels.

1025
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
There's the rebel who goes out in the mountains on his own

1026
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
and is out there kind of like Robin Hood shooting people.

1027
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And then there's the rebel that comes with a badge.

1028
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:35,000
If either one of them are acting outside the law, that makes them a rebel.

1029
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
And I know the statists of our time can't get it through their head

1030
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
that they could be the rebels.

1031
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,000
But the Constitution was put up to strictly limit what the federal government can do.

1032
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Well, that's profound what you said.

1033
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
When Lenin took over and then Stalin, they were rebels,

1034
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:57,000
and they even call us counterrevolutionaries.

1035
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:01,000
That's what Bill Ayers and Obama in his training, they know they're the rebels.

1036
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
That's why they operate like this and are buying 1.6 billion bullets

1037
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,000
and armored vehicles and demonizing real Americans,

1038
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
because they are an occupying rebel enemy force against the Republic.

1039
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And you're absolutely right.

1040
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
So we need to remember the Battle of Lexington.

1041
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,000
It ultimately went very poorly for the British that day

1042
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
because our guys insisted that the moral high ground be theirs.

1043
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
And that may take a lot more courage than would be needed to go

1044
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
and hide behind a rock and shoot, which they did later in the day.

1045
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But to stand there at first naked against the British ball

1046
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000
that was coming down at them out of those muskets, that was real courage.

1047
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But they knew why they were there.

1048
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:57,000
In fact, their preacher had preached on that the Sunday before,

1049
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
and he was there with them because he believed as much as they did

1050
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
what he'd been preaching about.

1051
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I believe he died.

1052
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I don't remember that, but that's entirely possible

1053
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
because it was not a fun day for either side.

1054
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The British ultimately lost about a quarter to a third

1055
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,000
of their entire regiment that they sent out, some 800 guys.

1056
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Not that many made it back.

1057
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,000
And more importantly, we were able to get to London

1058
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,000
ahead of the British couriers and point out what had happened

1059
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
and who had fired first, and that it was this oppressive government

1060
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that we'd been hollering about for four and six years in formal petitions,

1061
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,000
petitions of right, bills of right, all those kinds of things

1062
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:45,000
were going over to the British mainland, being published in their newspapers,

1063
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
and then it finally came to that.

1064
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,000
And so I think we have to remember that history,

1065
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,000
the history that's not being taught in our government schools,

1066
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
but our forefathers did it right, and God willing, we'll do it right.

1067
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Yes, sir.

1068
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
We'll do it right.

1069
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
We'll be right back with the conclusion of our important interview

1070
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:31,000

1090
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000

1091
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000

There's no priming required.

1097
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Filter from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

1098
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

1099
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Save money by not buying bottled water

1100
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

1101
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
ProPure is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

1102
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It's what my family uses.

1109

1118
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
such as stress, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and other harmful pathogens.

1119
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies

1120
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
of harmful bacteria at several hundred times the effectiveness

1121
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1122
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,000
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

1123
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000

Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.

1137
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

1138
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:17,000
I can't believe we're to the point that we're having to talk about 1775, 1776.

1139
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I mean, this is not a joke.

1140
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
I had you on a few weeks ago and I said,

1141
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
from all I've seen, this will be the greatest assault ever.

1142
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
And you said it's shaping up to be that.

1143
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Undoubtedly now, Larry Pratt, of gunowners.org,

1144
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
this is clearly the greatest assault ever.

1145
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Certainly in my lifetime.

1146
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
For a while I've been comparing it to Columbine,

1147
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
but I'm beginning to think that they are much bolder than they were even back in Columbine.

1148
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And one of the guys here made a suggestion which I still think could well be the case

1149
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:54,000
and that is they've overreached what Dianne Feinstein has proposed in her legislation

1150
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:00,000
is so far beyond what she, excuse me, got enacted in 94.

1151
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:06,000
That they're essentially, with a few exceptions, coming for it all.

1152
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Her much-vaunted statement after she'd enacted her quote-unquote limited gun ban of 1994

1153
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:19,000
was, well, I just didn't have the votes, otherwise I'd have said, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.

1154
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Well, we know what her objectives are, so we shouldn't be fooled.

1155
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,000
She's told us.

1156
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
And she's now indicating that she wants more.

1157
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Now, I think she's getting greedy and I think we can use that against her.

1158
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Without money, guarantee you, Alex, none of these jaspers here inside the Beltway are volunteers.

1159
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
They're extremely well paid.

1160
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I'm sure that 99% of your listeners would love to have what this 1% that works here in the government class is being paid.

1161
01:21:52,000 --> 01:22:00,000
So, this is definitely something that can be solved partially by money.

1162
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:09,000
If we can get around the Speaker of the House who is like a downed tank blocking a bridge

1163
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
and if somehow we can build another bridge or get him off the bridge in some way,

1164
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:20,000
then I think we could actually enact a spending measure that had a proviso in it.

1165
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
None of these funds may be used for the implementation of executive order, whatever it might be.

1166
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Well, sure, go ahead.

1167
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
They're out of gas at that point.

1168
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,000
You have always, again, been a very measured, calm person, and I'm like that in private.

1169
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:40,000
When I get wound up, I get very, very upset and did that with Piers Morgan because he's always been a bully.

1170
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I was not going to let him bully me, so I just basically dominated him.

1171
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But I want to play you a clip here because this is what was said last night amongst other things.

1172
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:55,000
They said they hope my children don't end up dead, and then there was this.

1173
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
So, I'm going to play it for you now.

1174
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Piers Morgan and guests discuss shooting.

1175
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Alex Jones, Daily Beast writer Buzz Bissinger says Piers Morgan should pop Alex Jones with a semi-automatic weapon.

1176
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Then Huntsman's daughter, Abby Huntsman of the Huffington Post, says I'd love to see that laughter in a uniform.

1177
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Piers Morgan, I'd borrow my brother's uniform, who reportedly is an Army officer.

1178
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So, I guess if it's a uniform, it's okay.

1179
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I want to play this clip and get your take on it.

1180
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Here it is.

1181
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
But what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for?

1182
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,000
The only reason I think you need it is, Piers, challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match.

1183
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him.

1184
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I'd love to see that.

1185
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
In uniform.

1186
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I'll borrow my brother's uniform.

1187
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
That's enough.

1188
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I'll borrow my brother's uniform.

1189
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,000
And then there was talk of, I hope my children don't get killed.

1190
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I mean, this is entering a whole other level of Creekville.

1191
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
What they did there is reveal the heart of the leftist.

1192
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
The leftist is about force.

1193
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:02,000
They're about imposing their righteousness on us slubs that don't know what's good for

1194
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
us.

1195
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
And it's such a delightful topic to talk about offing some loudmouth like Alex Jones.

1196
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
That'll teach those pumpkins a thing or two, won't it?

1197
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
I guess it will.

1198
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
My children were there watching when their deaths were being discussed.

1199
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I mean, they're clearly trying to terrorize the entire American people with these shootings.

1200
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
While they're horrible, statistically it's one of the rarest forms of death.

1201
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Right.

1202
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Along with our general murder rate, which is declining.

1203
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And I was just looking at something happily.

1204
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,000
My son Eric pulled something up that's quite good.

1205
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:41,000
There's an under-reporting of murder data in England, which is always held up as the

1206
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,000
country that's so wonderful compared to ours.

1207
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
British crime, I'm quoting from the finding.

1208
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Reporting tactics keep murder rates artificially low.

1209
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,000
And then this is a quote from a report from the Inspectorate of Constabulary.

1210
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Suppose that three men kill a woman during an argument outside a bar.

1211
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
They are arrested for murder, but because of problems with identification, quote, the

1212
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
main witness is dead.

1213
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Charges are eventually dropped.

1214
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,000
In American crime statistics, the event counts as a three person homicide.

1215
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
But in British statistics, it counts as nothing at all.

1216
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
And then the report is quoted directly here.

1217
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:24,000
With such differences, this is British, 2000.

1218
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
With such differences in reporting criteria, comparisons of US homicide rates with British

1219
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
homicide rates is a sham.

1220
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,000
That's the British cop group, the Inspectorate of Constabulary.

1221
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Well, can I have that headline?

1222
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Because I've got the Telegraph and others admitting that they're the crime capital of

1223
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Europe.

1224
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Portland has the lowest crime rate in the world because, of course, they have more guns.

1225
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But you can just type in Britain or England, the crime capital of Europe.

1226
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
People are beat, stabbed, you name it.

1227
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,000
But yeah, I read all the time where if you fist fight someone raping your wife at busting

1228
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
your house, they throw the book at you.

1229
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You know, the farmer who'd been robbed three times defending himself and they threw him

1230
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,000
in prison.

1231
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I mean-

1232
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:15,000
They probably give some condoms to the guy that was raping your wife and tell him to

1233
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
clean up his act.

1234
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Amazing.

1235
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I know.

1236
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I mean, but see, that's on purpose.

1237
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
They want-

1238
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
That's a criminal government trying to team up with the criminals.

1239
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Why do they love crime-ridden cities run by mafias?

1240
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Well, because we're then terrorized and we must depend all the more for our, quote, protection

1241
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:39,000
on the very authorities that have put us into that predicament to begin with.

1242
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
And I don't know whether they're accepting it in England, although it is, as the Telegraph

1243
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:51,000
said two days after that Piers Morgan interview, it is the fourth most violent country in the

1244
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
world.

1245
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Violent crime, which would include murder, but also rape and everything else that's-

1246
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
And that's with watered down numbers, because I've seen those numbers before that they just

1247
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
let murder- I mean, they don't even investigate when they come to your house and you and your

1248
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
wife are chopped up.

1249
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I mean, it's just like you could have the neighbor running around with a hand in their

1250
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
hand of a chopped off person.

1251
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
They just say, oh, no big deal.

1252
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Right.

1253
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
They do not believe in self-defense.

1254
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:22,000
That farmer who was infamous up in the little town of Norfolk in England had, after like

1255
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
the third home invasion by the same Gypsy gang members that had been terrorizing the

1256
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:34,000
whole area, he shot one of them in the dark of night who was coming up the stairs, actually

1257
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
shot both of them and killed one of them.

1258
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
And for that, they gave him a life sentence, which now he's out of jail because happily

1259
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
British public opinion finally focused on that outrage.

1260
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
And see, that's what scares me is that I'm still a young man, 38, but I've got aches

1261
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:57,000
and pains and things and problems now from a life of action.

1262
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I can't imagine once I get old and all I can depend on is the gun.

1263
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I mean, if two guys are coming up my stairs, I'm going to get so angry, even if they're

1264
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
pretty tough, I can probably deal with them.

1265
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
But not when I'm 65, 70, I need that firearm.

1266
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:17,000
And more and more now, I mean, as I get older, more and more, I try to avoid physical stuff.

1267
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It's just natural.

1268
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:24,000
We need to equalize things for the infirm, the old, the women, handicap.

1269
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I mean, the real liberal thing to do is to arm women.

1270
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Exactly.

1271
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Exactly.

1272
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:37,000
And to make it so that unarmed children can be protected by their teachers, the janitors,

1273
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:44,000
whatever, in schools rather than insist for now 20 years that if we just say no guns at

1274
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:45,000
schools, everything will be fine.

1275
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Well, everything is not fine.

1276
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:51,000
That's where most of our, in fact, that's where all of our mass murders have occurred

1277
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,000
in whatever kind of gun-

1278
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
I hope you can get that out tonight with Piers Morgan.

1279
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
