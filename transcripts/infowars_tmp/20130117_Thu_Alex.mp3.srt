1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the Resistance.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Aaron Dykes here for InfoWars.com.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Obviously, I'm outraged just about the use of executive orders themselves.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's very abusive of constitutional powers.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The fact that he has bragged through his aides to the media, in Reuters, that he's going to act without Congress.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's even more outrageous that he staged this press conference, exploiting children, bringing them on stage with him.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The same Obama who fake cried over the Sandy Hook shooting.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The same Obama who released the White House photo, showing him looking distraught.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The same Obama who lied about the entire bin Laden account, a staged photo of the Situation Room.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Supposedly watching the raid.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The same Obama administration lying about Benghazi.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
But worse than that is the actual actions taken in those executive orders.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And Obama's not even done with 23 of them.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He's still going to ask Congress to reinstate the assault weapons ban and do even more.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Now remember the words of Obama's first chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, now mayor of the murder capital of the world, who also wants gun control.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He said, never let a good crisis go to waste.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's an opportunity to do something you couldn't do before.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And what I mean by that is it's an opportunity to do things that you think you could not do before.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now it's on record the Obama administration has been pursuing gun control all along.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I did a top ten list of the actions of his previous administration.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Also, Senator Feinstein was amassing legislation to re-institute the assault weapons ban at the time of the election.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And they were waiting to use the appropriate crisis that became Sandy Hook.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So let's just remember they always wanted to exploit a good crisis and that's what we've seen now.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
With that in mind, at least two of Obama's executive orders on gun control institute a brainwashing mentality.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Remember that Eric Holder, attorney general, said in 1995 he wants to brainwash the American public on guns the way they did with cigarettes.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And here inside those 23 executive orders are two political campaign propaganda points.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
One to launch a national safe and responsible gun ownership campaign.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And another to have a national dialogue on mental health with Kathleen Sebelius, the head of Health and Human Services.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And Arn Duncan, the education secretary.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Now Obama, of course, has announced he's looking for ways to act without Congress,

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
without having to even ask for permission to infringe upon the uninfringable second amendment of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
With that said, look at how he's exploited health care in his executive orders.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here it is in the weekly standard, Obama asked doctors to help deal with guns.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And he reminds them in several different executive orders, as many as seven executive orders can be put in this category,

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
where he reminds doctors that they're able to report on suspicious activity.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They're able to ask their patients if they own guns and if they have guns in their homes.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They're able to flag people for threats against, for violent threats, report them to authorities.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And what they're doing is building a mental health database flagging people for potentially unstable behavior.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Obviously we don't want crazed people going out in society and shooting up crowds of people.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
At the same time, we want to maintain due process and we don't want to create a snitch culture where the entire Obamacare apparatus is used to spy upon Americans,

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
which is all dangerous for the sake that we've seen what they do with the terror watch list.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Once you get on it, it doesn't matter if you've ever done anything wrong, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to get off that list.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And we've been told more lists are coming. Rahm Emanuel said in this clip, no fly, no buy.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you're on that no fly list, your access to the right to bear arms is canceled because you're not part of the American family.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He was at the Brady Center and said his number one priority was to get people on a no buy gun list, that you lose that right.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That was under the context of terrorism, but it's going to apply to mental health as well.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And we've seen Chuck Schumer in the Senate and others already trying to introduce that legislation.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, the 17th day of January 2013. We're going to go to break and come back.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a full mobilization by the federal government under foreign control to absolutely go hysterical and attack the Second Amendment at every level, including extra judicially.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All of these everywhere, this is just one up at Infowars.com, are announcing that they're going to lean like the mafia on gun dealers, gun manufacturers, you name it.

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We'll be right back. Stay with us.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000

You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future.

73
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Not a future that will be but one that might be.

74
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is not a new world. It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.

77
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The answer to 1984 is 1776.

80
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

81
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We are gold.

82
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We are launch.

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It is the 17th day of January 2013.

84
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And while we're busy watching the globalists go after our guns, they are stealing $85 billion of taxpayer money a month and giving it to the six private mega crime syndicate banks who are offshore and tax free.

85
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
$85 billion a month for derivatives.

86
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
$85 billion they created.

87
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey, instead of going to jail, you just get the taxpayer money and get to run everything.

88
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Same thing in Europe.

89
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And ladies and gentlemen, we've got some incredibly serious news to report here for you.

90
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What we're facing is mafia tactics.

91
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I wrote an article this morning with Paul Joseph Watson that just went up at Infowars.com that goes over all of this.

92
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Philadelphia mayor declares economic warfare on gun retailers.

93
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But it isn't just this mayor.

94
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's a bunch of other mayors.

95
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And there's a people like Chuck Schumer and people like Rahm Emanuel and Dianne Feinstein and Michael Moore and Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden who've all been calling for what Bloomberg's done, suing gun manufacturers, suing gun dealers, suing gun shops.

96
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now they're just saying we're going to pull city investment funds out of any companies and we're going to harass gun shops and we're going to do all this.

97
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I mean, it's mafia.

98
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you don't go along with us, it's called good old fashioned muscle.

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You ever seen Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas based on a true story?

100
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That is exactly how these big city crime machines work, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

101
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They are oily gangsters involved in all sorts of crimes, but they're above the law because they run the system and they want the people disarmed, period.

102
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And we have President Obama in yesterday's speech, we have a video up at Infowars.com, we break all this down, titled President Obama responds to Alex Jones.

103
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's clearly what he's doing.

104
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And others say, hey, there's no tyranny.

105
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We're not coming after your guns.

106
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The people that are saying that just want to make money.

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Unbelievable.

108
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Remember, this is the guy saying he would never come after our guns.

109
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Here's that clip.

110
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This will be difficult.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:02,000
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.

112
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue for themselves.

113
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can to block any common sense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.

114
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're a liar.

115
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's it.

116
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The only way we will be able to...

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The only way is for the, quote, supporters, conservatives to stand up and do the right thing.

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And I'll get it done for you because you asked for it, little kids.

119
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
High five.

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The most exploitive garbage I've ever seen.

121
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Totally transparent.

122
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't let a good crisis go to waste.

123
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now, we now have the 23 executive orders, and it is an unbelievable nightmare.

124
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Natural News does an analysis.

125
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Aaron Dykes does an analysis.

126
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's all up at infowars.com.

127
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And our auxiliary site, if you can't get to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.

128
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And we've got a clip of this.

129
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Mayor, we're going to play in a moment, but they're saying, listen, we're going to shut down your businesses one way or another.

130
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Unless you do gun buybacks every year and a half, two years, which they've always done gun buybacks in the news worldwide before they then register, before they confiscate.

131
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I mean, they've taken guns worldwide.

132
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
They've taken guns everywhere these big city crime bosses run things.

133
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
So we know their goal.

134
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I mean, they've introduced bills to do it before.

135
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They've said our goal is civilian abolition of firearms ownership.

136
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's the UN Unity or Treaty.

137
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And those of us that are informed and actually read and know how the world works, we're going, hey, Lemmings, wake up.

138
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
They're coming with the guns.

139
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Shut up, conspiracy theorist.

140
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The government told me it's reasonable for the kids.

141
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And we're like, hey, mobsters, we know you want our guns.

142
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's right, Mac.

143
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
We're going to get them.

144
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's what's so frustrating about this is they still play this game.

145
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We just want some reasonable stuff.

146
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And then just like the Obama health care plan, a bunch of these executive orders and the bills they've now introduced are nebulous.

147
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like, yeah, it's up to the ATF discretion.

148
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You come in and register them and we may do a forced buyback.

149
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I know a big deal, though.

150
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It says in Feinstein's bill, it's the chief one that they're trying to pass.

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We've read it on air, written articles about it.

152
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's been national news.

153
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It says, just as a footnote, and we may do a forced buyback too.

154
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Never mind about that.

155
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But this gives us that power.

156
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
We're like, hey, this bill has death panels, says it'll double the premiums and will bankrupt everything.

157
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's a takeover health care plan.

158
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Shut up, conspiracy theorist.

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Doesn't say that.

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah, here's a subsection right here.

161
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
No, it doesn't.

162
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They pass it.

163
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, of course there's death panels.

164
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Of course we're going to double your premiums.

165
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I promise no payroll tax will go up, no other capital gains tax.

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Nothing will go up on anybody making under a quarter million a year.

167
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Capital gains tax for everybody went up.

168
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There's a total investment tax, almost 4% on top of everything else.

169
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's on after-earned money.

170
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Unbelievable.

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Totally unconstitutional.

172
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Payroll tax, 3.8 on average.

173
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I keep going here if you want me to.

174
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Everybody knows you're getting your paychecks now.

175
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I mean, people are real mad.

176
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
In the last three days, most people get paid every two weeks.

177
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You got your first two weeks.

178
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Most people got their first two weeks.

179
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Some of them are going to be getting them today.

180
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, people are mad.

181
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm already seeing it, people.

182
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The tweets are going out.

183
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
People got their check this morning and they're like, what is this?

184
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is this?

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, and everybody.

186
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
All the major chains, all the big stores are announcing.

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Nobody gets 40 hours anymore except the manager.

188
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Everybody else gets 25 because Obamacare kicks in above 29 hours.

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
And that way, if you get a couple hours overtime, it doesn't go over 29.

190
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Boom.

191
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And people are like, what's going on?

192
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What happened?

193
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But see, they're going to say unemployment is going to go down because they'll count each new job as new people.

194
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
This is how the mafia operates.

195
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So the average person is going to get two or three jobs now.

196
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
They're going to go, look, there's more people getting hired.

197
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Just cook that number.

198
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Real unemployment is above 20%.

199
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Every major economist has said that for four years.

200
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They say, hey, you know what, unemployment is down at eight something.

201
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's all about these are gangsters.

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's just like in Goodfellas where the mobsters are in the bar beating people up, not paying their $5,000 tabs for parties.

203
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The owner says something, so the one out of control gangster beats him up.

204
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
This is based on a true story.

205
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's such a good gangster movie because they were all convicted of this in court when one of the major crime families got brought down.

206
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A guy read the book back at the time when it came out like in 1990.

207
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I was so impressed by Scorsese's movie.

208
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I think it's his best movie.

209
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But the point is that they go to the head gangster and go, we'll just take over my business so he won't keep robbing me.

210
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
So he goes, okay.

211
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
And then they take everything.

212
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
They leverage out the business with all this debt that they put on him and then take everything he's got on top of it.

213
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I mean, they're gangsters, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, all these guys, if you watch how they act, their histories, what they do, the deaths around them, they're Goodfellas.

214
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And they're going, oh, look, we got the kid right here, a nice little kid.

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hey, little Sammy, I'm going to take the guns for you, kid.

216
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
All right, go around the back there.

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I got three dresses for you.

218
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
She goes and looks and sees guys getting ready to kill her.

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No, I don't think I'll take the dresses.

220
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, no, don't be a conspiracy theorist.

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
They don't believe people to warn you about me.

222
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You want to get in business with me.

223
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm going to take care of you.

224
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I mean, and then look, I'm up here.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Nobody else has got the nerve going.

226
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Listen, criminal gangsters, I know you're a tyrant.

227
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You're a scum.

228
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And Obama is responding.

229
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The Washington Times goes, I hate to quote, you know, the conspiracy nutball, Alex Jones,

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
but this is tyranny.

231
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I got an article.

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I mean, even the Washington Times can't come out and call this tyranny when it's staring

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
at you in your face.

234
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
People are like, I don't know if these are Goodfellas.

235
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't know.

236
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
They might have.

237
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Really, you don't know?

238
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You don't know?

239
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
These are Goodfellas with nuclear weapons.

240
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
These are Goodfellas with the big red one.

241
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
These are Goodfellas that control our military, the drones, everything, and only a full understanding

242
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
they're pure criminals will stop them.

243
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And by the way, that's already happened.

244
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Congress has a 9% approval rating.

245
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Obama needs this gun thing as a fight where he can restrict guns while making us, he's

246
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
on the offense.

247
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
See, he's been on the defense.

248
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He's gone on offense now where we've got to go defend the Second Amendment while they

249
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
loot 85 billion a month, just one of the dozens of ways they're robbing us, while they pass

250
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
more regulations that shut us down, while they ship more jobs taxpayer paid for overseas,

251
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
while all this, while the total meltdown happens, while the federal regulations, home inspectors

252
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,880
roll out, power plants being shut down, massive layoffs, they're going to push for total amnesty.

253
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,080
Republicans are saying they're going to go for it because they're bought and paid for

254
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,400
by the same foreign banks, the real mafia dons.

255
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,080
Obama and people are just regional capos.

256
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
That's all they are.

257
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
They're capos.

258
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,040
You take the mafia analogy, that is not an analogy, that's what they are.

259
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,040
The command structure, National Security Council, all of it, they just happen to be a mafia

260
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,920
of perverts and scum and pedophiles.

261
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,760
I mean, they're just the worst of the worst of the worst.

262
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,320
The globalists don't let you in unless you are nasty.

263
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,720
Little parties with kids, women is always coming out devil worship ceremonies with Dominique

264
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,880
Strauss-Kahn and a bunch of hookers and a bunch of world leaders.

265
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
That's nothing.

266
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,280
That's like, okay, you go and have orgies with hookers, with 200 people, we might trust

267
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,280
you.

268
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,320
Okay, you rape a kid, we'll start to trust you.

269
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,880
Now, shoot that kid in the head.

270
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,640
It's like all gangs, they have initiations.

271
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Go knock that old lady in the head, you're a made member of the Crips.

272
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,680
We've got a group of vicious criminals running this country, and I've got the nerve to tell

273
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,440
them they're criminals because I'm not going to be their slave.

274
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,160
They knew Texas would stand up to them, they've profiled America, they've tried to take over

275
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,240
Texas before, they know it ain't going to happen.

276
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?

277
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,280
From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the

278
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,680
family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

279
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,380
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

280
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,560
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's

281
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,100
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

282
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,640
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

283
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,440
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

284
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
and niece.

285
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,240
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

286
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,480

293
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,280
Hi, I'm Pastor Ginny, and that was the state I was in back in 2010.

294
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,240
Then I learned about RNA drops.

295
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,940
I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called junk is actually packed with millions

296
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,680
of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling how my cells, organs, and other

297
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,840
tissues behave.

298
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,840
I learned I don't have to put up with disease decay or decline like I've been conditioned

299
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,840
to believe.

300
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,640
I began taking RNA drops, a 100% natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide

301
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,800
me with amazing health and joy.

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

315
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,200
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

316
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
IRAs?

317
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,280
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

318
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,960
of gold for your retirement.

319
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,440
Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

320
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,440

323
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,400
Feeling like there are too many pressures and demands on you?

324
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Losing sleep?

325
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Worrying about tests and schoolwork?

326
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,400

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:14,440
You can clearly see tomorrow, and yesterday, today.

337
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:25,360
Cyrus Jones from 1810 to 1913, made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to a hundred and three.

338
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm going to be honest with you, the whole radio crew, we just spontaneously locked hands

339
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,880
and prayed to God for guidance and protection in these times.

340
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,800
The globalists have dug our grave, they've dug America's grave.

341
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:52,080
They want us to be an example of a nanny state tyranny worldwide, not a beacon of freedom.

342
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,640
And they will wrap themselves around those little children.

343
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,120
They will use them as their front to sell evil.

344
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,200
And those of us that have discernment are completely freaked out by what's happening.

345
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:12,040
It is not fun to have to face down these gangsters, but it's what has to be done.

346
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,740
No king but King Jesus.

347
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:16,520
We are not going to bow down to these tyrants.

348
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,840
These are horrible people that know the vaccines are killing people.

349
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,040
Obama says, we haven't given any solutions to the killing, which they probably conducted.

350
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,120
The evidence is pretty damning, especially in Colorado.

351
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,720
We know they staged other mass shootings, Operation Gladio in Europe.

352
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,240
We know they staged Fast and Furious that killed thousands, so they're prime suspects.

353
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,720
But they know full well every one of the real mass shooters was through cultural copycatting,

354
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,600
where they put mass shootings in all these movies.

355
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,440
The last Tom Cruise movie had one in it, came out right on time.

356
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,120
The media hypes it constantly.

357
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,200
They do these drills everywhere in every town and city, getting it into everybody's mind.

358
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,020
Where when there are unstable people on serotonin reuptake inhibitors, that the insert says

359
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,080
makes you engage in homicidal mass murder activity.

360
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,400
I mean, we've shown you the inserts, they all say the same thing.

361
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,680
Paxil, Luvox, Prozac, I mean, I don't wanna get into any names, but I've had friends who

362
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,240
had a divorce or whatever.

363
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,800
And they said, okay, you're having trouble doing whatever, we're gonna put you on Xanax.

364
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,960
And they just turned into complete zombies.

365
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,760
I've known people put on Luvox and stuff who just are totally screwed up.

366
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,320
And I knew instantly, a few months ago, we had a cop killed in years, thank God, here

367
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,340
in Austin, that a guy for no reason just walked up and shot a cop in a Walmart.

368
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,920
They said the guy was walking around like a zombie with a gun, and in the first reports

369
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,720
he just shot a cop who responded in cold blood.

370
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,320
And it turned out he was on a bunch of Xanax, I mean, this is a no brainer.

371
00:26:51,320 --> 00:27:01,400
And then Obama gets up there on television and says, hey, it's these gun owners, they're

372
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,400
the problem.

373
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,800
It's these gun manufacturers, these gun sellers, and we're gonna lean on them till they shut

374
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,080
down or stop selling semi-autos.

375
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,240
And then I'm watching CNN right before the show starts, we have it on to monitor enemy

376
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,240
transmissions.

377
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,880
And then another police chief on there going, we need to ban all the handguns, they're coming

378
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,880
for everything.

379
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,960
And they're gonna use the full weight of Homeland Security, now admitted, I had their manuals

380
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
years ago.

381
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,840
People are like, how did you know, Alex, that they were gonna use Homeland Security as an

382
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,440
anti-gun agency?

383
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,920
Because they've been training for it, they're just unveiling it now.

384
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,240
It's like in the old days, in World War I, World War II, they'd show a big ship being

385
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
built.

386
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:39,640
It'd be behind these big curtains in a giant dock, in a giant dry dock, and they'd pull

387
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,800
back the curtain with the press, with the film cameras rolling.

388
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,960
And then they'd cut these big ropes, and then all of a sudden, or they'd have explosives

389
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,480
detonate, and these big rocks would fall down, and the big ship would slide into the water.

390
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,200
I mean, they just pulled back, I mean, there's a big ship behind there, I've been behind

391
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
there.

392
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,200
They've done it over and over again, their blueprint, they're coming for our guns.

393
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,720
Uh-oh, here we go, boom, pull back the curtain, the ship's now gone on the water, it's on.

394
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,920
And Paul Watson is such a prodigious writer.

395
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,060
The mayor predicts Waco-style standoff in response to Obama gun confiscation.

396
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,480
It's not going to end well.

397
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,480
And that's the Gloversville mayor, Dayton King, yeah, they're gonna call us terrorists.

398
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,600
They've been telling police, we're going to get the guns, when they fight back, they're

399
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
terrorists.

400
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,760
And you go to the urban warfare drills, I've been to countless ones, this is a long-term

401
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,720
project to the globalist.

402
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,640
Getting units of police and military ready, most of them have been compartmentalized,

403
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,640
aren't part of it.

404
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,440
I've seen the footage in my police state films with guys that look like my farming relatives.

405
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,960
John Deere hats, overalls, they'll even have kids with them in the drills.

406
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,980
And they kill them, they practice killing farming people, okay?

407
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:51,820
And I mean, I'm no rocket scientist, but when the Army and the Marine Corps have been training

408
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:59,760
for at least 15 years that I know to take on Hank Williams Jr., cuz we can skin a buck,

409
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,980
we can run a trot line, we live back in the woods, you see, with the woman, the kid, and

410
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:10,840
the dogs and me, we say grace, we say amen.

411
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,160
And if you don't like it, well, we're not gonna go along with it.

412
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,560
You can't starve us out and you can't make us run, and that's the target of a foreign

413
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,040
banking takeover.

414
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,440
They're in New York, Chicago places, they see all the yuppies, all the soft scared people,

415
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,540
they're like, good, we got control of this.

416
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:31,680
But they see Americans going, we know you're criminals, we know you're globalist.

417
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,260
They're telling the cops there's no New World Order, nobody's coming for the guns, there's

418
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,880
no Federal Reserve.

419
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,280
Now there is a Federal Reserve, we are run by foreign banks, we are in a world government,

420
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,880
and those that don't accept it are terrorists.

421
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,480
And they got all these TV shows where the founding fathers are terrorists on television.

422
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,520
We got the sheriff coming up in Kentucky standing up to this.

423
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,200
We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

424
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:02,280
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

425
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:07,120
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

426
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,700
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

427
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,580
by a disastrous economy?

428
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,280

00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,200

430
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,000
life storm by having a supply of food on hand.

431
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,560
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

432
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,360
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

433
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
and niece.

434
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,160
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

435
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,400
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

436
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,760

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

442
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,080
A prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

443
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,120
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

444
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
to the global takeover.

445
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,120

459
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:06,280
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

460
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,680
Don't be one of them.

461
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,440
Protect yourself with Supernatural Silver, a revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial

462

solution.

463
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,240

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,000
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

470
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,120
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

471
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,800
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

472
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,640
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

475
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:29,480
Well, a few days ago, it was very touching to our viewers and listeners.

476
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:44,400
We played some clips of a county meeting that Sheriff of Jackson County, Denny Payman, was

477
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
at.

478
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,120
He was at the public meeting and he said, look, I would be ashamed if our founders were

479
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,240
here who fought so hard and gave so much up so that we would have the birthright of the

480
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Second Amendment.

481
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,240
I would be ashamed that we're even discussing this.

482
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,560
And that's absolutely right.

483
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,960
That's the perspective of an informed American.

484
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,520
But then you get all these globalist, all these corporate front men up there all over

485
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
television.

486
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,080
I was just back there during the break monitoring CNN and they're like saying again, we've got

487
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,680
to take the handguns too.

488
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,960
We got to take everything.

489
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,960
We've got mayors and we've got US senators like Chuck Schumer saying we'll just have

490
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
audits.

491
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
We'll just harass.

492
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:32,400
We'll just shut down outside of law gun shops unless you only sell single shots.

493
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,600
And we have clips of that.

494
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,120
We have all these articles up at Infowars.com right now, Philadelphia mayor declares economic

495
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:45,440
warfare on gun rights, financial terrorism, firearms sellers to be blackmailed into conforming

496
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
to gun control.

497
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:52,200
I mean, this is just Goodfellas mafia tactics.

498
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,240
They want a confrontation.

499
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:57,280
They've been training for it, especially since Obama got in.

500
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,240
They've been trying to federalize the police.

501
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,160
Police sent us the training manuals, Mayak on land security saying gun owners, veterans,

502
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,400
conservatives, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters that we were quote terrorist and the number

503
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,920
one terror threat.

504
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,160
Remember that three and a half years ago?

505
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,600
Well, now they're just going public with that and they want this confrontation.

506
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:25,080
Mayor Bloomberg told Obama yesterday, he said defy Congress executive orders make people

507
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,560
turn them in now.

508
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,200
And then here is another key report before we go to the sheriff.

509
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,400
This is also up at Infowars.com.

510
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,680
Mayor predicts Waco style standoff in response to Obama gun confiscation, expressing his

511
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,920
opinion to the New York SAFE Act, Gloversville Mayor Dayton King has just sensationally warned

512
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,040
that any federal gun confiscation program could lead to Waco style standoff in rural

513
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,560
areas of America.

514
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,560
And we're going to be going over that and I want to get that mayor on ASAP.

515
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:02,360
The point is, there are so many old veterans I know especially who understand tyranny,

516
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,080
and they are not giving up their birthright.

517
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,500
And again, most police chiefs and people are constitutionalist.

518
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,500
They're good men and women.

519
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:14,200
But a lot of them, the state police and others were gonna follow orders and it is going to

520
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
cause a civil war.

521
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
I had Ron Paul on last week, outgoing congressman.

522
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,900
He said, yeah, it's the line in the sand.

523
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:24,880
He said, undoubtedly, he knows they're gonna start raising taxes and things too.

524
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,600
There's gonna be tax rebellions.

525
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,200
And he said, when they come for the guns, it's going to kick off a war.

526
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,480
And they're gonna call us terrorist, okay?

527
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,200
Now me, I'm not here saying I'm offensively gonna do anything, I'm a radio talk show host.

528
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,960
I'm not trying to be macho, I don't want a war, but I'm telling you something.

529
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,480
They're gonna start it and we're gonna finish it.

530
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,480
That's where this is going.

531
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,320
I wanna take you now to Jackson County Sheriff Denny Payman.

532
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,400
He was the first sheriff, now it is dozens of them.

533
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Rand Paul vows to torpedo Obama executive orders, so we're gonna fight peacefully.

534
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,120
They know we're gonna beat them peacefully.

535
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,440
That's why they're trying to say, we're just gonna go shut things down if we feel like

536
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
it.

537
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,920
Lawlessly, I mean, this government is crazy.

538
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,400
These so-called liberals are a bunch of authoritarian freaks.

539
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,200
I've studied history, they did this in Russia and Germany and folk.

540
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,080
The Germans did this to the Jews in their businesses, just outside of law started harassing

541
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
them.

542
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,860
And folks, I mean, this is not gonna go well.

543
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,480
Many more sheriffs vow not to enforce federal gun laws.

544
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,760
Oregon law enforcers lead national fight against Obama gun grab.

545
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,320
We've got Texas sheriffs doing it.

546
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,320
We've got congressmen from Texas saying they're gonna start impeachment.

547
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,520
I had Toth on yesterday, the state rep, and the legislature's racing, he's talking to

548
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
the attorney general.

549
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,920
They're gonna pass law saying you can't do that in Texas.

550
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,280
And that's constitutional.

551
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:46,760
So I'm gonna move now to Jackson County Sheriff Denny Payment.

552
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,180
I wanted to give him that briefing, I know he's probably aware of all this, and talk

553
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,160
to him because he's the first to go public.

554
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,680
And sir, why were you the first to stand up from the great state of Kentucky and all 50

555
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,880
states and say that you're not gonna be involved in gun confiscation?

556
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:11,080
Because it dealt with my county, it dealt with the people that I have swore to protect.

557
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:17,000
It was, when I first got word of a friend of mine came in and showed me what Obama would

558
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
say and what he had said, and he said, man, what would you say to that?

559
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,240
And I said, we're not gonna do it.

560
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
He said, would you say that public?

561
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,280
And I said, yeah, I believe that, we're gonna stand by that, I'm not gonna disarm my people

562
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,200
because they need these guns for protection because it is their second amendment right

563
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,720
to have guns and I'm not gonna have the government come in and tell us, no, you're not.

564
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,760
And so that's where it started.

565
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,520
Can you elaborate because it's very touching, it sounds like you're about to break down

566
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,480
but you controlled yourself.

567
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,480
When you talked about the founding fathers, it sounds like you know about that history

568
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
a little bit.

569
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,400
Can you repeat what you said to your constituents?

570
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:59,560
Yes, I stood there, and this is an emotional topic for me because of the price that other

571
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,340
people paid that we take for granted to flippantly talk about these issues when it's something

572
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,200
that really doesn't even deserve to be talked about, it should already be taken care of.

573
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,320
And it's something that I was, we were in this meeting and I said that I was embarrassed

574
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,920
to have to be at a meeting like that and I was ashamed if our forefathers were to be

575
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,280
able to see and to hear what we were talking about and what the government is doing now,

576
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,280
how would they feel knowing what the price that they paid that we could have this freedom

577
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,720
and how we were just letting the government, which they designed the constitution for us.

578
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,280
They designed the second amendment for us to protect us and we sit back and just let

579
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
them push back and mold that however they want.

580
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,040
That's like taking the Bible and let's just say either you believe it or you don't, but

581
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,000
let's say you take it and you mold it to suit you and that's usually what people do.

582
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,520
That's the same thing they're doing with the constitution.

583
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,100
They're just going to mold that, they're going to tweak that, they're going to use it other

584
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,960
than what it was meant for to suit their purposes, their desires for the direction that they

585
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
wanted to go.

586
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,960
I know you've seen the FBI crime statistics that are gathered from all communities, some

587
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,680
of the most accurate government statistics out there, 21% violent crime reduction the

588
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,660
last 16 years.

589
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,540
Most of that dropped since 2007 and then I saw the number at fbi.gov.

590
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:26,560
In the last 20 years, a 49% drop in crimes using firearms.

591
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,520
Anybody can go look these numbers up and what's amazing is that the mainstream media will

592
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,360
not talk about that and they don't want the big secret that is gun ownership has skyrocketed.

593
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,240
Violent crime has gone down because criminals are scared to death to home invade or car

594
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,200
jack now except in areas run by these big city mayors where they've taken the guns.

595
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,200
That's exactly right and that's what I've told people and that's what as we talk here,

596
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,080
I mean we're living in a rural area and sometimes just 30, 45 minutes before I can respond to

597
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,540
somebody on our north end of our county, but they're calling me and they're talking on

598
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,680
a cell phone and how can I disarm somebody when I tell them I'm 30 minutes away and there's

599
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,720
two guys kicking their front door at 2 o'clock in the morning and they just woke out of a

600
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,280
sleep and they're depending on me to get there while these guys are coming into their house.

601
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,040
I would much rather them have a handgun, a weapon of some kind, not necessarily a handgun,

602
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,400
it could be an AK-47, I really don't care, as long as they can protect what's theirs

603
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,640
and protect themselves.

604
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,600
What's happening right now is all they've done is just paint this a different color,

605
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,480
all they've done is to crack the door a little bit to see what they can push through later.

606
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,400
They've crammed these apples down our throat and now they won't go so now they're going

607
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,600
to paint them, they're going to put something else on them, some caramel and try to cram

608
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,160
them again and that's what the people, I can only speak for the people in my county and

609
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,400
the people I'm responsible for, half our county are better, packs guns daily.

610
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,280
We don't have shootings and stuff here, we had a shooting here not long ago where a guy

611
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,480
was stealing a guy's stuff and he shot him.

612
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,320
We've had guys, other people that were shot, but we don't have guys go kicking doors on

613
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,960
people they know are armed.

614
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,880
Well that's right, in fact, where I live in Austin, the only place that you see people

615
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:18,520
getting robbed is mainly the illegal immigrant communities because folks know they're likely

616
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,000
to not have guns and so the criminals feed on them.

617
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,080
Home invasions, I've seen the national crime maps, I know you've seen them, it's almost

618
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,960
non-existent carjackings, home invasions.

619
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,960
People don't walk up in Texas in most areas, try to rob somebody in a shopping market parking

620
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,080
lot because most folks are packing a gun in their purse, even if it's a woman.

621
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,200
And then I read about Chicago in New York, Chicago, 530 something deaths last year of

622
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,920
citizens being fed on and they have a total gun ban for the citizens in the city and wonder

623
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,240
why every criminal in the country goes there because it's their happy hunting ground.

624
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,280
Yeah, it's free, it's free food there, you know, it's a free lunch and that's like here

625
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,520
or anywhere else, you know, just like in the shooting inside the theater.

626
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,680
What if everybody was armed in there, do you think the guy would have come in?

627
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,000
No, you know, and if he would have come in, how many would he have got?

628
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,560
I'm pushing here to arm our teachers because if I'm sitting at the bottom of the hill,

629
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,120
which from our high school, and they call me and say, Denny, he's coming in the room,

630
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,560
I've got 30 seconds to get up there, get in the room, he's already killed 30 students.

631
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,880
But if I have a teacher up there, he walks through the door, he can take him out as he

632
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
walks through the door.

633
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,080
How many people are gonna be doing school shootings?

634
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,880
They're not because there's no glory and just getting shot walking in with the glory is

635
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,840
how many they left dead.

636
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,400
Well we need to profile these people.

637
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,880
I've done a study of it and I know police have as well.

638
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,480
Almost every shooter, Harris, Kleibold, the Batman guy was into the occult, the guy that

639
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,840
killed his mom with a hammer and then got the illegal AR-15 cuz he was a felon.

640
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,840
Why was he out of jail?

641
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,760
He was a devil worshiper.

642
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Lanza was reportedly a Satanist, that's mainstream news.

643
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:55,760
They are goth.

644
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,480
I'm not saying all goths are bad, the point is they are goth, Satanist, into shoot them

645
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,120
up video games who were in the psychiatric system on psychotropic drugs in almost every

646
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,120
case.

647
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,600
I mean the drug insert, Sheriff, says it can make you do this.

648
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,720
Why didn't Obama mention not putting unstable people on Prozac?

649
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,360
Exactly, exactly.

650
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:21,200
They don't want it, just like if there is a shooting, just like the shooting in West

651
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,440
Virginia that was big, it was blown up, they don't talk about the shooting where a guy

652
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:29,560
came on and only shot two people and then they go back and check these guys as to why

653
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,800
they were doing it in the first place and find out that they were raised in these video

654
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,000
games that did desensitize them to that so when they're in that shooting mode they're

655
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,240
just playing another game.

656
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,240
It's incredible.

657
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,160
I want to bring up what the mayor was talking about.

658
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,240
I read you that headline here.

659
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,360
Mayor predicts Waco's call standoff in response to Obama gun confiscation.

660
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:57,200
I mean they knew when they put all these psychiatric drugs in schools and then made them victim

661
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,880
disarmament zones, there'd be shootings.

662
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,880
This stuff didn't go on until the 80s and 90s, even though overall crime's going down,

663
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,520
violent crime, this is going up because the media hypes it, there's mentally ill people,

664
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,720
there's these video game head Satanists.

665
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,960
This is really cool and fun for them to go and do this.

666
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440
What do you think's going to happen, Sheriff?

667
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,820
And again, the sheriff from Jackson County, Kentucky, Denny Paiman joins us.

668
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:27,560
What do you think's going to happen if they give state police the order to, okay, we've

669
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:34,920
got undercover reports that this guy out here's got 15 guns and he's a veteran, he's refused

670
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:35,920
to turn them in.

671
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,240
What's going to happen when they go to try to take the guns?

672
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,080
And then let's say the first 100 people turn their guns in, if you've got 160 million gun

673
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:50,680
owners and 1% refuse to turn them in, that's 1,600,000 people that are going to fight back.

674
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,000
What do you think is going to happen there, Sheriff?

675
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,760
I think that they're going to have a civil war on their hands because I know people well

676
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,560
enough, they're going to go bury whatever guns they have, they're going to hide them,

677
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,840
they're going to put them, but they're going to put them with their easy access for them,

678
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,720
and they're going to come say, I searched my place, take whatever, but when it comes

679
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,200
right down to taking it from their hand, it will never happen.

680
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:15,040
These people will fight back because people will fight over a lot of things, but the number

681
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,320
one thing they will fight over is their firearm because they know that is their last, very

682
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,080
last line of defense.

683
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,560
If you've got a guy 60 years old that's a veteran, and he's crippled up from his service,

684
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:32,160
what he's done, and that's all his last line of defense, that's what he's going to do.

685
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,600
He's going to fight you for it.

686
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,800
So what do you think the social engineers are thinking?

687
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,200
I mean, Ron Paul, everybody said what you said, and then I told Piers Morgan, you're

688
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,160
going to start 1776 again, and he spun it like I'm saying I want that.

689
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,940
That's the last thing I want, but they're pushing and pushing, I guess they think they're

690
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,400
going to be able to initiate this, they're already saying Obama's going to be the new

691
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:59,560
Lincoln, and he'll crush the states, I mean I think these people are on megalomaniac power

692
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,560
trips.

693
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,200
Yes, what it is, it's a bully tactic, and what they're going to do is they're going

694
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:08,320
to bully first, you know, verbally, then they're going to try and stretch their muscle a little

695
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,720
bit to see, because they think, you know, they've got all these trained troops and stuff,

696
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,920
but I'll tell you what, there's more people trained here than what we have in our full

697
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:16,920
military.

698
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,160
In the United States, there's more people that are trained that shoot, casual shooters,

699
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,320
people that, you know, and they're going to fight back, and once, I'll tell you something,

700
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,400
once this started, I've looked at a lot of people here lately and talked to a lot of

701
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,120
people, they've got the look in their eye, I've had enough, they're not going to take

702
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,120
this too.

703
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:41,680
You know, everybody, our employment is down, I mean, up to where people aren't employed,

704
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,560
prices are high, people are thinking, you know what, what do I care?

705
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,560
When they go to try to take somebody's gun, they're going to have more than a civil war

706
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:50,560
on their hands.

707
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,200
It'll be so much worse than what it ever was before, because, you know, and here, if you've

708
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:01,240
got, say, just in any part of the United States that you come in and you isolate an area and

709
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,360
try to get the guns, the wars are not going to start there, but the American people will

710
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
come to you.

711
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,200
The support that I've got just over the United States from fellow officers, retired officers,

712
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:16,680
veterans, all these people that are coming together right now, they're all willing to

713
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,680
fight.

714
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,960
Wow, you've really done your homework.

715
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,240
Because what you're saying is absolutely historical, and here's the thing, we don't want this,

716
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:30,400
but they've taken our sovereignty, they say our military's under NATO UN control, they

717
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,120
tell Congress that's their face, Obama's shutting down power plants everywhere, power prices

718
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
are exploding.

719
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,920
To wreck America, he paid to ship General Motors to China, 22 billion, this is economic

720
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,880
warfare, to shut us down, to put us on welfare, to domesticate us.

721
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,500
And they brag and say that, and Americans know that, and they know everything's been

722
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,500
taken from us.

723
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,360
Obama said it five years ago in a secret meeting with his million dollar donors.

724
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,640
He said they're bitter clingers, but don't worry, I'll get them in the second term.

725
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,020
They call us bitter clingers, they hate us cuz we love God, they hate us, and they've

726
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,760
taken everything from us.

727
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,680
All we've got's our guns left in our Bibles, and now they're taking our churches, saying

728
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,240
the Catholic Church and others are gonna have to pay for abortions, these people are crazy.

729
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:22,160
Yes, they are, and there's not the same blood that runs through them as it runs through

730
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,480
the rest of the core of America, it's not the same blood.

731
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:34,320
They'll find out what that color of that blood is, cuz they've showed it before.

732
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,120
That's right, so again, Sheriff, it sounds like you've really done a lot of historical

733
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,120
research.

734
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,600
I know the police I've interviewed, except for maybe former Sheriff Richard Mack.

735
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,420
You are the most informed about history, cuz everything you're saying is exactly how it's

736
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,920
gonna go down.

737
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,920
Is there any way to stop it?

738
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,520
No, even biblically, they're looking into, a lot of stuff is gonna come to pass.

739
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,920
But even the stuff that came to pass, they didn't lay down.

740
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,520
And does it mean come to pass, does that mean in our generation or the next year?

741
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,200
We're only responsible to take care of ourselves and the next generation.

742
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,640
It's the next generation's responsibility to take it there.

743
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,480
Everybody's talking about these different things, the end times, all that kind of stuff.

744
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,040
It could have been end times in the 60s, but people fought back.

745
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,960
It could have been in the 70s or 80s, but now we're in 2000.

746
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,760
Only God knows the exact time that he will return.

747
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,760
Wow.

748
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,600
No, it's like Nineveh got 100 year reprieve, you're right.

749
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,880
God helps those that helps themselves, he gave us a brain.

750
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,880
Yeah.

751
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,720
Yeah, I mean, we could have, I mean, the whole, I mean, this could have all been over a thousand

752
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,720
years ago.

753
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:49,080
It could have been over 200 years ago, but he also gives in man the freedom, the freedom

754
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,640
and the desire to do what's right.

755
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,080
Well, I'm in, God bless you, Sheriff.

756
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,760
One more segment with you, Jackson County Sheriff, Denny Payman.

757
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,240
This is the kind of sheriff we need in every county in this country.

758
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,000
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

759
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,960
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

760
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Here's why.

761
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:17,280
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators

762
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,680
run quietly, emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun.

763
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:25,120
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

764
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,720
Now here's the best part.

765
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,400
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

766
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:36,600
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of

767
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,600
each year.

768
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,320
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

769
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:46,520
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

770
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,080
Don't wait, they go fast.

774
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,000
where to go and who to trust.

806
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:24,600
Jackson County Sheriff hailing from Kentucky, Denny Payment is our guest.

807
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,360
You can hear his historical understanding of this.

808
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:33,000
I mean, when I look at the oily mafia types, the anti-gunners and their statements they're

809
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,520
making about, we'll just shut your gun shop down without a law.

810
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,320
We're just gonna, I mean, I'm gonna play some of these clips in the next hour.

811
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,880
I can't believe they're moving this fast.

812
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,880
Sheriff, what is your gut that their game plan is?

813
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,280
We know it's a full out assault, Homeland Security is now not for Al-Qaeda, it's for

814
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,280
the American people.

815
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,080
They're saying that it's for conservatives, libertarians.

816
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:57,920
What do you think in your gut is their full game plan and what they're planning?

817
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,560
What it is is that I feel is what they're doing now is they're gonna see what the American

818
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
people will tolerate.

819
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,920
They're kind of trying to crack the door a little bit, they're gonna throw some stuff

820
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
out.

821
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,840
They're throwing stuff out that we're gonna balk at, we're gonna balk and they're gonna

822
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:14,600
pull back and they'll say, okay, let's just try and find a medium here.

823
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,960
We'll give some, you give some and everybody's gonna be happy.

824
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,000
What the American people are gonna do is they're gonna give some and all they were gonna do

825
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,160
is they're setting the people up when they kick the door, they come in and take it all.

826
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:29,080
Because once you've been set up and you will compromise on the Second Amendment, if you

827
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,880
will compromise on any of that, then you've compromised on it all.

828
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,940
And that's what they're gambling, that we'll compromise.

829
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:38,520
If we don't compromise, they're not gonna know what to do then because they're gambling

830
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:42,920
that if we compromise, they can get the door cracked enough that they can get in that way.

831
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,920
But if we don't let them get in or let them get started, they're not gonna know what to

832
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,920
do next.

833
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,400
They also run the risk of being too over the top, I mean, I've got clips coming up, I'm

834
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,240
sure you're seeing this as well, I know you're busy.

835
00:55:53,240 --> 00:56:01,160
But they're on CNBC, CNN, MSNBC saying, quote, our presidents beat Hitler, they can beat

836
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
the gun owners.

837
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,280
That's a Bob Shafer quote CBS, no, my grandfathers beat Hitler, not presidents and certainly

838
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,720
not Obama.

839
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:15,160
And they're saying it's like South Africa, that's embargoing the racist and gun owners

840
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,160
are Klan members.

841
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:20,200
I mean, it's so over the top to say gun owners killed those kids.

842
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,600
They're trying to put the guilt on us.

843
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:25,480
I say we get on the offensive and point out they're the ones that made schools victim

844
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,240
disarmament zones.

845
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:29,760
Because if we don't get on the offensive, we're gonna lose it.

846
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,600
Well, what I'm finding in these little tea party groups, liberal groups, patriot groups,

847
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:42,320
what I'm finding, I used to see back in the 70s, 60s, 70s, they're more of the redneck,

848
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:47,960
they're more of the working man, you know what I'm saying, where it was gonna be kind

849
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,600
of stereotyping, all these gun owners are all hillbillies.

850
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,320
What I'm seeing now is I'm seeing judges, I'm seeing legislators, I'm seeing educated

851
00:56:58,320 --> 00:56:59,320
people.

852
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:06,840
The thing has changed dramatically, you still see a blend of people, but it's an upper,

853
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,160
I mean, you're talking people that are in places of power and control that can help

854
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,280
and can do something.

855
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:16,600
You just said it, we've got Congress people, we've got judges, we've got police chiefs,

856
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:21,560
sheriffs, it's a leadership core, just like leading up to 1775.

857
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,800
And the establishment better understand that, there's going to be organized at governmental

858
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,760
level resistance to this.

859
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,440
Yeah, but what they're betting that at that level it's gonna be taken care of, but it's

860
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:34,440
not.

861
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,440
It's still gonna take a cross of every American that packs a gun.

862
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,160
And just like for the people that don't pack a gun when this all comes down, they better

863
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:46,620
be standing close to somebody who does because they're gonna need protection too.

864
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:52,120
Well look at the economy, the derivatives, we're totally bankrupt by design, 50 million

865
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:58,360
people on food stamps, all these big cities run by these crime bosses are collapsing.

866
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:02,260
And then when everybody runs to the rural areas, I mean, we're not turning our guns

867
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,400
in so we can be gang raped.

868
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,080
Right, exactly.

869
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:11,760
You know, this is like they talk about the assault weapons and stuff.

870
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:16,000
I've got one, I've had one, I've had them for years, and I'm gonna continue to keep

871
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
them.

872
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Why?

873
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
No, I don't go out and play with them.

874
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,240
It's probably been two years since I've even fired some of them, but you know, I keep them.

875
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,240
Why do I keep them?

876
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,040
I keep them for my protection, and that's what other people are keeping theirs for,

877
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
for protection.

878
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,760
You don't turn in your protection.

879
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:38,200
If you've got 50 people rushing your farmhouse or planning to loot you, you need an AR-15.

Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

896
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:12,800
You want answers?

897
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,920
Well, so does he.

898
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:19,080
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

899
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:24,440
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

900
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,640
Anybody ask out there why the Republicans' leadership are going along with open borders,

901
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:32,840
gun control, all this stuff?

902
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:36,880
It's because most of the big guys are involved in insider trading, and that's come out, and

903
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,040
it's all illegal.

904
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,360
So they passed a law making it legal, which you can't really do, saying it's a law making

905
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:48,080
it illegal, but they just go get a ethics board to say it's okay.

906
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,980
I mean, it is incredible.

907
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,800
The Democrats are the kings of this, but they are a bunch of gangsters.

908
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,800
I've studied them.

909
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,120
We've put the evidence on here on air.

910
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,880
And criminals don't want people armed.

911
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,440
Good people want good people armed, cuz good people know criminals are gonna have weapons

912
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
regardless.

913
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Might as well have the good guys with the guns.

914
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,520
Like the NRA has said, we have the amazing sheriff of Jackson County, Kentucky, Denny

915
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,400
payment, if you wanna find out more about it, jacksoncountykentucky.us, and go to the

916
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:15,400
sheriff's department.

917
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,200
But, sir, you were telling me, we've only got four minutes left, about the support you're

918
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,200
getting.

919
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,880
Talk about that, and then talk about some of the real solutions, cuz Obama said pro-gun

920
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,360
people have given no solutions, which is a lie.

921
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,640
We've given the only solution that's gonna work, because what it is, is that everybody,

922
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:38,360
all down through history, they figure out a way to, from bullying to attacks to whatever,

923
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,920
to take what they want.

924
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:44,640
And here's what's been happening here for so long.

925
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,600
But what Americans have forgotten is how to fight back.

926
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,480
We need to teach our teachers how to fight.

927
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:52,520
We need to teach some of our older students how to fight.

928
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,600
Somebody comes in your classroom, you know, everybody's taught now to run cover in the

929
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,600
corner.

930
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,840
It saves half the ammunition, and sometimes you can kill two or three with one shot.

931
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:06,480
You know, if they were to spread out and to fan out and talk to attack, how many people

932
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,480
would come into a classroom?

933
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:10,200
They would only make it through the one classroom.

934
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,520
We're gonna lose students anyway.

935
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:16,640
But the nanny state does not ever want, they don't even let you play dodgeball or tag.

936
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:20,880
They might as well have them line up back to back so one bullet could shoot through

937
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:21,880
three people.

938
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,520
Maybe that should be what Obama proposes.

939
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,000
Well, that's kind of making the way it sounds.

940
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,240
But you know, right now there's 18 states that have passed that they're arming their

941
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,240
teachers.

942
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:36,080
People are starting to figure out, you know what, I can't stand here anymore.

943
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,240
I need to fight back for myself and for the people I'm responsible for.

944
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:45,080
And that's what we're pushing here is to arm teachers to be able to protect our students.

945
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:49,960
You know, they talk about putting officers in the schools.

946
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,800
The government has offered that through different grants and stuff.

947
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:53,800
They can't afford that.

948
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,680
They don't have the money.

949
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
States can't afford that.

950
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
Our county can't afford that.

951
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:02,640
But I'll guarantee you, like crosswalkers, if you ask retired police to volunteer, say,

952
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,480
a week out of each month, you could get five or six, seven guys per county.

953
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,880
They'd all be able to do that as well.

954
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,120
But I agree arming the teachers is the way to go.

955
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,520
And that's got to make the gun grabbers mad that how many states would you say are moving

956
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,520
to do that right now?

957
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:15,520
Eighteen.

958
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,520
Wow, that's exciting.

959
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:19,520
So it's catching on quick.

960
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,240
David, we know we're playing actually playing catch up at this point because, you know,

961
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,640
he has moved in his direction.

962
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,220
Now we're having to basically counteract everything.

963
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,760
We should have not ever had to counteract.

964
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,360
We should have already been there.

965
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:37,900
My dad went to a rural school, but it was big and he would drive in 15 miles with his

966
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:39,840
mom who was a teacher to work.

967
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:44,760
But they would all bring their shotguns and stuff to go shoot at each other's houses and

968
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,880
dove hunt and quail hunt or deer hunt.

969
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,320
They would all bring their guns to school.

970
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,440
And it was a school with over a thousand people in it.

971
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,080
They never had one accident because they were a gun culture.

972
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:54,080
Right.

973
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:58,200
Well, you saw you see a pickup in the 60s and 70s, you saw you see a pickup parked in

974
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,840
the parking lot with a gun hanging on a rack so kids could go hunting after school.

975
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,840
It wasn't uncommon at all.

976
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:08,720
And I think it was because of the shootings and stuff there.

977
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,760
Well, I tell you, you are the way forward.

978
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,480
My friend, 1776 was a 5000 year leap for freedom there.

979
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,480
They're saying it's old.

980
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,800
They're wanting to go back to ancient tyranny where only government is armed.

981
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,560
Jackson County Sheriff Denny Payman, sir, we salute you for being a true American.

982
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,120
I know you're just doing your duty.

983
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:30,160
But in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.

984
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,880
And you are a great example to everyone and I hope that you'll run for Congress or something

985
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,240
because I'll guarantee you we need you to join Rand Paul in the federal government to

986
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,240
protect our republic.

987
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:45,360
I appreciate that, sir, and I appreciate the opportunity to be able to visit with you today.

988
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,320
I'm saying right now you're drafted, buddy.

989
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,560
I don't know if that's what you want, but Kentucky, this guy's a statesman.

990
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:53,600
You draft him, you send him to Washington to protect the Bill of Rights.

991
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,840
Sheriff, we'll talk to you again.

992
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
God bless you.

993
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,840
Thank you, sir.

994
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,840
There he goes.

995
01:04:57,840 --> 01:04:58,840
All right.

996
01:04:58,840 --> 01:04:59,840
We'll be back with Lou Rockwell.

997
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:00,840
Amazing.

998
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,840
Amazing.

999
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:06,720
You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.

1000
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,720
Tyranny is here.

1001
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:11,280
The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.

1002
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,000
It really says that the state is God.

1003
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,520
The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states

1004
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,760
on Earth.

1005
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,600
This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

1006
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,440
expanded nationwide.

1007
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:30,600
This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all

1008
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,560
powerful shadow state.

1009
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,560
Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

1010
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:42,720
Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship, body scanners, sound cameras,

1011
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,820
citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.

1012
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:50,320
It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.

1013
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:52,360
The police state isn't coming.

1014
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,360
It's here.

Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1017
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,660
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1018
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,520
by a disastrous economy.

1019
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,240
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1021
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:24,200
a life storm by having a supply of food on hand after Hurricane Sandy.

1022
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:28,880
Danny from New York City wrote, Almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed

1023
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,320
to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

1024
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:37,160
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

1025
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,400

You want answers?

1045
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,160
Well, so does he.

1046
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:24,240
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1047
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:42,680
All right, ladies and gentlemen, we just concluded the first hour of you tuned in here and we

1048
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:51,640
had Sheriff Denny payment on from Jackson County and he's got to be the most powerful,

1049
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:57,520
just concise, calm speaker from, quote, law enforcement as a peace officer I've ever heard.

1050
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,280
I mean, it was unbelievable if you listen to it.

1051
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,720
He was just very calm, but you could hear it.

1052
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,820
He said people have got it in their eyes.

1053
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:04,820
They're ready.

1054
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:07,880
This is going to be a new revolution.

1055
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,100
And they're going to go and harass gun owners.

1056
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:12,360
They're announcing hell on earth.

1057
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,640
In fact, last night I couldn't go to bed researching these executive orders and it was everything

1058
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,640
I knew they do.

1059
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:22,680
But they are, I've got the mayor of Philadelphia saying we're just going to shut gun shops

1060
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:30,160
down because outside of law, they're announcing you'll do what we say or else.

1061
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:33,840
That's what Chuck Schumer is calling people.

1062
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:38,840
That's in the news saying you will not sell guns or I will do something.

1063
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,640
I mean, it's literally like the mafia coming into your shop and saying you'll do this or

1064
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:43,960
else.

1065
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:51,600
I've got clips coming up of Bob Schaefer saying that gun owners are like the Nazis in Germany.

1066
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,040
He likens Obama taking on gun owners to defeating the Nazis.

1067
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,040
That's a quote.

1068
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,200
I've got that clip.

1069
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,120
Morning Joe said, how dare the NRA point out that elites have bodyguards and he took his

1070
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:09,440
glasses off and Mika Brzezinski went, I just am ashamed to be an American today.

1071
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, get out of our country, you witch.

1072
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,640
And again, they just act like we're the weirdos and it's all affected.

1073
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,040
Man, Alex screwed up getting in our face saying we want to take their guns.

1074
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:23,040
Really?

1075
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,640
I mean, Paul Revere wrote down the road saying get your guns and get ready to kill people.

1076
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,680
George Washington signed death warrants.

1077
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:34,760
I'm just saying don't try to take our guns or it'll cause a civil war, which they know

1078
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,000
it will do.

1079
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:41,480
But the truth is it was very effective when the NRA said, hey, Israel has guns in their

1080
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,280
schools and it got rid of the mass shootings.

1081
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,680
They went, no, that's not true.

1082
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,880
Nobody in Israel is armed and lied.

1083
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,140
And no, that's not effective, NRA is discredited.

1084
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:53,600
That's a tactic when something really hits them hard, it's like you punch somebody and

1085
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:54,600
they go, that didn't hurt.

1086
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,640
Can you go out of the room, please, and they fall down on the ground.

1087
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,760
They are so scared of us pointing out that Dianne Feinstein has a concealed carry and

1088
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,080
five bodyguards, that Michael Moore has a concealed carry and bodyguards that have been

1089
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,360
arrested carrying guns in airports.

1090
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:12,840
That Chuck Schumer's been caught with bodyguards and then swore he'd never have them and turned

1091
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:13,840
a gun in.

1092
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,120
He got caught in a gun range with a semi-auto, all smiling, shooting it and bodyguards and

1093
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,280
oh, okay, I've given it up now, remember that?

1094
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:26,420
This is the end of these hypocrites and that's why they're like, did you see these ridiculous

1095
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:31,840
hypocrites pointing out that David Gregory on NBC has bodyguards and guns?

1096
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,440
Yeah, that's ridiculous, of course he has, he's a public figure.

1097
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:40,320
Well, listen, you scum, the average person living in a working class neighborhood, my

1098
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:46,360
dad going through college, through medical school would go because it was the best money

1099
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,360
he could make.

1100
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:50,460
And his dad had a heart attack and stuff and didn't have money to put him through college.

1101
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,960
My dad would go, this is when I was born, he had his UT degree, but he was going to

1102
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,000
dental school.

1103
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,020
He would go and he would do, with his own company, spraying bug poison in the worst

1104
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,940
neighborhoods of Dallas.

1105
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:07,760
And you know what, he carried a 357 Magnum in his lunchbox, okay?

1106
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,240
My dad drove around, bought his own poison, went and did it the whole nine yards.

1107
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:14,800
I remember when I was like two years old, him getting home at like 10 o'clock at night

1108
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,240
and I'd wake up and then wake him up once he went to bed and he'd get upset cuz he had

1109
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:21,600
to get up at 5 AM or whatever.

1110
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:29,420
Again, you scum, you elitist, my dad deserved going into the projects in South Dallas as

1111
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,380
a roach man, they called him the roach man's here.

1112
01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:37,120
The roach man carried a 357 Magnum, he still got the 357 Magnum.

1113
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,700
And this is what it comes down to here today.

1114
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:42,240
And that's why they're freaking out.

1115
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,800
But let me tell you, I've never seen such demonization.

1116
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,720
The Philadelphia mayor says, take the guns, it's like apartheid.

1117
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,820
We're gonna boycott, we're gonna protest, we're gonna shut them down.

1118
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:55,440
They're saying Fox Sports, gun owners of the new Klan, we're mass murderers, we killed

1119
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,440
those kids.

1120
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:00,520
The government took the guns out of the schools, and government advertised schools as the place

1121
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,680
to go and kill people.

1122
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:04,240
This didn't exist till the media hyped it in the 80s.

1123
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:09,560
Now joining us is the founder of the Von Mies Institute, the head of the Von Mies Institute,

1124
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,520
former Ron Paul chief of staff, libertarian icon, Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com.

1125
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,440
I just gave him a basic briefing, I know he's already aware of this.

1126
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,220
But the word is they're gonna try executive orders to use all of homeland security to

1127
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:26,080
demonize guns, to harass gun shops and gun owners.

1128
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,760
I've talked to several gun shop owners off record who are getting me the documents, ATF

1129
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:34,560
coming in and saying, orders are about to come down, we know this happened last year.

1130
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,240
You're gonna do what we say or else.

1131
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,320
So at that point, we've got to move for impeachment.

1132
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:44,360
I've entered public articles of impeachment that list with the law, so others can use

1133
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:45,360
it.

1134
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,040
Members of Congress are picking that up and others, and are saying we need to start impeachment

1135
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,040
now.

1136
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,040
Stockman of Texas and others.

1137
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,280
Ron Paul is vowing to, quote, torpedo it, and he's talking about impeachment.

1138
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:02,520
Ron Paul vows to torpedo Obama executive orders, new legislation with nullified gun control

1139
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,080
dictates.

1140
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,600
It's time to get on the offensive.

1141
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,060
Lou Rockwell, is this not in your 47 years of fighting tyranny?

1142
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:13,440
Is this the greatest assault you've ever seen?

1143
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,920
I mean, I've never seen rhetoric like this.

1144
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:17,560
Are we moving into DETHCON1?

1145
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,360
Well, because there have been many periods in American history when the government has

1146
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,040
massively expanded and stolen the people's liberties.

1147
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:28,720
I mean, usually during wartime, the New Deal, the Great Society.

1148
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:33,200
This is another one, and certainly this is an extraordinary moment.

1149
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,300
All governments would like to be totalitarian.

1150
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:40,220
They all would like to have total control, control every dime we have, everything we

1151
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,960
do in our life, everything we think, everything we say, our businesses, our homes, our children.

1152
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,560
So they want it all.

1153
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:51,120
Whenever there's a chance, something like this Newton shooting and the horrible things

1154
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,640
that happen there, they use it.

1155
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,520
But of course, they don't care about so-called gun violence.

1156
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:02,800
After all, Barack Obama is a leader of the world headquarters of gun violence in the

1157
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,600
history of the world of the US government.

1158
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,400
I mean, how many people, and he signs, of course, the kill orders, and the US government

1159
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:12,360
employs millions of people to shoot other people.

1160
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,680
I mean, that's their main deal in life.

1161
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:21,600
Whether it's in Afghanistan, or Iraq, or Yemen, or Syria, or they hope Iran, and all these

1162
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,520
other countries, they're shooting people.

1163
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,600
And when they talk about what might be encouraging violence, is it video games, is it TV, Hollywood?

1164
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:37,000
And I must say, I'm not a big fan of some of this stuff, although free speech does apply.

1165
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,880
But how about the glorification of war, the glorification of cops, the glorification of

1166
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:45,480
soldiers, the glorification of government gun violence?

1167
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,640
So none of these people are anti-gun or anti-gun violence.

1168
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,000
They're anti-private people owning guns.

1169
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,960
And anybody who knows people who own guns, they are not pro-violence.

1170
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:00,920
The last thing they want to do in their life is shoot somebody.

1171
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,940
There are people, of course, who like to shoot people, they work for the government.

1172
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:07,240
But private people with guns don't want to have to use them.

1173
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:12,080
They only want to have to use them if their back is against the wall, like that homemaker

1174
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,200
in Georgia the other day, who had, she was backed up into the attic where they're two

1175
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:23,240
little nine-year-old twins, and then finally shot the guy and got him to run away and avoiding

1176
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,240
rape and murder.

1177
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,440
That's right, you notice that in these cases that happen, we hear about every week but

1178
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:30,840
never make national news, every day, most days, the woman's on 9-1-1, okay, he's busting

1179
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,800
down the front door, I'm going in the bathroom, then they're busting down the bathroom door,

1180
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,120
and then 9-1-1's like, don't shoot them, and then the woman shoots them.

1181
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:43,240
The gun owners always try to hold back, but we have guns because we're not going to be

1182
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:44,240
victims.

1183
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,640
No, that's right, it's like the old joke, and it may be actually a true story, about

1184
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:52,720
a guy who called up 9-1-1 and said, I've got prowlers in the yard, and they said, oh, we'll

1185
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,320
be out in 25 minutes or whatever.

1186
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,840
And then he calls back and says, don't worry, I shot them, and of course the cops are there

1187
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:01,800
in just a minute.

1188
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,760
So they don't want us defending ourselves.

1189
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,280
Government wants its monopoly.

1190
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:11,760
The cops, aside from the few good guys like the sheriff you were talking to, most cops

1191
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,140
don't want people exercising self-defense, they only want that to be a government monopoly.

1192
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:20,680
They want to take away our guns for self-defense, and of course they want to take it for reasons

1193
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:26,800
of tyranny, the same reasons that governments all over the world, and you had some great

1194
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:32,560
photos of Hitler and Stalin and Mao and these guys using children in their propaganda exercises,

1195
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:37,400
just like Barack Obama did recently, it was Hannah Arendt who said, any time politicians

1196
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:41,600
start talking about your children, your country is on the road to totalitarianism.

1197
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:44,120
Well, that's right, I haven't even mentioned-

1198
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:48,160
Barack Obama says, the kids in Newtown are our kids, they're not his kids, he's got two

1199
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:53,720
kids, nobody else's children are his children, but it's a totalitarian move, he wants to

1200
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:58,160
be the chief minister, the chief religious figure, the chief protector, we're all supposed

1201
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:02,320
to focus on him, we're supposed to give him our guns, give him our freedom, give him our

1202
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:09,000
money, bow down, and he wants to be the pharaoh, but we don't have to allow it, and it's wonderful

1203
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:14,240
to see, Alex, all the opposition that you're leading among the American people refusing

1204
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,480
to have this happen to us.

1205
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:23,160
Well, you're right, and what you're mentioning is DrudgeReport.com, it's in the middle column.

1206
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:27,320
Yesterday I was sitting around with Kurt Nemo and we were looking at images of Hitler and

1207
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,440
Stalin and Mao and everybody else in Saddam Hussein using children, so I just said, well,

1208
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:34,880
let's just post it with Obama high-fying the kids.

1209
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:41,480
And it's so amazing that he said, I'm gonna take the guns for you, kid, like he's the

1210
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:46,480
good guy, he's the North Korean dear leader, he's the guardian of the society, he's the

1211
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:52,320
Hugo Chavez, he's the Mao Tse Tung, I mean, this is right out of a textbook, and if you

1212
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,780
don't turn your guns in, you're not for the children.

1213
01:18:55,780 --> 01:19:01,440
And that article is up at DrudgeReport.com showing Stalin, who said that he did all he

1214
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,440
did for the children.

1215
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:07,720
In fact, he was known as the Great Father Steele, he was known as the Man of Steele,

1216
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:09,000
the Father of Steele.

1217
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,120
Well, you know what, Barack Obama is not my father, I'm my father.

1218
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:19,560
What did you think of, we're gonna break, but Bob Shafer's saying that our president

1219
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:24,800
beat Hitler, I mean, our men beat Hitler, not the government, I'm sorry, go ahead.

1220
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,560
Does it matter that Hitler was a big gun controller?

1221
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,600
No, of course not, the facts don't matter.

1222
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,080
And Shafer's just a spoke, he might as well be broadcasting for Radio Berlin or Radio

1223
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:38,200
Moscow or Radio Havana or any of these other, I mean, he's just a representative of the

1224
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:43,120
state media, giving out state propaganda, spreading the lies, and of course, as you

1225
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:49,800
pointed out, we're living under such unbelievable intensive media attempts to control our minds

1226
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:57,040
to make us all fear private guns and think that government guns are the way to save us.

1227
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:00,160
Incredible, I want to hear where you think this is going, the man, Lou Rockwell is our

1228
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,520
guest, we'll be right back.

1229
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:07,520
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive, from natural disasters

1230
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:12,100
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on

1231
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,960
by a disastrous economy.

1232
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:16,680
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1233
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,480
At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

1234
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,400
life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

1235
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,940
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores

1236
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:32,760
are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister

1237
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:33,760
and niece.

1238
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:37,560
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

Jim Newcomer from Mondays Resources, January 16, 2013.

1261
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:08,080
Gold opened this morning at $1675.60.

1262
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:15,920
One ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1718.29, $859.15 for a half ounce or $429.57 for a quarter

1263
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,920
ounce.

1264
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,760
That's $1718.29, $859.15 and $429.57.

1265
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,080
Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1266
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:27,200
Have you ever wondered why bank stockbrokers and investment advisors won't talk about gold

1267
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,200
IRAs?

1268
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,360
Wait a sec.

1269
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:33,480
Gold and silver is going up while Congress is trying to settle on the next debt increase

1270
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,320
and there's no end to this madness.

1271
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:40,960
That old 401K and IRA can be converted into physical gold without tax consequences.

1272
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,160
I explained this in my book, 10 Reasons to Buy Gold.

1273
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,480
Don't let time slip away.

1277
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:05,360
Hey there, Frank Bates here.

1278
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:10,440
Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

1279
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:12,500
This is really scary stuff.

1280
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:17,440
Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.

1281
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,760
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed

1282
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,400
piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

1283
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:28,280
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

1284
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,180
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

1285
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:37,840
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat

1286
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,640
and blows the doors off the conspiracy.

1287
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:46,500
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

1288
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:51,440
discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

1289
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:56,000
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone

1290
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
forever.

1291
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,560
And that's weirddevice.com.

1292
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:05,560
This will be difficult.

1293
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:20,280
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists publicly warning

1294
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:24,360
of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.

1295
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:34,360
Not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear or higher ratings or revenue

1296
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,360
for themselves.

1297
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:37,040
Did you hear that?

1298
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:42,760
He is directly going after yours truly, obviously, from the Piers Morgan interview, pundits,

1299
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:48,920
that here I am making money, shelling T-shirts, water filters, sponsors.

1300
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,760
This is the government that takes your money and gives it to MSNBC.

1301
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,240
You know they've been giving government money.

1302
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,240
That's come out.

1303
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:59,280
To push tyranny and then we're immoral and he goes on to say we've given no solutions

1304
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:04,520
really get the kids off these drugs that have been linked to it directly, armed people in

1305
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:05,520
the schools.

1306
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,920
We shouldn't have big government training camps anyways.

1307
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,400
Lou Rockwell of lourockwell.com, we've gotten to a point where they're having to respond

1308
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:14,400
to us now.

1309
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,520
I'll put you on the hot seat.

1310
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,520
I want your real answer.

1311
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:20,440
Do you think it was effective to get in Piers Morgan's face and go, look, this isn't about

1312
01:25:20,440 --> 01:25:21,520
child safety.

1313
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:26,120
This is about tyranny and enslavement because if it wasn't effective, why then are they

1314
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:27,600
responding to it?

1315
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:33,280
Well, you know, Alan, you know, Alex, that I think was the biggest ratings that that

1316
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,000
bird has ever had.

1317
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,200
We know that his ratings are otherwise in the toilet and he probably, if he weren't

1318
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:44,240
so politically correct and so useful to the regime as a propagandist, he probably would

1319
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,680
have been sent back to England or some other place long before this because he doesn't

1320
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:51,560
have viewers except when you're on.

1321
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:52,560
Absolutely.

1322
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,560
But I mean, isn't it effective?

1323
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,120
I mean, you're gentlemanly, but you're also hard hitting.

1324
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,480
They always call us kooks no matter what we do.

1325
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:02,160
Isn't it effective to go ahead and get aggressive and back in their faces?

1326
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,160
Sure.

1327
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:04,160
You got to speak truth to power, right?

1328
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,800
And this guy represents the state media.

1329
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:12,440
I mean, he's no different from somebody who wrote for Pravda or, or, uh, was on, you know,

1330
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:15,320
Moscow state television in the Soviet days.

1331
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,420
He's nothing but a shill for the regime.

1332
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:18,620
He's a professional liar.

1333
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:21,720
He's paid to lie, uh, for the government.

1334
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,640
Same with Bob Schieffer, all of these people.

1335
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:29,560
So not only should we, should we speak the truth to them, but sure, I'm, I'm, uh, I'm

1336
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:32,080
for dissing them because they don't deserve respect.

1337
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,120
Uh, they're very bad people.

1338
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:36,960
They're making vast amounts of money for doing evil.

1339
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,760
Uh, so of course, of course we should speak the truth to them and we should be, uh, we

1340
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,680
should be frank with them and, uh, we should tell them exactly, I mean, Piers Morgan is

1341
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,320
a huge fan, for example, of drone warfare.

1342
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,080
He's a huge fan of all the U S government wars and wars of the British empire.

1343
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,560
He's for torture.

1344
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,560
He's for all this stuff.

1345
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:57,200
So we're supposed to think he's against violence.

1346
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,280
I mean, this is a guy who's a champion of violence, but he wants to, he wants the state

1347
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,280
to be violent.

1348
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,080
And, and of course the state is violence.

1349
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,920
The state is always the headquarters of violence.

1350
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:10,800
I mean, how many babies we do, you know, we're talking about the horror in Newtown.

1351
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,920
How many babies has the U S government killed in its, in its a career of mass murder?

1352
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:19,040
I mean, I remember back when they were going after Iraq, which did nothing to us.

1353
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:23,120
Madeleine Albright said a half a million dead children was worth it.

1354
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,640
She said that on NBC news famously, and they said half a million dead kids.

1355
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,640
Is that good?

1356
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:28,640
She goes, yeah, it's good.

1357
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:32,400
See, I mean, half a million kids that they were deliberately murdered by the U S through

1358
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:37,280
its murder sanctions, anti-civilian murder sanctions, and also sanctions against food

1359
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:40,580
against medicine designed to starve and sicken these children.

1360
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:41,580
Half a million.

1361
01:27:41,580 --> 01:27:44,480
I mean, uh, has Saddam Hussein ever done anything that bad?

1362
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,480
I don't know.

1363
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,480
My guess is no.

1364
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:50,440
I mean, the U S is, is really the murder state is the assassination state.

1365
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:51,800
It's the drone state.

1366
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,360
And we're supposed to think that Obama cares about violence.

1367
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,840
He is violence.

1368
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,880
Every morning he signs his death orders over his scrambled eggs.

1369
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,480
This is the guy who likes this kind of thing.

1370
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:05,840
Like by the way, everybody who prospers in government likes killing people or sending

1371
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,200
other people to be killed.

1372
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,200
They enjoy this.

1373
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,200
It empowers them.

1374
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,320
They feel very good about it.

1375
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,520
They love guns.

1376
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,480
And as you say, all the, uh, all the power leaders have, you know, Bloomberg and Obama

1377
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:20,200
and, uh, I'm sure Piers Morgan, all these people have armed bodyguards.

1378
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:23,880
CNN has gotten a bunch of armed bodyguards all in their studios.

1379
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,060
How come that's okay?

1380
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:29,520
But some little old lady, uh, in a bad area can't have a 22.

1381
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,360
So that's, you know, it's, it's, but you know, they want to disarm us.

1382
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,800
They want to control us.

1383
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,800
They want to hurt us.

1384
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,800
I'm also afraid by the way that they want to stimulate armed resistance in the sense

1385
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:46,000
that they would love another Waco or two Waco was we have to remember was about gun control.

1386
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:47,160
That's what the whole thing was about.

1387
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,160
I totally agree.

1388
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,360
They're trying to start a civil war.

1389
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,920
How do we respond to that?

1390
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:55,240
Well, I think we don't, we don't, uh, take the bait.

1391
01:28:55,240 --> 01:28:57,720
So I think we don't respond with violence.

1392
01:28:57,720 --> 01:29:00,040
Uh, and we just state our rights.

1393
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:05,600
We, we buy guns, hold guns, join together with other people who believe in freedom,

1394
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:12,560
uh, become, uh, go to the firing range, make use of them, talk up owning guns and really

1395
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:13,560
spread the word.

1396
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,520
I think most Americans, despite these little phony polls we're hearing and never forget

1397
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:21,880
that these national polls are designed to tell you what to think, not to tell you what

1398
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:22,880
other people think.

1399
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,220
They're propaganda devices.

1400
01:29:24,220 --> 01:29:28,360
So when we hear that 189% of the American people, you know, a hundred percent agree

1401
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,440
with Obama, you know, these are just, just laws.

1402
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:36,720
Well that's come out, they've had polling agency heads admit they lie, uh, I mean, it's

1403
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,720
just incredible.

1404
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:38,720
It is to create a bandwagon.

1405
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:41,440
Like 99% of people want to jump off a cliff.

1406
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:43,880
Well, come on Martha, let's go jump off right now.

1407
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:45,440
Lou Rockwell, long segment coming up.

1408
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,400
I want to ask you what you think is coming in the future and how we counter these people.

The empire's on the run.

01:29:55,440 --> 01:30:02,760
Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

1413
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,800
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

1414
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,160
Don't be one of them.

1422
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,540
harmful pathogens.

1423
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:39,400
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

1424
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,560
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1425
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:47,220
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

1426
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:51,080

Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the new world order, it's Alex Jones on the

1455
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:32,440
GCN radio network.

1456
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:33,440
Crank it up.

1457
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:38,440
I'm going to do the gingham style.

1458
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:50,520
There were a bunch of people who weren't going to turn their guns in and they could kick

1459
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:56,640
some tyranny real good as well.

1460
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:02,720
He never learned to read and write so well, but he could pull a trigger like he was ringing

1461
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,720
a bell.

1462
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:09,360
Go Johnny, go, go, go.

1463
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:11,200
It's exactly what Lou Rockwell was just saying.

1464
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:12,840
We're going to go to some clips with him as well.

1465
01:34:12,840 --> 01:34:14,800
You don't know who Lou Rockwell is.

1466
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:18,980
He of course is a icon in the movement towards libertarianism.

1467
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:24,000
You notice most real studies, university studies, people on the street is what I've seen.

1468
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,880
Around 60% of Americans call themselves a libertarian.

1469
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:30,080
They don't like either party and our movement is gaining steam.

1470
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:36,800
I call it constitutionalist freedom lover, folks that just want to be left alone.

1471
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:41,640
People that are into justice and that's why the power structure is going after us right

1472
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:48,160
now is because when I see liberal women's magazines, because Austin's more quote liberal

1473
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:51,520
than most cities in Texas, just because some of the Californian folks have come and taken

1474
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,520
it over.

1475
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:56,080
Not against Californians, but those kind of socialist types that call themselves liberals,

1476
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,360
they're not really authoritarians.

1477
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,880
Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.

1478
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:04,560
But I want to get Lou Rockwell's historical take on this because he's seen a lot and really

1479
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:08,640
has written about what he believed was coming and now unfortunately, it's unfolding.

1480
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:12,220
Women's magazines becoming pro-gun just because no one would buy the magazine unless they

1481
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:13,480
did it.

1482
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:19,000
Women going out and learning how to shoot, gun ownership proliferating, gun sales proliferating,

1483
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,440
self-defense classes proliferating.

1484
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:24,760
People are really getting into becoming self-sufficient.

1485
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:30,340
There is a rebellion against the nanny state, against all this, and people are really getting

1486
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:31,340
into it.

1487
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:36,560
And so the globalists are all out of salt because gun ownership is a beachhead against

1488
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:39,160
the nanny state, against victim disarmament.

1489
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:44,140
And that cultural area, one of the few areas of liberty really growing, was getting other

1490
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,200
areas to grow.

1491
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:49,000
It was becoming kind of a central part of a wheel with the spokes out from it.

1492
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,160
And the establishment has said this.

1493
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:54,840
And I mean, look at the prepper movement, look at the, all the liberals I know aren't

1494
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,840
liberals now.

1495
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:58,840
They've gone out and bought places in the countryside, they're getting self-sufficient.

1496
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:04,940
You heard the sheriff, he said, I go to these liberty meetings now and it's judges and it's

1497
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:10,080
state reps and it's doctors and it's lawyers and it's writers and it's former quote liberals.

1498
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:12,440
They're still liberals, they've become real liberals.

1499
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:16,800
And so the system is announcing a full out Homeland Security attack from hundreds of

1500
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:23,680
angles, 23 executive orders, massive demonization, arresting people for toy guns.

1501
01:36:23,680 --> 01:36:27,240
Because if they can't shoot this down, they're going to lose.

1502
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:31,960
They wanna collapse things and make us fully domesticated instead of collapsing things.

1503
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:35,720
And then we get off the government heroin and become self-sufficient.

1504
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:40,120
Lou Rockwell, your take on that and what you fear they're gonna try in the future and how

1505
01:36:40,120 --> 01:36:41,680
we turn the tide against these people.

1506
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:42,680
Well, Alex, you're right.

1507
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:47,040
I mean, there was one little boy tossed out of school for making a gun with his fingers.

1508
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:51,040
I must say, during Obama's press conference, I kept hoping one of those little boys would

1509
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,040
do that.

1510
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,040
It didn't happen.

1511
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:54,200
Of course, they're all brainwashed.

1512
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:57,600
But I think my guess is that Obama has actually gone too far.

1513
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,840
I think the government has gone too far, the whole government media complex.

1514
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:05,240
I think it's taken a step too far by doing what they're doing.

1515
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:10,240
And of course, this constant media propaganda and bombardment similar to what the old Soviet

1516
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:16,800
days or something out of 1984 or Nazi Germany when they were demonizing somebody, I don't

1517
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,160
think it's working.

1518
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,160
Everybody was sort of taken aback.

1519
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,960
Of course, we're horrified by the crime that took place, as we should be horrified by all.

1520
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:29,080
For example, the little Muslim children killed in Afghanistan, very few Americans care about

1521
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:30,080
that, of course.

1522
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:36,880
The US government is killing children every day all over the world and nobody cares.

1523
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:42,200
But I think by going after gun ownership like this, by being so openly a dictator, I don't

1524
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:46,380
think, Alex, despite all you've done, I've done, Ron Paul, talk about executive orders

1525
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:47,380
over the year.

1526
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:51,480
Does the average American realize the president can just legislate by fiat like that, like

1527
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,960
he's the pharaoh or the king?

1528
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,380
I don't think so.

1529
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:57,400
So this is waking people up.

1530
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,680
Everybody's concerned.

1531
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:04,000
Everybody's paying attention, both on the commissar side of the government and the big

1532
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:05,440
media and so forth.

1533
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,120
But the rest of the people and also more and more people are going to realizing that the

1534
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:15,280
power elites, of course, all are themselves armed and have tax paid, tax applied, armed

1535
01:38:15,280 --> 01:38:16,600
bodyguards.

1536
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:17,960
I think they stepped too far.

1537
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:19,200
I think everybody's waking up.

1538
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:20,800
I think they made a mistake.

1539
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,440
I think it's all going to end in a black eye for the government.

1540
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,720
They actually need two black eyes.

1541
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,920
And I think it's a huge step forward.

1542
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,120
It is connected to the entire liberty movement, as you point out.

1543
01:38:33,120 --> 01:38:36,880
And when people realize this, then they're going to take a look at other different areas

1544
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,460
of government encroachment.

1545
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:43,120
All the taxes they're increasing, the rotten Obamacare, which is also tied into gun control.

1546
01:38:43,120 --> 01:38:47,800
John Rappaport has pointed out that the doctors are going to be instructed to ask, how many

1547
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,420
guns are in your home?

1548
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:52,200
We can bet that the public school teachers are going to be asking children.

1549
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,720
They already interrogate children on a whole range of things.

1550
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,560
Do your parents have guns?

1551
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,480
Are you scared of your parents' guns?

1552
01:38:58,480 --> 01:39:00,400
What kind of guns do your parents have?

1553
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:04,960
So if anybody's concerned about what happened in Newtown, the answer to me is not to arm

1554
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:05,960
the school teachers.

1555
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:08,280
Although, of course, school teachers, like anybody else, have the right to be armed if

1556
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,520
they want to.

1557
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,640
Take your kids out of the public schools.

1558
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,440
Succeed from the public schools.

1559
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:17,240
That's the best thing you can do for your children, that you can do for your family.

1560
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:20,200
Send them to private school or, best of all, homeschool them.

1561
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,080
This doesn't happen in homeschools.

1562
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,100
It just happens in government schools.

1563
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:28,360
The old joke from when I was a boy and much older than that has come true.

1564
01:39:28,360 --> 01:39:32,560
That is, the head, the principals, the warden, the teachers of the guards, and the students

1565
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:33,560
of the prisoners.

1566
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:35,960
The public schools even look like prisons these days.

1567
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:37,520
They're going to be looking more and more like prisons.

1568
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,720
They're going to be more and more totalitarian with all kinds of cops, armed cops, resource

1569
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:46,000
officers and so forth, to propagandize them against guns, against their parents.

1570
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,680
Just like Stalin trying to use the children against the parents.

1571
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,660
Get your children out of the public schools.

1572
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:54,780
Don't pretend that you can reform the public schools because even if your children are

1573
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:58,940
physically safe, they're not mentally safe in there because they're being indoctrinated

1574
01:39:58,940 --> 01:40:03,520
with lies, with evil, with everything designed to make them.

1575
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,720
Never think critically.

1576
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:05,720
Never think independently.

1577
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,440
Bow down to the government.

1578
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:09,680
Go off and kill if the government asks you to.

1579
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:10,840
Give them all your money.

1580
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:11,840
Let them run your life.

1581
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:17,120
If you don't want your children indoctrinated in that kind of rotten stuff, bring them home.

1582
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,120
Teach them yourself.

1583
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,680
Well, and you're right.

1584
01:40:20,680 --> 01:40:23,960
And again, there are some public schools where there's good people in control.

1585
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,320
So it's overall not completely out of control.

1586
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:32,160
But in all the major cities, because I read the constant news and break it down, San Antonio

1587
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:37,280
for three years now, they have Pentagon AI cameras in the bathrooms, in the hallways

1588
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:42,160
and in the lunchrooms, quote, watching what the kids eat, and it even files how many calories

1589
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,620
the AI knows.

1590
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,620
That's a piece of fruit.

1591
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,620
That's a piece of meat.

1592
01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,660
I mean, this is how high tech it is.

1593
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:48,660
They're watching them.

1594
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:49,660
They make them wear RFID.

1595
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:55,240
And in California, even in Alabama and other areas, they're now giving inoculations without

1596
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:56,240
parental consent.

1597
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,560
That's a felony.

1598
01:40:57,560 --> 01:41:01,040
And so let me ask you this question, Lou Rockwell.

1599
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:05,560
They counsel children, they have abortions, and you can't trust the public schools.

1600
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,560
Yes, there are some good schoolteachers, of course.

1601
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,920
Good principals, yes.

1602
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,340
But they're targeted too.

1603
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:11,540
They're not in control.

1604
01:41:11,540 --> 01:41:13,800
They're forced to go along with the federal curriculum.

1605
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:17,700
What's being taught in all the public schools is damaging to your children, even if they

1606
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:19,760
don't end up getting shot.

1607
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,060
No, no, exactly.

1608
01:41:21,060 --> 01:41:25,080
But the issue is, I wanna ask you this, and I'm sure you know about this, but it went

1609
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:26,080
up on infowars.com.

1610
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,520
I haven't even played the clip yet.

1611
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,680
We're gonna play it in a moment.

1612
01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:32,260
Let's get the Philadelphia mayor ready, please, and then we'll get to Bob Shafer and the rest

1613
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:33,260
of it.

1614
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:34,800
These are all some short clips, but they're important.

1615
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,260
Philadelphia mayor declares economic warfare on gun retailers.

1616
01:41:38,260 --> 01:41:41,440
And they're saying, just like South Africa, we're gonna boycott you.

1617
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:42,440
We're gonna shut you down.

1618
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:43,440
We're gonna pull funding.

1619
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,680
We're gonna have the police harass you.

1620
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:49,880
They're literally like mafia, saying we're gonna put weight on you.

1621
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,280
We're gonna lean on you.

1622
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:55,840
And Chuck Schumer says he's calling stores, saying just don't sell it, or you're not gonna

1623
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:56,840
like what happens.

1624
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:58,320
And people say, well, that's not gonna happen.

1625
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:03,800
I've talked to gun shop owners in Austin who were scared to go on air, where the ATF has

1626
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:04,800
come in.

1627
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,800
They're really rude to them.

1628
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,800
They're mean.

1629
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:07,800
I've been around them before at the gun show.

1630
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:10,220
I've had ATF walk up and get my face like their god.

1631
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:12,760
They look like criminals out of Central Casting.

1632
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,840
And they're just coming in saying, yeah, get ready for some rule making.

1633
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:18,480
You're gonna do what we tell you.

1634
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:22,960
And as soon as we get these documents, I'm also talking to a gun shop in California cuz

1635
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:25,440
they're telling them, there's gonna be new rules.

1636
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,600
You're just not gonna sell these outside of law.

1637
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:32,760
I mean, what do you do when the government goes full tyrant, full dictator?

1638
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:37,360
Well, you mean as to what a poor gun store owner has to do?

1639
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:42,240
Of course, they depend on having the federal firearms license, which itself was a horrendous

1640
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:46,660
intervention like all the gun controls that were starting in 1934, in fact, the federal

1641
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,420
government has been encroaching on gun rights.

1642
01:42:49,420 --> 01:42:53,400
So the government could take their livelihood in a second.

1643
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,040
That by the way, is the position the government like to have us all.

1644
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,840
They'd like you, Alex, to have a license and if you don't comply, they take your license.

1645
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:03,680
So this is the way they're moving.

1646
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:09,200
But I think, can you respond with violence when the ATF agents come into your store?

1647
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,200
I don't think you can.

1648
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,200
They're gonna murder you.

1649
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:16,080
So I think- But can you believe we've gotten to the point?

1650
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:18,160
Intellectually resist them.

1651
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:25,280
I don't think the answer for a gun store owner is to resist physically, they'll kill you.

1652
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:30,960
Exactly, but I don't think people understand, we're getting to the point now where they're

1653
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:31,960
on the news.

1654
01:43:31,960 --> 01:43:35,740
I'm gonna play some clips of this, saying we're Nazis and that the president must wage

1655
01:43:35,740 --> 01:43:41,000
a war against gun owners like the presidents did before against Hitler.

1656
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,320
And there's like this worship by the collectivist of Obama.

1657
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:47,760
They're not just acting like they worship him.

1658
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,480
They really get off on the power of the state.

1659
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:55,640
They really get off on the idea that the president can do anything.

1660
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:59,960
Well, government is always in competition with God.

1661
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,220
They would like to displace God.

1662
01:44:01,220 --> 01:44:04,920
They look back to ancient Babylon or Egypt or whatever those regimes where the government

1663
01:44:04,920 --> 01:44:05,920
actually was God.

1664
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,120
I mean, that's their ideal.

1665
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,120
They don't like religion.

1666
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:10,120
They don't like God.

1667
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:15,320
That's why Obama made himself a religious figure at that new town, took over the parents'

1668
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:20,280
grief and just tried to put all the attention on himself, on the alleged first responders,

1669
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:26,000
of course, the no responders as usual, and onto the government and worship the government,

1670
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,600
worship me as the God King.

1671
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,520
Sure, of course, that's right.

1672
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,760
The government would like to be God.

1673
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:35,000
So they're always in competition.

1674
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,520
They don't like religion.

1675
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:38,520
That's the way they are.

1676
01:44:38,520 --> 01:44:40,940
In competition, we have to hate and fear the government.

1677
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:42,960
The government is the worst.

1678
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:47,360
The state is mankind's worst earthly enemy, always has been.

1679
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:52,040
It's what tyrannizes us, taxes us, starts all these wars in cahoots, of course, with

1680
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,680
big corporations.

1681
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,600
And so we have to mentally toughen ourselves.

1682
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,200
We have to educate ourselves.

1683
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,700
We have to talk to others.

1684
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:06,040
We have to withdraw our consent and refuse our consent and don't obey these people to

1685
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:08,160
the extent we can safely get away with it.

1686
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:14,880
They can't actually, because they are a minority and the oppressed of the vast majority, they

1687
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:18,520
can't actually enforce this stuff on us if we refuse.

1688
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:22,160
And again, why I think they've gone too far this time, I think the American people are

1689
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:27,720
going to refuse if people like you and the rest of us keep counseling them about this

1690
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:33,540
and about what the consequences are if we just go along and just salaam Obama.

1691
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:38,640
So I actually think this is going to be a good development, as horrendous as all this

1692
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:43,800
stuff is right now, as horrendous and talk about Obama accuses people like you of trying

1693
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:44,800
to gin up fear.

1694
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:46,360
That's all he does every day.

1695
01:45:46,360 --> 01:45:52,000
All the terrorists under the bed or Al-Qaeda's in Yemen or there's going to be a bombing,

1696
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,240
there's going to be all these phony terrorist incidents here at home.

1697
01:45:56,240 --> 01:46:00,800
That's the government, the government lives by ginning up fear and therefore wanting people

1698
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:01,800
to turn over their lives.

1699
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,840
Think about this, our founding fathers and in history and common sense has shown fear

1700
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:07,200
of big government.

1701
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:10,520
That's what America is all about, keep it small, look at the prosperity.

1702
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:13,680
Instead, they're like, there's people saying fear of the government and that the government

1703
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,680
might want to do something bad.

1704
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:19,240
No, we're just the biggest killers in history, trampling all your other rides, NDAA, Endo

1705
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,880
Habeas Corpus, warrantless wiretapping, secret torture camps discovered.

1706
01:46:23,880 --> 01:46:28,280
Obama promised to never take our guns, but now we're lying because we say they want our

1707
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,400
guns to oppress us.

1708
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:32,540
I mean, it just is incredible that they're doing this.

1709
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:34,880
Look at some of the mfoawards.com headlines.

1710
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:39,320
Mayor predicts Waco-style standoff in response to Obama gun confiscation.

1711
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,920
Gun permit forms question possible affiliation with anti-government organizations, that's

1712
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:44,920
the new forms.

1713
01:46:44,920 --> 01:46:48,920
You see, the terrorists are those libertarians.

1714
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:52,240
Mississippi governor vows to block Obama gun orders.

1715
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:56,760
Philadelphia mayor declares economic warfare on gun retailers.

1716
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:00,600
Just in a video, New York Democrats plan for gun confiscation.

1717
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:02,400
There's video, I haven't even gotten to that.

1718
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:07,240
Lou, let me play this clip of the Philadelphia mayor saying we're gonna go after the gun

1719
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:09,640
shops, here it is.

1720
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:14,720
Philadelphia was one of the first pension funds to divest from companies doing business

1721
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:16,260
in South Africa.

1722
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:24,560
We saw that movement go all across this country, in virtually every big city and other cities

1723
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:30,800
in America, some states and other investment fund managers took action.

1724
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:38,360
Cities, schools and other organizations can influence important societal change with their

1725
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:39,920
investments.

1726
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:43,480
Americans have economic power in how we choose to spend our money.

1727
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:44,920
All right, let's stop right there.

1728
01:47:44,920 --> 01:47:45,920
It gets worse.

1729
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,680
I must say, I think it's a great thing.

1730
01:47:47,680 --> 01:47:50,160
I hope government sells all its gun stocks.

1731
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:53,640
It means that for those of us who wanna buy them, they'll be cheaper.

1732
01:47:53,640 --> 01:47:55,480
So why should government own stock anyway?

1733
01:47:55,480 --> 01:48:02,800
What the heck is the mayor of Philadelphia doing owning stock at the expense of the taxpayers?

1734
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:03,920
That's an outrage.

1735
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:09,640
Forget it, Mr. Mayor, but it's getting a reminder that government is a liar, is an oppressor,

1736
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:13,880
and everything that comes out of their mouth is a lie or a threat.

1737
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:17,960
You look at the bottom of your parking ticket there, threatening your life, put you in jail

1738
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,080
and so forth.

1739
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:22,760
This is government, it's thugs incorporated.

1740
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:23,840
Don't compare it to the mafia.

1741
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:25,120
They're far worse than the mafia.

1742
01:48:25,120 --> 01:48:26,120
You're right.

1743
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:27,120
The mafia is not all bad.

1744
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:31,600
I mean, they supply services people wanna have that are outlawed by the government.

1745
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,800
They have an unfortunate means of enforcement being in the black market.

1746
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:35,800
No, no, you're right.

1747
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:36,800
They are historically better than the government.

1748
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,320
But I mean, let's see, there's nothing worse.

1749
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,800
Let's expand on this because you're absolutely right.

1750
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,800
This is what Eisenhower warned about where at his time, 86% of all scientific funding

1751
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:48,760
was government steered by DARPA.

1752
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:53,200
Now it's over 92%, last time I checked, MIT put out a report last year bragging about

1753
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:55,920
it, 92% directed by these kids.

1754
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:00,600
And now they take our tax money, invest it, and now they're gonna use our money in the

1755
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:04,800
market to try to wreck businesses that supply services we want.

1756
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,560
I mean, these people are incredible.

1757
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:11,200
Thanks for bringing this up because think of how much poorer we are as a society and

1758
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:15,780
in terms of good inventions and new companies and so forth, that all this scientific and

1759
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:21,440
engineering talent is taken out of the market producing goods and services for the people

1760
01:49:21,440 --> 01:49:27,360
and diverted into making bombs and poison gas and all kinds of weapons of mass destruction

1761
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,400
and drones and just methods of killing people.

1762
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:34,680
I mean, they're part of Murder Incorporated.

1763
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:39,600
So the fact that these tens of maybe hundreds of thousands of smart engineers and scientists

1764
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:43,420
are again taken out of the market where they could produce things and make our lives better

1765
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:47,680
and themselves make a good living from it and put into this killing operation.

1766
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,880
What an outrage.

1767
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:49,880
What a disaster.

1768
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:54,440
So the government doesn't only oppress us in terms of our rights and ideals, it makes

1769
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,440
us much poorer.

1770
01:49:55,440 --> 01:49:59,000
We're much poorer because of the activities of the federal government.

1771
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:05,040
All its wars, it's police state, it's spying, it's interventions, it's corporate state subsidization,

1772
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,900
it's fascist economic system with the big banks and the big corporations.

1773
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:11,240
It's taking the average Americans going like that to them.

1774
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:16,520
I know an inventor, I know an engineer and inventor who's worth hundreds of millions

1775
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:17,520
of dollars.

1776
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:18,520
I'll just leave it at that.

1777
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:22,320
And he talked about since the 70s, he's an old guy now, a lot of incredible inventions

1778
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:23,600
that were made at big companies.

1779
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:27,560
He was running as top technologist that they, the government would come like in Raiders

1780
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:31,120
of the Lost Ark, take it under executive power.

1781
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:34,600
Like you're not allowed to develop this and pay them and then go shelve it.

1782
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,720
So, so they're also holding back our civilization.

1783
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:38,720
That's right.

1784
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:41,680
Alan, Alex, you're exactly right.

1785
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:42,680
It is incredible.

1786
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:43,680
Lou Rockwell.

1787
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,680
Lourockwell.com is our guest.

1788
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:49,240
Got a couple more clips with him in the next segment where they say that, you know, gun

1789
01:50:49,240 --> 01:50:51,400
owners are like Hitler.

1790
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,600
We've got to defeat Hitler and more coming up.

1791
01:50:54,600 --> 01:51:09,480
Stay with us.

1792
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:30,080
Thanks, gentlemen, for

1793
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:31,780
We just can't sell as new.

1794
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:34,780
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse

1795
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:37,660
and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.

1796
01:51:37,660 --> 01:51:39,860
We call them scratch and dent units,

1797
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,600
but they're really just like new.

1798
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:44,020
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty

1799
01:51:44,020 --> 01:51:46,820
and special bonuses you just won't believe.

1800
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:48,460

The big game hunting ranch, goldandstagsafaris.com.

1816
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:03,140
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger,

1817
01:53:03,140 --> 01:53:04,420
author of the bestselling book,

1818
01:53:04,420 --> 01:53:06,660
Cancer Step Outside the Box.

1819
01:53:06,660 --> 01:53:09,500
I want you to know some very important information.

1820
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:12,460
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested

1821
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:15,100
that carnivora be sent directly to the White House

1822
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:16,620
at a time when only the president

1823
01:53:16,620 --> 01:53:18,620
could obtain this world-class healer.

1824
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:20,660
Now, 27 years later,

1825
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,620
carnivora capsules are used around the world

1826
01:53:22,620 --> 01:53:24,140
to keep people healthy.

1827
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,500
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones

1828
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:27,820
in this age of superbugs

1829
01:53:27,820 --> 01:53:30,620
with 17 naturally occurring compounds

1830
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,460
that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only

1831
01:53:33,460 --> 01:53:35,500
without harming a single normal cell.

1832
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:36,900
If you want to stay healthy,

1833
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:38,580
now's your chance to literally wake up

1834
01:53:38,580 --> 01:53:41,340
your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders

1835
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:43,220
that don't belong in your body.

1836
01:53:43,220 --> 01:53:47,540
Call 1-866-Venus-Fly or order from carnivora.com.

1837
01:53:47,540 --> 01:53:51,140
That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.

1838
01:53:51,140 --> 01:53:54,460
That's 1-866-836-8735,

1839
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:58,380

1840
01:53:58,380 --> 01:53:59,620
Protect your immune system.

1841
01:53:59,620 --> 01:54:01,060
It's the only one you've got.

1842
01:54:13,420 --> 01:54:16,020
We got two short segments left with Lou Rockwell,

1843
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:19,860
and he and I are literally chomping at the bit,

1844
01:54:19,860 --> 01:54:22,020
you know, jumping over each other to fight for liberty

1845
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:27,020
because it's so disgusting to watch mafia opportunists,

1846
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:32,140
insider trading criminals use these little kids

1847
01:54:32,140 --> 01:54:34,620
and then sit there lecturing us

1848
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:37,060
that we're bad in the pro-gun lobby.

1849
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:38,620
It's never the Second Amendment.

1850
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,660
It's never the individual.

1851
01:54:40,660 --> 01:54:43,420
It's that we're bad and we're Klan members.

1852
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:45,180
We're murder enablers.

1853
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,380
I'm going to play a Bob Shafer clip

1854
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,980
where he talks about our presidents have defeated,

1855
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:52,700
you know, Hitler and gotten the Civil Rights Act,

1856
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:55,220
and we can defeat the gun lobby.

1857
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:59,220
I mean, it's a whole new level of this.

1858
01:54:59,220 --> 01:55:02,380
I mean, is it just that I'm getting older and less,

1859
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:07,060
you know, less where I can't put up with this anymore,

1860
01:55:07,060 --> 01:55:09,420
Lou Rockwell, or is it that it's getting worse?

1861
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:11,540
You've been fighting these guys for four decades.

1862
01:55:11,540 --> 01:55:12,740
I mean, is it getting worse

1863
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,420
or is it just that we're becoming more aware

1864
01:55:14,420 --> 01:55:16,020
of their disgusting activity?

1865
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:16,860
Well, it's both.

1866
01:55:16,860 --> 01:55:19,660
They're getting worse and we're getting more outraged by it

1867
01:55:19,660 --> 01:55:22,620
and more dedicated to fighting it.

1868
01:55:22,620 --> 01:55:26,300
But my guess is nobody listening to this show

1869
01:55:26,300 --> 01:55:28,620
has ever bombed a party of children

1870
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:32,060
collecting firewood in a rural area.

1871
01:55:32,060 --> 01:55:33,780
Obama has done that.

1872
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:37,060
How many, he's actually killed a bunch of children,

1873
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:38,740
and yet he's, personally,

1874
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:41,140
he's authorized the drone strikes

1875
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:43,420
that killed these children in a number of instances,

1876
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,100
wedding parties and so forth.

1877
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:47,700
So he's actually killed children

1878
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:52,220
and he's lecturing us about killing children.

1879
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:55,620
The hypocrisy has got a capital H

1880
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:57,700
and it's all in neon letters.

1881
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:00,180
Well, you're right.

1882
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:02,660
And that's what's so incredible is that they just say,

1883
01:56:02,660 --> 01:56:06,660
oh, we bombed a wedding, killed 154 in one case.

1884
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:08,380
And yeah, about 18 children died,

1885
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:10,980
four or five others, you know, critically wounded.

1886
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,420
But it's like, that's collateral damage, move forward.

1887
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:15,900
But then, oh, these children, turn your guns in.

1888
01:56:17,140 --> 01:56:18,380
It's so fake.

1889
01:56:19,300 --> 01:56:20,660
It is fake, they couldn't care less.

1890
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:22,820
But of course, as Rahm Emanuel says,

1891
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,740
never let a good crisis go to waste.

1892
01:56:24,740 --> 01:56:28,180
And so they use any crisis to try to expand the government,

1893
01:56:28,180 --> 01:56:30,700
expand its income, expand its control,

1894
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:33,580
and make us, they try to make us more obedient,

1895
01:56:33,580 --> 01:56:35,420
more kowtowing.

1896
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:40,020
And again, I think if we do our job

1897
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:43,540
and thousands and thousands of other people do their jobs,

1898
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:45,140
this is not going to work this time.

1899
01:56:45,140 --> 01:56:47,340
They're not actually going to get away with it.

1900
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:48,860
It's going to backfire.

1901
01:56:48,860 --> 01:56:51,140
It's already backfiring 10 million guns a month now

1902
01:56:51,140 --> 01:56:52,540
from up from 4 million.

1903
01:56:52,540 --> 01:56:53,780
Let's play a clip of Bob Shafer.

1904
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:56,380
This is nothing, folks, compared to the longer thing

1905
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:58,300
with Mika Brzezinski, where she goes,

1906
01:56:58,300 --> 01:57:00,460
I'm just ashamed to be an American right now.

1907
01:57:00,460 --> 01:57:01,500
I mean, what?

1908
01:57:01,500 --> 01:57:02,460
Because we have guns.

1909
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,180
Well, get out and go to North Korea.

1910
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:05,460
Here's a clip of Bob Shafer.

1911
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:07,620
I want to get Lou Rockwell's response.

1912
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:10,180
What happened in Newtown was probably

1913
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:14,860
the worst day in this country's history since 9-11.

1914
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:17,180
We found Osama bin Laden.

1915
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:18,380
We tracked him down.

1916
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:22,500
We changed the way that we dealt with that problem.

1917
01:57:22,500 --> 01:57:25,580
Surely, finding Osama bin Laden, surely

1918
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:27,700
passing civil rights legislation,

1919
01:57:27,700 --> 01:57:30,660
as Lyndon Johnson was able to do, and before that,

1920
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:35,620
surely defeating the Nazis was a much more formidable task

1921
01:57:35,620 --> 01:57:38,420
than taking on the gun lobby.

1922
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:40,340
This is a turning point.

1923
01:57:40,340 --> 01:57:41,580
That's enough of that, idiot.

1924
01:57:41,580 --> 01:57:42,700
You're not even an idiot.

1925
01:57:42,700 --> 01:57:46,300
I mean, what a slimy little creature.

1926
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:48,180
The government got in the way of beating Hitler

1927
01:57:48,180 --> 01:57:49,760
with all the bed-rigging and stealing.

1928
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,140
It was my grandfather's and people that beat Hitler.

1929
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,300
I mean, what do you say to that?

1930
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:56,700
Well, Bob Shafer, of course, has gotten rich and powerful

1931
01:57:56,700 --> 01:57:59,380
off doing whatever the government told him to do.

1932
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:05,500
So he's just like somebody on Nazi radio or Soviet radio

1933
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:07,220
that he's just a shill.

1934
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:09,220
There is one interesting thing, if you notice.

1935
01:58:09,220 --> 01:58:11,940
When he talks about the government, he says we.

1936
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:14,420
So it's just a reminder of it's so important for us

1937
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:17,320
to never say we when we mean the government.

1938
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,580
The government is they.

1939
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:21,220
It's a separate entity, lives off of us by force.

1940
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:23,980
It's a parasitical entity that keeps a gun to our head,

1941
01:58:23,980 --> 01:58:25,180
speaking of guns.

1942
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:27,540
I mean, everything the government does involves a gun.

1943
01:58:27,540 --> 01:58:29,380
You don't do what we say if you don't pay the taxes,

1944
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:31,380
you don't pay this library bill or whatever.

1945
01:58:31,380 --> 01:58:32,220
Exactly.

1946
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:35,380
We claim the right to kill you if you sufficiently

1947
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:36,260
resist.

1948
01:58:36,260 --> 01:58:37,180
That's the government.

1949
01:58:37,180 --> 01:58:38,380
Do one more segment with us.

1950
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:39,020
Five more minutes.

1951
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:40,020
We've got to go to break.

1952
01:58:40,020 --> 01:58:42,980

01:58:42,980 --> 01:58:46,500

Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks

1956
01:58:54,700 --> 01:58:57,300
adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick

1957
01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:57,900
and die?

1958
01:58:57,900 --> 01:59:00,340
Start purifying your water with Pro Pure.

1959
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:02,220
My friends, I've done a lot of research.

1960
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:05,060
And the best gravity filter out there, bar none,

1961
01:59:05,060 --> 01:59:06,100
is Pro Pure.

1962
01:59:06,100 --> 01:59:09,460
And it's available discounted at infowars.com.

1963
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:11,380
Its filters are silver impregnated

1964
01:59:11,380 --> 01:59:12,940
to prevent bacterial growth.

1965
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:14,580
There's no priming required.

1966
01:59:14,580 --> 01:59:16,860
It's NSF 42 certified.

1967
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:20,420
Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95%.

1968
01:59:20,420 --> 01:59:21,980
Easy to set up and use.

1969
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,420
Doesn't require electricity.

1970
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:26,580
Purify water from lakes, streams, ponds, and wells.

1971
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:29,180
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,

1972
01:59:29,180 --> 01:59:29,940
which is key.

1973
01:59:29,940 --> 01:59:31,900
Save money by not buying bottled water

1974
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:34,100
and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

1975
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:36,860
Pro Pure is the best gravity fed filter out there.

1976
01:59:36,860 --> 01:59:38,380
It's what my family uses.

1977
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:41,740
Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Pro Pure.

Waging war on corruption.

1982
01:59:57,780 --> 02:00:07,140
Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1983
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:11,980
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

1984
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:13,540
You want answers?

1985
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:15,100
Well, so does he.

1986
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:19,260
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

1987
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:23,220
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1988
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:27,700
OK, the whole clip is up on infowars.com.

1989
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:29,300
It's also over at Newsbusters.

1990
02:00:29,300 --> 02:00:32,660
They're the ones that originally posted it.

1991
02:00:32,660 --> 02:00:34,180
And I can't play the whole thing.

1992
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,540
Lou's got to go in five minutes.

1993
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:37,300
And it's about a five minute clip.

1994
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,660
They play the NRA ad.

1995
02:00:38,660 --> 02:00:40,380
First they go, this is pornography.

1996
02:00:40,380 --> 02:00:41,380
This is propaganda.

1997
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:42,180
This is evil.

1998
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:46,420
This discredits the NRA on the Morning Joe show.

1999
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:48,500
And then they play the NRA going, hey, the government

2000
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:49,940
people, they've got armed bodyguards.

2001
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:51,460
Why don't we go to the NBA?

2002
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:53,460
They've got armed bodyguards, why don't we?

2003
02:00:53,460 --> 02:00:56,100
And they take their glasses off and they go, he goes,

2004
02:00:56,100 --> 02:00:56,900
I can't believe this.

2005
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:59,780
His poor children fight hard and had no choice.

2006
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:02,260
And Mika goes, I'm just ashamed to be an American right now.

2007
02:01:02,260 --> 02:01:02,900
I'm ashamed.

2008
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,700
And again, this is very effective.

2009
02:01:05,700 --> 02:01:07,940
That's why they go, this discredits.

2010
02:01:07,940 --> 02:01:09,620
Hoping we don't go down this line.

2011
02:01:09,620 --> 02:01:11,220
It is incredibly transparent.

2012
02:01:12,020 --> 02:01:13,700
I want to play part of this clip.

2013
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:14,980
And again, you got to watch the whole thing.

2014
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:16,980
It's unbelievable, the bad acting.

2015
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:18,340
Again, they run from this.

2016
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:20,020
Oh, don't say Israel has guns.

2017
02:01:20,020 --> 02:01:21,460
None of the citizens do over there.

2018
02:01:21,460 --> 02:01:22,180
You're a liar.

2019
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:24,020
Of course, we pay to give the Israelis guns.

2020
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:27,300
Again, because they're so scared of this thing that government

2021
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:30,740
and bureaucrats and rich people have guns because they use class warfare.

2022
02:01:30,740 --> 02:01:33,460
The ultimate populism is the average person with a gun.

2023
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,980
Let's play the clip and get Lou Rockwell's take.

2024
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:35,460
Here it is.

2025
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:38,100
That's a real ad.

2026
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:40,580
Yeah, that's a real ad.

2027
02:01:40,580 --> 02:01:42,100
Political pornography.

2028
02:01:43,140 --> 02:01:45,460
That's one of the grossest things I've ever seen in my life.

2029
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:47,380
It's like, oh my gosh, that's George Washington.

2030
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:49,060
What's wrong with these people, Mika?

2031
02:01:49,060 --> 02:01:51,300
What's wrong with these people, Mika?

2032
02:01:51,300 --> 02:01:55,300
You have children that had no say in the decision

2033
02:01:55,860 --> 02:01:58,260
on whether their father was going to step forward.

2034
02:01:58,260 --> 02:02:01,700
Her father, by the way, writes books bragging about how he uplifted Paul Pothead.

2035
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,100
The one for president, one of the most bone crushing.

2036
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:06,020
Her father is an architect of mass murder.

2037
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:08,980
The husband or wife can do to their family.

2038
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:10,100
That woman is a pig.

2039
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:15,460
And the second they make that decision, their children and their entire family

2040
02:02:15,460 --> 02:02:17,620
have targets on their backs.

2041
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:19,540
Oh, my gosh, targets on their backs.

2042
02:02:20,260 --> 02:02:21,860
Oh, they want to hurt Obama's children.

2043
02:02:21,860 --> 02:02:24,820
No, you want our guns.

2044
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:27,540
What's wrong with these people?

2045
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:28,260
What's wrong?

2046
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:30,580
I don't know what's wrong with a dead intern in your office.

2047
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:34,900
On the anniversary of the Newtown murders and now putting out an ad

2048
02:02:35,860 --> 02:02:37,940
talking about the president's daughters?

2049
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:39,780
They are out of step, out of the mainstream.

2050
02:02:39,780 --> 02:02:43,060
No, they pointed out he's got bodyguards and so does David Gregory.

2051
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:47,140
And quite frankly, after seeing that, I think some of the people who run that thing

2052
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:48,180
are sick.

2053
02:02:48,180 --> 02:02:49,380
I really do.

2054
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:51,300
I think they are sick in the head.

2055
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:52,420
And I'm serious.

2056
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:54,500
I'm embarrassed right now.

2057
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,660
I'm embarrassed for our country.

2058
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,420
Well, get out of it and go to North Korea.

2059
02:02:58,420 --> 02:02:59,780
We're the only the state has guns.

2060
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:01,060
Lou Rockwell, we got two minutes left.

2061
02:03:01,060 --> 02:03:02,260
You've got the floor.

2062
02:03:02,260 --> 02:03:03,460
Your take on that.

2063
02:03:03,460 --> 02:03:07,940
Well, obviously, Mika and Joe are themselves protected by armed bodyguards,

2064
02:03:07,940 --> 02:03:11,060
but they do feel, you know, they my guess is this really does upset them

2065
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:13,380
because they don't like this sort of thing being made public.

2066
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:15,940
That the power elite is, of course, got guns.

2067
02:03:15,940 --> 02:03:17,380
They all have carry permits.

2068
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:19,540
I'm sure Mika and Joe have got carry permits.

2069
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:24,260
Certainly, they've got armed bodyguards, just like they believe that the law is doesn't

2070
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:24,820
apply to them.

2071
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:26,820
It's only to be applied against us.

2072
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:28,180
So this is the nature of their part.

2073
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:31,220
They're part of the power elite or their spokesman for the power elite.

2074
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,140
And of course, they're outraged that anybody would discuss their privileges and their special

2075
02:03:35,140 --> 02:03:38,020
rights and the fact that they can live differently than the rest of us.

2076
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:43,540
So it's all the more important to point out not only that these people are doing bad things

2077
02:03:43,540 --> 02:03:46,180
politically, but they're they're personally ripping us off.

2078
02:03:46,180 --> 02:03:47,780
And they're all surrounded by guns.

2079
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:49,300
Obama's surrounded by guns.

2080
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:51,860
His children's school has got a bunch of armed guards.

2081
02:03:51,860 --> 02:03:54,180
And of course, they have armed guards all the time.

2082
02:03:54,180 --> 02:03:56,660
Bloomberg has got armed guards all around him.

2083
02:03:56,660 --> 02:03:59,220
And Obama just signed a bill giving himself and George W.

2084
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:02,660
Bush armed guards for the rest of their lives 24 7.

2085
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,180
So it's OK for them to have armed guards, but the people can't have armed guards.

2086
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:08,100
So this is this is this is government.

2087
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:09,940
It's a separate entity.

2088
02:04:09,940 --> 02:04:14,900
And it's an outrage to do anything but bow down and kiss their shoes.

2089
02:04:14,900 --> 02:04:17,300
I mean, that's that's what Mika is upset about.

2090
02:04:17,300 --> 02:04:18,180
And you're exactly right.

2091
02:04:18,180 --> 02:04:24,340
Her dad deliberately helped lure the Soviets into Afghanistan, causing many, many deaths.

2092
02:04:24,340 --> 02:04:28,820
He promoted mass murder in Vietnam and the coming of Pol Pot.

2093
02:04:28,820 --> 02:04:33,060
Pol Pot was put in his book and then the rest of the rest of them.

2094
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:34,180
He brags.

2095
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,540
He brags in his book.

2096
02:04:35,540 --> 02:04:38,100
I'm sure you know about how great Pol Pot did.

2097
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:40,020
I mean, it's it's incredible.

2098
02:04:40,020 --> 02:04:44,500
You know, the U.S. government in the Vietnam War killed between four and six million people,

2099
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:47,380
says the great military historian Martin Van Crevel.

2100
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:50,500
Between four and six million people just in that one war.

2101
02:04:50,500 --> 02:04:53,220
They don't have their names on any wall in Washington.

2102
02:04:53,220 --> 02:04:55,780
So this is the government knee deep in blood,

2103
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:59,940
killing people every day and lecturing us about the dangers of violence.

2104
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:01,140
Well said, Lou Rockwell.

2105
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:01,540
Thank you.

2106
02:05:02,340 --> 02:05:05,380
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

2107
02:05:05,380 --> 02:05:10,420
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

2108
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:13,460
The globalist model is to shut down societies

2109
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:17,700
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

2110
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:19,460
That's why we've assembled the most vital

2111
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:23,380
and important preparedness items at Infowarshop.com.

2112
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:27,380
These are items that I did research on that I personally use.

2113
02:05:27,380 --> 02:05:32,100
We've got the life straw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

2114
02:05:32,100 --> 02:05:35,540
The Ktor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment

2115
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:37,620
during power outages or out in the field.

2116
02:05:37,620 --> 02:05:40,820
Strategic relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.

2117
02:05:40,820 --> 02:05:43,300
When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein.

2118
02:05:43,300 --> 02:05:45,540
Ferro safe used by Homeland Security

2119
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:48,100
to protect yourself during any radiological event.

2120
02:05:48,100 --> 02:05:50,980
Hand crank shortwave AM FM radios.

2121
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:55,540
Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com.

We're getting prepared.

2124
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:00,100
Are you?

2125
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:02,260
Infowarsshop.com.

2126
02:06:02,260 --> 02:06:06,180
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive?

2127
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:10,180
From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought

2128
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:13,700
to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

2129
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:16,340
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2130
02:06:16,340 --> 02:06:20,100
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to

2131
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,980
weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2132
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:26,180
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote,

2133
02:06:26,180 --> 02:06:31,300
almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

2134
02:06:31,300 --> 02:06:33,460
to be able to help my sister and niece.

2135
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:37,380
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2136
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:39,540
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

2137
02:06:39,540 --> 02:06:41,780

2142
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:05,620
Now that we have moved into the winter season,

2143
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:09,060
there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

2144
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:12,820
At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs

2145
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:15,780
by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

2146
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:21,620
Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce Nano Silver Solutions.

2147
02:07:21,620 --> 02:07:26,740
Our 2-ounce Nano Silver Nasal Applicators as well as our all-natural silver soaps.

2148
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:30,820
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

2149
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:35,060
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents

2150
02:07:35,060 --> 02:07:37,940
which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

2151
02:07:38,580 --> 02:07:41,220
But rather, we have formulated our silver gel

2152
02:07:41,220 --> 02:07:44,340
using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

2153
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:49,140
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

2154
02:07:49,140 --> 02:07:54,260
Visit www.SilverLungs.com and click on our store page

2155

2156
02:07:56,980 --> 02:08:21,540
That's www.SilverLungs.com

2157
02:08:26,980 --> 02:08:29,540
It's Alex Jones.

2158
02:08:57,060 --> 02:09:00,100
He's down there visiting friends in Austin, so we thought we'd have him come in.

2159
02:09:00,660 --> 02:09:03,940
And we are more and more every week going to have radio stations in focus.

2160
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:08,820
In fact, radio station managers or owners that want to pop in for 15 minutes once a week or so,

2161
02:09:09,460 --> 02:09:13,540
we want to try to get our 140-plus affiliates, managers and owners,

2162
02:09:13,540 --> 02:09:14,820
you know, get their take on things

2163
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:19,060
and also try to focus in on some of the things their stations are doing

2164
02:09:19,060 --> 02:09:22,260
because that is so, so incredibly important.

2165
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:30,100
1530wckg.com is the website, 1530wckg.com.

2166
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:35,780
And I do want to travel around to, especially our bigger stations, and give speeches.

2167
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:38,020
And I've told the Dallas station I'm going to go up and do that.

2168
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:39,620
I just have been so slammed with everything.

2169
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:42,500
As everyone's seen, I barely have time to even see my family.

2170
02:09:42,500 --> 02:09:45,540
But we do want to do events with listeners as well

2171
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,380
because it's important to get out there.

2172
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:53,860
But the bare minimum I can do is promote our affiliates and some of the things they're doing.

2173
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:55,620
Okay, I want to play just a few minutes of this.

2174
02:09:56,660 --> 02:09:59,940
And we're going to load the phones up for your take on what Obama did yesterday,

2175
02:09:59,940 --> 02:10:04,020
specifically on the Second Amendment and the all-out assault on our liberties.

2176
02:10:04,020 --> 02:10:08,980
And these mayors and people saying, we'll just shut down gun shows outside of law.

2177
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:11,140
Austin tried to do it, but people beat it.

2178
02:10:11,140 --> 02:10:12,740
And where I live, this is happening.

2179
02:10:13,860 --> 02:10:15,060
And it was because of the backlash.

2180
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:19,060
They had the votes to shut down the gun shows, even private ones, not on government property.

2181
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:21,780
So they're really coming.

2182
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:24,020
And it's because they know they're collapsing the economy.

2183
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:26,260
And they know that they could end up losing control of the country.

2184
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:28,660
But we are in the fight of the century.

2185
02:10:28,660 --> 02:10:29,700
We're in the fight of our lives.

2186
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:31,620
The NRA has said that, I agree with them.

2187
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:33,300
I said that before they said it.

2188
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:36,500
This video is up on infowars.com.

2189
02:10:37,220 --> 02:10:39,540
And it's Obama Responds to Alex Jones.

2190
02:10:40,260 --> 02:10:44,580
It is in the featured news section.

2191
02:10:44,580 --> 02:10:45,860
It's the bottom story.

2192
02:10:45,860 --> 02:10:49,460
It is so important to click that featured story archive there at the bottom.

2193
02:10:49,460 --> 02:10:52,180
There's so many of the top stories scroll off the front page.

2194
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:55,380
We've got to develop some other section like Drudge Report does,

2195
02:10:55,380 --> 02:10:57,300
where the really important stuff he keeps on top.

2196
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:00,500
And then it's always changing in the middle and the bottom.

2197
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:02,740
I just, it drives me crazy.

2198
02:11:02,740 --> 02:11:05,620
But the featured news archive is so important.

2199
02:11:05,620 --> 02:11:08,340
It's also red linked at the top, just breaking news.

2200
02:11:08,340 --> 02:11:09,540
That's the news feed.

2201
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:11,460
Top Stories is the featured news archive.

2202
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:15,380
Those two links are so important there on the top to be sure and go through that.

2203
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:18,660
Let's play a few minutes of this 14-minute report.

2204
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:20,340
I meant to play the whole thing today.

2205
02:11:20,340 --> 02:11:27,060
Maybe we'll play part of it tomorrow when Paul Watson is guest hosting the broadcast.

2206
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:29,300
I think Mike Adams is gonna be a guest via Skype.

2207
02:11:29,300 --> 02:11:33,140
But the point is, and they got some big breaking news tomorrow.

2208
02:11:33,140 --> 02:11:36,820
Everybody's demanding we look at false flag at Newtown.

2209
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:38,820
And it's Sandy.

2210
02:11:38,820 --> 02:11:41,780
Look, it's got all the signs of it.

2211
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,460
It looks really bad, okay?

2212
02:11:43,460 --> 02:11:50,100
And I've just stayed out of it cuz I know they can crucify people with the information

2213
02:11:50,100 --> 02:11:52,020
if it's not 100% nailed down.

2214
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:53,060
It's got all the earmarks.

2215
02:11:53,060 --> 02:11:56,900
We're gonna hear from some of the people that are saying this.

2216
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:58,580
And it doesn't mean I agree with all of it.

2217
02:11:58,580 --> 02:11:59,940
There's a lot of signs.

2218
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:01,220
I mean, we know they put them on the drugs.

2219
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:02,980
We know we got the gun illegally.

2220
02:12:02,980 --> 02:12:05,060
We know they're blaming us for stuff we couldn't control.

2221
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:06,900
We know they made them victim disarmament.

2222
02:12:06,900 --> 02:12:09,300
We know they made them victim disarmament zone.

2223
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:15,540
But some of the other stuff, were the whole things a hoax?

2224
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,460
No, they killed some real people there.

2225
02:12:18,340 --> 02:12:19,620
It does have the signs.

2226
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:24,020
I mean, the Batman shooting in Aurora, I'll say that stage.

2227
02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:26,180
And even Larry Pratt has said it has all the marks.

2228
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:27,940
I mean, they did Fast and Furious.

2229
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:29,140
So they may have done this.

2230
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:33,780
I mean, if they'll bomb a whole apartment building to get one, quote, terrorist and

2231
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:37,060
kill 200 people, a bunch of them kids, of course they'll do this stuff.

2232
02:12:39,220 --> 02:12:42,500
But I don't know about Sandy Hook.

2233
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:44,100
They're gonna look at that some tomorrow.

2234
02:12:44,100 --> 02:12:46,740
Watson is somewhat of a skeptic, but we're gonna look at it

2235
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:48,260
cuz you're beating our doors down to do it.

2236
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:49,700
That's all we've been doing is looking at it.

2237
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:52,900
Believe me, that's all people are doing is it looks real bad.

2238
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:55,940
But it's so over the top that I can't 100% prove it.

2239
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:59,140
I mean, with 9-11, they were saying, we're gonna blow up building seven.

2240
02:12:59,140 --> 02:12:59,860
And then they blew it up.

2241
02:12:59,860 --> 02:13:04,420
And I have the news footage, and they call me a kook when I show CNN and BBC,

2242
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:06,100
saying, get back, they're blowing it up.

2243
02:13:06,100 --> 02:13:07,700
And they go, what, are the cops involved?

2244
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:10,660
I go, no, they told the cops get back, they're gonna blow it up, then told them shut up.

2245
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:14,020
It was a CIA building, they blew it up.

2246
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:14,820
I don't know why.

2247
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:19,540
I talked to the head emergency manager who died a few weeks after he was on my show,

2248
02:13:20,420 --> 02:13:21,140
Barry Jennings.

2249
02:13:21,140 --> 02:13:22,980
I mean, this is scary, okay?

2250
02:13:23,700 --> 02:13:25,460
I'm not saying there aren't Muslim extremists.

2251
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:28,260
I'm not saying, the point is there's criminal elements

2252
02:13:28,260 --> 02:13:32,180
in these mega banks, I mean, look how they're funding Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria right now.

2253
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:33,380
See, I'm already ranting.

2254
02:13:33,380 --> 02:13:37,140
Total free number to join us, 800-259-9231.

2255
02:13:37,140 --> 02:13:42,340
We'll take a few calls before our guest, 800-259-9231.

2256
02:13:43,860 --> 02:13:45,700
We probably wanna start getting the headset and everything ready

2257
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:47,060
in the microphone for him coming in here.

2258
02:13:47,060 --> 02:13:48,260
That's always a good idea.

2259
02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:52,180
800-259-9231 to get some calls in today.

2260
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:55,700
I'm tempted to do an hour of overdrive, but I'm here to meet with our guest after.

2261
02:13:55,700 --> 02:13:58,020
Maybe we'll just go into overdrive with the guests and take calls.

2262
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:01,700
But I've also got to get a bunch of work done, a bunch of projects done.

2263
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:02,900
That's why I'm taking off tomorrow.

2264
02:14:03,460 --> 02:14:04,740
A lot of times I take off now.

2265
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:07,140
It's not even to take off, it's to get stuff done.

2266
02:14:07,140 --> 02:14:10,100
But part of this is actually taking off, be with family.

2267
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:13,540
My children are growing up, I hardly even know them.

2268
02:14:13,540 --> 02:14:16,260
800-259-9231.

2269
02:14:16,260 --> 02:14:17,940
Let's go to part of the video.

2270
02:14:17,940 --> 02:14:20,340
And the whole thing's up on infowars.com.

2271
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:23,540
Obama responds to Alex Jones and they are responding now.

2272
02:14:23,540 --> 02:14:28,020
Here it is.

2273
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:31,780
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists

2274
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:35,460
publicly warning of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.

2275
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:40,420
Alex Jones here for infowars.com with a special report.

2276
02:14:40,420 --> 02:14:43,540
Most people that watch television or even YouTube

2277
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:47,300
know that last Monday I debated Piers Morgan and got in his face

2278
02:14:47,300 --> 02:14:50,980
and said, look, you're coming for our guns to enslave us.

2279
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:53,700
America is becoming a police state tyranny.

2280
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:54,340
Back off.

2281
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:56,580
Hitler took the guns.

2282
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:57,940
Stalin took the guns.

2283
02:14:57,940 --> 02:14:58,900
Mao took the guns.

2284
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:00,580
Fidel Castro took the guns.

2285
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:01,860
Hugo Chavez took the guns.

2286
02:15:01,860 --> 02:15:07,300
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.

2287
02:15:07,300 --> 02:15:10,020
Doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street

2288
02:15:10,020 --> 02:15:11,860
begging for them to have their guns taken.

2289
02:15:11,860 --> 02:15:13,380
We will not relinquish them.

2290
02:15:13,380 --> 02:15:14,340
Do you understand?

2291
02:15:15,300 --> 02:15:19,460
Two days later, Ron Paul came on my show, outgoing congressman, and he agreed.

2292
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:22,900
He said, if they come to the guns, it's going to cause a civil war.

2293
02:15:22,900 --> 02:15:24,900
1776 part two.

2294
02:15:26,020 --> 02:15:27,700
Will you turn in your semi-autos?

2295
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:34,260
Well, I might not even have anything to turn in for that purpose,

2296
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,140
but I don't think the American people will.

2297
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:40,580
I've always assumed that the line in the fan may well be drawn.

2298
02:15:41,620 --> 02:15:45,860
If the federal agent marches in unannounced and they say,

2299
02:15:45,860 --> 02:15:48,100
well, give me your gun and give me your gold.

2300
02:15:48,100 --> 02:15:51,620
I don't think that we'll do that.

2301
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:57,140
You know, Tom, I think the American people will highly resent it and resist.

2302
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:02,820
Now, as soon as I got off Piers Morgan, the White House released a press release

2303
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:07,300
and said they were watching and responded to our petition, your petition,

2304
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:11,540
to deport Piers Morgan for engaging in political subterfuge

2305
02:16:11,540 --> 02:16:15,540
and trying to overthrow our Bill of Rights and Constitution.

2306
02:16:15,540 --> 02:16:16,980
So we know they were watching.

2307
02:16:16,980 --> 02:16:18,740
It became the biggest story in the country

2308
02:16:18,740 --> 02:16:21,380
and the biggest story on Twitter for two days straight.

2309
02:16:21,380 --> 02:16:24,500
It's had like 15 million views online on YouTube alone.

2310
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,420
So we know the White House is watching.

2311
02:16:26,420 --> 02:16:29,780
We also know that it's come out in Homeland Security documents

2312
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:33,700
that myself and Matt Drudge have been basically investigated

2313
02:16:33,700 --> 02:16:37,380
and surveilled and are in secret documents concerning the TSA,

2314
02:16:37,380 --> 02:16:40,020
because we've been covering their out-of-control violations

2315
02:16:40,020 --> 02:16:43,460
of the Fourth Amendment and conditioning the public to basically be slaves.

2316
02:16:43,460 --> 02:16:47,860
But then today, I'm watching his speech while I'm live on the radio playing it.

2317
02:16:48,340 --> 02:16:52,660
And he talks about these pundits out there who just want to make money.

2318
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:56,820
And they say that, you know, we're tyrants who want to enslave you.

2319
02:16:57,860 --> 02:16:58,900
This will be difficult.

2320
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:04,260
There will be pundits and politicians and special interest lobbyists

2321
02:17:04,260 --> 02:17:07,940
publicly warning of a tyrannical all-out assault on liberty.

2322
02:17:07,940 --> 02:17:14,820
Not because that's true, but because they want to gin up fear

2323
02:17:14,820 --> 02:17:17,860
or higher ratings or revenue for themselves.

2324
02:17:20,340 --> 02:17:22,740
And behind the scenes, they'll do everything they can

2325
02:17:23,300 --> 02:17:27,540
to block any common-sense reform and make sure nothing changes whatsoever.

2326
02:17:29,940 --> 02:17:33,780
The only way we will be able to change is if their audience,

2327
02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:36,500
their constituents, their representatives,

2328
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:41,700
their constituents, their membership says this time must be different.

2329
02:17:42,980 --> 02:17:43,940
It was incredible.

2330
02:17:43,940 --> 02:17:47,300
He was clearly going after pundits.

2331
02:17:47,300 --> 02:17:50,820
Talk radio host, chief among them myself.

2332
02:17:50,820 --> 02:17:52,420
And it's just really bizarre.

2333
02:17:52,420 --> 02:17:54,340
I mean, I've had the White House respond to this before

2334
02:17:54,340 --> 02:17:57,380
on their plans to shut down coal-powered plants and a few other issues.

2335
02:17:57,380 --> 02:18:01,060
But this is one of his big initiatives to disarm us.

2336
02:18:01,060 --> 02:18:04,500
And he said in the past he wanted to disarm us as a state senator.

2337
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:07,540
Then as candidate Obama in 2008, he said,

2338
02:18:07,540 --> 02:18:09,220
I'll never try to take your guns.

2339
02:18:09,220 --> 02:18:12,020
That is a conspiracy theory.

2340
02:18:12,020 --> 02:18:15,380
And so now he's back with 23 executive orders and all the rest of it.

2341
02:18:16,100 --> 02:18:17,700
Dianne Feinstein's on record.

2342
02:18:17,700 --> 02:18:21,140
Mr. and Mrs. America, get ready, we're coming for your guns.

2343
02:18:21,140 --> 02:18:25,300
And now out of all these people out there, he's having to respond to me.

2344
02:18:26,260 --> 02:18:27,380
And why is that?

2345
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:32,500
Because I tell it like it is and we have tens of millions of viewers and readers

2346
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,820
and people that listen to the radio show.

2347
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:36,500
It's over 15 million a week.

2348
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:40,180
And their entire paper tiger facade corporate media,

2349
02:18:41,220 --> 02:18:43,700
the top shows on MSNBC have a million.

2350
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:45,300
CNN, a half a million.

2351
02:18:45,300 --> 02:18:48,020
Piers Morgan's ratings doubled all week after I was on.

2352
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:52,260
It's not that I'm something special, it's that people are sick

2353
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:55,540
of these establishment mouthpieces reading off teleprompters.

2354
02:18:55,540 --> 02:18:58,260
So the good news is we're having an effect.

2355
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:00,340
They're having to respond.

2356
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:03,380
Now, again, you just saw that clip of the president where he's saying

2357
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:08,340
these pundits and others, he's going after people implying we're crazy

2358
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:10,260
to say that tyrants want our guns.

2359
02:19:10,260 --> 02:19:12,340
All of our founding fathers said that.

2360
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:14,180
Federal court rulings have stated that.

2361
02:19:14,180 --> 02:19:18,020
We have a second amendment to protect ourselves from street thugs and government.

2362
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:21,380
That's on record, but they're trying to act like that's crazy.

2363
02:19:21,380 --> 02:19:24,820
In closing, we know that Obama is deceptive.

2364
02:19:24,820 --> 02:19:28,100
We know he's lied about everything across the board.

2365
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:30,020
I mean, he told poor people he wouldn't raise their taxes,

2366
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:31,220
and that's who they targeted.

2367
02:19:32,820 --> 02:19:35,860
And I can make a firm pledge under my plan.

2368
02:19:36,500 --> 02:19:44,820
No family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.

2369
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:51,540
Making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase,

2370
02:19:51,540 --> 02:19:52,740
not your income tax.

2371
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:53,780
All right, we'll be back.

2372
02:19:53,780 --> 02:19:57,300
That's only five minutes of the 14 minute video.

2373
02:19:57,300 --> 02:19:58,500
It's powerful.

2374
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:01,460
Obama responds to Alex Jones in full wars.com.

2375
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:02,020
Get it out there.

2376
02:20:02,580 --> 02:20:05,300
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best selling book,

2377
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:07,300
Cancer Step Outside the Box.

2378
02:20:07,300 --> 02:20:09,620
I want you to know some very important information.

2379
02:20:09,620 --> 02:20:15,300
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House

2380
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:18,820
at a time when only the President could obtain its world-class healer.

2381
02:20:18,820 --> 02:20:24,340
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

2382
02:20:24,340 --> 02:20:30,020
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring

2383
02:20:30,020 --> 02:20:35,700
compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

2384
02:20:35,700 --> 02:20:40,820
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells

2385
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:43,460

02:21:02,180 --> 02:21:04,900
We travel so much and having a fake TV.

2393
02:21:04,900 --> 02:21:07,300
Well, it gives added peace of mind.

2394
02:21:07,300 --> 02:21:13,060
Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets, but fake TV can fool even

2395
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:17,140
professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television.

2396
02:21:17,140 --> 02:21:23,060
As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window

2397
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:27,620
and know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV

2398
02:21:27,620 --> 02:21:29,620
when I'm actually away from home.

2399
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:34,180
Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer.

2400
02:21:34,180 --> 02:21:36,020
And they're so easy to use.

2401
02:21:36,020 --> 02:21:38,180
You just plug them in and they're ready to go.

2402
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:42,180
Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs.

2403
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:45,220
Fake TV is only $34.95.

2404
02:21:45,220 --> 02:21:51,940
Order your fake TV by calling 877-5FAKETV or go to faketv.com.

2405
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:57,860
That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.

2406
02:21:58,420 --> 02:22:01,620
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

2407
02:22:01,620 --> 02:22:07,780

2415
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:03,860
Hi there, my name is Frank Bates.

2416
02:23:03,860 --> 02:23:07,700
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

2417
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:14,020
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

2418
02:23:14,020 --> 02:23:18,740
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that

2419
02:23:18,740 --> 02:23:22,900
are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

2420
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:28,100
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up, and you will be

2421
02:23:28,100 --> 02:23:30,980
shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

2422
02:23:31,620 --> 02:23:37,460
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

2423
02:23:37,460 --> 02:23:38,740
and how you can beat them too.

2424
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:43,620
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

2425
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:44,580
in the last three months.

2426
02:23:45,140 --> 02:23:50,660
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

2427
02:23:50,660 --> 02:23:51,060
your home.

2428
02:23:51,620 --> 02:23:57,380
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

2429
02:23:57,380 --> 02:23:59,940
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

2430
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:27,940
Thank you, brother.

2431
02:24:58,100 --> 02:25:01,300
Wondering why is it going on?

2432
02:25:01,300 --> 02:25:01,460
Do you-

2433
02:25:01,460 --> 02:25:04,340
Well, we shouldn't be on the defensive.

2434
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:10,100
They're trying to tell law abiding citizens who have gotten armed the last 20 years that

2435
02:25:10,100 --> 02:25:15,220
we're bad because violent crime with guns has dropped 49% FBI statistics gathered from

2436
02:25:15,220 --> 02:25:15,940
local communities.

2437
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:18,580
Those are very accurate statistics because they're very diverse.

2438
02:25:18,580 --> 02:25:21,700
They're collated by a lot of different groups and double checked.

2439
02:25:21,700 --> 02:25:26,980
They're very upset that overall violent crime has dropped 21%.

2440
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:29,540
And so they're telling us we killed kids.

2441
02:25:29,540 --> 02:25:33,860
I mean, if my neighbor came to my house and said, hey, you know, you kill kids.

2442
02:25:33,860 --> 02:25:35,540
I'd say, get off my porch, crazy man.

2443
02:25:36,260 --> 02:25:38,340
I mean, they're here telling us we're guilty.

2444
02:25:38,340 --> 02:25:41,700
So we've got to submit to them because he's up there high fiving the kids.

2445
02:25:41,700 --> 02:25:43,940
And I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable.

2446
02:25:43,940 --> 02:25:46,260
It's Jerry Springer level baloney.

2447
02:25:46,820 --> 02:25:48,420
And I appreciate your call, Jacob.

2448
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:53,780
The reason they are doing this to answer your question is they're going to drop the economy.

2449
02:25:53,780 --> 02:25:55,140
The country's already fallen apart.

2450
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:56,260
They're looting everything.

2451
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:57,540
They're raising taxes.

2452
02:25:57,540 --> 02:25:59,620
They know less revenue is going to come in from that.

2453
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:01,140
They want to bankrupt us.

2454
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:03,220
They want to collectivize us.

2455
02:26:03,220 --> 02:26:04,420
They do this on purpose.

2456
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:07,780
They're very bad people.

2457
02:26:07,780 --> 02:26:11,380
They told poor folks they were going to get a tax cut and they increase their taxes.

2458
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:13,460
I mean, that's cold blooded even for dictators.

2459
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:17,940
A lot of dictators want to be popular and really actually cut taxes to get more money

2460
02:26:17,940 --> 02:26:19,700
in so they can be the big shot.

2461
02:26:19,700 --> 02:26:23,460
These people are sicko eugenicist, okay?

2462
02:26:23,460 --> 02:26:24,900
They're not liberals, okay?

2463
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:26,260
I'm a liberal.

2464
02:26:26,260 --> 02:26:28,740
I want you to live your life, be free, do what you want.

2465
02:26:28,740 --> 02:26:31,060
As long as you leave other people alone, libertarian.

2466
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:32,820
They're not libertarians.

2467
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:34,420
They're turds.

2468
02:26:34,420 --> 02:26:36,260
Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Washington.

2469
02:26:36,260 --> 02:26:36,820
You're on the air.

2470
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:37,300
Go ahead.

2471
02:26:38,740 --> 02:26:38,900
Yeah.

2472
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:39,540
Hi, Alex.

2473
02:26:39,540 --> 02:26:40,020
Hey, buddy.

2474
02:26:41,700 --> 02:26:43,140
So far you've been doing a good job.

2475
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:49,780
I just wanted to bring up something that came out on Monday, apparently, there was a bill

2476
02:26:49,780 --> 02:26:57,060
introduced that was originally called to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow

2477
02:26:57,060 --> 02:27:03,540
a credit against tax for surrendering to authority certain assault weapons.

2478
02:27:03,540 --> 02:27:04,740
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

2479
02:27:04,740 --> 02:27:05,300
I mean, I saw it.

2480
02:27:05,300 --> 02:27:08,340
They're trying to get all this stuff passed in the last few years.

2481
02:27:08,340 --> 02:27:08,900
Yeah, no, no.

2482
02:27:08,900 --> 02:27:10,260
I mean, we know their plan.

2483
02:27:10,260 --> 02:27:10,820
Yeah, that's it.

2484
02:27:10,820 --> 02:27:11,540
You're right.

2485
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:13,460
They're trying the police.

2486
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:16,260
That's why the cops are finally waking up because they're starting to get more and more

2487
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:18,420
of them training in gun confiscation.

2488
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:23,140
And the police, even if they're not moral, some of them, they know that is a very dangerous

2489
02:27:23,140 --> 02:27:23,860
job.

2490
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:25,700
I mean, people are going to resist.

2491
02:27:25,700 --> 02:27:26,580
It's guaranteed.

2492
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:34,180
Well, I just hope an article gets written up on this because it's pretty important.

2493
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:40,980
It shows how the IRS is going to be used at least to kind of reimburse people for weapons

2494
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:42,980
that are taken, whether they're voluntarily or not.

2495
02:27:42,980 --> 02:27:46,420
Yeah, wasn't that introduced like two years ago and again last year?

2496
02:27:46,420 --> 02:27:48,980
I mean, I'd forgotten about that, but I've never seen that like a year ago, right?

2497
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:52,180
I don't know, but it was introduced this Monday.

2498
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:54,020
It's HR 226.

2499
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:55,540
HR, oh, I didn't know that.

2500
02:27:55,540 --> 02:28:01,140
226 and IRS for confiscated guns.

2501
02:28:01,140 --> 02:28:02,100
Holy Toledo.

2502
02:28:02,100 --> 02:28:05,300
I mean, you know what's amazing about why I should take more calls?

2503
02:28:05,300 --> 02:28:10,020
You guys always remind me of stuff I forgot about or things that I didn't know about.

2504
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:14,660
HR 226 IRS bill, and that's the full bill number?

2505
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:15,700
What's the title of the bill?

2506
02:28:16,900 --> 02:28:23,540
Well, they changed it here yesterday to support assault, firearms elimination and reduction

2507
02:28:23,540 --> 02:28:24,740
for our streets act.

2508
02:28:24,740 --> 02:28:28,900
So in other words, short for that is safer for our streets act.

2509
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,820
Oh no, that's the safe act.

2510
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:31,620
Okay, yeah.

2511
02:28:31,620 --> 02:28:32,900
So they put it in the safe act.

2512
02:28:32,900 --> 02:28:33,540
Oh wow.

2513
02:28:33,540 --> 02:28:38,100
No, the safe act is Obama's big omnibus nightmare like Obamacare.

2514
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:39,300
Oh my goodness.

2515
02:28:39,300 --> 02:28:42,820
See, folks, everybody better be analyzing these bills right now.

2516
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:47,780
Cuz I had heard about this, I guess they put it in by itself before, where they make you

2517
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:51,460
turn your guns in, you get a tax deduction, and you're telling me it's been introduced

2518
02:28:51,460 --> 02:28:52,260
in the safe act.

2519
02:28:52,260 --> 02:28:54,420
Wow, what subsection is that?

2520
02:28:55,780 --> 02:29:00,100
I don't know, I just have a printout of information I tried to send you so I could get through

2521
02:29:00,100 --> 02:29:00,980
to you on air.

2522
02:29:00,980 --> 02:29:04,660
I found it on govcrack.us and I found it on thomas.look.gov.

2523
02:29:04,660 --> 02:29:06,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that Library of Congress.

2524
02:29:06,500 --> 02:29:09,860
Okay, wow, okay, I'm gonna call Watson right now.

2525
02:29:10,740 --> 02:29:13,860
Or I can get a Don Salazar or one of my other writers on this.

2526
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:14,420
This is big.

2527
02:29:15,220 --> 02:29:15,940
Anything else, sir?

2528
02:29:15,940 --> 02:29:17,060
January 14th.

2529
02:29:17,060 --> 02:29:17,860
Nope, that's it.

2530
02:29:17,860 --> 02:29:22,180
I mean, it's introduced January 14th, so that was Monday, HR 226.

2531
02:29:23,380 --> 02:29:24,740
Wow, yeah, there it is.

2532
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:25,540
We just found it.

2533
02:29:25,540 --> 02:29:29,140
To amend Title 18 of the United States Code, provide a national standard in accordance

2534
02:29:29,140 --> 02:29:33,380
with non-residents of the state may carry concealed firearms in the state.

2535
02:29:34,260 --> 02:29:35,300
That's open to Congress.

2536
02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:36,740
I think that may be an old HR.

2537
02:29:38,340 --> 02:29:40,100
That's not the bill you're talking about, is it, sir?

2538
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:41,620
I don't think so.

2539
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:43,540
You got to make sure and get the 113th Congress.

2540
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:47,140
Yeah, 113th Congress and you've got to get...

2541
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:49,620
Okay, thank you.

2542
02:29:49,620 --> 02:29:50,340
We'll get it, sir.

2543
02:29:50,340 --> 02:29:50,840
Thank you.

2544
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:53,220
We're on the march.

2545
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:54,900
The empire's on the run.

2546
02:29:55,780 --> 02:29:58,580
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

2547
02:29:58,580 --> 02:30:03,940
The new year is a great time to take charge of your health and wellness.

2548
02:30:03,940 --> 02:30:08,420
Get serious and make a stand with Supernatural Silver.

2549
02:30:08,420 --> 02:30:14,020
This is a breakthrough in silver technology that is several hundred times more effective

2550
02:30:14,020 --> 02:30:16,660
than colloidal or ionic silver.

2551
02:30:16,660 --> 02:30:24,500
Supernatural Silver can be taken orally every day to help fight bacteria, viruses, infections,

2552
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:29,620
yeast, and molds.

2553
02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:35,620
Supernatural Silver is also exceptional for wound care and is highly effective for water

2554
02:30:35,620 --> 02:30:37,140
purification.

hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

2567
02:33:27,220 --> 02:33:32,980
If that's the case, this is even worse than I thought, an IRS tax credit, because in the

2568
02:33:32,980 --> 02:33:37,860
Feinstein bill, she says, you gotta come in and re-register guns, and then we'll decide

2569
02:33:37,860 --> 02:33:40,180
if you can keep them, and we've got a forced buyback provision.

2570
02:33:40,180 --> 02:33:47,700
Well, in HR 226 of the 113th Congress in there to amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow

2571
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:52,260
a credit against tax for surrendering to authority certain assault weapons.

2572
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:54,580
Whoa, and that's for gun confiscation.

2573
02:33:54,580 --> 02:33:59,780
But they always first have it voluntary, and then you get the tax credit to create the

2574
02:33:59,780 --> 02:34:01,140
image of people turning their guns in.

2575
02:34:01,140 --> 02:34:03,460
They've done this in country after country.

2576
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:14,260
I am very excited to have in studio the general manager of 1530 WCKG.

2577
02:34:15,300 --> 02:34:17,860
And Matt, it is so good to have you here with us.

2578
02:34:18,900 --> 02:34:20,340
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

2579
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:24,740
Thank you for your hospitality.

2580
02:34:24,740 --> 02:34:26,660
The people here are wonderful.

2581
02:34:26,660 --> 02:34:28,020
Your staff has been amazing.

2582
02:34:28,020 --> 02:34:28,900
We just had some food.

2583
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:30,180
You guys have been the greatest.

2584
02:34:30,820 --> 02:34:32,100
I've been all over.

2585
02:34:32,100 --> 02:34:33,220
I've talked to radio people.

2586
02:34:33,220 --> 02:34:34,500
I've talked to TV people.

2587
02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:36,020
I've been to their facilities.

2588
02:34:36,900 --> 02:34:39,140
They're not always the nicest folks in the world.

2589
02:34:39,140 --> 02:34:45,220
Everybody here is nice and a person first, and I think that's really important.

2590
02:34:45,220 --> 02:34:48,740
That's one of the reasons why I wanted to come here, because we have this radio station.

2591
02:34:48,740 --> 02:34:54,420
We put your show on, and 90% of the time, if you're a radio manager, you never meet

2592
02:34:54,420 --> 02:35:00,020
Rush, Hannity, Savage, those folks, and you don't ever know what's going on, and that's

2593
02:35:00,020 --> 02:35:00,660
why I came here.

2594
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:06,020
I came here to meet you and to meet your staff and see what happens behind the scenes of

2595
02:35:06,020 --> 02:35:10,980
the Alex Jones Show and Info Wars, because we give a big part of our day to your show

2596
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:11,700
Afternoon Drive.

2597
02:35:12,340 --> 02:35:13,860
How did you get into radio?

2598
02:35:14,900 --> 02:35:18,340
I was a kid with a dream out of high school.

2599
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:21,780
I started working my way up, interned, did a lot of the things that a lot of the folks

2600
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:23,300
around here are doing for you.

2601
02:35:23,300 --> 02:35:28,660
Ran and got coffee for a lot of the big shots, and it was music radio, and I saw where radio

2602
02:35:28,660 --> 02:35:34,740
was going, and I just worked my way up, and now I've gotten to the position to at least

2603
02:35:34,740 --> 02:35:39,300
be able to put on the things that are a little different than the average radio station,

2604
02:35:39,300 --> 02:35:44,820
the average media outlet, not the same old five shows from the same three companies.

2605
02:35:44,820 --> 02:35:49,220
And so on my station, we have Man Cal in the morning, and I spoke to him Monday and told

2606
02:35:49,220 --> 02:35:50,100
him I was coming to see you.

2607
02:35:50,100 --> 02:35:56,660
He gave me a call, and Alex Jones on In the Afternoon, and it really gives us unique information

2608
02:35:56,660 --> 02:35:58,580
to give to this audience in Chicago.

2609
02:35:58,580 --> 02:36:01,460
Well, I actually know just through strange things.

2610
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:04,980
One guy who grew up around Rush Limbaugh and some other folks that know him pretty well,

2611
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:07,220
he's actually a pretty nice guy and plays golf all day.

2612
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:08,500
I mean, he's a real guy.

2613
02:36:08,500 --> 02:36:12,020
Some of these guys, Michael Savage is a real guy in a lot of ways.

2614
02:36:12,020 --> 02:36:13,220
He's pretty wild, I'm told.

2615
02:36:13,220 --> 02:36:17,300
But Man Cal, I've gotten to know him pretty well.

2616
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:18,660
He's a really smart fellow.

2617
02:36:18,660 --> 02:36:19,620
He is, he is.

2618
02:36:19,620 --> 02:36:21,060
I've gone to church with him.

2619
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:26,260
I've had Pico and Eaten Chips and Salsa with him, and we've spent some time together.

2620
02:36:26,980 --> 02:36:32,580
None of these places are in operation, though.

2621
02:36:33,140 --> 02:36:34,020
People don't realize.

2622
02:36:34,020 --> 02:36:36,100
None of these media places that you go to.

2623
02:36:36,740 --> 02:36:39,860
I recently did a whole junket a few months back.

2624
02:36:39,860 --> 02:36:42,180
My little boy was screened at the TSA.

2625
02:36:42,180 --> 02:36:46,180
And so I got calls from CNN, Inside Edition, Fox News.

2626
02:36:46,180 --> 02:36:47,860
My little boy was on your website.

2627
02:36:47,860 --> 02:36:49,540
He was the one in the wheelchair.

2628
02:36:49,540 --> 02:36:50,980
He was the one that got screened on.

2629
02:36:50,980 --> 02:36:52,500
Well, what a small world.

2630
02:36:52,500 --> 02:36:54,420
I was never even told that.

2631
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:55,380
I didn't even know that.

2632
02:36:56,500 --> 02:36:58,420
So that happened.

2633
02:36:58,420 --> 02:36:59,220
He's five now.

2634
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:00,500
That happened when he was three.

2635
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:06,100
I was in a bad spot because we're going to Disney and we're going through the whole thing.

2636
02:37:06,100 --> 02:37:08,260
My wife's giving me the look like, don't blow this.

2637
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:09,380
And I'm going, well, I can't.

2638
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:10,500
I'm going to be honest with you.

2639
02:37:10,500 --> 02:37:14,580
I just didn't wrap which I'm the king of when I saw that video and how bummed out and scared

2640
02:37:14,580 --> 02:37:16,020
he looked because I don't know how my children are.

2641
02:37:16,740 --> 02:37:18,100
I mean, sometimes I have relatives come.

2642
02:37:18,100 --> 02:37:18,980
They haven't seen in a year.

2643
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:22,100
My kids don't want to be next to them and one don't want to be hugged by them.

2644
02:37:22,100 --> 02:37:24,420
Imagine these weirdos and outfits in there.

2645
02:37:24,420 --> 02:37:24,900
Get away.

2646
02:37:24,900 --> 02:37:25,380
Get back.

2647
02:37:25,380 --> 02:37:25,780
Hold on.

2648
02:37:25,780 --> 02:37:26,260
That was you.

2649
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:27,620
What a small world.

2650
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:28,020
Yeah.

2651
02:37:28,020 --> 02:37:30,900
Well, sadly, I let it happen.

2652
02:37:30,900 --> 02:37:35,460
I let it happen because, you know, you go back in time and it's interesting to look

2653
02:37:35,460 --> 02:37:36,100
back now.

2654
02:37:36,820 --> 02:37:37,780
I let it happen.

2655
02:37:37,780 --> 02:37:40,900
And I put it online to share with my in-laws and my father.

2656
02:37:40,900 --> 02:37:42,420
They had never seen the video.

2657
02:37:42,420 --> 02:37:45,860
Monday morning, as soon as I put it on the Internet on our YouTube channel and shared

2658
02:37:45,860 --> 02:37:50,820
it with some friends and family, Fox, CNN, Inside Edition, you name it, and they all

2659
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:51,940
wanted to talk about it.

2660
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:53,700
And I thought, this is my chance.

2661
02:37:53,700 --> 02:37:58,180
This is my chance to make up for not having done anything about it except videotape it

2662
02:37:58,180 --> 02:37:59,620
when the thing happened.

2663
02:37:59,620 --> 02:38:00,420
And you know what?

2664
02:38:00,420 --> 02:38:01,380
I blew it.

2665
02:38:01,380 --> 02:38:04,740
I blew it because I didn't do what you did on Piers Morgan.

2666
02:38:04,740 --> 02:38:10,260
I didn't take the chance to go on and really break through and kind of, you know, wake

2667
02:38:10,260 --> 02:38:10,900
people up.

2668
02:38:10,900 --> 02:38:13,620
And I went on there and went on there with my suit and my tie on.

2669
02:38:13,620 --> 02:38:15,300
I stood in front of a green screen.

2670
02:38:15,300 --> 02:38:19,140
They put pictures of Chicago behind me and did their whole hocus pocus.

2671
02:38:19,140 --> 02:38:21,620
And then they used, you know, I was talking for 20 minutes.

2672
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:25,300
They used a three second clip and they said, well, this is what it used to be like.

2673
02:38:25,300 --> 02:38:26,580
Now the TSA is better.

2674
02:38:26,580 --> 02:38:28,020
This is what it's like now.

2675
02:38:28,020 --> 02:38:33,460
And it was all steered government propaganda except Fox and friends who actually kind of

2676
02:38:33,460 --> 02:38:34,740
told the story a little bit.

2677
02:38:34,740 --> 02:38:36,660
But all of them were that way.

2678
02:38:36,660 --> 02:38:41,700
And so I wanted to see as a guy who runs, you know, I'm telling people how great our

2679
02:38:41,700 --> 02:38:43,620
station is and how great the hosts are.

2680
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:45,060
And I'm standing behind the content.

2681
02:38:45,060 --> 02:38:50,900
I wanted to come and I wanted to see what's going on here because I saw what was going

2682
02:38:50,900 --> 02:38:51,540
on there.

2683
02:38:51,540 --> 02:38:53,780
And people don't know what they do.

2684
02:38:53,780 --> 02:38:54,980
Tell folks what they do.

2685
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:58,020
And again, Matt Dubiel is here in studio.

2686
02:38:58,020 --> 02:39:02,100
He's a general manager at 1530wckg.com.

2687
02:39:02,100 --> 02:39:05,780
And every week we plug a couple of our affiliates.

2688
02:39:05,780 --> 02:39:09,380
We try to learn something about it, like if they have a podcast or they have an iPhone

2689
02:39:09,380 --> 02:39:10,580
app, we plug that.

2690
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:15,540
Or if stations want me to cut liners for them, I'm trying to get all that done because I'm

2691
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:15,860
running.

2692
02:39:15,860 --> 02:39:17,140
I'm not just a radio talk show host.

2693
02:39:17,140 --> 02:39:18,980
And since you're here now, you've gotten the tour.

2694
02:39:19,700 --> 02:39:20,980
I want you to tell me what you've seen.

2695
02:39:20,980 --> 02:39:25,060
But first, tell people what it's like behind the scenes at a big news operation.

2696
02:39:25,060 --> 02:39:26,660
I'll tell you and then get your take.

2697
02:39:26,660 --> 02:39:29,620
These are people on incredible power trips who think they're God.

2698
02:39:29,620 --> 02:39:32,100
They are people that are totally cold.

2699
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:36,260
They are people that have a total agenda and know they're manipulating people.

2700
02:39:36,260 --> 02:39:38,900
Now, that's TV, that's CNN, that's MSNBC.

2701
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:41,460
I mean, I've been there behind the scenes.

2702
02:39:41,460 --> 02:39:44,180
I've had Nightline here and we go to dinner with them.

2703
02:39:44,180 --> 02:39:46,740
They go, yeah, we know how it is, but you're on your side, we're on our side.

2704
02:39:46,740 --> 02:39:47,860
They're mercenaries.

2705
02:39:47,860 --> 02:39:53,300
Talk radio, though, has gotten the point in the economy where it's either a total standalone

2706
02:39:53,300 --> 02:39:56,980
station with a few guys overworked because of the economy.

2707
02:39:56,980 --> 02:39:59,140
And then trying to get real news out.

2708
02:39:59,140 --> 02:40:03,060
Or you've got some of the old line local news stations that still put out some real news.

2709
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:04,420
But still, it's more real.

2710
02:40:04,420 --> 02:40:07,540
That's what's so great about talk radio is it brings in personalities.

2711
02:40:07,540 --> 02:40:09,620
I mean, Obama couldn't even read off a teleprompter the other day.

2712
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:10,740
The whole thing was teleprompter.

2713
02:40:10,740 --> 02:40:12,420
I'm up here, there's no teleprompter here.

2714
02:40:12,420 --> 02:40:14,820
I mean, I'm here, this is what I think, this is what I do.

2715
02:40:14,820 --> 02:40:16,020
This is my passion.

2716
02:40:16,020 --> 02:40:17,540
And that's why I love talk radio.

2717
02:40:17,540 --> 02:40:20,500
And I'll tell you, talk radio people are not as arrogant.

2718
02:40:20,500 --> 02:40:23,140
I've met some of the biggest talk radio hosts in the country.

2719
02:40:23,140 --> 02:40:26,260
Usually they're like, don't tell anybody we're meeting because you're such a crazy

2720
02:40:26,260 --> 02:40:27,140
guy.

2721
02:40:27,140 --> 02:40:28,340
But that's fine.

2722
02:40:28,340 --> 02:40:29,860
The point is they're still real guys.

2723
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:33,540
They actually know what I'm saying is true even if they won't go all the way.

2724
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:35,140
Because they're reading all the same stuff.

2725
02:40:35,140 --> 02:40:36,260
They've lived a life.

2726
02:40:36,260 --> 02:40:40,900
That's what's so beautiful about talk radio is that it's not perfect, but it's long form.

2727
02:40:40,900 --> 02:40:41,620
It's real.

2728
02:40:41,620 --> 02:40:44,100
Look, you're not going to be good in talk radio if you're not real.

2729
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:45,220
You're not going to be popular.

2730
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:49,220
They got some guys that can wing it with a bunch of guests and cue cards and kind of

2731
02:40:49,220 --> 02:40:51,460
cobble through it and they sound great.

2732
02:40:51,460 --> 02:40:53,060
People don't want that in talk radio.

2733
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:55,700
They want people that really, folks can connect.

2734
02:40:55,700 --> 02:40:57,940
Man, this guy's telling me what he really thinks.

2735
02:40:57,940 --> 02:40:59,220
This is a real person.

2736
02:40:59,860 --> 02:41:00,500
I'm ranting.

2737
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:00,820
Go ahead.

2738
02:41:00,820 --> 02:41:02,900
No, it's intimate and you're 100% right.

2739
02:41:02,900 --> 02:41:07,620
And so I also did radio and I did radio in my hometown on WGN.

2740
02:41:07,620 --> 02:41:08,820
In fact, I did radio.

2741
02:41:08,820 --> 02:41:10,260
I'm calling into the radio show.

2742
02:41:10,260 --> 02:41:13,940
I'm doing the midday show on GN while I'm sitting in the CNN Bureau.

2743
02:41:13,940 --> 02:41:18,820
They have these bureaus when they don't have a full blown studio in your market in Chicago.

2744
02:41:18,820 --> 02:41:22,420
You go and they basically have a garage with a camera and a green screen.

2745
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:28,260
And so I'm waiting for CNN to tape me and I'm doing an interview with WGN and the interview

2746
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:32,180
with WGN was intimate and pure and the guy was coming after me.

2747
02:41:32,180 --> 02:41:37,140
He's a very liberal leaning talk show host that now does a show in Minnesota and a very

2748
02:41:37,140 --> 02:41:38,580
nice guy, but he was coming after me.

2749
02:41:38,580 --> 02:41:39,780
Oh, like I had something to gain.

2750
02:41:39,780 --> 02:41:42,500
And I said, well, listen, I'm not selling a book about the TSA.

2751
02:41:42,500 --> 02:41:44,100
I'm not trying to get you to do anything.

2752
02:41:44,100 --> 02:41:45,940
I'm just telling you what happened to me.

2753
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:48,980
And the radio interview was so intimate and so pure.

2754
02:41:48,980 --> 02:41:51,300
He invited me to come down and do another segment.

2755
02:41:51,300 --> 02:41:54,420
The television interviews were the opposite.

2756
02:41:54,420 --> 02:41:56,820
And what they do is they bring you into a room.

2757
02:41:56,820 --> 02:42:00,420
I talked to the producer for 20 minutes from CNN.

2758
02:42:00,420 --> 02:42:02,020
She said that she was the producer.

2759
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:02,580
She wasn't.

2760
02:42:02,580 --> 02:42:03,940
She was the person interviewing me.

2761
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:05,460
They were taping it the whole time.

2762
02:42:05,460 --> 02:42:08,580
And I figured as much, but they had a green screen behind me.

2763
02:42:08,580 --> 02:42:13,140
So they put the fake skyline of Chicago behind you because they got to show the people that

2764
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:14,100
are watching.

2765
02:42:14,100 --> 02:42:15,380
You can't be in Chicago.

2766
02:42:15,380 --> 02:42:18,580
If the skyline is not behind you, you couldn't possibly be in Chicago.

2767
02:42:18,580 --> 02:42:20,420
We got to show you Chicago behind him.

2768
02:42:20,420 --> 02:42:21,860
We got to play music underneath.

2769
02:42:21,860 --> 02:42:27,220
We've got to do this whole sort of facade to make them send the message we want.

2770
02:42:27,220 --> 02:42:30,820
And so the message from CNN was TSA used to be bad.

2771
02:42:30,820 --> 02:42:31,620
Now it's good.

2772
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:34,500
We used to do this to kids, to elderly, so and so.

2773
02:42:34,500 --> 02:42:36,100
The rules changed today.

2774
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:37,860
And now all hail the TSA.

2775
02:42:37,860 --> 02:42:38,980
That was the message.

2776
02:42:38,980 --> 02:42:41,700
And what I did, I brought somebody with me.

2777
02:42:41,700 --> 02:42:44,260
And he videotaped all the things behind the scenes.

2778
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:49,940
And he videotaped all the things that I see here, except what I'm seeing here, the magazine

2779
02:42:49,940 --> 02:42:52,180
operation and the warehouse.

2780
02:42:52,180 --> 02:42:58,180
This is a full blown alternative media outlet to get info to the people.

2781
02:42:58,180 --> 02:42:59,620
Well, it's a military operation.

2782
02:42:59,620 --> 02:43:00,500
It's unbelievable.

2783
02:43:00,500 --> 02:43:04,420
We don't go around in uniforms and stuff, but we know we're about all there is against

2784
02:43:04,420 --> 02:43:06,420
the globalist and it's our responsibility.

2785
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:07,540
And not that we're great either.

2786
02:43:07,540 --> 02:43:11,300
We're just saying God, we even had a prayer before the show and we don't usually do this,

2787
02:43:11,300 --> 02:43:11,940
but it's just coming.

2788
02:43:11,940 --> 02:43:13,220
We said, God, we're weak.

2789
02:43:13,220 --> 02:43:14,580
We don't do a perfect job.

2790
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:18,340
Help us be strong because help us communicate because we understand.

2791
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:22,260
That's why I work 18 hours a day most days now is because there's not any future if we

2792
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:22,900
don't win this.

2793
02:43:23,780 --> 02:43:25,060
But I mean, you've seen the operation.

2794
02:43:25,060 --> 02:43:25,780
What else did you see?

2795
02:43:25,780 --> 02:43:28,980
I thought that it was going to be big.

2796
02:43:28,980 --> 02:43:30,340
I figured television.

2797
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:34,660
I mean, now I know where Glenn Beck gets all of his ideas because I saw the television

2798
02:43:34,660 --> 02:43:35,060
studio.

2799
02:43:35,060 --> 02:43:36,020
I saw the set.

2800
02:43:36,020 --> 02:43:37,540
I see the radio area.

2801
02:43:37,540 --> 02:43:44,020
I was telling your guys and girls, you have such a great staff, positive, focused, driven.

2802
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:45,060
They're all in sync.

2803
02:43:45,060 --> 02:43:48,420
They're all focused on what everything is happening here.

2804
02:43:48,420 --> 02:43:55,620
And I said, in radio, most broadcasting companies that have 10 stations in Chicago don't have

2805
02:43:55,620 --> 02:43:58,740
the tools and creativity that's at your disposal.

2806
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:00,740
And every room, you see it from room to room.

2807
02:44:00,740 --> 02:44:03,220
You see the set for the TV for the nightly news.

2808
02:44:03,220 --> 02:44:06,980
You see the radio studios, the production facilities, the break room.

2809
02:44:06,980 --> 02:44:10,580
And these people that are working with you have these tools.

2810
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:15,380
And I'm a little embarrassed, honestly, because I can't provide those tools to the people

2811
02:44:15,380 --> 02:44:16,340
that are working with me.

2812
02:44:17,540 --> 02:44:20,100
You've got the tool of your brain and the news articles and the analysis.

2813
02:44:20,100 --> 02:44:20,580
Exactly.

2814
02:44:20,580 --> 02:44:22,660
No, no, but we're just crawling.

2815
02:44:22,660 --> 02:44:26,740
We haven't even gotten to the walking stage yet because we're always busy fighting the

2816
02:44:26,740 --> 02:44:27,220
globalists.

2817
02:44:27,220 --> 02:44:31,700
But I can get somebody in here who is kind of a halfway libertarian but out of college

2818
02:44:31,700 --> 02:44:33,300
and doesn't even know if I'm for real.

2819
02:44:33,300 --> 02:44:37,140
Within six months, it's almost like they're in the video game, but it's real.

2820
02:44:37,140 --> 02:44:38,340
And the asteroids are coming in.

2821
02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:39,540
They start shooting at them.

2822
02:44:39,540 --> 02:44:41,620
People start going, whoa, look, this is real.

2823
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:48,580
I mean, oh, my gosh, I thought you were making it up that they're got black kids in New York

2824
02:44:48,580 --> 02:44:50,820
killing them with pesticides and government tests.

2825
02:44:50,820 --> 02:44:53,300
I mean, here's the New York Daily News.

2826
02:44:53,300 --> 02:44:57,220
I never heard about this because what we do is I have a good memory, or at least I used

2827
02:44:57,220 --> 02:44:57,620
to.

2828
02:44:57,620 --> 02:45:01,700
We will take one article and go, OK, now we're going to show you 10 of the things that connect.

2829
02:45:01,700 --> 02:45:02,660
And that's what they hate.

2830
02:45:02,660 --> 02:45:07,540
They hate the connecting of the dots, not just Obama says he wants to get I don't want

2831
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:10,980
to give you tyranny, but to me, OK, well, what's this, this, this and that?

2832
02:45:10,980 --> 02:45:15,140
That's something so-called reporters never do because they've been taught the last 50

2833
02:45:15,140 --> 02:45:15,620
years.

2834
02:45:15,620 --> 02:45:16,740
Don't have your own view.

2835
02:45:16,740 --> 02:45:17,860
Don't bring anything into it.

2836
02:45:17,860 --> 02:45:19,140
Only this report.

2837
02:45:19,140 --> 02:45:20,340
Well, that's not reporting.

2838
02:45:20,340 --> 02:45:21,860
That's regurgitating.

2839
02:45:21,860 --> 02:45:25,140
A real reporter is going in to find out what's behind it.

2840
02:45:25,140 --> 02:45:26,100
Muckraking.

2841
02:45:26,100 --> 02:45:28,340
That was the great journalism of 100 years ago.

2842
02:45:28,340 --> 02:45:32,580
And I found all these big meetings on record where Robert Barron said publicly, we got

2843
02:45:32,580 --> 02:45:35,060
to go buy up the media and shut this down.

2844
02:45:35,060 --> 02:45:38,820
Because used to it was 50000 Alex Jones is running around.

2845
02:45:38,820 --> 02:45:40,500
I mean, do you think the establishment like that?

2846
02:45:40,500 --> 02:45:40,980
No.

2847
02:45:40,980 --> 02:45:43,860
And what people don't realize is it's all a show.

2848
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:48,500
And, you know, they treated me as though maybe I had something to sell because I was going

2849
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:50,180
and saying, I wish I had protected my son.

2850
02:45:50,180 --> 02:45:51,780
I wish I hadn't had allowed that.

2851
02:45:51,780 --> 02:45:52,100
No, no, no.

2852
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:53,540
That's how they put it back on you.

2853
02:45:53,540 --> 02:45:54,740
I mean, look, I'm like, yeah, you're right.

2854
02:45:54,740 --> 02:45:55,620
I'm selling something.

2855
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:56,580
I sell what I believe in.

2856
02:45:56,580 --> 02:45:58,340
I'm selling freedom to fund myself.

2857
02:45:58,340 --> 02:46:01,540
I don't take the government line that many cases funding you.

2858
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:02,900
They always use that thing.

2859
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:04,980
Well, I mean, I'd say, hey, you're getting paid money.

2860
02:46:04,980 --> 02:46:06,500
Just sit here and see what you're doing.

2861
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:07,700
They're getting paid big money.

2862
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:11,140
They're getting paid six and seven figures as the news person.

2863
02:46:11,140 --> 02:46:15,300
In addition to that, they want more people to watch because the more people that watch,

2864
02:46:15,300 --> 02:46:18,100
the more the Pfizer can pay for their commercials.

2865
02:46:18,100 --> 02:46:19,140
The Prozac.

2866
02:46:19,140 --> 02:46:19,940
Exactly.

2867
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:23,140
So they're trying to get ratings and more viewers to sell advertising.

2868
02:46:23,140 --> 02:46:24,100
And why are they doing that?

2869
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:26,100
They're they're having me on to tell my story.

2870
02:46:26,100 --> 02:46:29,540
But I'm the bad guy because, you know, I'm looking back and I'm thinking, man, I let

2871
02:46:29,540 --> 02:46:30,020
that happen.

2872
02:46:30,020 --> 02:46:32,340
They know people are mad about TSA as well.

2873
02:46:32,340 --> 02:46:35,540
So they have you want to get people to listen and so they can then brainwash.

2874
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:36,100
So they get.

2875
02:46:36,100 --> 02:46:37,380
So, oh, you're mad about this.

2876
02:46:37,380 --> 02:46:40,100
And then they try to knock you down while getting the audience.

2877
02:46:40,100 --> 02:46:41,540
And that's why I didn't let.

2878
02:46:41,540 --> 02:46:45,380
In fact, I wish I had been even meaner because I went in there, I had a chest cold and feel

2879
02:46:45,380 --> 02:46:45,540
good.

2880
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:47,940
I was tired and he was so sniveling.

2881
02:46:48,660 --> 02:46:50,260
I just blew up at him.

2882
02:46:50,260 --> 02:46:54,740
And but then, you know, it turned out good because I think it really struck a chord.

2883
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:58,900
Now you got state reps, congressmen and women, all these sheriffs coming out and saying

2884
02:46:58,900 --> 02:47:00,100
1776.

2885
02:47:00,100 --> 02:47:00,660
Yeah.

2886
02:47:00,660 --> 02:47:01,860
And listen, gangsters.

2887
02:47:01,860 --> 02:47:05,460
We know it's because you want to enslave us to the point of Obama's got to respond.

2888
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:10,580
My only regret in the peers thing with you and CNN is that you didn't do more of the

2889
02:47:10,580 --> 02:47:11,700
British accent.

2890
02:47:12,660 --> 02:47:16,740
I would have really enjoyed just the back and forth of you doing the British voice with

2891
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:20,580
him, because as I go back and I watch that stuff and we've got some of it on the radio

2892
02:47:20,580 --> 02:47:21,700
station website as well.

2893
02:47:21,700 --> 02:47:26,020
And it's just it really it really there's nothing he can say back.

2894
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:26,980
There's no defense.

2895
02:47:26,980 --> 02:47:28,180
There's no retaliation.

2896
02:47:28,180 --> 02:47:30,660
There's no retort from him whatsoever.

2897
02:47:30,660 --> 02:47:33,380
By the way, I'm not just saying this because you've got us on one of our most important

2898
02:47:33,380 --> 02:47:33,780
stations.

2899
02:47:33,780 --> 02:47:37,940
You know, we're on Dallas, we're on outside San Diego, outside L.A., a bunch of other

2900
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:38,420
big cities.

2901
02:47:38,420 --> 02:47:41,300
But the point is 50,000 watt.

2902
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:47,060
We just got, you know, in places like what Fresno I mean, just new affiliates every week.

2903
02:47:47,620 --> 02:47:51,860
But you look like a TV anchorman and you sound awesome and you're a patriot.

2904
02:47:52,500 --> 02:47:56,900
I got Paul Watson sitting in and filling in tomorrow.

2905
02:47:56,900 --> 02:48:00,180
And Mike Adams is going to be guest hosting via Skype.

2906
02:48:00,180 --> 02:48:01,300
He's not going to be here.

2907
02:48:01,300 --> 02:48:05,140
But I mean, you're the type of guy that if you've got an ISDN line and or good Skype

2908
02:48:05,140 --> 02:48:08,580
for video, if you ever want to sit in, you know, once a month when I'm gone or got to

2909
02:48:08,580 --> 02:48:09,940
do stuff, I'd love to have you on the show.

2910
02:48:09,940 --> 02:48:13,060
I mean, I know you're busy running a radio station, you know, and that's God bless you

2911
02:48:13,060 --> 02:48:13,540
for saying that.

2912
02:48:13,540 --> 02:48:14,660
That's really nice of you.

2913
02:48:14,660 --> 02:48:16,260
This is my general manager suit.

2914
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:17,540
And we all wear these costumes.

2915
02:48:17,540 --> 02:48:20,580
You know, we wear costumes when we go and I roller skate with my kids.

2916
02:48:20,580 --> 02:48:21,780
Now that I should wear the costume.

2917
02:48:21,780 --> 02:48:22,980
People take you more serious when you do.

2918
02:48:22,980 --> 02:48:28,580
You know, I did it specifically because I know that you dressed the way you did on on

2919
02:48:28,580 --> 02:48:32,660
CNN because you were just I don't you didn't need to put on airs.

2920
02:48:32,660 --> 02:48:33,940
You just needed to be you.

2921
02:48:33,940 --> 02:48:36,340
But that guy sitting next to you did.

2922
02:48:36,340 --> 02:48:40,420
He thought that he was better because he's and I wanted just to let people see that,

2923
02:48:40,420 --> 02:48:42,100
you know, this doesn't mean anything.

2924
02:48:42,100 --> 02:48:46,500
But guys, guys like this can sit next to and agree with some of the things that you're

2925
02:48:46,500 --> 02:48:48,260
saying without putting their costumes on.

2926
02:48:48,260 --> 02:48:50,340
I mean, I don't know what appears Morgan is honestly.

2927
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:52,820
I know that he was on this reality show.

2928
02:48:52,820 --> 02:48:55,060
They introduced him to America.

2929
02:48:55,060 --> 02:48:57,700
Who gets a reality show when nobody in America knows you?

2930
02:48:57,700 --> 02:48:58,820
It doesn't happen.

2931
02:48:58,820 --> 02:49:00,980
He got fired for fake news.

2932
02:49:00,980 --> 02:49:02,820
He was at the top of a giant hacking operation.

2933
02:49:02,820 --> 02:49:04,100
I mean, they may indict him.

2934
02:49:04,100 --> 02:49:06,180
He literally came here to get away from all this.

2935
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:06,580
He did.

2936
02:49:06,580 --> 02:49:10,020
But they introduced him into the media like he was God's dream America.

2937
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:11,700
And then they put him on The Apprentice.

2938
02:49:11,700 --> 02:49:13,380
And you've seen The Apprentice.

2939
02:49:13,380 --> 02:49:16,900
Everybody on there is selling something or has something to promote.

2940
02:49:16,900 --> 02:49:22,500
And then all of a sudden, after The Apprentice, Piers got his CNN job and out was Larry King.

2941
02:49:22,500 --> 02:49:24,660
And finally, people sort of knew who he was.

2942
02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:26,260
But people don't know who this guy is.

2943
02:49:26,260 --> 02:49:30,420
Who gets a show on a big network like that when nobody knows who you are?

2944
02:49:30,420 --> 02:49:32,340
Fareed and Piers.

2945
02:49:32,340 --> 02:49:33,780
Fareed is part of the Bilderberg group.

2946
02:49:34,340 --> 02:49:34,820
These guys-

2947
02:49:34,820 --> 02:49:36,340
Fareed is really bad news.

2948
02:49:36,340 --> 02:49:38,820
But I mean, we've been in the media a long time.

2949
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:39,620
You have to prove it.

2950
02:49:39,620 --> 02:49:42,580
Man, Kyle Muller is one of the best-

2951
02:49:42,580 --> 02:49:44,420
He's been on since he was 15.

2952
02:49:44,420 --> 02:49:45,860
Rush Limbaugh since he was 15.

2953
02:49:45,860 --> 02:49:46,740
They have a tough time.

2954
02:49:46,740 --> 02:49:48,260
They've had to work their way through the ranks.

2955
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:50,820
These guys just all of a sudden, just a guy, Fareed?

2956
02:49:50,820 --> 02:49:51,860
Fareed's not good.

2957
02:49:51,860 --> 02:49:52,820
He's a plagiarist.

2958
02:49:53,380 --> 02:49:54,020
No, exactly.

2959
02:49:54,020 --> 02:50:02,260
I've been on air since 1995 and have had to crawl on my belly through just all sorts of

2960
02:50:02,260 --> 02:50:03,300
indignant things.

2961
02:50:03,300 --> 02:50:07,300
My first couple of years in radio, the general manager liked me, but he went to run the YMCA

2962
02:50:07,300 --> 02:50:09,780
and suddenly there were these new people that were like globalists.

2963
02:50:09,780 --> 02:50:11,300
And they're like, you scum, you're nobody.

2964
02:50:11,300 --> 02:50:13,140
We don't care if you have ratings and making us money.

2965
02:50:13,140 --> 02:50:14,340
You watch it or you're gone.

2966
02:50:14,340 --> 02:50:15,780
And I had to sit there and just to get the word out.

2967
02:50:15,780 --> 02:50:16,580
Okay, yes, sir.

2968
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:20,020
I mean, all the groveling I've had to do just to even get here.

2969
02:50:20,020 --> 02:50:21,860
And it's not like, ooh, I'm a big shot.

2970
02:50:21,860 --> 02:50:25,620
It's cuz I wanted to get in the face of tyrants cuz nobody else was doing it.

2971
02:50:25,620 --> 02:50:29,300
Yeah, and you have to play their game when they're pulling the strings.

2972
02:50:29,300 --> 02:50:33,060
And if you don't, you get squashed unless you take matters into your own hands and build

2973
02:50:33,060 --> 02:50:33,700
your own thing.

2974
02:50:33,700 --> 02:50:34,580
Well, that's why I did this.

2975
02:50:34,580 --> 02:50:35,940
Plug the radio station.

2976
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:40,660
Everybody in Chicago has got to tune in 1530wckg.com.

2977
02:50:40,660 --> 02:50:42,580
Yeah, 1530wckg.com.

2978
02:50:42,580 --> 02:50:44,580
It comes in around the airport in Chicago.

2979
02:50:44,580 --> 02:50:50,740
And our sponsor that made it possible in Chicago is royalvelvetnow.com.

2980
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:52,740
They've been huge. They're from Austin.

2981
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:55,460
And without them, I wouldn't be able to keep the lights on.

2982
02:50:55,460 --> 02:50:56,100
So thank you.

2983
02:50:56,100 --> 02:50:56,980
Plug them again.

2984
02:50:56,980 --> 02:50:58,980
Royalvelvetnow.com.

2985
02:50:58,980 --> 02:51:00,420
Great people, great supplement.

2986
02:51:00,420 --> 02:51:02,740
And we got to support the stuff to support Liberty.

2987
02:51:02,740 --> 02:51:06,660
If you ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

2988
02:51:06,660 --> 02:51:11,220
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

2989
02:51:11,220 --> 02:51:11,940
Here's why.

2990
02:51:11,940 --> 02:51:15,220
Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power.

2991
02:51:15,220 --> 02:51:18,660
And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly,

2992
02:51:18,660 --> 02:51:21,940
emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun.

2993
02:51:21,940 --> 02:51:25,380
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

2994
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:26,900
Now, here's the best part.

2995
02:51:26,900 --> 02:51:31,700
Every year, we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

2996
02:51:31,700 --> 02:51:37,620
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of each year.

2997
02:51:37,620 --> 02:51:41,540
We call them scratch and dead units, but they're really just like new.

2998
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:46,740
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

2999
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:47,300
Don't wait.

3000
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:48,340
They go fast.

Matt Dubiel is our guest and he's the general manager at 1530wckg.com

3040
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:26,900
and it was his son in the wheelchair that they separated from him and scared him and all that.

3041
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:29,780
I didn't even know that. I mean, what a small world.

3042
02:54:29,780 --> 02:54:34,020
And we're on his fine station at 1530wckg.com.

3043
02:54:34,020 --> 02:54:37,620
And don't you have like iPhone apps and stuff too or something?

3044
02:54:38,580 --> 02:54:42,020
Free app at 1530wckg.com. Free app.

3045
02:54:42,020 --> 02:54:46,100
You can get it in iTunes in the iPod store, the iTunes store.

3046
02:54:46,100 --> 02:54:47,220
It's an Android app too.

3047
02:54:47,780 --> 02:54:54,100
And, you know, it's, you can, all this stuff is at the website 1530wckg.com.

3048
02:54:54,100 --> 02:54:59,060
And I'll say this, stations that put true constitutional libertarian radio on.

3049
02:54:59,060 --> 02:55:02,260
You know, Glenn Beck's now the libertarian. Fine, I hope he actually becomes one

3050
02:55:02,260 --> 02:55:04,340
and doesn't support torture and secret arrest and all this.

3051
02:55:05,220 --> 02:55:09,460
People need to support libertarians and constitutionalists and need to support the stations,

3052
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:14,740
the affiliates, the sponsors, sponsor these shows because that's how we're growing.

3053
02:55:14,740 --> 02:55:19,380
And because we've gone so far down this line, more people now realize, well,

3054
02:55:19,380 --> 02:55:23,860
Alex Jones was right to a great extent. We better put him on air to fight this.

3055
02:55:23,860 --> 02:55:27,620
And Matt was asking me during the break, he goes, are you planning on staying in the US?

3056
02:55:27,620 --> 02:55:30,580
Because he's obviously heard me talk about getting my family out.

3057
02:55:30,580 --> 02:55:32,820
When I say all this horrible stuff's happening,

3058
02:55:32,820 --> 02:55:35,140
every government wants to be a tyranny, as Lou Rockwell said.

3059
02:55:35,140 --> 02:55:37,540
This is just history, founding father stuff.

3060
02:55:37,540 --> 02:55:42,180
If you call it extremist, you have been brainwashed by the new socialist board.

3061
02:55:42,180 --> 02:55:44,900
This is what kept America great was keeping government small

3062
02:55:44,900 --> 02:55:46,180
and jealously guarding our liberties.

3063
02:55:46,180 --> 02:55:53,620
And I said, yes, I believe what I say is coming will happen if we don't fight back.

3064
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:58,100
I mean, okay, so I'm here, I know how real this is, but they're not gonna get there.

3065
02:55:58,660 --> 02:56:02,420
I mean, it's always a fight, like that sheriff said in the first hour.

3066
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:06,580
It's always a fight. It's not only evil people out there on the field.

3067
02:56:06,580 --> 02:56:07,540
Your comments on that?

3068
02:56:07,540 --> 02:56:11,780
Well, American people, everyday people, and I'm an everyday person, too.

3069
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:14,420
I've just gotten to see behind some of the curtains,

3070
02:56:14,420 --> 02:56:18,900
and I know how the media business works. It doesn't make me better, just I know this.

3071
02:56:18,900 --> 02:56:23,060
And what I know is regular people, they need to take action.

3072
02:56:23,060 --> 02:56:25,220
They don't always know how to take action.

3073
02:56:25,220 --> 02:56:28,100
And listening to the program, going to infowars.com,

3074
02:56:28,100 --> 02:56:31,060
going to our radio station's website, those things are great.

3075
02:56:31,060 --> 02:56:35,460
But at the end of the day, the thing that makes it possible, the reason why

3076
02:56:35,460 --> 02:56:40,100
your show may not be on my station or somebody else's station is money,

3077
02:56:40,100 --> 02:56:41,620
because you gotta pay for it.

3078
02:56:41,620 --> 02:56:45,140
And the best way to make those things happen is for them to support

3079
02:56:45,140 --> 02:56:47,380
the advertisers that support these shows.

3080
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:51,780
The globalists say they wanna make us poor, so nobody has money to protest them,

3081
02:56:51,780 --> 02:56:53,300
so they own everything.

3082
02:56:53,300 --> 02:57:00,820
People, you better support drugsreport.com, infowars.com, 1530wckg.com,

3083
02:57:00,820 --> 02:57:03,380
the radio station you're listening to right now.

3084
02:57:03,380 --> 02:57:07,460
Folks, support them, go support their sponsors, become a sponsor.

3085
02:57:07,460 --> 02:57:10,100
This is a war, and wars need money.

3086
02:57:10,100 --> 02:57:13,300
They absolutely do, and the reason why you are able to do the thing,

3087
02:57:13,300 --> 02:57:15,140
and there's nothing wrong with making money.

3088
02:57:15,140 --> 02:57:18,020
There is something wrong with making money at the expense of other people.

3089
02:57:18,020 --> 02:57:20,100
That's right, and we've taken the money and put it back in here.

3090
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:23,380
And that's, you know what, media companies don't do this.

3091
02:57:23,380 --> 02:57:27,380
Huge broadcasting companies don't do and reinvest the way that you are.

3092
02:57:28,420 --> 02:57:32,100
And the reason why you can is because people will buy a video or a shirt,

3093
02:57:32,100 --> 02:57:34,180
or a water filter, or whatever it is.

3094
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:38,100
They've gotta do that stuff within their means, be responsible.

3095
02:57:38,100 --> 02:57:41,300
Don't go crazy, but do it within your means, because if you do that,

3096
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:43,780
and that's all you do, you will help.

3097
02:57:43,780 --> 02:57:45,700
You will help in some small way.

3098
02:57:45,700 --> 02:57:51,620
The next thing I'd recommend to people to do is forget about Obama versus,

3099
02:57:51,620 --> 02:57:53,300
what's his face, the Mormon guy.

3100
02:57:53,300 --> 02:57:57,940
Run for local office, help your local area, so that if things do get a little hinky,

3101
02:57:57,940 --> 02:58:01,780
there's somebody there that has a brain and can help things.

3102
02:58:01,780 --> 02:58:03,220
No, and that's happening, absolutely.

3103
02:58:03,220 --> 02:58:04,340
It is, and it's not easy.

3104
02:58:05,140 --> 02:58:08,180
And well-spoken folks, do your own YouTube videos to prove it.

3105
02:58:08,180 --> 02:58:10,660
Go to the local station and say, hey, I want to do one hour.

3106
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:13,060
Just try me one, see how I do one time.

3107
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:15,780
Put them on, pretty soon you might be doing the morning show.

3108
02:58:15,780 --> 02:58:16,180
Right.

3109
02:58:16,180 --> 02:58:19,300
I mean, so much of life is just getting your foot in the door.

3110
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:19,940
Yes.

3111
02:58:19,940 --> 02:58:24,500
Get out there, use the web, stop putting weird pictures on Facebook

3112
02:58:24,500 --> 02:58:25,700
about something that doesn't matter.

3113
02:58:25,700 --> 02:58:28,420
Use it to share with people and connect with people.

3114
02:58:28,420 --> 02:58:30,820
Folks, you better get active or lose everything.

3115
02:58:30,820 --> 02:58:32,580
You act like sheep, you're going to get overrun.

3116
02:58:32,580 --> 02:58:35,220
We're going to do just a few more minutes of overdrive to talk to Alan

3117
02:58:35,220 --> 02:58:44,260

Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.

3133
02:59:56,420 --> 03:00:00,980
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

3134
03:00:26,980 --> 03:00:27,780
All right, folks.

3135
03:00:31,860 --> 03:00:34,420
Yeah, see right there, you guys are running the refit over that.

3136
03:00:34,420 --> 03:00:37,940
I could tell I was here and do things, but that's good because we're into

3137
03:00:37,940 --> 03:00:41,380
overdrive and it's fun to have that type of stuff going on.

3138
03:00:41,380 --> 03:00:43,300
Let's jam in a few phone calls here.

3139
03:00:43,300 --> 03:00:45,380
Allen in Kentucky, you're on the air.

3140
03:00:45,380 --> 03:00:58,500
Go ahead.

3141
03:00:58,500 --> 03:00:59,540
Hey brother, how you doing?

3142
03:00:59,540 --> 03:01:01,700
Listen, of course this happens when we have a visitor.

3143
03:01:01,700 --> 03:01:02,820
Go ahead and kill it.

3144
03:01:02,820 --> 03:01:04,740
Well, what that is is you're running the rebroad.

3145
03:01:04,740 --> 03:01:07,940
You're running that the first five minutes of the show right now.

3146
03:01:07,940 --> 03:01:10,660
Just so you guys know, I'm just telling them I'm not actually getting on him here.

3147
03:01:10,660 --> 03:01:12,260
I'm telling him so they know what that is.

3148
03:01:12,260 --> 03:01:14,900
That's from when I played that clip of Aaron at the beginning of the show.

3149
03:01:14,900 --> 03:01:16,740
I'm going to go to 20 after now in overdrive.

3150
03:01:16,740 --> 03:01:18,020
I can't let the show in like this.

3151
03:01:19,620 --> 03:01:21,300
We had like a big IT crash yesterday.

3152
03:01:21,300 --> 03:01:23,940
This never happens, but how is it running our news station?

3153
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:25,860
I know it's crazy, isn't it?

3154
03:01:25,860 --> 03:01:28,740
Your site, was Infowars down because of the traffic?

3155
03:01:29,380 --> 03:01:33,380
We thought it was traffic at first and a lot of it was traffic, but it was also a hack.

3156
03:01:33,380 --> 03:01:36,340
It's not even fair to say that I run a news organization.

3157
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:40,580
I run an AM radio station, but we do not.

3158
03:01:40,580 --> 03:01:43,140
I mean, there's four people there at any given time.

3159
03:01:43,140 --> 03:01:44,340
That's the most amount.

3160
03:01:44,340 --> 03:01:46,420
You have an army of people.

3161
03:01:46,420 --> 03:01:50,420
In fact, back when I was an intern and Mancout came to town, we had a sports station across

3162
03:01:50,420 --> 03:01:50,980
the hall.

3163
03:01:50,980 --> 03:01:55,380
We used to call it a boyquarium because all the windows, you could see all the young interns

3164
03:01:55,380 --> 03:01:57,220
just buzzing around, making things happen.

3165
03:01:57,860 --> 03:01:59,940
And that's what it's like here for people that can't see.

3166
03:01:59,940 --> 03:02:03,620
There's just people everywhere doing stuff, all active all at once.

3167
03:02:03,620 --> 03:02:09,700
You come to our station and the morning show is fed in and the afternoon show is fed in

3168
03:02:09,700 --> 03:02:10,580
from Austin.

3169
03:02:10,580 --> 03:02:14,980
And so in between, we're doing what we can to support those shows, to get things up on

3170
03:02:14,980 --> 03:02:18,020
the web, and to get sponsors that get it.

3171
03:02:18,980 --> 03:02:22,660
It's one thing for Rush Limbaugh to get a bakery to sponsor that show.

3172
03:02:22,660 --> 03:02:23,540
It's not easy.

3173
03:02:23,540 --> 03:02:28,580
It's another thing for somebody to get a bakery in Main Street USA to sponsor a show that

3174
03:02:28,580 --> 03:02:31,220
is saying, hey, things are wrong.

3175
03:02:31,220 --> 03:02:33,540
It takes a special kind of advertiser to do that.

3176
03:02:33,540 --> 03:02:33,860
So-

3177
03:02:33,860 --> 03:02:38,340
Well, also what's happening is that people are intimidated by the system.

3178
03:02:38,340 --> 03:02:42,500
But I've actually noticed now that the tyranny is so out in the open, people are really starting

3179
03:02:42,500 --> 03:02:43,220
to actually go, you know what?

3180
03:02:43,220 --> 03:02:44,340
It's time to stand up against this.

3181
03:02:44,340 --> 03:02:45,220
Are you finding that?

3182
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:47,780
It is, but it's almost like you got to put up a bat signal.

3183
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:49,540
It's great to have a radio station.

3184
03:02:49,540 --> 03:02:53,780
The next thing that I want to do in Chicagoland is I want to get a couple of billboards in

3185
03:02:53,780 --> 03:02:58,500
really nice locations with either some of the artwork that you guys use promoting this

3186
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:03,860
show, almost like a bat signal to kind of wake people up and go, hey, there's something

3187
03:03:03,860 --> 03:03:04,500
going on.

3188
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:05,300
Check out this billboard.

3189
03:03:05,300 --> 03:03:08,980
Get a little conversation going about it in the market.

3190
03:03:08,980 --> 03:03:10,260
America's in trouble.

3191
03:03:10,260 --> 03:03:11,300
Find out why.

3192
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:11,700
Exactly.

3193
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:13,060
I want to turn America around.

3194
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:14,180
It's on the radio now.

3195
03:03:14,980 --> 03:03:17,380
The Joker picture, some of that stuff even.

3196
03:03:17,380 --> 03:03:19,620
I mean, people, it takes things like that.

3197
03:03:19,620 --> 03:03:22,580
They're used to seeing regular advertisements.

3198
03:03:22,580 --> 03:03:24,580
They're used to seeing Subway or whatever it is.

3199
03:03:24,580 --> 03:03:29,860
I saw a billboard on my way to the airport to come see you, and it was blurry on purpose.

3200
03:03:29,860 --> 03:03:30,980
Blurry on purpose.

3201
03:03:30,980 --> 03:03:31,780
You can't read it.

3202
03:03:31,780 --> 03:03:35,460
And then as you get closer underneath, you say, I think it's time to get your eyes checked.

3203
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:37,060
And it's like, wait a minute.

3204
03:03:37,060 --> 03:03:38,340
My eyes are fine.

3205
03:03:38,340 --> 03:03:42,340
You put up a billboard to make it look like my eyes are bad to then get my attention to

3206
03:03:42,340 --> 03:03:45,620
then get me to consider going to whatever vision center it is.

3207
03:03:45,620 --> 03:03:47,300
Well, that's like you might die of a heart attack.

3208
03:03:47,300 --> 03:03:48,500
Go get it checked right now.

3209
03:03:48,500 --> 03:03:51,380
They don't tell you that they're catching all these doctors putting stents in people

3210
03:03:51,380 --> 03:03:52,100
that don't need them.

3211
03:03:52,100 --> 03:03:52,580
Yeah.

3212
03:03:52,580 --> 03:03:52,980
Yeah.

3213
03:03:52,980 --> 03:03:58,260
So just like you guys take the things that they're doing and use them to get information.

3214
03:03:58,260 --> 03:04:01,700
I think that's the next thing that we need to do in Chicago is put up three or four billboards

3215
03:04:01,700 --> 03:04:05,940
in a few strategic places that really get people talking, shine the light on what's

3216
03:04:05,940 --> 03:04:06,500
going on.

3217
03:04:06,500 --> 03:04:11,140
And then what will happen is the guy that owns the bakery that will support this movement

3218
03:04:11,140 --> 03:04:12,900
and the show and the station, etc.

3219
03:04:12,900 --> 03:04:15,700
He'll find us and then we can talk and we can show him how great things.

3220
03:04:15,700 --> 03:04:16,180
Absolutely.

3221
03:04:16,180 --> 03:04:20,740
And again, the great part about live radio is one of our local affiliates, 590 AM.

3222
03:04:20,740 --> 03:04:24,100
They've got all that is an old fashioned big news thing with like 15 people in there.

3223
03:04:24,100 --> 03:04:27,300
You know, you'll hear him play the traffic wrong or somebody's live on air that doesn't

3224
03:04:27,300 --> 03:04:27,780
know it.

3225
03:04:27,780 --> 03:04:29,220
That's what makes it so real.

3226
03:04:29,220 --> 03:04:32,580
So, you know, the guys almost have a heart attack once a week when something screws up

3227
03:04:32,580 --> 03:04:33,940
and I'm like, hey, it's all right.

3228
03:04:33,940 --> 03:04:34,980
It's interesting.

3229
03:04:34,980 --> 03:04:35,940
And that's what makes it real.

3230
03:04:35,940 --> 03:04:37,300
Now, I promise to go to your call.

3231
03:04:37,300 --> 03:04:37,860
So be ready.

3232
03:04:37,860 --> 03:04:39,140
Allen in Kentucky.

3233
03:04:39,140 --> 03:04:43,460
We're going to go to you and we're going to go to everybody else that's holding with our

3234
03:04:43,460 --> 03:04:48,100
guests riding shotgun on the other site of this break.

3235
03:04:48,100 --> 03:04:53,540

3237

Stay with us.

3239

Our operation as we move to the next level.

3240
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:37,060
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

3241
03:05:37,060 --> 03:05:42,740
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

3242
03:05:43,300 --> 03:05:50,900
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

3243
03:05:50,900 --> 03:05:53,140
and ultimate extermination.

3244
03:05:53,140 --> 03:05:54,580
The war is here.

3245
03:05:54,580 --> 03:05:56,500
It's an info war.

3246
03:05:56,500 --> 03:06:02,340
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

3247
03:06:04,020 --> 03:06:08,180
You've come to expect winter specials from Herbal Healer Academy, and we're not going

3248
03:06:08,180 --> 03:06:09,220

Who wants to be disease free, full of energy and vibrant health?

3264
03:07:06,180 --> 03:07:10,420
Two reasons you may feel constantly tired and run down could be that your body's acid

3265
03:07:10,420 --> 03:07:12,900
level is high and your pH level is low.

3266
03:07:12,900 --> 03:07:14,660
How does acid enter your body?

3267
03:07:14,660 --> 03:07:18,580
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, tap water, stress and cell phones.

3268
03:07:18,580 --> 03:07:22,340
Plus your own body produces acid on a regular basis.

3269
03:07:22,340 --> 03:07:26,100
Alkavision plasma pH drops alkalize the water you drink and raise your pH level.

3270
03:07:26,100 --> 03:07:30,420
They promote more oxygen in your system, higher energy potential and many other documented

3271
03:07:30,420 --> 03:07:31,300
health benefits.

3272
03:07:31,300 --> 03:07:36,820
And studies show viruses, bacteria and toxins cannot survive an alkaline high pH environment.

3273
03:07:36,820 --> 03:07:42,260

Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN

3279
03:08:17,940 --> 03:08:18,820
Radio Network.

3280
03:08:18,820 --> 03:08:21,780
All right, Matt Dubiel is in studio.

3281
03:08:21,780 --> 03:08:24,740
He is the general manager of our Chicago affiliate.

3282
03:08:24,740 --> 03:08:28,660
And we're doing a few more segments here, taking your phone calls on this Thursday edition.

3283
03:08:28,660 --> 03:08:33,060
Ladies and gentlemen, we confirmed a bill has been introduced and added into the big

3284
03:08:33,060 --> 03:08:39,700
omnibus gun grab bill, saying that the IRS, the government will order all semi-autos turned

3285
03:08:39,700 --> 03:08:39,940
in.

3286
03:08:39,940 --> 03:08:44,420
They're now just saying all handguns on CNN, and that they will then give you a tax credit

3287
03:08:44,420 --> 03:08:45,540
for what they say it's worth.

3288
03:08:45,540 --> 03:08:50,900
I mean, whoa, the confiscation mechanism is now being put in.

3289
03:08:50,900 --> 03:08:52,500
I wanna go to some of your phone calls.

3290
03:08:52,500 --> 03:08:56,180
We've got the bill, Kurt Nemo's doing an article on it right now.

3291
03:08:56,180 --> 03:09:00,740
I mean, this is gonna be breaking news, cuz I went and looked, the gun sites don't even

3292
03:09:00,740 --> 03:09:02,020
have this information.

3293
03:09:02,020 --> 03:09:08,020
And we have confirmed it in the 113th Congress, introduced on Monday, and we're just learning

3294
03:09:08,020 --> 03:09:10,100
about it on Thursday from a caller.

3295
03:09:10,900 --> 03:09:12,820
Matt, where do you think all this is going?

3296
03:09:14,500 --> 03:09:19,940
It's scary because I think you're gonna have your insurance companies ask you if you have

3297
03:09:19,940 --> 03:09:20,900
a gun in the home.

3298
03:09:20,900 --> 03:09:24,740
You're gonna have doctors so and so, your pediatrician's gonna ask you if you have a

3299
03:09:24,740 --> 03:09:25,780
gun in the home.

3300
03:09:25,780 --> 03:09:29,300
And what happens when I got little kids, I got four little kids.

3301
03:09:29,300 --> 03:09:34,020
If somebody asked my kids a question, especially somebody in a position of authority, teacher,

3302
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:38,980
doctor, somebody, they're honest children, they're going to answer.

3303
03:09:38,980 --> 03:09:46,100
And their answers could dictate the course of a path for that family that is very bad

3304
03:09:46,100 --> 03:09:46,740
or very good.

3305
03:09:46,740 --> 03:09:51,620
I mean, if this is creepy government, like in every other authoritarian system, sticking

3306
03:09:51,620 --> 03:09:57,380
its snout in there when they're the ones that disarm the schools and advertised it as giant

3307
03:09:57,380 --> 03:09:58,420
shooting zones.

3308
03:09:58,420 --> 03:10:03,220
I mean, this is absolutely totally off the charts, insane.

3309
03:10:03,220 --> 03:10:07,540
And they're announcing a Homeland Security program to demonize gun owners and harass

3310
03:10:07,540 --> 03:10:09,780
gun owners from 100 different angles.

3311
03:10:09,780 --> 03:10:13,700
This is what I've been saying on air was really set up for, because I had their manuals.

3312
03:10:13,700 --> 03:10:16,180
They're just unveiling what was already there, Matt.

3313
03:10:16,180 --> 03:10:20,020
If you don't have a gun in the house, you're marked to be a victim.

3314
03:10:20,020 --> 03:10:22,980
Like the newspaper display of all the houses that don't have guns.

3315
03:10:22,980 --> 03:10:24,980
If you have one, you're crazy.

3316
03:10:24,980 --> 03:10:28,420
So at some point, then you got to say, well, what do we say?

3317
03:10:28,420 --> 03:10:29,220
Do we have guns in the house?

3318
03:10:29,220 --> 03:10:30,180
Don't we have guns in the house?

3319
03:10:31,140 --> 03:10:33,860
Are people going to even talk about having guns anymore?

3320
03:10:33,860 --> 03:10:36,660
Are they going to be like the smokers that are in front of the office building that are

3321
03:10:36,660 --> 03:10:36,820
now-

3322
03:10:36,820 --> 03:10:38,500
No, no, that's what the Attorney General said.

3323
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:41,540
He said, we have to make it look bad for the citizens to own guns.

3324
03:10:41,540 --> 03:10:44,740
And we have to literally brainwash them as the quote, but what you just said is key.

3325
03:10:44,740 --> 03:10:45,700
Think about this, folks.

3326
03:10:45,700 --> 03:10:46,660
Pinch yourselves.

3327
03:10:46,660 --> 03:10:56,820
The government is sitting here right now in everybody's face, attempting to tell you that

3328
03:10:56,820 --> 03:10:57,940
you're bad, you're dirty.

3329
03:10:57,940 --> 03:10:59,300
We're going to publish your name.

3330
03:10:59,300 --> 03:11:00,900
We're going to ask your kids questions.

3331
03:11:00,900 --> 03:11:02,180
This is outrageous.

3332
03:11:02,180 --> 03:11:03,940
Bullying is what we're seeing.

3333
03:11:03,940 --> 03:11:06,900
And the problem is we don't ask questions.

3334
03:11:06,900 --> 03:11:09,220
We don't ask questions about authority.

3335
03:11:09,220 --> 03:11:13,700
I took the little boy that was in the wheelchair video with the TSA, took him to the doctor.

3336
03:11:13,700 --> 03:11:16,900
We wanted to get a flu test just to see, we have to watch this.

3337
03:11:16,900 --> 03:11:19,620
And the first thing the doctor asked me was, did he get a flu shot?

3338
03:11:20,420 --> 03:11:22,260
And I said, no.

3339
03:11:22,260 --> 03:11:22,900
Well, why not?

3340
03:11:23,940 --> 03:11:24,420
Why not?

3341
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:26,340
What do you mean why not?

3342
03:11:26,340 --> 03:11:27,060
Why did I know?

3343
03:11:27,940 --> 03:11:28,820
He just didn't.

3344
03:11:28,820 --> 03:11:30,500
Now let's talk about, does he have a fever?

3345
03:11:30,500 --> 03:11:31,460
Does he have this?

3346
03:11:31,460 --> 03:11:35,220
So when the doctors make me, and I started to sweat a little bit.

3347
03:11:35,220 --> 03:11:36,580
I don't know, did I do something wrong?

3348
03:11:36,580 --> 03:11:37,220
Am I going to?

3349
03:11:37,220 --> 03:11:40,500
So then what happens when they're asking, do you have a firearm in the house?

3350
03:11:40,500 --> 03:11:41,140
Do you have this?

3351
03:11:41,140 --> 03:11:45,380
No, no, no, they're making you a suspect for something that's not even illegal.

3352
03:11:45,380 --> 03:11:49,460
And listen, the flu shots have never been accurate for whatever the flu is.

3353
03:11:49,460 --> 03:11:50,820
They lower your immunity.

3354
03:11:50,820 --> 03:11:53,140
This is all a major government admissions.

3355
03:11:53,140 --> 03:11:54,900
The insert says it can kill you.

3356
03:11:55,460 --> 03:12:01,220
The insert says it can kill you, kill you.

3357
03:12:01,220 --> 03:12:04,500
But they go, hey, you're gonna take it or you're not taking your baby home.

3358
03:12:04,500 --> 03:12:06,660
Alex, four of us had the flu.

3359
03:12:06,660 --> 03:12:08,900
Four out of six of us had the flu three weeks ago.

3360
03:12:08,900 --> 03:12:11,860
We went to the doctor, they tested us, we had the flu.

3361
03:12:11,860 --> 03:12:13,540
We made it through in four days.

3362
03:12:13,540 --> 03:12:14,260
And you know what they said?

3363
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:15,940
They said, well, you have flu A.

3364
03:12:15,940 --> 03:12:17,460
And I said, okay, well, what difference does it make?

3365
03:12:17,460 --> 03:12:21,300
They said, well, people that have been vaccinated typically have flu B.

3366
03:12:21,300 --> 03:12:22,500
And I went, oh, interesting.

3367
03:12:22,500 --> 03:12:26,580
So everybody that has been vaccinated has one kind of flu.

3368
03:12:26,580 --> 03:12:29,220
And everybody that hasn't been vaccinated is getting another kind of flu.

3369
03:12:29,220 --> 03:12:30,580
Well, let me put it to you this way.

3370
03:12:30,580 --> 03:12:31,300
Go ahead, sorry.

3371
03:12:31,300 --> 03:12:33,700
Well, there's various viruses out there.

3372
03:12:33,700 --> 03:12:35,380
There's thousands and thousands of flus.

3373
03:12:35,380 --> 03:12:38,500
How did they know which one to inoculate you for that year?

3374
03:12:38,500 --> 03:12:41,220
So and my point is, all four of us survived.

3375
03:12:41,220 --> 03:12:42,100
We made it through.

3376
03:12:42,100 --> 03:12:42,980
We had a fever.

3377
03:12:42,980 --> 03:12:44,260
We got sick for a few days.

3378
03:12:44,260 --> 03:12:45,700
We didn't send the kids to school.

3379
03:12:45,700 --> 03:12:46,900
We didn't go to the store.

3380
03:12:46,900 --> 03:12:48,340
We stayed away from people.

3381
03:12:48,340 --> 03:12:50,500
And then when it was over, we got back to our lives.

3382
03:12:50,500 --> 03:12:52,660
But see, that's that guilt thing that you're gonna make them sick.

3383
03:12:52,660 --> 03:12:59,300
Well, if they've had the vaccine, it says it can paralyze you and cause permanent narcolepsy,

3384
03:12:59,300 --> 03:13:00,180
Guillain-Barre.

3385
03:13:00,740 --> 03:13:02,100
I mean, this is all admitted.

3386
03:13:02,100 --> 03:13:07,140
And that's what's so frustrating to me is that it just gets worse and worse as a society.

3387
03:13:07,140 --> 03:13:09,860
Let's jam in some phone calls here.

3388
03:13:09,860 --> 03:13:14,420
Let's go ahead and talk to Alan in Kentucky.

3389
03:13:14,420 --> 03:13:15,060
Go ahead, Alan.

3390
03:13:16,500 --> 03:13:17,380
Yeah, Alex.

3391
03:13:17,380 --> 03:13:17,880
Yes, sir.

3392
03:13:18,580 --> 03:13:24,020
But you're quickly becoming the, well, you probably are the leader of the people that

3393
03:13:24,020 --> 03:13:26,260
woke up there in Kentucky for information.

3394
03:13:27,620 --> 03:13:31,540
I just wanted to bring something to your attention and your guests' attention.

3395
03:13:31,540 --> 03:13:33,540
I'd like to see people kick it around a little bit.

3396
03:13:33,540 --> 03:13:36,980
But there are some of us that are on psychotropic drugs.

3397
03:13:38,420 --> 03:13:40,980
You know, I've been on psychotropic drugs for 20 years.

3398
03:13:42,020 --> 03:13:43,380
I've had a gun that whole time.

3399
03:13:44,740 --> 03:13:46,340
I haven't shot anybody.

3400
03:13:46,340 --> 03:13:48,340
I haven't wanted a gun at anybody.

3401
03:13:48,340 --> 03:13:52,340
I haven't had a problem, which I'm proud that I didn't.

3402
03:13:53,140 --> 03:14:00,980
But if somebody doesn't step up and say, look, we've got to find a way to see whether these

3403
03:14:00,980 --> 03:14:11,380
people are competent or not, some kind of a real way of doing it, there's going to be

3404
03:14:11,380 --> 03:14:13,140
people that will not go that need help.

3405
03:14:14,020 --> 03:14:16,900
And there's going to be people that need help that will stop them.

3406
03:14:17,860 --> 03:14:20,420
And I just wanted to bring that to your attention.

3407
03:14:22,420 --> 03:14:27,460
Well, what's happening is we're already chemically imbalanced from all the additives in the food.

3408
03:14:27,460 --> 03:14:31,860
And so I'm not saying that out of the 60 million people on some type of psychotropic, it hasn't

3409
03:14:31,860 --> 03:14:33,060
actually helped somebody.

3410
03:14:33,060 --> 03:14:37,620
Most people can take LSD and not jump off cliffs, stab their wife.

3411
03:14:37,620 --> 03:14:41,460
But still, LSD is a very dangerous drug because some people are going to have a bad trip and

3412
03:14:41,460 --> 03:14:42,900
they're going to kill their neighbors.

3413
03:14:42,900 --> 03:14:44,260
And these are in that class.

3414
03:14:44,260 --> 03:14:48,740
And see, it's one thing if you maybe had a chemical issue and they put you on a drug

3415
03:14:48,740 --> 03:14:50,660
that actually helped you as an individual.

3416
03:14:50,660 --> 03:14:51,940
Different strokes for different folks.

3417
03:14:51,940 --> 03:14:52,980
I'm a libertarian.

3418
03:14:52,980 --> 03:14:55,540
You know, I say decriminalize all this stuff.

3419
03:14:55,540 --> 03:15:01,220
My issue is they put 67% of foster kids on psychotropics on average nationwide.

3420
03:15:01,220 --> 03:15:03,140
And the average is on seven drugs.

3421
03:15:03,140 --> 03:15:05,860
Now, these kids are bombed out of their brain.

3422
03:15:05,860 --> 03:15:09,460
And most of these mass shooters, it turns out the Batman guy was on five drugs that

3423
03:15:09,460 --> 03:15:10,500
they're now learning.

3424
03:15:10,500 --> 03:15:11,620
Five psychotropics.

3425
03:15:11,620 --> 03:15:12,820
Oh, this one made you crazy.

3426
03:15:12,820 --> 03:15:14,500
Let's put more, more, more, more.

3427
03:15:14,500 --> 03:15:17,860
So I'm not saying some people can drink whiskey and be nice.

3428
03:15:17,860 --> 03:15:19,620
Some people drink whiskey and they beat their wife.

3429
03:15:20,340 --> 03:15:21,940
Some people don't need to be drinking.

3430
03:15:21,940 --> 03:15:26,900
So what I'm saying is the drugs definitely are tied to the mass shootings.

3431
03:15:27,460 --> 03:15:28,020
Okay.

3432
03:15:28,020 --> 03:15:30,980
And so stop blaming my guns and inanimate object.

3433
03:15:30,980 --> 03:15:33,220
Start blaming high powered drugs on it.

3434
03:15:33,220 --> 03:15:33,940
Your comment on that?

3435
03:15:33,940 --> 03:15:36,740
Well, yeah, it's people have said before you take away the cars then.

3436
03:15:36,740 --> 03:15:38,340
Well, they could drive and they could have a problem.

3437
03:15:38,340 --> 03:15:39,140
They could stab it.

3438
03:15:39,140 --> 03:15:41,460
I mean, there's people that are on psychotropic drugs.

3439
03:15:41,460 --> 03:15:42,420
There's mothers.

3440
03:15:42,420 --> 03:15:46,500
Oh, these stories break my heart where the mother drives the car with the kids into the

3441
03:15:46,500 --> 03:15:46,740
lake.

3442
03:15:46,740 --> 03:15:48,500
We had that happen in Chicago a few years ago.

3443
03:15:48,500 --> 03:15:50,180
Or chops their arms off of the Mayclaver.

3444
03:15:50,180 --> 03:15:50,740
Always on it.

3445
03:15:50,740 --> 03:15:51,940
You can't, what are you going to do?

3446
03:15:51,940 --> 03:15:52,740
Take everything away.

3447
03:15:52,740 --> 03:15:54,100
Put everyone in a rubber room.

3448
03:15:54,100 --> 03:15:55,220
You can't do that.

3449
03:15:55,220 --> 03:15:57,460
What you can do is start at home.

3450
03:15:57,460 --> 03:15:58,980
Don't feed your kids garbage.

3451
03:15:58,980 --> 03:16:04,020
Don't drug your kids up and take care of a home court first and then worry about other

3452
03:16:04,020 --> 03:16:04,420
people.

3453
03:16:04,420 --> 03:16:08,020
And notice how exactly, notice how they're attacking the family right now.

3454
03:16:08,020 --> 03:16:11,460
The family is the only thing in church that is holding things together.

3455
03:16:11,460 --> 03:16:15,220
It's churches that go and bail people out of jail when they've been arrested for no

3456
03:16:15,220 --> 03:16:15,780
reason.

3457
03:16:15,780 --> 03:16:19,780
It's churches that were able with the whole Hurricane Sandy to hold things together.

3458
03:16:19,780 --> 03:16:21,380
FEMA said clothes for bad weather.

3459
03:16:21,380 --> 03:16:22,580
And it wasn't a joke.

3460
03:16:22,580 --> 03:16:24,420
I mean, it's families and churches.

3461
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:25,940
And they're the things under attack.

3462
03:16:25,940 --> 03:16:29,620
What do all you yuppies think is going to happen when everything collapses?

3463
03:16:29,620 --> 03:16:31,620
That's the end of your martini parties.

3464
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:33,220
It's the end of Sex and the City.

3465
03:16:33,220 --> 03:16:34,660
Because I know there's a lot of women out there.

3466
03:16:34,660 --> 03:16:35,460
I'm not blaming women.

3467
03:16:35,460 --> 03:16:37,940
A lot of women are awake who are like, oh, I don't want to hear negative.

3468
03:16:37,940 --> 03:16:38,660
Let's party.

3469
03:16:38,660 --> 03:16:39,300
Let's have fun.

3470
03:16:39,300 --> 03:16:40,580
The government's your friend.

3471
03:16:40,580 --> 03:16:42,420
No, it's not honey cake.

3472
03:16:42,420 --> 03:16:43,300
It's not your friend.

3473
03:16:43,300 --> 03:16:44,260
Comments on that.

3474
03:16:44,260 --> 03:16:46,980
My kids, I've fed them McDonald's.

3475
03:16:46,980 --> 03:16:47,780
We're human beings.

3476
03:16:47,780 --> 03:16:50,260
Every now and then we've given in and, oh, we go to McDonald's.

3477
03:16:50,260 --> 03:16:52,420
I've seen, I can tell when they eat that stuff.

3478
03:16:52,420 --> 03:16:55,460
Because later on, they're acting like they're not my kids.

3479
03:16:55,460 --> 03:16:59,380
No, no, we've been on the highway and fed a McDonald's and they act like demons that

3480
03:16:59,380 --> 03:16:59,700
day.

3481
03:16:59,700 --> 03:17:01,540
And I come home and I go, well, what do they have?

3482
03:17:01,540 --> 03:17:02,420
Oh, they have McDonald's.

3483
03:17:02,420 --> 03:17:06,420
Oh, so everyone else is putting that stuff in their kids all the time.

3484
03:17:06,420 --> 03:17:09,940
And then they go and they take them in and get them on ADHD meds or whatever.

3485
03:17:09,940 --> 03:17:13,540
So take a step back, lead your family.

3486
03:17:13,540 --> 03:17:15,780
And you're right, they want to tear up the family.

3487
03:17:15,780 --> 03:17:18,260
They don't want strong men leading their family.

3488
03:17:18,260 --> 03:17:21,060
And they don't want strong women with their strong men.

3489
03:17:21,060 --> 03:17:23,780
Who get that a strong family is a strong man.

3490
03:17:23,780 --> 03:17:27,540
They're teaching women a strong family is a man who's following you.

3491
03:17:27,540 --> 03:17:32,100
Yeah, an emasculated man that's carrying her purse and following her around.

3492
03:17:32,100 --> 03:17:34,260
You see it everywhere and these women are not happy.

3493
03:17:34,260 --> 03:17:35,140
Yeah, they're not.

3494
03:17:35,140 --> 03:17:36,420
And the kids aren't happy.

3495
03:17:36,420 --> 03:17:41,780
And because of that, folks are growing up with parents that are on the phone all the

3496
03:17:41,780 --> 03:17:42,020
time.

3497
03:17:42,020 --> 03:17:43,380
And we, you know what, we're human.

3498
03:17:43,380 --> 03:17:45,700
We try and put the iPhones away later and not text.

3499
03:17:45,700 --> 03:17:48,340
We're all guilty of it, but at least you can be conscious of it.

3500
03:17:48,340 --> 03:17:52,740
You got to because if you're not, then before you know it, it's going to spiral out of control.

3501
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:55,140
Then you're going to be going, well, they should be doing this.

3502
03:17:55,140 --> 03:17:56,020
They should be doing that.

3503
03:17:56,020 --> 03:17:56,900
Well, wait a minute.

3504
03:17:56,900 --> 03:17:58,740
Let's get our home turf in order first.

3505
03:17:58,740 --> 03:17:59,460
Let's start at home.

3506
03:17:59,460 --> 03:18:00,900
Well, I'm really glad you came to visit me.

3507
03:18:00,900 --> 03:18:01,620
I'm impressed, man.

3508
03:18:01,620 --> 03:18:04,180
What a great general manager of our Chicago station.

3509
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:05,300
Thank you, Alan.

3510
03:18:05,300 --> 03:18:07,620
We're not blaming anybody on psychotropics.

3511
03:18:07,620 --> 03:18:13,300
Okay, I just said you shouldn't put young devil worshipers on it because it's young

3512
03:18:13,300 --> 03:18:15,860
devil worshipers in every case on this that do it.

3513
03:18:15,860 --> 03:18:17,700
Let's talk to Josh in Wisconsin.

3514
03:18:17,700 --> 03:18:18,580
Josh, you're on the air.

3515
03:18:19,780 --> 03:18:21,300
Hi there, Mr. Jones.

3516
03:18:21,300 --> 03:18:21,780
Hey, buddy.

3517
03:18:23,300 --> 03:18:24,980
It's a pleasure to be on here with you.

3518
03:18:24,980 --> 03:18:26,820
I know you ain't got much time.

3519
03:18:28,420 --> 03:18:37,140
I had called you last month about a gun on, you know, Mr. Obama's thing and all this chaos,

3520
03:18:37,140 --> 03:18:40,180
but I called you last month about it.

3521
03:18:40,180 --> 03:18:48,820
And the day I got out of incarceration, I ended up, thank God, I ended up talking to

3522
03:18:48,820 --> 03:18:49,460
you that day.

3523
03:18:50,580 --> 03:18:58,980
And well, needless to say, I'm just hoping that I'd be able to get my gun back.

3524
03:18:58,980 --> 03:18:59,380
I don't know.

3525
03:18:59,380 --> 03:19:02,820
I've been pinpointed for the last month.

3526
03:19:02,820 --> 03:19:06,260
Yeah, what's happening is a lot of people are being arrested for petty things.

3527
03:19:06,260 --> 03:19:10,820
In some of these bills, they talk about we may just take your gun and never give it back

3528
03:19:10,820 --> 03:19:11,940
for no reason.

3529
03:19:11,940 --> 03:19:13,620
It's like these random investigations.

3530
03:19:13,620 --> 03:19:16,580
They're going to start persecuting gun owners like we're Al-Qaeda.

3531
03:19:16,580 --> 03:19:17,780
I appreciate your call, sir.

3532
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:20,980
I don't actually remember your exact story.

3533
03:19:20,980 --> 03:19:25,140
Ladies and gentlemen, you need to visit the website 1530wckg.com.

3534
03:19:25,140 --> 03:19:29,700
It's got free iPhone apps where you can pick up all the great shows that are there, including

3535
03:19:29,700 --> 03:19:30,420
mine.

3536
03:19:30,420 --> 03:19:33,060
And we just appreciate you carrying the show live, Matt.

3537
03:19:33,060 --> 03:19:33,700
Very exciting.

3538
03:19:33,700 --> 03:19:35,300
We appreciate you doing the show.

3539
03:19:35,300 --> 03:19:39,620
You know, if you didn't do it, we'd have to choose from all the other garbage that's out

3540
03:19:39,620 --> 03:19:39,780
there.

3541
03:19:39,780 --> 03:19:44,740
That's the same, the same, the same right and left political Republican Democrat.

3542
03:19:44,740 --> 03:19:46,660
And it's nice to have an alternative to that.

3543
03:19:46,660 --> 03:19:51,300
Coming up next, we've got the Kentucky sheriff, the amazing patriot.

3544
03:19:51,300 --> 03:19:52,980
And he's warning of civil war.

3545
03:19:52,980 --> 03:19:55,380
If they try to take the guns, he's coming on.

3546
03:19:55,380 --> 03:19:59,860
And we've got the article up at info wars.com gun confiscation bill introduced in Congress.

3547
03:19:59,860 --> 03:20:05,860
IRS credit to citizens who allow government to confiscate their firearms.
