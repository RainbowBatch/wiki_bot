1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,480
big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,120
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,440
Alex Jones

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:32,560
all right welcome to the Alex Jones show it is Monday January 21st 2013

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,320
inauguration day of our well the second coming of our Lord and Savior according

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:49,560
to the mainstream media yes all hail Obama all praise Obama and you made you

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,580
may know something about history and by the way I'll give you a rundown of the

8
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,000
guests we have coming up today is a hard-hitting show we've got a lot of

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,480
breaking news a lot of hard-hitting guests as well but just this

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,800
inauguration thing if you probably notice it throughout history the less

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,760
legitimate a government is the more pompous and over-the-top the ceremonies

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,100
are for its illegitimate leader and that's what we saw here today just a few

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:23,400
minutes ago with the Obama inauguration a band playing all these people I'm

14
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,800
surprised I didn't have stiff-legged soldiers marching around with the Heil

15
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,760
Hitler type of sign going out there you know I'm surprised they didn't have 57

16
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,460
Air Force jets and nuclear missiles on on vehicles rolling down the road and I

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,360
mean anything you know people holding up the Emperor's fake invisible clothes I

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,040
mean I'm surprised they didn't just go all out because it's so ridiculous that

19
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,880
the complete illegitimacy of this government now and this Obama

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,920
administration think about it if Ron Paul had been elected president do you

21
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,720
think Ron Paul would have wanted all this this just pompous celebration of

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:13,320
him no Ron Paul would say we don't need a party we don't need it just just

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:20,240
all this show what we need is to have a quiet dignified confirmation that the

24
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Bill of Rights is alive in America today all we need is to not have a man in

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,840
charge but principles of liberty in charge and there we go for those

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,800
watching on prison planet TV a picture of the inauguration oh my gosh the

27
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,240
draping of the flags this looks like something pulled right out of Nazi

28
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,920
Germany I mean it is all put that back up on the screen guys and show me some

29
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,400
more photos because I was actually driving in during some of this I didn't

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,160
see it all this looks like a Hitler inauguration it it looks exactly like it

31
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,560
you just change the flags to a different you know German Nazi Germany flag and

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:06,240
that's it and the the postures of the people are the same the pompousness the

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,640
arrogance is the same this is sick it is sick where this country is going folks

34
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,240
and just to remind us Obama has been tweeting out now this morning saying I'm

35
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,880
honored and grateful that we have a chance to finish what we started our

36
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,400
work begins today he says that's a quote from Obama that he tweeted out our work

37
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,800
begins today oh what what work let's uh let's talk about that the work of

38
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,560
dismantling the US economy the work of destroying our jobs the work of

39
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,320
essentially revoking the Bill of Rights the First Amendment the Second Amendment

40
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,960
the Fourth Amendment the Fifth Amendment and of course completely ignoring the

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:54,200
Tenth Amendment the work of turning our airports into Nazi police state security

42
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,280
zones with naked body scanners yeah I know they say they pulled those but

43
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,760
they're they're replacing them with all millimeter wave machines so the

44
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,440
announcement that the TSA is pulling those scanners is a bit of a hoax

45
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,680
they're just replacing them with other machines so what is Obama's work really

46
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,960
in this country what has he done in the last four years that he's going to

47
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,640
continue look at it take an honest look at what he has done without even

48
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,800
thinking about political affiliation unemployment is up we've got 128 million

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,520
Americans now living on the government dependent on the government and for some

50
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,320
reason those people are still even allowed to vote why should people who

51
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,040
are living on the government be allowed to vote to control the revenues of the

52
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,400
taxpayers who are actually contributing to society why should the takers be able

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,640
to control the outcomes of elections in a free nation it doesn't even make any

54
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:54,520
sense anyway all that much more straight ahead plus some hard-hitting guests like

100
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,440
as well as Martin Luther King and his desire to carry concealed and his

101
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,600
support for the right of self-defense and I think by the way oh by the way

102
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,800
this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Alex will be back tomorrow I'm just the

103
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,840

104
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,840
appreciate your support I'm just here fighting for liberty that's it that's

105
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,240
why I'm here so we've got a bunch of news coming up on gun control on the

106
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:59,680
economy on issues like this one and the MIT I'm sorry a Harvard Medical School

107
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,200
professor is seeking a quote adventurous woman to give birth to a Neanderthal man

108
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,960
that they're going to implant in her body by reconstructing the DNA of

109
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:20,200
Neanderthals how much more evidence do you need yet that we're violating the

110
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,920
will of the Creator hmm it's not just GMOs with plants and corn I mean now

111
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,240
they're gonna they're gonna actually try to have a woman give birth to a

112
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,640
Neanderthal and then what what are they gonna do then what are you gonna what

113
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,120
are you gonna do with the Neanderthal you're gonna make it president I mean

114
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,280
what do you do with a live Neanderthal it's it's insane this is this is this is

115
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,520
a violation of nature and it's going on from every angle but let me give you a

116
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:53,520
quick rundown before I get too far into this coming up at the bottom of this

117
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,760
hour we have as a guest author max velocity yes max velocity that is his

118
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,120
call sign he's the author of this book contact a tactical manual for post

119
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,440
collapse survival and the reason I'm having max velocity on is because he

120
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,840
served in the British Army as well as the United States Army and he is now a

121
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,200
US citizen but he's one of those rare individuals who has perspective from

122
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,640
both the UK and the US as well as being well-informed on survival and the

123
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,240
Patriot movement in the United States so that should be a fascinating interview

124
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,620
don't miss that from max velocity in the next hour we've got Sheriff Denny

125
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,120
Paimon he was on last week with Alex Jones he is that sheriff I believe he's

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,760
from Kentucky if memory serves me correctly he's the sheriff that posted

127
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,680
that famous now famous YouTube video where he was almost brought to tears

128
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,120
talking about the founding fathers and the sacrifice that they made in order to

129
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,640
bring us the liberty and the freedom that we are desperately trying to

130
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,360
protect today and then in the third hour we're going to be joined by John

131
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,600
Rapoport for a few minutes with some additional comments and updates on the

132
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,760
psychiatric police state that has now been implemented in the United States

133
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,780
but getting back to what is actually happening today and real quickly Lance

134
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:19,200
Armstrong books are being moved to the fiction section of a library in

135
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,920
Australia they've now decided that Lance's entire history is complete

136
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,880
fiction yeah so they're moving them to the fiction section which seems

137
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,480
appropriate but the real reason that I bring that up is because Barack Obama is

138
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,040
the Lance Armstrong of politics think about that for a second why is Barack

139
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,320
Obama the Lance Armstrong of politics well Barack Obama is a highly charismatic

140
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,360
person he's a good-looking person like Lance Armstrong I know some of you might

141
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:56,760
argue with me but I'm saying across the board a lot of people look at Obama at

142
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,280
the way he speaks at the way he carries himself he has charisma so does Lance

143
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,600
Armstrong they both got charisma but what else do they have in common they're

144
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,000
both lying to you that's all they know how to do is lie and deceive in order to

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,760
climb their way to the top of positions of power and influence they use the

146
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:23,040
media to manipulate the public and they are indignant against their accusers and

147
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,480
whistleblowers and they they say things like how dare they even suggest that that

148
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,860
I was doping or that that or in Obama's case how dare anyone suggest that he was

149
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,800
going to sign the NDAA the NDAA the National Defense Authorization Act which

150
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,880
of course he helped write or his attorneys did his administration did and

151
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:51,840
then he signed we have been infested infected with a culture of charismatic

152
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:59,040
liars psychopaths sociopaths who all they know how to do is lie in order to

153
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,900
get to the top they do not honor ethics they do not honor spirituality they

154
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,680
typically don't believe in a creator they don't believe in the human soul

155
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,120
they don't believe in an afterlife they don't believe in in judgment that any of

156
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,800
us are ever going to be judged for actions all they know how to do is live

157
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,560
as charismatic parasites living off the goodwill of people who are easily

158
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,520
manipulated into supporting them that is Lance Armstrong in my opinion and that

159
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,160
is Barack Obama in my opinion and I think I the one reason Obama is so

160
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,400
dangerous is because he's so charismatic is far more charismatic than Bush ever

161
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,840
was and she can't look at Bush and and say charisma no the the last person who

162
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:52,080
had this kind of widespread charisma was probably Bill Clinton and also another

163
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,880
highly accomplished liar these people are all liars and but they're

164
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,500
believable liars they know how to lie with such apparent credibility that they

165
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,480
sucker people into it even we had the the obama phone lady here sitting right

166
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,400
there in this in this office what was the last week with Alex or the week

167
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,920
before and she was not aware that Obama lied about raising your taxes she was

168
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,800
not aware that Obama lied about not taking away your guns but once she

169
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,480
became informed about that her position changed very quickly once she became

170
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,720
aware of the truth she actually began to start questioning some of her own

171
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,720
support for Obama so that's just one example of what happens when people

172
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,720
actually collide with the truth you know the truth that Alex Jones says to them

173
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,440
and by the way I think I'm going to try to approach this topic with with all

174
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,560
seriousness I think it is time and this is my opinion this is not Alex Jones

175
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,320
opinion this is not info wars opinion but I think it is time that we began to

176
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,680
make a list of all those who are enemies of the Bill of Rights who are enemies of

177
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,480
America anyone who has publicly advocated the stripping away of your

178
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,360
Second Amendment rights or your First Amendment rights or who calls for the

179
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,800
end the abolishment of the Constitution or who calls for destroying the Bill of

180
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,840
Rights or forfeiting all of the rights that are granted to you under the Bill

181
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,680
of Rights I'm talking about people on the news I'm talking about news anchors

182
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,160
I'm talking about writers it's time we made a list now you might say what's the

183
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,200
purpose of this list the purpose in my opinion should be eventually as the

184
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,080
Patriots restore the Republic in America because I believe that's what's coming

185
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,880
we must arrest these people on the list and strip them of their citizenship and

186
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,960
here's why if they do not believe in the Bill of Rights and they would want to

187
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,160
strip you of your Second Amendment rights then what right do they have to

188
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,720
even call themselves Americans if they do not believe in your rights they

189
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,880
forfeit their own so anyone who is out there speaking out against the

190
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,480
Constitution speaking out against the Bill of Rights is technically an enemy

191
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,500
of America if they do not believe in the founding fathers they do not believe in

192
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,200
the very principles the philosophies the ideas that great that gave us the great

193
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,840
abundance the innovation the freedom and the liberty to become the greatest

194
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,280
nation on our planet if they do not believe in those things they are not

195
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,280
Americans they are not Americans and they are trying to destroy America by

196
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,640
turning it into a nation where none of us have those rights anymore where we

197
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,520
don't even have the separation of powers anymore where the executive orders from

198
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:45,080
one president whether it's Obama or some future president can override Congress

199
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,920
and override representation and override public debate on issues that really

200
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,000
matter to our day-to-day lives I say because I'm an advocate of non-violence

201
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,880
I say we make a list now and we put these people on this list with the

202
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,960
intention of having them arrested and stripped of their citizenship take their

203
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:13,520
passports take their IDs put them on a list do not ever enter this land of the

204
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,480
free again you are barred for life from the Republic of America have two ships

205
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,680
waiting one on East Coast the ship on the East Coast sails to Havana you can

206
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,400
get on that ship or the ship on the West Coast sails to North Korea you can get

207
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,920
on that ship it's your choice because it's it's the land of the free so you're

208
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,440
free to choose which ship you want to leave on and then we kick these people

209
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,320
out of America we send a message that says if you're going to be an American

210
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,440
if you're going to be on the media in America if you are going to have any

211
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
position of power in America if you're going to be a member of Congress and

212
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,680
vote on bills a member of the Senate then you must support the philosophies

213
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,280
of freedom and liberty and justice upon which this great republic was originally

214
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,240
founded and I want to put that idea out there with all necessary and justified

215
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,440
force I don't mean violent force I mean dedication is what I mean because again

216
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,640
this is this is the nonviolent way to do this there are some people out there

217
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,520
that are maybe more radical that would say they should shoot those people I say

218
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,240
no no we must operate with dignity we must operate with honor we must adhere

219
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,320
to the principles because of being philosophically correct and of non

220
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,160
violence because we are in the right we are in the right we have history on our

221
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:47,160
side we have God on our side we have the Bill of Rights on our side and anyone

222
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,520
who is an enemy of those of those fundamental philosophies rest assured

223
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,440
they are an enemy of this nation and they must be they must be shown the door

224
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,520
get out of America you traitors get out of America now today is Martin Luther

225
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,600
King Day and I believe that Martin Luther King would agree with much of

226
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,480
what I'm saying here maybe not all of it but I know that Martin Luther King was a

227
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,480
man who espoused nonviolent solutions that he believed in the Second Amendment

228
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,920
the right to self-defense he applied for a concealed carry he knew that his life

229
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,840
was being threatened and he was correct that there are dangerous people that

230
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,400
were trying to silence him so he wanted a firearm to carry for his own

231
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,960
self-protection and he was right to seek that out if Martin Luther King were

232
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,720
alive today I believe he would condemn the actions of Barack Obama he would say

233
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,600
Obama you are wrong to take these rights and freedoms away from the American

234
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,120
people including all the African Americans out there who have the right

235
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,320
to self-defense to defend themselves against tyranny or threats of violence

236
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,920
or anything that might threaten their own safety or the safety of their

237
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,920
families or communities that's what Martin Luther King would say today I

238
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,480
believe stay with us we'll be right back on the Alex Jones show looking back on

239
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,120
2012 we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,040
Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships

welcome back this is Mike Adams the health Ranger filling in for Alex Jones

299
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,480
today I'm the editor of naturalnews.com a frequent contributor to infowars.com

300
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,440
and check out infowars.com right now and every day during the broadcast here

301
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,480
as more news is being posted it seems like every hour there's a Kurt Nemo and

302
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,760
Don Salazar are working very hard as well as other writers Paul Joseph Watson and

303
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,920
other contributors to get to bring you the news that really matters now just to

304
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:49,440
clarify during the last segment yes I did advocate creating a list of all of

305
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,320
those people in America who are calling for the abolition of the Constitution or

306
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,000
the Bill of Rights and then having those people arrested and stripped of their

307
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,880
citizenship and deported from the country yes that's it that is exactly

308
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,440
what I'm going for let there be no mistake and it makes perfect sense

309
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,800
because they are traitors from within in fact think about it Obama today in the

310
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,160
inauguration he swore an oath to defend the Constitution I mean how could that

311
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,040
not be comedy hour Obama swearing an oath to defend the Constitution but the

312
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,920
entire crowd should have broken out in bouts of mad laughter when when he swore

313
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,920
that because he is the one destroying the Constitution but that that oath

314
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,560
means you must swear to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and

315
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,200
domestic why is that even in the Constitution because the founding

316
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,800
fathers knew that there would be many enemies of America from within the most

317
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,080
insidious kind enemies from within enemies of the Constitution enemies of

318
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,440
the Bill of Rights enemies of the founding principles upon which this

319
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,040
great nation was originally created which which gave rise to the abundance

320
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,880
and the innovation and the freedom that made this the greatest nation in the

321
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:09,320
world so why should we tolerate these enemies from within to run around our

322
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,360
country and continue to try to destroy it why should we tolerate that we should

323
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,480
arrest them we should kick them out again I'm an advocate of non-violence so

324
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,520
I don't I don't think we should commit any violence to that I'm not saying we

325
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,440
should throw them in secret prisons like Obama does I'm not saying we should put

326
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,000
them on a kill list like Obama does I'm not saying that we should do what Obama

327
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,560
does and launch unmanned drone missiles to kill innocent children that's what he

328
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:40,240
does I'm not saying that at all I mean Obama is the king of violence he talks

329
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,520
about protecting children from violence he's the one killing children with

330
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,200
violence I mean it's it's such hypocrisy but why should we let these people run

331
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,560
around and try to destroy our country from within we shouldn't we should make

332
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,600
a list have them arrested give them a fair trial show the evidence of what

333
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,640
they said on television what they said on CNN those people that said Alice

334
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,720
Jones should be popped and shot with an ar-15 they should be arrested stripped

335
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,840
of their citizenship and shown the exit shown the door you're out of the country

336
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,800
buddy don't come back go to North Korea that probably have a place for you there

337
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm sure you could clean toilets in the gulag for Kim Jong-un yeah they might

338
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,520
love that they might love that job that's what we should do with them now

339
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,600
I've got a video all across the country over this weekend there were gun rights

340
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,320
protests our Second Amendment advocation protests at state capitals everywhere

341
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,360
and I've got a video here from this this is a short speech by Roger Saucier the

342
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,360
one of the co-founders of the Connecticut Minutemen group and here's

343
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,400
what he had to say on the on the Capitol steps of the state of Connecticut over

344
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,640
the weekend fellow patriots I am here to support our second amendment right to

345
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,760
bear arms which is provided to us by our Constitution but not just these rights

346
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,240
only but for all the god-given rights that our government has no business

347
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,720
interfering with who the hell are they to tell us that we can't have solved or

348
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:20,240
20-hour soda or an ar-15 I only have one comment I will not comply

349
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,880
yes I will not comply those are the words of Roger Saucier the founder or

350
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,760
co-founder of the Connecticut Minutemen group and his words were reflected all

351
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,640
across the country in dozens of other protests at state capitals by people who

352
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,640
are fed up and who have had enough of the tyranny who've had enough of enemies

353
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,520
of America operating from within trying to destroy the Constitution and the Bill

354
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,080
of Rights they're trying to bring us to a civil war okay that's what they're

355
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,920
doing they're trying to turn America into a war zone so that they can then

356
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,640
launch their drones on Americans and they can then activate their kill lists

357
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,840
on Americans American patriots returning veterans they're trying to take over

358
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,640
because they're losing they're so desperate they're so desperate that look

359
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,360

360
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,960
on with only two defenders of the Second Amendment the polls that they show that

361
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,220
the mainstream media shows are completely fabricated they'll delete the

362
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:24,120
poll if the gun rights are winning or they'll change the numbers to make it

363

403
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,200
all right we're back on the Alex Jones show welcome back on this Monday this

404
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,160
inauguration day January 21st 2013 this is Mike Adams the editor of natural news

405
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:28,840
dot-com filling in for Alex today it's also Martin Luther King Day and we had a

406
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,840
few comments about Martin Luther King and his advocation of gun rights for

407
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,400
private citizens you know it's funny we got banned by Facebook a few weeks ago

408
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:44,200
for posting a graphic where Gandhi was speaking out in support of self-defense

409
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,080
because you know all human beings have a sacred divine right to defend themselves

410
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,520
against aggressors and Gandhi understood that and we put that on a graphic and we

411
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:59,640
put that out on Facebook and Facebook suspended our account yep and in fact

412
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Drudge linked to that story and it became quite quite a quite a bit of a

413
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,000
story across the internet well Martin Luther King was also an advocate of gun

414
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,280
rights so you've got these two people who history shows or at least mainstream

415
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,800
history says these are the champions of non-violence of pacifism that they say

416
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,720
you're supposed to just lay down and be obedient that is not what they said at

417
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:30,200
all Gandhi only resorted to non-violence because his countrymen were disarmed if

418
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:36,360
Gandhi had an ar-15 and his countrymen had an ar-15 they would have kicked the

419
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:43,680
British out of that colony a long time many years earlier Gandhi had to resort

420
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:47,280
to non-violence because that was the only thing left and even in his own

421
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,360
writings the doctrine of the sword in particular the doctrine of the sword you

422
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,800
can search that online he spoke of using self-defense to protect yourself or your

423
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,800
brother or your family from aggressors who were intent on violence so don't be

424
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,520
fooled into thinking that Gandhi or Martin Luther King only espouse

425
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,320
non-violence no they knew that we have a sacred divine right to self-defense and

426
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,160
they both understood the role that firearms play in protecting innocence

427
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,200
from aggressors and that's why Martin Luther King's own house was described as

428
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:25,320
an arsenal of weapons he had all kinds of guns in there because people were

429
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,640
trying to kill him as actually happened he was right to be armed as are you

430
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,560
because you never know what kind of bad person out there might be trying to take

431
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,920
you out or take what you own or just commit random acts of violence that's

432
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,400
why we need responsible upstanding citizens to be armed when they're showing

433
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,760
that graphic there with Gandhi that we did post if you're watching a prison

434
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,000
plant TV in any case changing the subject now we are joined by our first

435
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,960
guest today his name is max velocity or his his call sign I should say and he's

436
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,960
the author of this book contact a tactical manual for post-collapse

437
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,920
survival now max velocity was born in the UK and he served in the British

438
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,160
Army first before serving in the United States military and he has a very unique

439
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,520
perspective therefore I'm serving in the militaries of both nations and a unique

440
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,040
perspective on a nation that has strict gun control versus America which has gun

441
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,240
rights and gun freedoms so you can find his books on amazon.com and everywhere

442
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,040
else and we'll give out its website soon but max velocity joins us now welcome to

443
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,800
the show max hi thanks very much for having me on it's a my pleasure to have

444
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:45,240
you have you on you've just released a new book called Patriot Dawn that lays

445
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,960
out a rather frightening scenario of what could happen in America can you

446
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,440
give us a just a brief synopsis of what that book is all about and what you're

447
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:58,680
trying to explore narratively through that work of fiction yes yeah sure

448
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,520
really that book is a result of my personal journey as I came through the

449
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,280
whole prepping thing to writing my own books and my own manuals trying to give

450
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,480
people the tools to to be able to defend themselves initially you know when I was

451
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,540
writing contact it was more of a collapse kind of situation and as I

452
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:25,160
learned more it kind of also gave gives you the tools for you know perhaps a

453
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,520
civil war resistance against the tyrannical government all the tools are

454
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,360
in there and then I the reason I wrote Patriot Dawn was because it really came

455
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,080
to my attention that the fiction is a good way of getting things across to

456
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,800
people some people might not want to buy a manual it might have you know too

457
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,000
technical that kind of thing tactics but so what I've tried to do with with

458
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,920
Patriot Dawn is to prevent is to is to write about what I think is a very

459
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,740
realistic scenario not that I expect it to happen exactly the same way that I go

460
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,800
through in the prologue to Patriots Patriot Dawn it's just setting a scenario

461
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,100
there's something I think you know may well be coming soon and by telling a

462
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:11,360
story try and sort of probably tell it an interesting story but also to educate

463
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:17,320
people in a little bit of tactics a little bit about what they might face

464
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:22,920
what things they might be against and just to try and use that medium to get

465
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,440
the point across well on the on the philosophical side let me ask you this

466
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,120
you were born and raised in the UK you became an American citizen many years

467
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,320
later what are your beliefs and philosophies on the Second Amendment the

468
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,480
Bill of Rights the right to self-defense versus living in a disarmed society I'm

469
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,400
I mean it's not a canned question I'm actually curious about what kind of

470
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,920
contrast you see what are your thoughts on all that yeah well I mean I am a

471
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,440
despite the accent I am a US citizen I consider myself a patriot I have sworn

472
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,360
the oath on joining the US military and when I became a citizen I take it very

473
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:07,140
seriously I joke a little bit I'm now here living in the United States I have

474
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,800
an American wife and children and I I should almost be suing for breach of

475
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,760
contract because I came to America before I came on so many years with and

476
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,280
before and you know US military forces that kind of thing in place like the

477
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,120
Middle East and it wasn't that much of a of a of a change to me to actually come

478
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,480
and I mean associated with Americans for a long time before that so it wasn't a

479
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,040
great culture shock to me I've taken it very seriously and I fully support the

480
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:45,440
Second Amendment I fully support the Constitution although because of things

481
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,880
like the UCMJ I have to be careful what I would say because for instance you

482
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,320
know the commander-in-chief is the president and so therefore I have to be

483
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,440
careful what I say but I will point out that that the when you swear your oath

484
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,600
of allegiance you swear your oath of allegiance to the Constitution exactly

485
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,280
not to a person but to the Constitution so what if what if someone violates the

486
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,720
Constitution what is your allegiance to them well we see that all the time you

487
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,240
see that people seem to be violating the Constitution and there doesn't seem to

488
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,160
be anything any repercussions or consequences for that right it just

489
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,280
happens all the time and you've got these instances like Benghazi you've got

490
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,680
the you know the I forget the name of it you know the Mexican gun running thing

491
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:39,120
yeah the the Sinaloa cartel are all kinds of different cartels a drug fast

492
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,720
and furious operation that you know you see you know thuggery across the United

493
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:47,960
States with police officers doing things unconstitutionally the TSA you've got

494
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,480
lots of things going on unconstitutional and really something needs to be done

495
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,200
about that and you originally asked me the question you know how you know how

496
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:01,640
do I feel about how do I feel about it well having come from the UK and now

497
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,920
being a US citizen I feel privileged to be in the United States and given that I

498
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,040
started on this path planning for like a prepper planning for a collapse before I

499
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,480
really got to the political side of it and started to wake up and see the

500
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,680
dangers inherent in our own country the importance to me of having firearms

501
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,960
whatever you want to call them weapons is one of them that you call it you have

502
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,000
your personal weapon that's what it's called so I mean people use the language

503
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
but you need those to be able to defend yourself against whatever may happen I

504
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,240
feel privileged that should a collapse happen if I'm living in the United

505
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,040
States I'll have the ability to defend my family if I'm living in the UK I have

506
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,480
nothing well that's a good point so we are on the verge many people believe of

507
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,480
an economic collapse a global cascading debt collapse of the trillions or more

508
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,920
than a quadrillion dollars in derivatives which are of course you know

509
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:06,160
fake fake constructs of mathematically inclined greed mongers or something yeah

510
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,560
the point is the system it looks ripe for collapse what will happen in the UK

511
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,480
if there is chaos and the citizens have no real way to protect themselves

512
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,920
because they've all been disarmed well I dread to think about my family is still

513
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,240
still living back there and I you know I I really don't know what they can do I

514
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,560
mean I have family who's actually in the British military I would hope that they

515
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,120
would get themselves onto the translation which at least has firearms

516
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,480
to benefit you know and somewhere to actually you know protect themselves

517
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,000
there is nothing most people can do and and this is one of the things you know

518
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,120
you see these I have to mention the name Piers Morgan but you see these

519
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,840
interviews and you know this British guy coming over and telling people they

520
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,080
don't need a Second Amendment anymore but my experience is that the UK is a

521
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,800
very violent society well yeah now that you bring it up let me bring up Piers

522
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,760
Mordor and he joked about shooting rivals this is an article out of Daily

523
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,360
Caller it says in England Piers Mordor joked about shooting I'm obviously

524
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:10,360
invoking Lord of the Rings there Piers Morgan slash the Dark Lord Sauron

525
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:16,520
Mordor joked about shooting rivals said homeowners who killed and said said

526
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,400
homeowners who kill burglars should not be prosecuted so Piers Morgan was saying

527
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,360
that he first he joked about shooting professional enemies and he wrote that

528
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,880
he was a rabid fascist who wanted burglars tortured and quote after a

529
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,140
decent period of cattle prodding testicle electrode treatment and slow

530
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:38,640
gentle skewering over hot coals these are the words of Piers Morgan as

531
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,120
published by Daily Caller what do you think about that well I mean the man's

532
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,040
outrageous he basically got kicked out of the UK and now you know people trying

533
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,320
to pull him from the United States and people in the UK don't want him back I

534
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:58,000
mean he it's not really for him it's not really about banning a certain type of

535
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,120
firearm or gun it's really about his real agenda is banning them all because

536
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,060
he's a you know he's one of these these progressives you know these

537
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:10,560
collectivists these statists and you know he's a he's a front man for all

538
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,480
that so really you know his point I thought I'd forget who it was with I

539
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,920
saw an interview on the internet someone was being interviewed by him and it made

540
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,280
some very good points and he referenced it back to what the real meaning of the

541
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,600
Second Amendment is which is you know to defend against tyranny you know it's not

542
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,200
about being a hunter all those things are things that come out of the fact

543
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,440
that you might have run firearms target on what it's really about and all he

544
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:47,480
could do was just keep the region on this guy so you know it it just it's all

545
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:51,000
on your site I mean it all comes in from so many different angles the kind of the

546
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,720
demonization you know the full crime it's really just about pushing this

547
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,480
agenda and to disarm you know the American population so that anything can

548
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,680
be done to them well that's exactly it you got it you got to ask the question

549
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,160
what kind of a nation or let's say this what is a government planning if it must

550
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,880
first disarm the citizens so in fact there's a quote from the author of this

551
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,040
book called the resistance to tyranny by Joseph P Martino and there's a quote in

552
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,920
here that I believe goes any any any government that attempts to disarm its

553
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,040
citizens is either a tyranny or planning to become one so you gotta ask what are

554
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:35,680
they planning that they got to have everybody disarmed well exactly and I

555
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,560
think you know you guys know a lot more about this I do I'm still on a personal

556
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,280
journey of education with this but you're exactly right because why would

557
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,680
America administration in America want to take away the Second Amendment and

558
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,320
effectively disable the Constitution or you know revoke or get rid of the

559
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:58,360
Constitution which is the thing that that makes America exceptional and has

560
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:03,680
made America what it is right if you take away that Constitution then what is

561
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,480
America anymore I mean they got rid of guns in Australia but they didn't have

562
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:09,860
they weren't protected by Second Amendment right or you know a

563
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,520
constitution so they just basically just they had a similar situation to Sandy

564
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,360
hook and they just said right no more guns but think but think about all the

565
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,680
details of this too we have an illegitimate president who doesn't

566
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,000
qualify whose birth certificate is a total fake an absolute document fraud

567
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,720
you know multiple layers copy and paste font resolutions differ and so on it's

568
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,920
it's an obvious fake that that I I would I would debate that with anybody it's

569
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,160
irrefutable and then we have an administration that runs itself like a

570
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,440
tyranny invoking executive orders bypassing the separation of powers

571
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,960
bypassing Congress which means bypassing representation and the the war of

572
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,960
independence in America was fought in part over the lack of representation of

573
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,800
the American colonies in the decision-making process in the UK so now

574
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:02,080
we have the same kind of kingship and Obama was crowned king yet again today

575
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,120
in another pompous ceremony that really smacked of you know the Fuhrer this is

576
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:12,320
the same issue that we once fought a war over to get away from and to establish

577
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:17,160
liberty that's how crazy it has gotten well my main worry here is that you know

578
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,320
as the United States has progressed through its history from being the

579
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,320
shining light with it with it you know the Declaration of Independence and

580
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,480
Constitution the Bill of Rights now it's becoming basically the federal government

581
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:33,520
is becoming there for its own sake and for whatever other agendas there might

582
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:41,480
be and and it becomes you know it's just becoming another socialist state and

583
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,000
it's just starting to do all the things that socialist states do yeah and about

584
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,040
you know back to a previous point why would they want to disarm why would you

585
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,960
possibly if as administration you were interested in what is best for Americans

586
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,400
because we know that all these arguments about you know gun control are just

587
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,200
specious it's ridiculous I mean you me you me can just say that we don't have

588
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:07,940
to debate it between ourselves it's ridiculous so there is no real reason

589
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,120
apart from agendas and you know thought police type stuff to really want to you

590
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,920
know disarm Americans and and therefore so you disarm all the lawful people and

591
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,360
then basically criminals have the guns and then the worrying probably even more

592
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:25,840
worrying than the criminals having the guns are if there is therefore no

593
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:31,400
defense against tyranny should and you know I say this because I have to but

594
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,940
should an administration become a regime as I have it in my book become tyrannical

595
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,320
nobody's got any defense I mean one of the criminals are going to fight it but

596
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,280
I don't see that happening right now the people who got guns I think I think the

597
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,440
the the brain damaged part of this in the minds of the radical left is that

598
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,160
they cannot ever imagine a government becoming a regime because in their minds

599
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,160
their hardcore belief is that government is the Savior government is the answer

600
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,840
government provides solutions it never causes problems it only provides

601
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:08,440
solutions and therefore how could a government ever murder its own people or

602
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:13,040
commit genocide and I guess they just they have to you know dismiss all of

603
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,560
human history to hold that contradictory belief but they managed to do that they

604
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:21,320
can hold that contradiction in their brain little brain damaged you know

605
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,920
minds I don't know how I don't know how I couldn't even fake like being a

606
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:32,400
radical left you know anti-gun liberal I don't know how they do it I'm not a

607
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,360
psychiatrist but I mean it seems to me that you know you get to that point

608
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:42,400
where you're trying to push this agenda and so you're the you're the you know

609
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,200
the progressive status who's in power you're the socialist whatever it might

610
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,120
be you know your ideal might be communism whatever the exact agenda is

611
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,520
but you therefore have enemies you may construct those enemies because you need

612
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,580
enemies to push your revolution through but at the end of the day it's easy in

613
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:03,720
their mind to justify the removal and destruction of those enemies look what

614
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:10,680
happens in Russia and Nazi Germany or Stalin Russia well that's what it has

615
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:16,080
become with Obama is is that his entire agenda is really just destroying his

616
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,640
enemies it's not about helping America it's not about boosting the economy even

617
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,760
it why should government even have the role of boosting the economy anyway

618
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,560
government's not going to solve that problem it should be government get out

619
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:32,000
of the way let innovation rise but but but Obama is focused on destroying his

620
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:40,240
enemies and not doing anything really for America you didn't build that but

621
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,960
hey Obama's been re-inaugurated and he's gonna do more he's gonna do more he gave

622
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,240
us the phone and he's gonna do more stay with us max velocity we got to go to a

623
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,840
break but we'll be right back after this break with much more straight ahead here

624
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,680

Amendment and for example it has shall not be infringed coming out the barrel

666
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:48,640
what part of shall not be infringed do you not understand I guess it's all

667
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,960
about parsing words now isn't it Bill Clinton is is not is and Obama we're

668
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,680
gonna do more we're gonna do more to erode the Bill of Rights and destroy the

669
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,200
Constitution and we've given them four more years and I guess I guess enough of

670
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,560
popular support to where they think they can try to get away with it but they're

673
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:21,680
continuing with Max velocity the author of contact the author of Patriot Dawn a

674
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,620
very interesting individual who has served in militaries of two nations the

675
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:33,000
UK and the United States and also served as a contractor working alongside US

676
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,680
military men in the Middle East Max you still you still with us there yeah I'm

677
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,320
still here all right great so I wanted to ask you your thoughts since you've

678
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,760
been you know in trenches so to speak with so many individuals in the military

679
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,840
if an order comes down from Washington to say martial laws declared well here's

680
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:56,080
how it would happen first the false flag attack is set off somewhere in a major

681
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:01,460
u.s. city they blame it on gun owners they then declare martial law bring in

682
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:06,280
the military violating posse comment a comment atis and have the military start

683
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:11,320
kicking indoors and confiscating guns to disarm the American citizens do you

684
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,800
think max that American military servicemen would engage in that behavior

685
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:23,240
how or what percent would follow orders or what do you think might happen well

686
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,520
Mike I'm not really sure about percentages but I did basically cover

687
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,600
this topic in my book Patriot Dawn because I actually have you know

688
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,440
resistance elements fighting against what I call regime forces and the way

689
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:40,280
I've described it is I think it would be a split because some people are awake

690
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:46,160
and some people aren't and some people come from different backgrounds so among

691
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:51,680
the great variety of people in the United States military some of them come

692
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,480
from strong kind of patriot families depending on what part of the country

693
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,800
they come from other people don't you don't remember a lot of people are

694
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:05,480
recruited to the military through the inner cities for instance yes so there's

695
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,440
two parts this is really what the background is of of the people in the

696
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,120
military the military reflects the society it comes from and so many people

697
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:18,000
in today's society are not aware of and really understand things like the

698
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,640
Constitution and the Bill of Rights we've got the whole push now you know

699
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,640
for safety and security which is infringing upon people's rights and so

700
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,800
you've got many people in the military who are similar to a lot of the people

701
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,000
or even the entitlement class as we call them you know who are out there in

702
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,200
America today the other side of it is is if you've got an active duty unit for

703
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,640
instance that's sitting on a base if it's chain of command doesn't flinch

704
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:49,400
and it just you know the orders come down and if there is you know an

705
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,480
intelligence briefing that says you know this false flag attack is happening

706
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,880
we're going to say it's a false flag attack but such-and-such has happened

707
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,120
and there are terrorists and we have been ordered to deploy and do operations

708
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,680
against these terrorists in the domestic United States a lot of people aren't

709
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:11,000
going to question that well yeah that's how the manipulation will be done they

710
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,760
would call gun owners terrorists can you stay with us for one more segment max

711

733
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,840
of the great things about what's happening right now is we really have to

734
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:45,080
thank Obama and we've got to thank senator Feinstein from California we got

735
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:51,400
to thank all of these gun grabbers were overreaching vastly overreaching they

736
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:57,280
have made a tactical error they have awakened tens of millions of people to

737
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,200
the reality that we are under siege by an illegitimate unconstitutional and

738
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,520
perhaps even a criminal government and this is going to work in our favor and by

739
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:12,400
us I mean Patriots I mean people who actually believe in America believe in

740
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,440
the founding fathers and the principles upon which we were founded so they've

741
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,400
overreached and Bill Clinton warned about that and just recently this is an

742
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:25,520
article of Politico January 19 Bill Clinton says the Democrats don't trivial

743
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:31,520
don't trivialize the gun culture a lot of these people he's talking about people

744
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,920
who advocate gun firearms ownership private firearms ownership a lot of

745
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,360
these people live in a world very different from the world lived in by the

746
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,920
people proposing these things he means gun control measures I know because I

747
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,920
come from this world yeah Arkansas there is a big gun culture in Arkansas there

748
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,240
is in fact gun culture isn't even the right word it's a culture of liberty and

749
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,520
self-reliance that's really what it is so max velocity continues with us in

750
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,160
this segment he's our guest the author of Patriot Dawn and Max and like your

755
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,800
very good link to the blog on there as well all right and not a lot not a lot

756
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,880
of info on there yeah but I'm sure you'll continue to post but there are

757
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,800
some pictures of you in action what is that a is that a saw a pull auto rifle

758
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,600
there I think yeah much what you're going to but there's yet picture me with

759
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,240
store yeah that was like that's pretty heavy-duty firepower you got there dude

760
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:46,800
that's right is that is that what you have in your house now yeah those full

761
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,240
auto kind of kind of pricey to get those these days yeah not too many private

762
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:55,960
citizens with a saw all right no hammers that's a totally different story but not

763
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:02,080
saws okay only gun owners will get that joke but go ahead sir with your comments

764
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:07,600
on the on the bill Clinton thing about making the gun yes what do you think

765
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:15,520
what do you think about that because multiple thoughts because yes I think

766
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:21,280
maybe in their arrogance people at Feinstein have overreached but what

767
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,960
worries me is I mean we were just talking before about how how military

768
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:28,320
could be kind of persuaded to be used domestically against so-called domestic

769
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,640
terrorists who might just be preppers or gun owners or whatever it is you know

770
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:35,040
you have those those those pronouncements that people having

771
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:38,040
waterproofed ammunition and more than seven days of food could be like

772
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:44,080
domestic terrorists and ridiculous things like that what worries me is is

773
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:50,720
at one point people are going to kind of stand up by which mean I actually may

774
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,040
not do anything violent that's one of the dangers is that it might be some

775
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:58,320
kind of false flag thing which is put onto you know this could be how it

776
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:02,440
begins they've blown up somewhere or they've shot someone and these are the

777
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,080
right-wing extremist terrorists right now we've got to calm down yeah well

778
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:09,600
that's where we're fully expecting that to happen in fact I put I'd put money on

779
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,880

with his comments I can only imagine what he's gonna have to say about

838
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,640
today's pompous inauguration of the king Obama and everything else that's going

839
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,400
on these days but we're gonna go through more news and then at the bottom of this

840
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:03,280
hour we've got Sheriff Denny Paimon from Kentucky who is going to be joining us

841
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,200
as a guest with an update on his thoughts on the Second Amendment the

842
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,160
founding fathers and what's really happening to America in the meantime

843
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:13,600
we're gonna we're gonna go over some news and I'd like to take some calls in

844
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,280
the the second half of this hour so if you if you're interested in calling it's

845
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:28,560
1-800-259-9231 yeah just making sure that's it 1-800-259-9231 all any time in

846
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,860
the next 30 minutes or so and then we will start taking your calls about the

847
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:38,880
Second Amendment or especially if you ever call for Sheriff Denny Paimon now I

848
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:45,240
was just thinking during the break there how is it that these operatives in the

849
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:51,440
Obama administration and in Congress how do they think that they're not gonna

850
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:56,060
face their own sort of Nuremberg trial at some point I mean really do they

851
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:02,720
because look all they've done is they've activated the Bill of Rights resistance

852
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:09,440
to tyranny that was part of the DNA of America they've activated the DNA of

853
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,040
America they've activated the culture of independence and freedom and liberty and

854
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:17,880
they've grossly miscalculated Bill Clinton just pointed that out read that

855
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,240
in the last break Bill Clinton says the Democrats don't trivialize gun culture

856
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:28,480
basically he says you're not gonna make any headway by just dismissing the the

857
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:33,280
pro-gun arguments he says the issue of guns has special emotional resonance in

858
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,600
many rural states it's not just emotional residence it's survival people

859
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,000
you live on a farm you live on a ranch if you don't have a rifle if you don't

860
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,520
have a hunting gun if you don't have a shotgun you you can't succeed in farming

861
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:52,180
believe me I know that because I live on a ranch and that many times that I grab

862
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:56,560
a shotgun and rush outside and have to take care of something to protect our

863
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:03,240
our animals or to investigate a strange noise from a wild animal or a strange

864
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,880
sound or whatever many times you do that and if you're a farmer you need a

865
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:11,840
varmint rifle you might need a hunting rifle a high-powered hunting rifle with

866
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:17,000
like one-half MOA accuracy something like that to really reach out and you

867
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,560
know long-range accuracy but how do these people in the Obama administration

868
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:26,040
actually think and all these people on CNN that are advocating the destruction

869
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,720
of the Constitution the destruction of the Bill of Rights do they not realize

870
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:36,200
that they are admitting their guilt as traitors to America do they not realize

871
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,960
that do they they they have no view of history they have no understanding that

872
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:47,620
they've just admitted total guilt and I tell you what it's on and if if if the

873
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:52,720
communists don't win if they don't take over the entire nation they're all gonna

874
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,160
face trial all right I'm just I'm just putting that out there they're gonna

875
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,040
face trial and may God have mercy on their souls because I'm not so sure that

876
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,400
the citizenry will have mercy on them I'm always an advocate of non-violence I

877
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:09,040
think people should have a fair trial I think we stick to the Bill of Rights we

878
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,120
stick to due process we would give them what they would deny us which is a jury

879
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:19,640
of their peers and and and due process see they would deny us the very things

880
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:25,160
that we would grant them because we are the ones who occupy the moral high

881
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:29,800
ground we are the we are in the right we have the philosophy the ideals upon

882
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,040
which this nation was founded we would grant them a jury trial we would grant

883
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,080
them the right to remain silent we would not try to take away their rights even

884
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,040
though they try to take away ours and that's why we will be victorious because

885
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,760
they will alienate the population if they try to conduct gun confiscation

886
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:51,040
raids even by calling gun owners terrorists it won't take very long

887
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:54,880
before those military bases find out that all their supplies are cut off

888
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,040
because they depend on the goodwill of the citizenry to give them food and

889
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:06,040
water and safe passage to and from the base to their homes as Paul Howe said in

890
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:11,360
a in a recent piece that we talked about here last week or week and a half ago it

891
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:17,120
wouldn't take long before any military personnel based in America who engage in

892
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,920
gun confiscation and the murder of American citizens it wouldn't take long

893
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:26,520
before their homes and their families were identified by resistance groups and

894
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,280
they would start taking casualties so you're either with the Republic or your

895
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:36,200
toast I mean to put it in simple slang you're either with the Republic or your

01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,480

911
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,800
and I'm going to be here to help make that happen it no matter what all right

912
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:59,080
I just want you to know that I know a lot of you don't know me I grew up I

913
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:03,960
played football one year in high school I ran track four years competitive

914
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:10,560
athlete very high academic scores went into engineering school ended up with a

915
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,800
degree in technical writing wrote software documentation found that a

916
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,800
software company became a business innovator and ended up creating a

917
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:24,520
multi-million dollar software firm that sold software to 20 20% 25% of the

918
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:33,760
fortune 500 and found Liberty and the the need for Liberty in the 1990s on the

919
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,480
tail end of the Clinton administration I began to see a beginner my eyes began to

920
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:42,000
be opened to the reality of what was happening in our world and I gotta say I

921
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,320
was in in in college I actually believed a lot of the liberal stuff I was

922
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,600
indoctrinated by the public education system I was I was suckered into the

923
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,840
Clinton charisma and I think a lot of people are suckered into the into the

924
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:04,240
Obama charisma with the same thinking today I had to find Liberty myself I had

925
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:10,880
to read and study and learn and become a defender of Liberty and teach myself

926
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,680
history that the public schools wouldn't teach me so I didn't have the benefit of

927
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,840
homeschooling I didn't have the benefit of private schooling I was a public

928
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,680
school educated you know typical Midwest

929
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:28,240
student and had to come out of that anyway enough about me I just wanted to

930
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:31,120
give you a little background so you know where I'm coming from I come from the

931
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:35,240
Midwest and I had to find Liberty on my own let's get to the other news the

932
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:39,240
kindergartner has been suspended for bubble gum terrorism so that this

933
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,040
kindergartner pointed a five-year-old girl pointed a bubble gum gun at a

934
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:49,880
fellow student a Hello Kitty bubble blower and was then suspended there you

935
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,440
go I also wrote a piece last night about

936
01:16:52,440 --> 01:17:00,760
nerf guns apparently oh my god you can buy on amazon.com a full auto nerf

937
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:06,280
assault rifle that has 18 round magazines I mean high-capacity clips it

938
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:11,080
comes with three of them 18 round magazines and it's full auto man I mean

939
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:16,440
full auto nerf guns and they don't even have background checks required how

940
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:23,000
dare Amazon sell full auto nerf assault rifles to children it's advertised to

941
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:28,160
children the eight-year-olds no background checks no fingerprinting I

942
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:32,920
can't believe it I so I I propose I propose that we have a new federal law

943
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:38,040
that is called the nerf control act of 2013 and what we have to do is limit all

944
01:17:38,040 --> 01:17:43,000
full auto nerf guns to no more than seven rounds of ammo per magazine to be

945
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,680
in compliance with New York and even if you have an 18 round nerf magazine you

946
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:51,960
can only load seven nerf bullets into it otherwise you're a terrorist and you'll

947
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,960
be suspended from your school or they'll make you wear an RFID chip like they do

total hypocrisy of all the Hollywood celebrities who've been calling for gun

955
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:30,080

1020
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,240
yeah we're back it's the Alex Jones show in four wars

1021
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:24,240
calm Mike Adams here filling in for Alex today we've just become aware of a new

1022
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:31,560
law being debated in the Senate SB 124 it turns parents into criminals if they

1023
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:37,240
fail to report to the school that they own a firearm so let me let me just run

1024
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:42,720
this down for you a parent has a child that goes to the school if the parent

1025
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:49,240
owns a firearm that parent must notify the school district that the parent owns

1026
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:54,320
a firearm within 30 days of enrolling the child in the school otherwise they

1027
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,560
become a criminal the written notification needs to include the names

1028
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,720
of the parent and any child attending the school and the fact that the parent

1029
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:07,880
owns a firearm so of course they're trying to create another database and

1030
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,320
they're going to discriminate against her child in the school so you're bad

1031
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:17,480
you're your mommy or your daddy owns a gun you're bad you're evil and they're

1032
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,600
probably going to then force that child into psychiatric care and then use the

1033
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:27,200
psychiatric diagnosis as a justification to take away your right to own a firearm

1034
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:32,720
so you see how this works it's all a catch-22 little scam now how is this

1035
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:40,320
gonna stop a kid like Adam Lanza from killing his parent and stealing her guns

1036
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:45,520
think about that I guess they're gonna have to charge the dead mother of Adam

1037
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:52,240
Lanza with a felony because it's her fault it's her fault that her son

1038
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:58,120
allegedly killed her and took her guns it's her fault I mean if if if your

1039
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,560
child kills you and steals your guns it's your fault they're gonna dig up

1040
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:04,800
your grave they're gonna dig up your body they're gonna throw you in handcuffs

1041
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,640
and charge you with another felony crime and probably have you as a guest with

1042
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:12,440
Piers Morgan just have a corpse right there talking to Piers Morgan just a

1043
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:18,520
corpse Piers Morgan would say to the corpse how dare you be a corpse I think

1044
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:23,820
it's just like zombie time total zombification of America but that law

1045
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:29,600
SB 124 is a I don't think it's on the floor of the Senate yet but it was

1046
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:35,840
sponsored by Chappelle and Nadal Nadal I don't know how you pronounce that those

1047
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,040
are the co-sponsors there you go SB 124 now you have to alert the school if you

1048
01:26:40,040 --> 01:26:46,960
own a firearm and if you have a child in school so one more reason to home school

1049
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,880
folks as if we needed more we got a guest coming up here in just a few

1050
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:56,560
minutes we've got Sheriff Denny Paimon he is the outspoken sheriff who is now

1051
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,160
famous for his YouTube video talking about the importance of the founding

1052
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,640
fathers and what they would want to to see happen in America today which is the

1053
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:10,440
restoration of the Republic and the rights of the people uninfringed so we'll

1054
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,600
have we'll have that sheriff on the show here in just a few minutes here's a

1055
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,140
quote from Bill Clinton this was mentioned last week by Aaron Dykes in a

1056
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:23,520
video Bill Clinton said and I'm not sure what year this is quote when we got

1057
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:27,560
organized as a country and we wrote a fairly radical Constitution with a

1058
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:32,760
radical Bill of Rights giving a radical amount of individual freedom to

1059
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:37,600
Americans this is Bill Clinton again it was assumed that the Americans who had

1060
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,540
that freedom would use it responsibly there's a lot of irresponsibility now

1061
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:47,120
and so a lot of people say there's too much freedom Wow well wait a minute

1062
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:54,040
mr. Clinton when we the people granted power to the government to have limited

1063
01:27:54,040 --> 01:28:00,760
powers to run a few small things in the nation we assume that the limited

1064
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:05,920
government would use those limited powers responsibly but it didn't it

1065
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:11,360
became irresponsible it became oppressive it became a regime it

1066
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:16,720
bypassed the will of the people and has become a monster that is on the verge of

1067
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:22,000
committing genocide so to quote Bill Clinton that's a lot of irresponsibility

1068
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:28,040
and so a lot of people say there's too much government and when government is

1069
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,920
abusing our freedoms you have to move to limit it that's so that's the flip side

1070
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,320
of Bill Clinton's quote you see Bill Clinton was saying that oh my god there's

1071
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:38,680
too much freedom there's too much there's freedom everywhere freedom is

1072
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,840
flowing around it's it's out of control there's so much liberty it's just

1073
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,560
totally out of control what are we gonna do we're gonna have to limit the freedom

1074
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,600
he says but wait a minute the answer is government's out of control it's too

1075
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:52,800
much government in invading every little area of our lives how much water you

1076
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:58,520
could flush in your toilet how big your soda can be in New York and now you got

1077
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,680
to register your your guns if you if you have a kid in school if this bill passes

1078
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,720
I mean that government is intruding in every area of our lives I wouldn't be

1079
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:12,880
surprised if New York mayor of Governor Cuomo passed a law that said you can

1080
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:19,120
only use 2.5 square sheets of toilet paper every time you use the restroom in

1081
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:23,520
New York two and a half sheets and they would require toilet paper manufacturers

1082
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,400
to put extra perforations at the half sheet mark so that you can tear off

1083
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:33,200

YouTube talking about the importance of honoring what our founding fathers

fought for and the liberty they gave us and the moral responsibility that we

1126

have to protect those freedoms for future generations and Sheriff Pymond I

1127
01:33:56,480 --> 01:34:00,680
want to welcome you back to the Alex Jones show thank you very much just my

1128
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:04,400
pleasure to be here well it's it's great to have you back on sir

1129
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:09,720
things are moving rapidly but I first want to ask you what has been the

1130
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:15,240
reaction so far to your appearance last week on the Alex Jones show as well as

1131
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:20,280
your YouTube video what are you hearing from people well it's been it's all it's

1132
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:29,800
all been very you know pro what we're trying to keep here it's been you know

1133
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:33,720
there's been no negative calls whatsoever what I'm getting from people

1134
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:40,040
mostly is that they're ready to dig in they're ready to stand their ground and

1135
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:44,640
that's been that's been really exciting to see that there's still people that

1136
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:48,840
are willing to step up and to stand in the gap even for the people that choose

1137
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,200
not to the people that choose to are still staying in a gap running for their

1138
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:57,920
freedoms but for the freedoms of the people that that obviously don't

1139
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,840
understand what's happening right now so have you had a meeting with your

1140
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,280
deputies then where where it's very clear to everybody that you're standing

1141
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:10,600
your ground you're not going to disarm constituents in your county and so on is

1142
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:15,920
it is it clear to everybody now where you and your office stands yes it's very

1143
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:21,280
clear and the support that's come back from the community has just been been

1144
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:24,880
great sometimes when you make a stance like that you step out I mean I didn't

1145
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,760
ask anybody about it I didn't ask for a pole I didn't ask for the favor if it's

1146
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:36,280
gonna be good or bad I just went by my heart and the commitment that I made

1147
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:41,240
when I took an oath and the way I was raised and the things that I was taught

1148
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:46,720
in my home by my parents there was just no other response to have us but no it's

1149
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:49,560
just not gonna happen here well yeah yeah I mean you're exactly right this

1150
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,960
isn't up to a pole that's the whole point of the Bill of Rights is that this

1151
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,640
is the these things in the Bill of Rights are not subject to debate they're

1152
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:02,200
not subject to popular movements you you always have a First Amendment you always

1153
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,800
have a Second Amendment and so on they cannot be taken away from you no matter

1154
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:09,960
how unpopular they may become in any particular moment in history so you did

1155
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:14,440
the right thing you followed your oath exactly and that's what I think people

1156
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:19,440
are looking for I think a lot of people are still you know what's politically

1157
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:23,600
correct and what's you know gonna get me reelected or you know they have their

1158
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:29,600
own little hidden agendas as to their safe being but with me it was just the

1159
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:34,480
commitment that I had made in the the issues that I count to be important to

1160
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,600
me and to my family and the people around me and that's a that's a very big

1161
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:44,680
commitment is to you know uphold what has been given and handed down to us the

1162
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:49,480
price that others have paid that we might just even you know have these

1163
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:54,520
opportunities absolutely and also just from a a practical and perhaps even a

1164
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:59,160
tactical viewpoint if your population there your constituents if they were

1165
01:36:59,160 --> 01:37:04,000
forcibly disarmed from some other method or if they turn in all their guns for

1166
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,440
some reason which I know they wouldn't do but wouldn't that put you and your

1167
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:13,960
deputies in grave danger responding to 911 calls because now you are you're

1168
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,960
going into situations where you don't have any help of firepower from the

1169
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,440
citizens exactly what I talk with citizens every day and we talk with

1170
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:27,240
those today one that had just come in and I've known this man to carry a gun

1171
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:32,280
for the last 15 years every day that I've been around him I've never seen it

1172
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:35,780
I've never seen his gun but I know every day that he has when I asked him if he

1173
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:41,280
had his his weapon with him easy as he did and you know if I'm out in a remote

1174
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:47,240
area and my closest backup is maybe 30 minutes away and I'm in a bad situation

1175
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:53,200
I should would like to see a citizen like that show up absolutely yeah and I

1176
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:58,640
should be hanging myself out to disarming you know yeah that would be

1177
01:37:58,640 --> 01:38:02,720
crazy have you ever or has have any of your discussions gone into the area of

1178
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:07,880
let's say a possible financial collapse followed by civil unrest and then how

1179
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:11,720
your county might protect your community with the help of armed citizens has that

1180
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:16,440
ever entered your discussions at all not so much like an open discussions in a

1181
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:20,920
meeting or anything like that but just in coffee room talk yeah what people are

1182
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:24,160
saying what they're gonna do and you know you have a lot of people that you

1183
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:27,920
know do the home storage they get the food they get the water and they've been

1184
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,240
real good too but they're pacifist type people yeah and you know I understand

1185
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:36,200
that I respect their beliefs but I also know that that's the first place that

1186
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,920
they're gonna hit because they're they know there's no resistance there right

1187
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:44,560
it's so is that really fair to their family who they have you know proof you

1188
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,320
know said they're gonna provide for for the next year while we go through these

1189
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:52,120
situations these problems and to have somebody else marching to take this

1190
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:55,440
stuff out of their home that leaves them with nothing well there was there was a

1191
01:38:55,440 --> 01:39:00,760
comedian I think it was I think it was Gaffigan who said this he said if if you

1192
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:06,000
store up a bunch of food and you don't have a gun all you've done is stored

1193
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,720
supplies for the biggest bully on the block exactly not not such a good

1194

1213
01:40:40,640 --> 01:40:45,600

01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,800
I learned from Alex I'll sit and question them when I'm sitting in the

1215
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,920
car and asking questions about the ammunition that the Homeland Security

1216
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:58,160

1229
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:58,720
lead a resistance in the Congress against unconstitutional executive

1230
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,200
orders for example is there anything in those conversations that is okay to

1231
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:07,160
share with us publicly well just that we have the same beliefs that we have the

1232
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:12,580
same thing at heart that thing is that at heart is the Constitution and by

1233
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:16,320
serving the people that have put us in these positions that's really that's the

1234
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:20,320
only thing we can do in the position that he takes is being supported by

1235
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:26,880
everybody here yeah and I've had no opposition other than just be high

1236
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,600
regards for for Rand and all that that he's doing and all the people here to

1237
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:37,720
support him have you spoken with Sheriff Mack yes I have good good it is people

1238
01:42:37,720 --> 01:42:43,480
like like you sure Paimon who are the key to victory of restoring the public

1239
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:49,240
in America and I'm sure you realize that but it's a you know it's really kind of

1240
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:52,800
sad in some ways because I've had some people come say oh you know you're

1241
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:57,320
really a hero and what it is it's not being a hero it's a responsibility of

1242
01:42:57,320 --> 01:43:00,880
all Americans absolutely and it is something that should have never got to

1243
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,240
this point in the first place well that's what I said in the last hour and

1244
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:07,400
I know this is gonna be controversial but I said people who openly attack the

1245
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:10,960
Constitution and the Bill of Rights who are saying we should eliminate it they

1246
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:14,480
are enemies of America and we should deport them and strip them of their

1247
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:23,640
citizenship as far as I'm concerned yeah well you know Kim Jong-un needs some

1248
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:26,960
additional servants in his gulags so I'm sure a lot of those folks will be happy

1249
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,520
there let's go to another caller Joe in Pennsylvania with comments on the Second

1250
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:35,560
Amendment Joe you're on the air with Alex Jones show and Sheriff Paimon go

1251
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:40,960
ahead sir how you doing guys doing good um first of all I want to thank you

1252
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:46,400
sheriff what you're doing you know we need more public people people to come

1253
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:51,040
out in public like you are because I'm sure you know a lot of them are you know

1254
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:55,720
thinking the same thing but I think they need to go more public but one thing

1255
01:43:55,720 --> 01:44:01,560
I've noticed on YouTube I think they're suppressing accounts on things because

1256
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:06,040
there's like tons of people that are you know they got these comments about the

1257
01:44:06,040 --> 01:44:13,480
guns and they systematically do that yes yes and it's disheartening and also like

1258
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:17,960
on Facebook you make comments like this and people they just don't care they

1259
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:23,280
just care about cookies and football but I wanted to share I wanted to share

1260
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:28,160
something with you guys I'm sure you you've seen it before but if not I found

1261
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:35,160
a interesting video on YouTube it was published on December 15th of 2012

1262
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:44,280
Australia bans gun guns crime rate soars and they if you didn't see it it just

1263
01:44:44,280 --> 01:44:50,880
shows how they all they're chopping up the guns and and the people they said

1264
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,840
the guy said if I the gun I have I have to keep it locked here it can't be

1265
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:58,120
loaded well let's let's direct that to Sheriff Paimon thank you for your call

1266
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:02,680
Joe but what would happen in your County Jackson County Kentucky if everyone were

1267
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:05,960
disarmed what would happen to the crime rate there in your view it would be it

1268
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:09,520
just go out out the roof I mean we'd have people coming from everywhere just

1269
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,960
to steal from here yeah well hey why don't but Sheriff why don't you just I

1270
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:19,000
got the solution for you you put a big sign on the road that comes into your

1271
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:24,080
county and the sign says gun free zone then you'd be protected right oh I'm

1272
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,360
sure absolutely I'm every good citizen would probably stop there and if they

1273
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:31,040
did have a gun rather than enter they probably turn around and leave and would

1274
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:35,240
not enter that zone if they were you know just a good good citizen that went

1275
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:39,480
by that but of course part of the problem is some of these criminals can't

1276
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:45,520
read because they're illiterate so they came to read gun free zone so that's why

1277
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:48,200
if they can read it it would work then they would just turn their guns in at

1278
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:54,640
the border I'm sure absolutely yeah the biggest problem with this is cold gun

1279
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:59,480
thing is everybody's I don't know what's happened to people's common sense you

1280
01:45:59,480 --> 01:46:04,760
know you and me both brother I mean they're talking stuff that I mean it's

1281
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:09,960
just I would be ashamed to even have that come out of my mouth well it's it's

1282
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:14,640
this magical thinking they they think for example this is mostly from people

1283
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:18,920
who are not familiar with firearms they think that a rifle will leap out of the

1284
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,480
trunk of a car it will load itself it will turn its own safety off and it will

1285
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:28,240
engage in rapid fire as its own animated metallic object without any human being

1286
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:31,840
operating it that's what they literally believe well we tried to you know so we

1287
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:36,200
have something to back that up that's area we took a gun and we placed it in a

1288
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:39,280
room full of people but we hate it where nobody who knew it was in there but yet

1289
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:43,000
it was in plain view and we had people come and go we did that for several

1290
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:46,720
years and not one of those people ever saw that gun felt that gun that gun

1291
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:50,600
never bothered anybody so really we just we didn't know what to do after that

1292
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:54,440
well I'm pretty sure Obama would say that's an unscientific experiment you

1293
01:46:54,440 --> 01:47:03,400
did not have a control group well they also believe I mean at the bottom the

1294
01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:07,240
bottom line is all of us want to see less violence against innocence that's

1295
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:11,320
the goal that we can agree on what what we disagree on is how to get to that

1296
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:16,640
point and for some reason the gun grabbers think that if you if if the

1297
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:21,040
law-abiding citizens turn their guns in the somehow fewer criminals would use

1298
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:27,320
guns how I'm not how does that even make sense well you know I mean it's just I'm

1299
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:30,800
looking at the criminal side of it let's just say I'm a criminal and I'm gonna I

1300
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,840
picked out a school that I'm gonna go attack so I started doing my homework on

1301
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,880
the school and I realized the guy that went ahead of me to go to this school

1302
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:43,400
when he walked into the school guy come out from behind a desk and shot him you

1303
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,480
know he didn't get a chance to shoot anybody yeah chances are I'm not gonna

1304
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,720
go to that school that's right I have to look for another one well there you go

1305
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,520
another argument for arming some of the school personnel let's go to another

1306
01:47:52,520 --> 01:47:57,200
call if you're okay Pat in Texas Pat welcome to the show you're on the air

1307
01:47:57,200 --> 01:48:06,320
with sheriff Paimon go ahead sir I heard this mention lately but many years ago

1308
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:10,840
in Kennesaw Georgia they passed a law that you had to have a gun in your house

1309
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:17,160
law-abiding citizens didn't the crime rate drop 70% of criminal break-ins

1310
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:22,240
dropped 70% overnight good question are you aware of the stats related to that

1311
01:48:22,240 --> 01:48:26,160
sheriff I have heard that but it wasn't here in our area because they didn't

1312
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:32,760
have to pass all like that people had it anyway yeah we're you know that's

1313
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:37,040
something that's just it goes back to the common sense thing you know all

1314
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:41,560
right well do you have a follow-up question Pat yeah I'm worried about that

1315
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:47,320
we you know like taking down the bullets and sail of the bullets away and where

1316
01:48:47,320 --> 01:48:52,800
do you hide those I know Tupperware will hold things the waterproof I put

1317
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:58,080
matches and Tupperware and thrown it in the yard and two years later took them

1318
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:01,400
out and struck them now that's the old Tupperware the new Tupperware is

1319
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:06,160
microwave-proof but I was wondering how do you how do you stop them from

1320
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:09,760
detecting that with a metal detector the kind you go to the beach with and

1321
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:14,920
I can answer that living on a ranch in Texas you throw all kinds of scrap metal

1322
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,560
all over the yard which is pretty much already there anyway if you live on a

1323
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:23,600
ranch you any any other thoughts on that sheriff that's the way it works though

1324
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:28,240
there's already there's bullets buried that they can dig them up years and

1325
01:49:28,240 --> 01:49:31,880
years from now people have thought well enough they had advanced that even if

1326
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:36,440
they pass stuff today they're never gonna get all this stuff so yeah I tell

1327
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:41,000
you if if one of Obama's minions wants to run a metal detector over you know

1328
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,880
400 acres go for it that'll that'll distract you while we restore Liberty in

1329
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,600
the meantime all right let's go to another caller and thank you for your

1330
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:55,320
call Pat Mariah in Iowa Mariah you're on the air with Sheriff Paimon from

1331
01:49:55,320 --> 01:50:02,960
Kentucky go ahead with your call how are you doing great hi Danny are you I'm

1332
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:08,000
doing all right I am in I have a question for you I need some clarity on

1333
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,200
it clarification with all this after the president signed these executive orders

1334
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:19,560
and everybody went into panic I know Alex had a few sheriff on don't know

1335
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:25,820
whether it was you or sheriff Matt I was just I'm in central Iowa I have my

1336
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:31,800
county sheriff ran solely the high-profile individual okay calling

1337
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:36,080
we're gonna have to go to break here real quick but please oh we're skipping

1338
01:50:36,080 --> 01:50:38,960
it okay I'm sorry we're skipping this break go ahead with your question thank

1339
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:43,240
you thank you I really want to get this out in the open I think a lot of people

1340
01:50:43,240 --> 01:50:49,160
are confused at what a share of what what is his duty when he is sworn in my

1341
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:56,000
this this sheriff of my county was like I said a high-profile individual he ran

1342
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:03,240
on his name he was just elected to the second term from his previous job your

1343
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,120
question is what were the responsibilities of the sheriff what the

1344
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:12,720
10th amendment I called him I want to know how he stood on the issue of when

1345
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:20,040
if federal officials were to come in does he have the right to say no you

1346
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:24,680
know these are this is my responsibility these are the people is that elected me

1347
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:29,760
well the short answer is yes but let's let let sure if I'm an answer that the

1348
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,240
sheriff is the highest elected official for law enforcement in your area it be

1349
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:39,680
if it be the county then that's the area where just like Kentucky we're a

1350
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:43,440
sovereign state they've tried to break that what's happened over the years is

1351
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:48,880
the states have given up rights and things to the federal government if you

1352
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:53,000
go back to the way the Constitution was made that there were all individuals

1353
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,320
just like they're trying to make decisions in Washington for the people

1354
01:51:57,320 --> 01:52:02,160
in Jackson County all they can make is the decisions for a mass of people I'm

1355
01:52:02,160 --> 01:52:05,600
gonna do a better job of or the people here are gonna do a better job of

1356
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:11,000
elected somebody that's going to provide for our needs here rather than something

1357
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:16,160
federal now the sheriff here know or the sheriff there knows your problems of

1358
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:20,080
situation of issues better than the federal people coming in the federal

1359
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:25,160
people can pass those laws but most most shares do not exercise the rights and

1360
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:28,040
authority that they do have because most of them aren't familiar with that's

1361
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:34,180
right that's right so a sheriff can say and if if this is passed by the the

1362
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:38,680
local voters a law that says let's say a federal agent cannot enforce an

1363
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:45,360
unconstitutional gun confiscation in the county a sheriff can legally stand on on

1364
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:50,040
the road with force and arrest those federal agents and that is all 100%

1365
01:52:50,040 --> 01:52:55,080
protected under law yes I hope it doesn't come to that I would hope the

1366
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:59,600
feds would back down knowing what would be what they'd be facing but I think

1367
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:02,960
that's what the caller was getting that yeah well I think the way it's gonna go

1368
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,440
I don't think it would be the federal people come in to try to get the guns

1369
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:09,240
anyway because most federal people I've talked to believe the same way that we

1370
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:14,480
believe they swore an oath to the Constitution as well yes and I think

1371
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:20,360
it's gonna take outside of this this country bringing people in it that are

1372
01:53:20,360 --> 01:53:24,920
actually the ones in the long run when it gets to the out to that point but

1373
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,880
this is the key is just don't let it get to that point listen if it in the bud

1374
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:33,720
right now and take control of what is already ours well I I agree with you

1375
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:36,640
hundred percent I know there are many very good men and women in the FBI for

1376
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:41,200
example even in the ATF in the DEA sometimes I criticize the DEA for their

1377
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:45,280
overreaching raids but you know it's there are good people in every branch

1378
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,200
just as there are bad apples in every branch but I think you're right there

1379
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:52,480
are enough good people to prevail but are you talking about like a red dawn

1380
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:55,800
type of scenario something really goes wrong and we have foreign troops in the

1381
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:59,280

u.s. boys back because they wouldn't do that they're not gonna go into some

1385
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:14,000
little woman's house that lives her closest neighbors two miles away and

1386
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:19,600
she's just there with her pets and the only thing she has is a ak-47 laying by

1387
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:23,200
her bed to protect herself I don't think they're gonna take it from her no no and

1388
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:26,400
they will have to use foreign troops but I got to tell you every hunter in Texas

1390
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:35,920
fight if that happens let's go to one more call Austin in Ohio calling in

1391
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:41,040
about the Obama inauguration Austin go ahead you're on the air sir how are you

1392
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:47,720
gentlemen doing today we're fighting for Liberty brother oh yeah I just wanted to

1393
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:52,680
speak my mind on something because this whole Obama inauguration it's just a

1394
01:54:52,680 --> 01:54:57,400
complete hoax I'm just saying people around on social media and just

1395
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:01,400
everywhere in general just worship in this puppet kills kids with little

1396
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:07,000
drones and it's just completely ridiculous how they just worship a puppet

1397
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:11,360
who's doing all of this stuff and the sheep out here are just not doing any

1398
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:15,680
type of research out here and they're making all these biased comparisons to

1399
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:19,360
Martin Luther King and all these pictures and stuff and it's just

1400
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:23,960
completely demonizing and Austin let me let me let you in on something here that

1401
01:55:23,960 --> 01:55:28,120
I'm convinced and sure if you'll find this interesting as well I'm convinced

1402
01:55:28,120 --> 01:55:32,080
that about one-third of all of the Facebook accounts and Twitter accounts

1403
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:38,120
are run by advanced linguistic robots in other words code that's been written to

1404
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:41,560
act like real human beings you don't know that's even a real person so a lot

1405
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:45,880
of that stuff it's a completely like you said it's a complete hoax it's a theater

1406
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:51,600
reaction that's made to appear as if it were real sheriff directing the question

1407
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:56,880
to you and thank you for your call Austin have you seen some of this posts

1408
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,640
on Facebook about you that seemed to be sort of maybe there wasn't really a

1409
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:07,880
person behind it auto-generated type of thing yeah well they're out there the

1410
01:56:07,880 --> 01:56:11,360
robots are running the online world and that's see that's the thing about local

1411
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:15,040
government when you spoke to your constituents on that YouTube video there

1412
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:19,480
you were in person face-to-face eye-to-eye that's real but this this

1413
01:56:19,480 --> 01:56:24,680
stuff on Facebook it's all it could all be a hoax we don't even know yeah very

1414
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:28,600
true that's why I say what you're better off and that's when the sheriff's on the

1415
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:32,440
level of the county level are gonna make a lot better decision for his good his

1416
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:35,960
people his constituents than somebody that's right federal people that's

1417
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:41,000
exactly right that's why they designed it that way are you I'm just curious by

1418
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,680
the way we need more people in positions of authority in in America people like

1419
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:48,920
you and I'm sure you've heard that and I know you're a humble person but have you

1420
01:56:48,920 --> 01:56:54,120
have you ever thought about I don't know run for Congress and in in the state of

1421
01:56:54,120 --> 01:56:59,960
Kentucky or taking on a position of more more influence well I have I've had

1422
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:04,760
people have talked to me a lot about that the last week and I've offered

1423
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:09,480
avenues to do that I I mean what I do is something like that I just have to pray

1424
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:13,560
about it and to see the direction there's nothing worse than to be out of

1425
01:57:13,560 --> 01:57:18,920
the will of what God would have you to do I mean if my sole purpose in life is

1426
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:23,940
to be a sheriff in Jackson County and raise up some young men to go on and

1427
01:57:23,940 --> 01:57:27,400
fill those positions and guide and direct them the best that's what I would

1428
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:32,720
do absolutely well that's that's the sense I get that you you are you are

1429
01:57:32,720 --> 01:57:37,860
already a powerful influential person just by the truth in your voice the

1430
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:43,980
wisdom in your words and without even ever stepping foot in the House of

1431
01:57:43,980 --> 01:57:49,560
Congress you are influencing minds right now in a positive direction that can

1432
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:54,100
influence generations to come well you know people came before us the

1433
01:57:54,100 --> 01:58:00,340
generations before us were women that took a stand and upon that stand people

1434
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:05,440
reacted and moved with that and that's how we that's why we are we are today I

1435
01:58:05,440 --> 01:58:09,880
can still look back into my child and people that helped bold me and its

1436
01:58:09,880 --> 01:58:14,880
responsibility of us to hold that next generation I may never be in Congress

1437
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,600
but if I can mold a young man or young woman to go into Congress and to make

1438
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:24,240
the right decisions that are going to further benefit Liberty and our area

1439
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:28,600
here then that's what that's what I'm doing words of wisdom from Sheriff

1462
02:00:30,680 --> 02:00:33,680
people like Sheriff Denny Pieman who we just interviewed there in that last

1464
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:45,200
are we are blessed to live in a nation where we have the sense of ethics and

1465
02:00:45,200 --> 02:00:50,560
morality and sense of history in the context of the bigger picture with which

1466
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:57,280
we can rise up in resistance to tyranny hopefully peacefully and restore the

1467
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:03,240
Republic so that innocent lives can be saved so the bloodshed can be avoided so

1468
02:01:03,240 --> 02:01:09,480
that we can move forward as a nation of justice of innovation of progress real

1469
02:01:09,480 --> 02:01:17,720
progress for humankind not the the selfish greed progress of an elite few

1470
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:22,260
which is what we're battling against today but I feel proud to be an American

1471
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:27,560
and I've lived all over the world I've lived outside the country I speak a

1472
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:31,600
couple of different languages I've lived in places where guns were illegal for

1473
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:36,840
citizens to own and I've seen what happens there and it's it is a tyranny

1474
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:42,440
it is oppression it's it's a nightmare and do not give up your guns America you

1475
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:49,200
do not want to live as disarmed slaves to a 1984 style Orwellian government that

1476
02:01:49,200 --> 02:01:54,320
demands your obedience you do not want to be in that situation all right we're

1483
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:21,720
to Stephen in Pennsylvania with comments on the Second Amendment Stephen you're

1484
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:27,840
on the air go ahead sir hi folks I was hoping to talk to the sheriff and ask

1485
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:34,840
him what his definition of is a gun a firearm and that's where I think the

1486
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:46,120
solution lies in that the the laws that were passed were regulating firearms and

1487
02:02:46,120 --> 02:02:56,920
if you look back to the original law the definition of a firearm is a I believe a

1488
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:03,360
rifle under 18 inches in length barrel or a 16 inches barrel length or a

1489
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:09,200
shotgun smooth more that will fire a smooth bore rifle that will fire

1490
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:15,520
shotgun type ammunition under 18 inches in length and they were able to pass

1491
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:21,800
that law according to my understanding was back in 1934 when these gangsters

1492
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:27,120
were going into banks and robbing banks and they could hide a short shotgun under

1493
02:03:27,120 --> 02:03:31,760
their trench coat or whatever a long shotgun over 18 inches was very

1494
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:35,080
difficult sure so you're thinking they might be playing word games with us here

1495
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:40,880
and you know doing like a hoax ban on firearms but it doesn't technically

1496
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:46,080
apply is that what you're saying I'm saying explicitly a firearm is only a

1497
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:54,560
smooth bore rifle under 18 inches in length anything 18 inches or over as

1498
02:03:54,560 --> 02:04:02,080
long as it has micro grooving in it rifle all pistols are not firearms not

1499
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:07,360
one single pistol that has a has rifling in it is not a firearm not one single

1500
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:12,960
rifle over 16 inches barrel length is not considered a firearm none of them

1501
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:16,040
are well that's that's a very interesting angle there Stephen I'm glad

1502
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:20,960
you brought that up I guess we'd have to get to some attorneys to help parse the

1503
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:25,680
language to see if there's any legitimacy to that but you know I'll

1504
02:04:25,680 --> 02:04:31,760
take my one and eight twist barrel any day over a smooth smooth barrel right so

1505
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:37,600
I'm glad we have rifling otherwise we would not have range right we would not

1506
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:41,840
have some stable ballistics in flight so thank you for your call that's a good

1507
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:45,640
point we got to go to a quick break and straight ahead as we return here on the

02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:48,200
update with us on the psychiatric police state and also what I'm calling the era

1557
02:08:48,200 --> 02:08:54,320
of thought crimes now being a reality as psychiatrists are given judge dread type

1558
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:57,720
of authority to strip citizens of the constitutional right so that's coming up

1559
02:08:57,720 --> 02:09:05,320
but here we go here are the stories for today rapper Lupe Fiasco thrown off

1560
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:09,680
stage during pre inauguration event after anti Obama rant you see you can't

1561
02:09:09,680 --> 02:09:14,520
have an opinion anymore if it's against the state Obama averages 49% approval

1562
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:18,440
rating in the first term some of the lowest approval ratings that we've seen

1563
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:24,160
in history except for perhaps Jimmy Carter CBS News political director Obama

1564
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:28,520
must destroy the Republican Party you see it's all about destroying the

1565
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:31,920
opposition not about helping America it's not about doing what's right it's

1566
02:09:31,920 --> 02:09:36,700
not about making America a great nation it's about destroying the Republican

1567
02:09:36,700 --> 02:09:41,000
Party and disarming your guns at the same time because of course that's that's

1568
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:45,380
one of the big goals out there remember he gave us a phone and he's gonna do

earlier this morning significantly smaller inaugural crowd expected that's

1575
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:22,040
old news now since that already happened Biden says he's proud to be president

1576
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,880

1580
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:43,660
a scoreboard back here how much news can we get through establishment media

1581
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:52,920
announces the second coming of Obama oh the Christ the king the Obama heil

1582
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:59,080
heil Obama Barack Obama the Lance Armstrong of politics the federal

1583
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:02,680
government now requires that we ask you the following personal questions this is

1584
02:11:02,680 --> 02:11:10,400
from zero hedge and this is whoa whoa what is this if you if we fail to ask

1585
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:16,400
these questions we are subject to I'm sorry I don't understand the context of

1586
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:19,520
this is Obamacare prying into our personal lives even more this is the

1587
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:23,480
danger of getting into the news stack you never know what's in there it's kind

1588
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:27,560
of like Forrest Gump life is like a box of chocolates news is like a box of

1589
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:34,720
randomness Obama I did it as he was sworn in his daughter says good job

1590
02:11:34,720 --> 02:11:39,480
daddy the president responded I did it because it's all about him yes no

1591
02:11:39,480 --> 02:11:48,480
dignity no philosophy no history no principle no ethics all about Obama he

1592
02:11:48,480 --> 02:11:54,200
gave us a phone he's gonna do more Tony Carlucci on prison planet calm the

1593
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:58,080
greatest way to dishonor Martin Luther King is to compare him with US President

1594
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:03,320
Barack Obama I couldn't agree more Martin Luther King a man a man of

1595
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:10,280
substance excuse me a man of substance a man of principle a man who actually stood

1596
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:17,560
for the people versus Barack Obama a deceiver a lying person someone who

1597
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:23,240
knowingly fabricates things and says he won't pass the NDAA and then does says

1598
02:12:23,240 --> 02:12:27,640
he's trying to help Americans and then he destroys the American economy destroys

1599
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:32,240
jobs come on there's no comparison and by the way I hope you know that that's

1600
02:12:32,240 --> 02:12:36,200
that's proof that it's never about skin color around here it's about principle

1601
02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:40,960
as Alex Jones says if there was a black president who protected the Bill of

1602
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:46,120
Rights we would love that guy we would all love that guy where is that guy we

1603
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:48,460
got to find that guy wouldn't that be great

1604
02:12:48,460 --> 02:12:54,480
the quote Jamie Foxx how great is that to find a black president that that

1605
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:59,640
supports the Bill of Rights how great is that that's what we need but we haven't

1606
02:12:59,640 --> 02:13:03,720
found one yet and we haven't found a white president that supports the Bill

1607
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:08,820
of Rights what am I talking about that would be great too that's Ron Paul you

1608
02:13:08,820 --> 02:13:14,480
know how great would that be to have Ron Paul in all right continuing and by the

1609
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:17,400
way John Rappaport will be joining us here in just a couple of minutes I think

1610
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:20,520
I'm finally starting to have fun here today I was I was kind of down in the

1611
02:13:20,520 --> 02:13:24,080
first couple of hours not down but but serious you know I usually come in here

1612
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:30,440
more jovial joking around more flippant sorry to use those big words for those

1613
02:13:30,440 --> 02:13:34,880
of you who are public school educated like I only the homeschoolers will

1614
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:38,960
understand that I don't have to look it up all right I'm just joking don't take

1615
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:44,080
it all too seriously folks Americans not in labor force has increased eight point

1616
02:13:44,080 --> 02:13:48,620
three million eight point three million more Americans jobless under Obama thank

1617
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:53,240
you and he's gonna do more flu season fuels debate over paid sick time laws in

1618
02:13:53,240 --> 02:13:57,280
New York they're trying to pass laws that would mandate companies to pay for

1619
02:13:57,280 --> 02:14:02,040
for employees to stay home sick that way they're saying well they wouldn't come

1620
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:05,760
to work sick and spread the flu hey once you just give out vitamin D at work it's

1621
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,760
like a couple cents a day why don't you just give them some vitamin D and then

1622
02:14:08,760 --> 02:14:11,280
they won't miss work and they won't get the flu and they don't even need the

1623
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:17,000
vaccine shot but no that just makes too much sense for America today another

1624
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:22,560
battle over taxes in the Washington Post the economic collapse says the sovereign

1625
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:28,480
debt bubble will continue to expand bang until the system explodes that's the big

1626
02:14:28,480 --> 02:14:32,240
that's the big elephant in the room that people aren't talking about it doesn't

1627
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:35,560
matter who's in the White House this system is coming down coming down real

1628
02:14:35,560 --> 02:14:40,360
soon and global debt collapse domino effect system leading to I mean isn't

1629
02:14:40,360 --> 02:14:43,240
this probably why they're trying to take our guns because they know they're gonna

1630
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:47,560
have to declare martial law in the economic collapse that's what's going on

1631
02:14:47,560 --> 02:14:51,560
I mean that's at least a reasonable assessment of what's going a couple more

1632
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:57,240
headlines here Nevada legislator Brooks arrested accused of threatening assembly

1633
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:05,000
leader why okay whatever California's Hispanic population to outnumber whites

1634
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:10,320
by the end of 2013 hey why don't we have a Hispanic president that supports the

1635
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:13,680
Bill of Rights that would be awesome too that would be great I don't care what

1636
02:15:13,680 --> 02:15:17,240
skin color you are if you support the Constitution and the Bill of Rights

1637

support the Constitution you're my hero that's it that's all there is to it

1642
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:42,260
CIA drone strikes will get passed in the counterterrorism playbook officials say

1643
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:45,680
yeah because the rules don't apply to the unmanned drone strikes that are

1644
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:50,320
blowing up little children hmm you want to end violence against children stop

1645
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:56,720
shooting them with missiles just a little bit of logic for those who don't

1646
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:01,360
yet get it fanfight outside Georgia Dome leaves one injured I think he got stabbed

1647

02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:13,080
gets punched in the face you got a band fist right there band knives TSA toys

1649
02:16:13,080 --> 02:16:17,720
with the surfs at Lou Rockwell blog saying it's retiring some of its porno

1650
02:16:17,720 --> 02:16:20,880
scanners naked body scanners from the airports but as we talked about earlier

1651
02:16:20,880 --> 02:16:25,880
that is a hoax because of being replaced by a millimeter wave scanners just

1652
02:16:25,880 --> 02:16:30,720
another way to irradiate your body so that is the blow-through news cycle I

1653
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:34,840
hope we covered some territory for you there now joining us by Skype is John

1654
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:38,900
Rappaport with an update on the psychiatric police state in America let

1655
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:42,880
me give you a bit a bit of background on that the article that I wrote on this is

1656
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:47,760
that psychiatrists are now given judge dread authority to strip citizens of

1657
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:53,280
their constitutional rights just because they say so so John Rappaport wrote one

1658
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:56,960
of the first articles on this about the psychiatric police state in New York and

1659
02:16:56,960 --> 02:17:02,640
now joining us is mr. Rappaport from no more fake news calm John any new

1660
02:17:02,640 --> 02:17:08,440
developments in this realm of thought crimes in America well the thought crime

1661
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:14,160
aspect is the big one like that you pointed out in your article to me it's

1662
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:18,080
all an extension of all of the surveillance that's been building up

1663
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:24,160
over the last 10-15 years you know we've got the drones we can spy on you you've

1664
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:28,080
got smart appliances in the home that can tell where you are what you're

1665
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:35,880
doing we've got intercepts on all emails phone calls purchases we've got

1666
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:43,520
everybody under surveillance in America the only thing that was missing was what

1667
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:49,600
are you thinking that was the last piece of the puzzle well yeah that piece is

1668
02:17:49,600 --> 02:17:55,240
being put into place because the psychiatrists are now the new high-priced

1669
02:17:55,240 --> 02:18:01,760
predator drones of thought it's like psychiatric drones but the you know the

1670
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:06,840
real thing about this so if you think about it is that now they can set up a

1671
02:18:06,840 --> 02:18:12,520
catch-22 where if you believe in the Constitution you're mentally ill if you

1672
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:16,720
think you need to own a gun there's something wrong with you so now just the

1673
02:18:16,720 --> 02:18:20,720
mere expression of wanting to exercise the rights and freedoms that you should

1674
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:25,960
have under a republic gets you diagnosed with a mental illness classic

1675
02:18:25,960 --> 02:18:31,320
catch-22 totally you're totally trapped as a patient although why you would want

1676
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:36,440
to see a psychiatrist in the first place is beyond me but yeah but John they're

1677
02:18:36,440 --> 02:18:39,240
gonna mandate it that's the thing I mean right now we can say no but soon they're

1678
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:43,760
gonna mandate it well they're definitely gonna try and it's gonna be part of

1679
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:48,280
Obamacare and that they're gonna be many more occasions let's put it this way

1680
02:18:48,280 --> 02:18:54,600
where they will be able to order you to a court-ordered psychiatrist for any

1681
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:59,560
reason they want to and then once you're there according to the New York State

1682
02:18:59,560 --> 02:19:05,560
law has just been passed if the psychiatrist feels that you represent a

1683

1686
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:25,960
point is who hasn't ever had some kind of thought not an action but a thought a

1687
02:19:25,960 --> 02:19:31,920
moment a fleeting moment of anger the ideation of violence against some other

1688

person or some organization you know your boss at work whatever getting to

1689
02:19:36,040 --> 02:19:40,440
because the psychiatrist is in charge of making that assessment yeah but I mean

1690
02:19:40,440 --> 02:19:43,760
everybody's had some kind of fleeting thought that doesn't make you criminal

1743
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:24,520
already and there's more yet yet ahead for us here broadcasting from Austin

1744
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:28,480
Texas this is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex Jones today Alex comes back

1745
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:33,840
sometime today and he'll be here running the show and run his show tomorrow so

1746
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:37,120
I'll be listening in that's the one thing that I don't like about hosting

1747
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:41,080
the show is I don't get to hear Alex do the show I mean I actually like to hear

1748
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:47,160
other people's thoughts on these things and and Alex is great at understanding

1749
02:24:47,160 --> 02:24:51,520
the historical context and the angles that you don't normally think of right

1750
02:24:51,520 --> 02:24:55,000
away so I was like his analysis I'm sure he's got it I'm surprised he hasn't

1751
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,200
called in guys he must be he must be out of cell phone range because he often

1752
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:02,440
calls in with some additional comments in any case we've got John Rapaport

1753
02:25:02,440 --> 02:25:06,880
with us right now from no more fake news.com with comments on the

1754
02:25:06,880 --> 02:25:14,080
psychiatric police state in America so John it looks like psychiatrists who

1755
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:18,360
were actually part of the problem and their drugs the drugging of children

1756
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:23,240
they're they're perhaps the largest contributing source to the problem now

1757
02:25:23,240 --> 02:25:26,960
they're going to be put in control and given more power in reaction to the very

1758
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:31,440
problem they caused the school shootings yeah they're totally off the hook now

1759
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:36,680
nobody is going to take up the question in the official media of all these drugs

1760
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:41,200
that cause people to kill other people like Prozac and Zoloft and so forth

1761
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:46,080
that's all going to go by the wayside completely but let me run down what was

1762
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:49,040
going to happen in the office you see psychiatrists are sitting there the

1763
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:53,800
patient comes in psychiatrist says so what's the problem the patient begins to

1764
02:25:53,800 --> 02:25:58,280
talk and the psychiatrist is going to inject at some point and say well what

1765
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:05,360
about your fantasies have you ever had thoughts of say getting revenge well

1766
02:26:05,360 --> 02:26:11,000
yeah sure against whom I said well what thoughts did you have well I wanted to

1767
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:15,880
destroy you know well I had a dream what's about destroying the school

1768
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:22,000
where I went you know when I was nine years old I see now at this point you

1769
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,840
see you're done because the psychiatrist can now file a report saying potentially

1770
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:34,120
a harm to others is talking about blowing up things and so we need to see

1771
02:26:34,120 --> 02:26:37,680
if this guy has a gun and all of a sudden this guy gets a visit at his

1772
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:41,040
house and says what are you talking about I was talking about a dream I had

1773
02:26:41,040 --> 02:26:45,640
when I was nine years old we don't care about that get out of the way when it

1774
02:26:45,640 --> 02:26:49,920
starts the house and you're on the list and bah bah bah bah bah it's now as you

1775
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:54,360
wrote a thought crime and this is how the psychiatrist brings it out of a

1776
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:58,800
person you could do it I could do it anybody on the street could do it you

1777
02:26:58,800 --> 02:27:04,000
just engage in a little chitchat and say have you ever had any you know thoughts

1778
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:09,440
about violence I mean we all have certainly well sure I once wanted to

1779
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:14,240
blow up the planet I remember we were drunk at a party we're talking to all of

1780
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:19,920
a sudden you're done you're a thought criminal huh no more rights yeah that's

1781
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:24,680
it that's that is exactly what it is coming to John Rappaport and you know

1782
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:29,800
the problem with this is that I mean these kids most of the school shooters

1783
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:35,000
right they have been bullied as children I mean many in many of the cases they

1784
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:38,860
were bullied and they go back to the school to take revenge on those who

1785
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:43,280
bullied them powered by the psychiatric drugs that the psychiatrist has given

1786
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:47,040
them so in their minds they do have an anger they do have a revenge but that

1787
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:51,320
alone is not enough to trigger the trigger it's got to be the drugs that

1788
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:55,360
separate them from reality that really makes it go over that takes it beyond

1789
02:27:55,360 --> 02:27:59,880
the realm of ideation or imagination into the realm of taking action and at

1790
02:27:59,880 --> 02:28:03,320
that point the shooters feel like they're in a in a dream state or a video

1791
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:07,480
game they don't feel like it's real so that's what the drugs do but you know

1792
02:28:07,480 --> 02:28:13,200
now go ahead this has been pointed out a conversation that I had some years ago

1793
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:19,360
with dr. Peter Bragan who is the conscience of psychiatry that not only

1794
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:24,760
do these drugs like the SSRI antidepressants and other psychiatric

1795
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:30,920
drugs even like Ritalin or Adderall push kids over the edge into actual homicide

1796
02:28:30,920 --> 02:28:38,680
but they can also stimulate as he told me grandiose plans for destruction so

1797
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:43,840
it's just immediate impulse this is let's get to the blueprint blueprint the

1798
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:49,400
drawing board let's paint the scenario here let's work up the whole scene on

1799
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:54,800
how we're going to do this these drugs also promote that kind of behavior in

1800
02:28:54,800 --> 02:29:00,320
kids that yeah they feel angry but ordinarily would do nothing absolutely

1801
02:29:00,320 --> 02:29:03,640
maybe Eric Holder is on these drugs you know maybe maybe the people in

1802
02:29:03,640 --> 02:29:08,160
Washington who are plotting conspiring to overthrow the Bill of Rights and

1803
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:11,080
disarm the American people maybe they're on these drugs I think a lot of them

1804
02:29:11,080 --> 02:29:18,800
must be you bet and why don't we know let's have a list what drugs god forbid

1805
02:29:18,800 --> 02:29:23,080
the list is going to be incredibly long is Joe Biden on what lists are all what

1806
02:29:23,080 --> 02:29:27,520
drug is Joe Biden not on are you kidding me dude that is so far gone

1850
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:19,240
muscle and blood you gotta wonder when has the government ever proposed that a

1851
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:26,920
solution to any problem could be solved by having less government never never

1852
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:31,920

shooting about which there are many many questions including questions about

1855
02:33:39,880 --> 02:33:46,120
possible multiple shooters we have the government proposing new new solutions

1856
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:50,440
always involving taking more power away from you and putting it into the hands

1857
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:54,240
of the very people who are causing the very problems under which we are all

1858
02:33:54,240 --> 02:33:58,360
suffering and in this case is the psychiatrist and John Rappaport joins

1859
02:33:58,360 --> 02:34:04,160
us continuing he's the creator of no more fake news dot-com and to lead off

1860
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:09,360
this section and we will take some calls to this section in the segment John

1861
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:13,760
here's here's what I want to hit you with right now it used to be that

1862
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:20,160
psychiatrists and psychologists were at least they were advocates of the patient

1863
02:34:20,160 --> 02:34:23,440
or at least they pretended to be you know they were in your corner they're on

1864
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:28,240
your team trying to help you solve your problems with confidentiality you know

1865
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:31,840
you can tell me anything tell me what's wrong you tell me your greatest fears

1866
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:37,000
your fantasies your challenges will help you solve it that's been that's been the

1867
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:41,720
marketing line of psychiatry and psychology now it's different where

1868
02:34:41,720 --> 02:34:46,320
snitches for Obama or stitches for the government whatever you tell us and in

1869
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:50,420
private conversations we're going to fill out a report and send it to the

1870
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:54,400
feds and they're going to use that to take away your rights now they are the

1871
02:34:54,400 --> 02:34:59,000
secret police the psychiatrists are secret police snitches for the

1872
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:03,320
unconstitutionally operated federal government is am i am i wrong about that

1873
02:35:03,320 --> 02:35:07,520
or is that what it's come to it's absolutely right and the American

1874
02:35:07,520 --> 02:35:12,280
Psychiatric Association has just issued a statement applauding the whole move

1875
02:35:12,280 --> 02:35:16,880
toward greater gun control so they're patting themselves on the back because

1876
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:21,300
they're saying yeah we like this niche role that we're in now we think it's a

1877
02:35:21,300 --> 02:35:27,840
good idea and even the psychiatrists who are less insane than the other

1878
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:31,420
psychiatrists think about what they're going to go through they're sitting

1879
02:35:31,420 --> 02:35:35,680
there with a patient who says to them you know I'm very angry at my father I

1880
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:38,560
mean that's a statement that a psychiatrist heard you know maybe

1881
02:35:38,560 --> 02:35:43,120
100,000 times in his career but all of a sudden this guy is going to stop and

1882
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:48,800
think hmm what happens if I don't report this patient exactly and then later he

1883
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:51,940
goes out and he kills his father that's exactly it they're going to report every

1884
02:35:51,940 --> 02:35:56,280
little thing then to start cover themselves I'm done so I'm going to

1885
02:35:56,280 --> 02:36:00,840
report everybody and everything that I possibly can so essentially the only

1886
02:36:00,840 --> 02:36:04,520
thing you can say to a psychiatrist now is oh life is great everything's

1887
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:08,760
wonderful everything's fine peachy no problem when and if you're going to say

1888
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:13,040
that why go to a psychiatrist I just want one of those that you've got I mean

1889
02:36:13,040 --> 02:36:17,320
I feel great but I think I could feel a little better and I've ripped out Prozac

1890
02:36:17,320 --> 02:36:21,520
maybe you could you know write me a script that's all they want to say and

1891
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:25,320
the psychiatrist actually thinks that's great well of course yeah they're good

1892
02:36:25,320 --> 02:36:28,660
they're getting the kickbacks and everything dispensing drugs and if they

1893
02:36:28,660 --> 02:36:33,800
can shrink an appointment down from a half hour to ten minutes are they going

1894
02:36:33,800 --> 02:36:37,000
to run more people through every day yeah you're right nobody's going to want

1895
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,560
to say anything but now sure fine no problem but the bigger point here is

1896
02:36:42,560 --> 02:36:48,100
that we have ignored we I mean the nation has ignored the problem what

1897
02:36:48,100 --> 02:36:51,800
causes the outbursts of violence that result in fatalities of innocent

1898
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:57,460
children psychiatric drugs a culture of violent movies and video games perhaps

1899
02:36:57,460 --> 02:37:01,400
plays a role but definitely psychiatric drugs so Obama didn't mention

1900
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:06,320
psychiatric drugs in any of his 23 executive orders psychiatrists are given

1901
02:37:06,320 --> 02:37:10,720
more power by any account we're going to have more school shootings because we're

1902
02:37:10,720 --> 02:37:15,800
going to have more psychiatrists giving out more drugs to people who refuse to

1903
02:37:15,800 --> 02:37:18,460
address the real issues they're having because they don't want to tell the

1904
02:37:18,460 --> 02:37:22,160
truth now because the psychiatrist is going to snitch on them no question

1905
02:37:22,160 --> 02:37:25,540
about it they're going to be more of these killings and murders because more

1906
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:29,380
of the drugs that cause the killings and murders are going to be dispensed but

1907
02:37:29,380 --> 02:37:34,280
here's another factor that shows you where Obama's head is really at if he

1908
02:37:34,280 --> 02:37:38,260
really wanted to end gun violence in America he would stand up at the podium

1909
02:37:38,260 --> 02:37:43,660
and he'd say look at this map folks this shows you where the gun violence is

1910
02:37:43,660 --> 02:37:47,740
taking place in America where the people are being killed in greatest numbers and

1911
02:37:47,740 --> 02:37:54,360
who's committing the crimes gangs for example cities these are the facts we

1912
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:59,520
have to face them because my motivation as your president is to end gun violence

1913
02:37:59,520 --> 02:38:04,980
and therefore this becomes our new mission did he do anything faintly

1914
02:38:04,980 --> 02:38:09,380
vaguely resembling that of course not because it's not gun violence that he

1915
02:38:09,380 --> 02:38:14,220
wants to end it's gun ownership that he wants to have a good point yeah and also

1916
02:38:14,220 --> 02:38:18,620
your approach is logical you know you you want to look at the causes of the

1917
02:38:18,620 --> 02:38:22,200
thing you're trying to stop but you got to understand I know you understand this

1918
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:27,140
but I'm speaking to the listeners Washington doesn't want logic they want

1919
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:33,020
an emotional and invocation of an irrational emotional knee-jerk response

1920
02:38:33,020 --> 02:38:38,020
that doesn't stand up in any kind of actual critical thinking they just want

1921
02:38:38,020 --> 02:38:44,380
you to react and the reaction is blame an inanimate object blame a gun refuse to

1922
02:38:44,380 --> 02:38:48,500
look at the psych drugs that altered the mind that pulled the trigger that shot

1923
02:38:48,500 --> 02:38:53,820
the child you know you it's like you're asking you're asking people to think and

1924
02:38:53,820 --> 02:38:57,720
in America today that's too much apparently at least on the on the

1925
02:38:57,720 --> 02:39:01,780
radical left you can't ask them to think they're not supposed to think they're

1926
02:39:01,780 --> 02:39:05,340
supposed to react they're supposed to leap to conclusions and they're supposed

1927
02:39:05,340 --> 02:39:11,100
to worship their king Obama who's gonna do more and it's all for the children

1928
02:39:11,100 --> 02:39:16,860
keep that of course yeah high-fiving the kids even though these drugs that are

1929
02:39:16,860 --> 02:39:19,940
going to be dispensed in greater numbers than ever the psychiatric drugs that

1930
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:24,700
cause violence and murder are going to result in more children being murdered

1931
02:39:24,700 --> 02:39:29,260
that's not part of the argument that's not something we think about that's too

1932
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:33,940
logical we can't approach that what we just have to keep saying is it's all for

1933
02:39:33,940 --> 02:39:38,280
the Sandy Hook children that's why we're taking everybody's guns it's totally

1934
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:42,860
irrelevant doesn't make any sense but that's the emotion of the moment yeah

1935
02:39:42,860 --> 02:39:49,260
and look at Obama's logic he said if we can save one child's life then I think

1936
02:39:49,260 --> 02:39:53,780
he said something like we owe it to ourselves to try what he means is any

1937
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:58,340
any cost in society is worth reducing one death well by that logic we should

1938
02:39:58,340 --> 02:40:04,660
ban all swimming pools ban all trampolines ban all automobiles in fact

1939
02:40:04,660 --> 02:40:09,900
you should ban being born yes I guess they do with all their abortions but

1940
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:14,700
they should ban childbirth because that can result in a child dying so therefore

1941
02:40:14,700 --> 02:40:21,020
ban childbirth that's Obama's logic ban thought ban all thought because

1942
02:40:21,020 --> 02:40:26,020
obviously thought precedes action and some actions result in harm so let's

1943
02:40:26,020 --> 02:40:29,860
have a drug that the psychiatrist can give us that will stop people from

1944
02:40:29,860 --> 02:40:34,180
thinking all together and then that will be the final solution we just have

1945
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:37,940
zombies around the landscape and everything is wonderful yeah what is

1946
02:40:37,940 --> 02:40:41,820
something's drugs called guys throughout a sci-fi movies there have been lots of

1947
02:40:41,820 --> 02:40:45,500
different names and and and fiction also different names for these drugs that

1948
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:50,140
that quote normalize the range of human emotions and thought I like the movie

1949
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:55,820
the island with Ewan McGregor that's a great film to review right now because

1950
02:40:55,820 --> 02:40:58,780
of the medical police state that were under and I believe they were all on

1951
02:40:58,780 --> 02:41:04,300
drugs there and that in that movie as well and give it a false reality to tell

1952
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:08,020
them a fairy tale so that they wouldn't resist and that's what we're seeing

1953
02:41:08,020 --> 02:41:11,860
right now with sandy hook also speaking of that John I want to take a call from

1954
02:41:11,860 --> 02:41:16,140
Robert in Georgia who apparently has comments on sandy hook of the Second

1955
02:41:16,140 --> 02:41:21,260
Amendment so Robert in Georgia you're on the air go ahead sir awesome thank you

1956
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:26,380
very much for taking the call and I've got a lot of my heart the floppiness I

1957
02:41:26,380 --> 02:41:30,820
mean I thought I was living about 9-eleven and here you have sandy hook

1958
02:41:30,820 --> 02:41:36,020
and not one person down there not one child died I've been researching it it

1959
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:41,180
is anybody died down there if you continue looking at the research and how

1960
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:45,500
they've done all that they don't nobody's died they're actors I'm not

1961
02:41:45,500 --> 02:41:49,900
kidding you they are actors down there and this is the worst one I've seen it's

1962
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:52,300
just let me stop you for a second so I just want to make sure understand your

1963
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:56,260
position so you're saying that there were no children died at all in sandy

1964
02:41:56,260 --> 02:42:02,660
hook no sir I've been honest for hours on the end and then people were actors

1965
02:42:02,660 --> 02:42:06,740
and you can go down there we need to get a phone number going down there to

1966
02:42:06,740 --> 02:42:11,660
Connecticut and Sandy Hook and start calling them police officers well no I

1967
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:14,860
look look I I want to say I agree that there are a lot of questions about

1968
02:42:14,860 --> 02:42:17,980
sandy hook and John I want your comments on this as well they haven't shown the

1969
02:42:17,980 --> 02:42:21,500
video footage for example I'm convinced that there was no ar-15 used in the

1970
02:42:21,500 --> 02:42:27,140
shooting whatsoever I I haven't perhaps investigated as much as you have caller

1971
02:42:27,140 --> 02:42:31,060
but I'm very skeptical of the idea that nobody died there but I but it's a good

1972
02:42:31,060 --> 02:42:34,020
question to raise we should always ask questions so John what are your thoughts

1973
02:42:34,020 --> 02:42:38,540
on that on that scenario that the caller is explaining well I just wrote an

1974
02:42:38,540 --> 02:42:43,940
article about this this morning but you know these people have unearthed

1975
02:42:43,940 --> 02:42:49,420
tremendously interesting video clips of interviews with survivors at Sandy Hook

1976
02:42:49,420 --> 02:42:53,940
and they look like actors some of them I've seen right yeah you place on it

1977
02:42:53,940 --> 02:42:59,100
yeah is is a that's under question but there's no question that what we're

1978
02:42:59,100 --> 02:43:05,300
looking at here are people who have been in one way or another programmed out of

1979
02:43:05,300 --> 02:43:10,060
being able to feel genuine human emotion in the midst of a horrendous tragedy

1980
02:43:10,060 --> 02:43:13,860
let me go back to the caller because I Robert what what in your mind is the

1981
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:17,780
best evidence that exists today that that as you say no one was killed there

1982
02:43:17,780 --> 02:43:23,420
okay Robbie Parker and for one when the news channel does it they use your

1983
02:43:23,420 --> 02:43:27,620
proper name Robert my name's Robert my family used to call me Robbie for him

1984
02:43:27,620 --> 02:43:32,580
to call this fellow Robbie Parker and not use his real name and he's laughing

1985
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:37,220
and cutting up and then you know if you haven't seen it yet I've seen it yeah

1986
02:43:37,220 --> 02:43:42,660
it's said in all of the interviews there is no remorse and one thing here I want

1987
02:43:42,660 --> 02:43:47,980
to really stress is that truth is not threatened by a lie but a lie is

1988
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:53,260
threatened by the truth and I hope that they're just getting so sloppy on this

1989
02:43:53,260 --> 02:43:59,100
it's gonna be exposed people if I was living about 9-11 this is literally sick

1990
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:03,780
and I was in surgery that day that morning on the 14th I was going to

1991
02:44:03,780 --> 02:44:07,940
surgery and it started all happening and I could tell it right from there things

1992
02:44:07,940 --> 02:44:13,260
were really bad I wish I lived in that area so I could ask people I know I mean

1993
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:17,260
I mean caller in one sense you're right that we can never really know what is

1994
02:44:17,260 --> 02:44:23,320
theater could they stage something like that with all actors theoretically

1995
02:44:23,320 --> 02:44:27,460
possibly but there it seems like there must be real people out there who lost

1996
02:44:27,460 --> 02:44:32,300
real children or maybe I don't know maybe I'm still being suckered in I John

1997
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:35,820
your thoughts I mean how do you know what's true that's the bottom line well

1998
02:44:35,820 --> 02:44:39,780
this is the point because everything comes through television right how do we

1999
02:44:39,780 --> 02:44:43,820
know there are only certain people that are going to be interviewed for example

2000
02:44:43,820 --> 02:44:50,300
anybody any parent who is outraged angry about the investigation who wants to get

2001
02:44:50,300 --> 02:44:55,060
to the bottom of it who is close to being actually catatonic because they

2002
02:44:55,060 --> 02:45:02,540
have lost a child who was really killed who is incredibly angry at the press for

2003
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:05,860
trying to approach them for an interview in the wake of the death of their

2004
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:09,740
children none of these people are going to be interviewed on television you're

2005
02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:15,660
not going to see that and so right but we see is this section of people that

2006
02:45:15,660 --> 02:45:20,660
appropriate for the scenario that's being created by the major media that

2007
02:45:20,660 --> 02:45:25,420
is independent of what actually happened there in Sandy Hook and so we get this

2008
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:30,340
entirely insane picture of who these people in Sandy Hook are and plus we've

2009
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:34,020
got all the tie-ins with actual fiction theater you know the Batman movie the

2010
02:45:34,020 --> 02:45:37,900
Sandy Hook on the map with the strike zone circled right around it it actually

2011
02:45:37,900 --> 02:45:42,380
looks like the school on the map in Batman and you know I'm not saying okay

2012
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:45,340
maybe it could be coincidence but you get enough of these and it starts to

2013
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:49,340
become very suspicious and that's that's where I am on this folks is asking

2014
02:45:49,340 --> 02:45:53,100
questions I haven't reached all the conclusions or anything but asking

2015
02:45:53,100 --> 02:45:56,500
intelligent questions is what we're supposed to do members of the press are

2016
02:45:56,500 --> 02:46:00,940
supposed to ask questions but we've got CNN and others just actually just shoving

2017
02:46:00,940 --> 02:46:05,740
ideas down your mind without asking any questions that's what I'm that's what I

2018
02:46:05,740 --> 02:46:09,660
have trouble with there's a difference between a staged event that actually

2019
02:46:09,660 --> 02:46:15,820
happens you know people are killed but the perpetrator is not the person that

2020
02:46:15,820 --> 02:46:20,740
is blamed by law enforcement in the media that's a whole scenario that I've

2021
02:46:20,740 --> 02:46:26,300
explored in depth that Lanza was not actually the shooter he was a patsy then

2022
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:29,700
you have the idea that nothing happened at all that the whole thing was a

2023
02:46:29,700 --> 02:46:36,180
gigantic hoax and nobody died for which I would see personally no real motive if

2024
02:46:36,180 --> 02:46:40,860
people would go that far in staging an event they would have no compunction

2025
02:46:40,860 --> 02:46:46,700
about actually killing people right adults whatever well it's like the I

2026
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:49,260
think Larry Pratt said this if they would stage Fast and Furious they would

2027
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:53,580
stage anything but for example in the the Gabrielle Giffords shooting in in

2028
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:58,220
Arizona I was able to actually make a phone call to a close personal friend of

2029
02:46:58,220 --> 02:47:05,900
of Gabby and to verify sort of what went on I actually was a distant friend of

2030
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:10,060
Gabby she was a wonderful woman by the way just just a wonderful representative

2031
02:47:10,060 --> 02:47:14,540
for the people there even though she was in the Democratic Party she was just a

2032
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:18,380
very wonderful person and so I you know I'm convinced that you know that

2033
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:21,580
shooting took place there's no question about it the question is what what

2034
02:47:21,580 --> 02:47:26,300
caused that shooting but in Sandy Hook we don't have one well-known person that

2035
02:47:26,300 --> 02:47:30,860
we can call and confirm I mean it there are way too many questions that we can't

2036
02:47:30,860 --> 02:47:35,220
confirm it and I personally don't know anybody in that area to confirm it maybe

2037
02:47:35,220 --> 02:47:41,860
I don't know maybe somebody can call in and and phone lines are open 1-800-259-9231

2038
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:46,460
if you've got proof one way or another or the other on Sandy Hook how about

2039
02:47:46,460 --> 02:47:50,500
that let's put that out there and we'll jump to your calls first fair enough

2040
02:47:50,500 --> 02:47:54,540
sound good John sure all right cuz I know you want to get to the bottom of

2041
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:58,340
this too but yeah absolutely I mean look I've looked into Robbie Parker to the

2042
02:47:58,340 --> 02:48:02,340
degree that there are articles about him in Utah newspapers like the Deseret News

2043
02:48:02,340 --> 02:48:08,780
that he wants his family is from there that he had a family that this guy is

2044
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:14,420
not just some actor that they brought in from you know the sky to portray

2045
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:20,420
somebody that doesn't exist at all right so you know got to think about this

2046
02:48:20,420 --> 02:48:28,020
if you had a group of 15 or 20 or 50 or 75 actors that were brought in to stage

2047
02:48:28,020 --> 02:48:32,300
a complete hoax don't you think that somebody out there in the world who

2048
02:48:32,300 --> 02:48:37,300
actually knows one of these people and said hey you see that guy who's supposed

2049
02:48:37,300 --> 02:48:42,220
to be a fireman or a cop or a parent that's Marty don't you remember Marty we

2050
02:48:42,220 --> 02:48:46,900
went to school together I gotta put up a YouTube about Marty this is ridiculous

2051
02:48:46,900 --> 02:48:50,820
don't you think that would have proliferated by now unless somebody's

2052
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:56,100
going to say no these hundred people were you know kidnapped 50 years ago or

2053
02:48:56,100 --> 02:49:02,420
20 years ago and they were raised you know they're raising a psych ward no I

2054
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:08,380
look I I suspect I suspect the real story here is kids were killed but they

2055
02:49:08,380 --> 02:49:12,860
were killed by multiple shooters who were put up to this and that's why they

2056
02:49:12,860 --> 02:49:16,460
they killed Adam Lanza at the end so he couldn't talk that's what I suspect very

2057
02:49:16,460 --> 02:49:21,060
similar to Aurora because I know you know a lot about guns I mean for a while

2058
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:26,580
there and I still think they're saying that Lanza killed himself with a

2059
02:49:26,580 --> 02:49:31,780
rifle well yeah you can do that yeah is that an easy thing to do is to turn a

2060
02:49:31,780 --> 02:49:35,820
rifle around on yourself well I mean the other kids did it in the what the zero

2061
02:49:35,820 --> 02:49:38,540
day shooting they did that right on camera in a school they put the rifles

2062
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:42,300
on the you know the butt stocks of the rifles on the ground vertically and then

2063
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:45,740
they just put their chins over the rifles and and or a shotgun in one case

2064
02:49:45,740 --> 02:49:50,180
I think and pulled the trigger so yeah they kids know how to do that I mean if

2065
02:49:50,180 --> 02:49:54,620
they're violent like that psychotic kids then they can do that well I agree with

2066
02:49:54,620 --> 02:50:00,980
you I think so far from everything that I've seen this kid was a patsy and there

2067
02:50:00,980 --> 02:50:06,060
were professionals who did the job and that opens the issue up completely to

2068
02:50:06,060 --> 02:50:13,100
the whole aftermath which is grab the guns yeah yeah clearly that it whether

2069
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:18,660
it was real or or or staged the issue is that it was a justification to take the

2070
02:50:18,660 --> 02:50:22,460
guns and that makes no sense now I want to go to some more callers after this

2071
02:50:22,460 --> 02:50:28,140
break that's coming up here so William and Cindy and can stay on the line there

bad then America is lost okay this is the job of the media CNN should be

2076
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:52,460

2120
02:54:06,020 --> 02:54:09,500
GCN radio network

2121
02:54:09,500 --> 02:54:20,900
in regards to that last call I think we have to be very cautious if we are to

2122
02:54:20,900 --> 02:54:25,220
have any credibility whatsoever in questioning the official story of events

2123
02:54:25,220 --> 02:54:29,820
like Sandy Hook we've got to be careful and I am that caller probably have good

2124
02:54:29,820 --> 02:54:33,620
intention and maybe he knows more about it than I do I'm not sure but we have to

2125
02:54:33,620 --> 02:54:40,780
be careful not to leap one bridge too far so to speak otherwise we all get

2126
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:45,560
painted as as as complete loons we have to ask good questions look for what we

2127
02:54:45,560 --> 02:54:50,260
can actually substantiate where is their video evidence for example with the ar-15

2128
02:54:50,260 --> 02:54:53,980
rifle not being used in the shooting there's they haven't released any video

2129
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:58,140
footage why wouldn't they release video footage if the kid was carrying an ar-15

2130
02:54:58,140 --> 02:55:01,340
around shooting kids they would love to release that footage so we can say

2131
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:05,700
logically and rationally as skeptical journalists the fact that they haven't

2132
02:55:05,700 --> 02:55:09,460
released that footage probably means they don't have it that's a rational

2133
02:55:09,460 --> 02:55:13,220
thing but we got to be careful not to go too far and there's there are also

2134
02:55:13,220 --> 02:55:17,700
agents of disinfo out there that try to get us to go one step too far to make us

2135
02:55:17,700 --> 02:55:21,620
look stupid I'm not saying that was that caller that caller sounds like he was he

2136
02:55:21,620 --> 02:55:29,500
was informed in his research and was putting forth what he believes but we

2137
02:55:29,500 --> 02:55:32,020
just have to be cautious is all I'm saying let's go with what we actually

2138
02:55:32,020 --> 02:55:37,400
have evidence for and not allow anyone to pull us one step too far down the

2139
02:55:37,400 --> 02:55:42,260
road of of things that didn't really necessarily happen so so John what are

2140
02:55:42,260 --> 02:55:45,380
your thoughts on that I mean can't we there's a lot that we could actually

2141
02:55:45,380 --> 02:55:51,220
like on 9-eleven there's so much evidence that building 7 was taken down

2142
02:55:51,220 --> 02:55:55,100
intentionally not hit by an airplane and so on on all these issues there's a lot

2143
02:55:55,100 --> 02:55:59,540
of evidence for us to stand with right huge amount of evidence and to go back

2144
02:55:59,540 --> 02:56:04,620
to something you said before the break these the reason people think oh these

2145
02:56:04,620 --> 02:56:09,460
are crazy questions is because they can condition to the media that never asks

2146
02:56:09,460 --> 02:56:13,580
these questions should be asking the questions I mean what we're talking

2147
02:56:13,580 --> 02:56:18,740
about here is what CNN and Fox and NBC ABC CBS should be doing all the time

2148
02:56:18,740 --> 02:56:23,580
yeah they should be saying how did the kid get in the school okay which we want

2149
02:56:23,580 --> 02:56:27,060
to know we don't want just some little brush off here I mean you have a fairly

2150
02:56:27,060 --> 02:56:32,380
heavy door there did you what kind of glass was there did he talk over video

2151
02:56:32,380 --> 02:56:36,400
they have a video system he's not supposed to get in unless he identifies

2152
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:41,820
himself he's wearing all these weapons and so forth somebody let him in let's

2153
02:56:41,820 --> 02:56:46,380
dig into this let's not stop let's be relentless until we get the answers all

2154
02:56:46,380 --> 02:56:50,140
right let's dig into this the way the media used to dig into Nixon during

2155
02:56:50,140 --> 02:56:54,940
Nixon administration Washington Post you bet absolutely you see so now people say

2156
02:56:54,940 --> 02:57:00,020
well the people that ask these kinds of questions are crazy because people are

2157
02:57:00,020 --> 02:57:03,980
hypnotized into believing everything the police says is true oh I know that's the

2158
02:57:03,980 --> 02:57:08,120
danger that's the danger of where we are is that you're considered crazy if you

2159
02:57:08,120 --> 02:57:14,340
even behave like a responsible intelligent journalist I mean journalism

2160
02:57:14,340 --> 02:57:19,060
has become a joke in this nation because the people working for CNN for example

2161
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:25,860
refuse to ask real questions I heard a press conference three minutes outside

2162
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:31,340
chief of police at Sandy Hook and the reporters started asking questions about

2163
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:36,300
the guns what was the gun found in the trunk again was it the bushmaster was

2164
02:57:36,300 --> 02:57:42,300
it the thing was that and was it two handguns that he had and so forth and

2165
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:48,980
the police chief danced around that the reporters were starting to zero in and

2166
02:57:48,980 --> 02:57:52,700
on the fact that there were contradictory stories and then they all

2167
02:57:52,700 --> 02:57:57,420
backed away like it was a time for a picnic let's go to a picnic whatever the

2168
02:57:57,420 --> 02:58:03,460
chief says okay forget about it there was nothing left it was all a travesty

2169
02:58:03,460 --> 02:58:08,740
crazy go where and then they stopped all right well look we're gonna go into

2199
03:00:37,820 --> 03:00:43,380
all right anyway I had a conversation with Richard Max on a Richard Mack on

2200
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:48,580
another program here and it was a good conversation and people are always

2201
03:00:48,580 --> 03:00:52,220
wondering you know we got all this talk radio we got all you know all the news

2202
03:00:52,220 --> 03:00:55,700
and it just keeps getting hash and rehash there's got to be some solutions

2203
03:00:55,700 --> 03:01:00,980
well he talked about a solution a solution that everybody can do I don't

2204
03:01:00,980 --> 03:01:05,260
just mean going around buying guns like that has been going on I mean what

2205
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:09,580
people need to do is they need to contact their sheriff and say hey look

2206
03:01:09,580 --> 03:01:14,000
we're gonna put something together this is going to be made public how do you

2207
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:18,360
stand on a Second Amendment are you going to keep these people from you know

2208
03:01:18,360 --> 03:01:21,340
are you gonna protect our rights we elected you for this it's gonna be made

2209
03:01:21,340 --> 03:01:25,480
public let them know it's gonna be made public I mean I've fortunately I've got

2210
03:01:25,480 --> 03:01:30,100
the use of the radio station here but others have like yourself have the

2211
03:01:30,100 --> 03:01:35,420
opportunity to put it out on on their web page you know there's a site well

2212
03:01:35,420 --> 03:01:38,860
that's good to hold them accountable right now see where they stand absolutely

2213
03:01:38,860 --> 03:01:42,580
because these are elected officials yes and if they don't if people don't like

2214
03:01:42,580 --> 03:01:46,780
what they're hearing they're out of there so but in my conversation for

2215
03:01:46,780 --> 03:01:52,020
instance here in Millard County Utah the sheriff made the cost of the comment

2216
03:01:52,020 --> 03:01:56,400
that he wasn't a constitutional sheriff I want clarification but he was not a

2217
03:01:56,400 --> 03:02:02,880
constitutional sheriff yeah what does that mean exactly are you not willing to

2218
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:07,220
uphold a Second Amendment or any of the Constitution I want clarification I know

2219
03:02:07,220 --> 03:02:10,680
there's sheriff's out there calling themselves constitutional sheriff's

2220
03:02:10,680 --> 03:02:15,540
they're involved in and they're in keeping their else I we want to know you

2221
03:02:15,540 --> 03:02:20,320
know all right and that's gonna make it public yeah well well said Greg a good

2222
03:02:20,320 --> 03:02:23,260
luck to you out there in Utah great great suggestion let's do that let's do

2223
03:02:23,260 --> 03:02:26,980
that all across the nation call your local sheriff find out where they stand

2224
03:02:26,980 --> 03:02:31,600
on the Constitution if they're not constitutional sheriff's then they then

2225
03:02:31,600 --> 03:02:34,660
they're in violation of their own oaths of office they should be kicked out

2226
03:02:34,660 --> 03:02:38,100
immediately but let's let's take some more calls I want to get John's comment

2227
03:02:38,100 --> 03:02:42,040
on this as well William in Connecticut William thank you for holding in and

2228
03:02:42,040 --> 03:02:46,700
welcome to the show thank you very much well there's a lot of information that

2229
03:02:46,700 --> 03:02:53,620
is not made public and that lead us to speculate in foreign theories I'm calling

2230
03:02:53,620 --> 03:03:02,340
because I have information that I believe is legit Adam Lancer he told his

2231
03:03:02,340 --> 03:03:08,820
mom that if he she put him in a special school his he was going to kill her in

2232
03:03:08,820 --> 03:03:15,140
her sleep and he did he there's also suppose there's supposed to be a video

2233
03:03:15,140 --> 03:03:21,180
about Adam Lancer going to the high school first but because he saw a

2234
03:03:21,180 --> 03:03:26,980
patrol car outside he moved into the little school to the other school so I

2235
03:03:26,980 --> 03:03:30,580
don't know why they are not saying that

2236
03:03:30,820 --> 03:03:38,620
well wasn't John go ahead that said that Lancer had threatened his mother or he

2237
03:03:38,620 --> 03:03:42,500
was very angry at her because she was going to have him institutionalized and

2238
03:03:42,500 --> 03:03:49,700
that was at one point given as a motive for the killing but then later on

2239
03:03:49,700 --> 03:03:54,500
questions were raised whether or not that actually ever happened that turned

2240
03:03:54,500 --> 03:04:00,260
out to be as I recall somebody's opinion rather than a direct observation of what

2241
03:04:00,260 --> 03:04:05,220
the mother was threatening to do and Adams reaction to that so all right good

2242
03:04:05,220 --> 03:04:08,300
I don't know about that good good call though thank you call let's go to one
