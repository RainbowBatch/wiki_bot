Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
Welcome to the Alex Jones Show on this Monday, January 7th, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the
Health Ranger, sitting in for Alex today. We have an amazing show lined up for you for
the next three hours. And the reason I'm here is because Alex is on a plane headed to New
York. He's going to appear on the CNN broadcast tonight. I think it's at, what, nine, eight
o'clock, no, nine central, eight eastern, I think is what it is, right?
Anyway, Alex is gonna be there with Piers Morgan, so we'll see how that goes. So I'm
here covering for Alex today, and he called me before the show with some somewhat disturbing
news as well. He has been detained and nearly arrested at the Austin airport. And he's gonna
be uploading a video later that will explain what happened.
And I'm not gonna go into any details right now, but he was very angry about how he's
being treated as an American citizen just trying to get on an airplane. In any case,
that's coming up later tonight. That'll probably make the InfoWars nightly news, but in the
meantime, let's continue.
We've got some great guests coming up for you today. We've got Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com
joining us at the bottom of this hour with an update on how the state of Michigan has
been forcing farmers there to shoot their own pigs. And now an economic embargo of sorts
has been enacted against Mark Baker and other farmers there.
It's an all out economic warfare against American patriots, okay? So anybody who tries to grow
their own food, who tries to farm, who tries to exercise any kind of freedom whatsoever,
whether it's free speech, food freedom, medical freedom, health freedom, you name it, they're
all being assaulted, attacked at every angle imaginable.
It's on, the war is on against the American patriots and Mark Baker will be joining us
with some more details on what's going on there. Also in the next hour, we've got John
Rappaport joining us with some breaking realizations about psychiatric drugs and how now these
could be used.
You see, the government has a record of prescription drugs. Who's been prescribed all of these?
It's a patient database of prescription records. And this database not only has your name in
it, but also what you've been prescribed. So if you're taking antidepressant drugs,
if you're taking mind altering psychiatric drugs, if your children are taking drugs for
ADHD or depression or anything, this is all being recorded by the government.
And now that we've got new gun control, a new push, of course, happening in the Senate
thanks to people like Feinstein, your prescription drug records could be used to deny you your
constitutional rights. All they have to do is claim that everyone who's taking antidepressant
drugs is now, quote, mentally unfit to own a firearm or to even perhaps invoke their
Fifth Amendment rights or their First Amendment rights.
Or basically they can just say, if you're taking these drugs, the Bill of Rights no
longer applies to you. That's what they can say. So that is a very worrisome realization
and a possible development in this gun control issue. And John Rappaport will be joining
us to go over that.
We've also got Richard Pearson popping in in the next hour. He is the head of the Illinois
State Rifle Association that just narrowly defeated yet another sneak attack gun control
bill last night. Yeah, they're trying it at all hours now. It's like, I guess these lawmakers
are staying up until three in the morning on a Sunday night to try to sneak a bill through
that is completely unconstitutional.
That would criminalize all citizens of Illinois who own firearms. It would criminalize the
farmers and the ranchers and everyone in that state who legally owns firearms. But that
bill was narrowly defeated last night. We'll get an update on that issue in the next hour.
So stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show. All of that and much more straight ahead.
We'll be right back.

All right, we are live on this Monday, January 7th. Yes, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the Health
Ranger filling in for Alex Jones, who right now is on an airplane headed to New York to
be on CNN tonight. The Piers Morgan show. Apparently Alex is going to be there live
sitting with Mr. Morgan. Mr. Redcoat Morgan, the guy that has a big successful petition
calling for Morgan to be detained and kicked out of the country. That's a pretty good petition.
But anyway, Alex is going to be sitting in there with him to have something that I'm
sure will be a very mild conversation. And Alex, and by the way, that's going to be aired
at, I think, let's see, let me get this right, 9 p.m. Eastern and 8 p.m. Central. So I guess
that makes it 6 p.m. Pacific, right? Did I get that right? I can do math today. What
a wonderful Monday. Yeah, normally the math doesn't work till Tuesdays, right?
Okay, so we have a lot of news coming up today. Obviously the attack is on at every level
at every angle on all Americans who believe in the Bill of Rights, who believe in the
Second Amendment especially. And we've got a number of guests coming on today. And let
me give you the rundown of what you're going to hear here for the next three hours. This
is going to be an amazingly hard hitting show. At the bottom of this hour, we've got Mark
Baker coming on from Baker's Green Acres talking about the state of Michigan and how they are
now putting in kind of economic embargo on home small farmers who are trying to have
a small family farm raising heirloom pigs basically and are being shut down by the state
of Michigan.
I know we've covered that issue before, but we have new information, new updates, and
a worsening of the situation. So Mark will be here to give us that breakdown. Then the
next hour, we've got John Rappaport from nomorefakenews.com joining us to give us more details on some
additional breaking realizations that we had about the psychiatric patient prescription
drug list. Look, the government is running a surveillance database on all the drugs that
you are prescribed and purchased from pharmacies.
That database could be turned into a no gun buy database. They could just say they can
invoke this by executive order as has been admitted. The Washington Post over the weekend
ran a story saying Obama was looking at executive order to just mandate new gun restrictions.
And one of those, this wasn't in the Washington Post article, but this is in our article at
Natural News and it's posted on infowars.com this morning, shows that that drug database
could be copied and pasted into the no gun buy database, which essentially is the FBI
instant background check system, NICS, to deny people the right to buy firearms who
have been on antidepressants.
So that's coming up. That's a very big important discussion because it means that if you are
taking psychiatric drugs, which includes antidepressants and other classes of prescribed pharmaceuticals,
you could be denied your constitutional rights. Outside of law, just with a regulation, no,
this would not even require senators or members of the House to vote for any new law, wouldn't
require anything at all.
Just one stroke of the pen or one stroke of the robotic pen from Obama, who doesn't even
sign his laws anymore, just has a robot do it. Hey, why not? He's a puppet anyway, just
have a puppet sign it. Grab a puppet with a pen and sign the laws that way.
All right, here's some other news. We've got welfare recipients. This is out of the New
York Post. Welfare recipients take out cash at strip clubs, liquor stores, and X-rated
shops. This was an exclusive story that broke on the New York Post over the weekend. And
it turns out that if you track where these recipients are taking out their cash, they're
taking out all their, with their EBT cards, their government paid welfare cards.
They're taking it out at porn shops, hookah parlors. I've never heard that term before,
a hookah parlor, and even strip clubs. Man, I must be out of the loop on that whole realm
because I've never even heard of a hookah parlor. Anyway, I have heard of strip clubs,
so that's where they're taking out their money and using it. So this is your money, folks.
This is your taxpayer money when you go to work and you pay taxes or they take it out
actually to sort of confiscate taxes from you and they're confiscating more now than
ever before, thanks to the fiscal cliff negotiations.
That money goes to these Obama-supporting EBT card owners who are using your money to
get it on at X-rated porn shops and strip clubs. Man, how insane has it become when
our tax dollars go to fund the compassionate welfare of people who use your money to hire
strippers and buy porn? Yeah, that's called welfare in the new United States of America.
Enough on that. Let's move on.
Large cities all over America are degenerating into gang-infested war zones. This was by
Michael Snyder at Economic Collapse and it's posted on Infowars.com as well. And in this
article he looks at the large cities and how they're breaking down into total criminal
gang-infested chaos.
And there was a story posted on Drudge over the weekend where a woman in Detroit called
911 reported that her car had been stolen and a firearm inside the car had obviously
been stolen with the car. And the police or 911 told her, call back later. Call back later.
Welcome to the suicide hotline. Please hold. It's like, forget about police in Detroit
now. Didn't the police of Detroit even announce a few weeks ago for people not to even enter
the city?
Because if you dial 911, we can't help you. We can't even help you. This reminds me of
the movie RoboCop. Remember that? The original RoboCop movie from the 1980s? You gotta go
back and watch RoboCop because that was based in Detroit. And in the movie, the city of
Detroit had degenerated into a total corporate gang crime zone where the corporations were
running the drugs.
Ah, guess what's happened today? Exactly like that. The commercials in that movie RoboCop
were so ridiculous then they seemed outlandish and today they are true. That movie, it really
foreshadowed the future. And this is happening in cities all across the country, East St.
Louis, Detroit, LA, East LA, you name it. It is all degenerating as, but look, you can't
blame the police on this because the men and women in blue who are out there trying to
do their jobs.
And I know this because I've worked with these cops firsthand. They are trying to do their
jobs. They are ridiculously underfunded. They are not given even enough money to buy the
ammo that they need to police their local cities. They're denied their own gear in many
cases. Hey, when I was working with the police in Arizona, we were raising money so they
could buy their own bulletproof vest because the PD there didn't even give them bulletproof
vest. Imagine being a cop and having to buy your own vest. It's ridiculous.
But this is true. So as a result, as a result of the cuts, as a result of the insanity,
the cops are being downsized everywhere. And of course the gangs are running completely
out of control. Now here's another great article that I saw over the weekend from WorldNet
Daily by the managing editor of WorldNet Daily, David Kapelian. I hope I am pronouncing his
name correctly, Kapelian.
This is a great story. The giant gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting. And in the story
that's up at worldnetdaily.com, WND, he covers the mainstream media, their refusal to cover
the psychiatric drugs and their links to violent shooting and suicides. And he runs down what
we've been reporting on for years at Natural News, which is the link between psych drugs
and violent shootings.
If you go back to Columbine, those kids that shot up their classmates and shot up their
school, they were taking antidepressant drugs. If you run down the whole list, most school
shootings and most violent outbursts, even in the military, the military violence that's
in, what was the shooting at Fort Hood? That guy was under psychiatric care. All of these
people are under psychiatric care.
You look at Aurora, Colorado, you look at Sandy Hook in Connecticut, the recent situation,
that guy was on psychiatric drugs. It is the link that the media refuses to report. They
want to focus on, the guns are bad. They don't wanna tell you that the guy left his AR-15
vehicle in the car. He didn't even bring it into the school. They don't wanna tell you
that he was on psych drugs.
They don't wanna tell you that all these people are Satan worshippers, that they're all these
goth-like characters who literally love the devil, love Satan or think they do. They probably
never even, they don't even know what they're really dealing with. But they think they love
Satan, and so they engage in this kind of behavior. In any case, check out that article
called thatdailywnd.com, good article. Next item, this is up at infowars.com by Mark Slavo
at shtfplan.com.
America's biggest killer is the chart anti-gunners don't want you to see. Alex covered this briefly
in yesterday's article, but I wanna make an addition to this chart. This chart shows the
ten biggest killers in the United States. And at the top of the chart is tobacco use
at 529,000 deaths per annum. And underneath that is medical errors at 195,000 deaths,
and it goes on down the chart.
And guns or firearm homicides are at the very bottom of the chart. Underneath falls, unintentional
falls, people falling and dying. Motor vehicle accidents are three times, 300% larger than
firearm homicides. Alcohol abuse is almost ten times higher in terms of deaths than firearm
homicides. Unintentional injuries also 12 times higher and so on. And if you look at
the firearm homicides, most of those are gang related crimes where gang bangers are shooting
up each other.
It's not like they're actually going after just random people on the street, they're
going after each other. So that chart, it needs an update. I've got new information
to add to it. And I'll bring that to you when we return here on the Alex Jones Show. This
is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex today. Stay with us, we'll be right back.

Piers Morgan show live tonight at 9 PM Eastern and you can do the math on when that is in
your local area. So that might be interesting. Covering other news, the Orlando gun show
sales, this was in clickorlando.com over the weekend.
Orlando gun show sales reached record amidst the gun control debate. 8,000 people attended
the first day of the gun show. Normally, they probably get 2,000 people. 8,000 people had
to turn people away and give them a credit to come back the next day because they couldn't
fit all the people in there.
And of course, once they got there, all the guns were sold out. So it's like a gun show
where you can't buy anything because it's all sold out. Actually, there were still some
things for sale there. But gun dealers all across the country are completely wiped out
of their supplies of firearms. This is continuing. The wait time is getting worse and worse.
I've been talking to some of the gun distributors and dealers and manufacturers that I know
personally and they're telling me it's still on, man. It's still people are buying like
mad and people are lining up just handing them money.
Handing them like here $3,000, just take this $3,000. Find me a.308 battle rifle the first
chance you get and just hold on to my money until that happens. That's what we're seeing
now. It's like put your money down now and hope, hope and pray. That should be Obama's
new slogan.
Hope and pray that you can never buy a rifle again because they've talked it up so much
now. They've created like a one year wait period without even having a law for it. They've
wiped out the gun supply nationwide. And the reason that I'm kind of happy today, you know
why I'm happy?
I'm happy because Feinstein and the liberals have finally shown their cards. And I actually
welcome Dianne Feinstein to amend her bill. Let's just make it put everything in the bill
that you really, really want, okay? Just put everything in there. Let's ban not just rifles,
not just handguns and shotguns.
Let's ban forks and spoons and knives cuz you could whack somebody in the temple with
a spoon. That could hurt. We should just ban spoons and make people eat with sticks like
they did in China. Just have Americans, all Americans, it's time for chopsticks. And you
can't sharpen the chopsticks cuz those could be weapons of mass destruction.
So everybody eat with chopsticks. And while we're at it, Senator Feinstein, why not just
add into your bill that anyone who owns a gun can't have a website, can't have a First
Amendment right, can't have a Second Amendment right. And that if you say anything against
Obama, then let's say you shouldn't even have a Fifth Amendment right.
In fact, all your Bill of Rights completely gone if you speak your mind. If you don't
worship Feinstein and Obama, then you should be denied all of your right. Let's just get
it all out in there. And Feinstein's bill, by the way, banned grenade launchers on semi-auto
rifles as if you could just walk down to the gun store and buy a grenade launcher.
Really, is she so ignorant that she thinks that you can buy grenade launchers? In fact,
the NRA even pointed out, why not just add to the bill banning particle beam weapons
on your rifle? Yeah, particle beam weapons.
And how about laser blasters? And why not handheld rifle-mounted tactical nukes out
of Robert Heinlein's novel Starship Troopers? Let's just ban fully automated robotic body
armor suits with self-seeking nuclear weapons and particle beams and laser blasters.
Wonderful, we get sound effects today. Thank you, Feinstein, for painting such a wonderfully
imaginative view of what America really needs today. I think we should get the Han Solo
character on the show to talk about his laser blasters, and then have Feinstein threaten
to ban Han Solo. That's what we should do. No more Han Solo, no more laser blasters,
and God forbid, no lightsabers.
Because if you had a lightsaber, you could go into a school and just wreak havoc. So
no more lightsabers, Dianne Feinstein. That's something we can support, banning lightsabers
in the hands of the Jedi. All right, now getting back to reality here in the short time we
have left. Sorry to get carried away, but it's so insane. All we can do is laugh at
it at this point.
It's so insane that you don't have a right to self-defense. You don't have a First Amendment.
You don't even have the right to engage in commerce. Here's a story of the Bank of America
freezing the deposits of a licensed gun manufacturer that was selling parts online. It's an economic
embargo on top of the insanity. All right, stay with us. We've got guests and more news
coming up. This is Mike Adams on the Alex Jones Show. We'll be right back after this
break. Stay with us.
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

That was Han Solo there. That little quote you might have heard. What did he say? Your
ancient arts and hocus pocus is no match for a good blaster or something? Anyway, that's
one of my favorite lines from Star Wars. There are many. These are not the droids you're
looking for, being another. All right, I'm geeking out here on the Alex Jones show by
quoting Star Wars. If it gets any worse, I'll start quoting Star Trek lines too. Let's move
on.
We've got a guest coming up in just a couple of minutes, Mark Baker from Baker's Green
Acres. He is the small farm owner who has been just endlessly harassed by the state
of Michigan and its DNR, the Department of Natural Resources. They're going to go to
him in a second. But first, let me cover this. This has been reported in a website called
the ironicsterrealism.com. I'm not familiar with that site, but the Bank of America freezes
licensed gun manufacturers deposits.
And this is the company called American Spirit Arms at americanspiritarms.com. The owner's
name is Joe Sarachman. And he posted on Facebook that Bank of America seized his deposits,
his online retailing deposits. And that the manager in Bank of America told him that the
reason they seized his funds was, quote, we believe you should not be selling guns and
parts on the Internet.
Wow, first of all, you can't sell guns on the Internet. Just for all the liberals that
may be listening and don't know about FFL laws, you can't sell guns on the Internet.
You can accept a payment for a gun on the Internet, but you can't deliver the gun to
the person's house. You have to deliver it to a local dealer, obviously, where that person
undergoes a background check and so on and so forth.
FFL, Federal Firearms License. But the fact that this Bank of America representative reportedly
said you shouldn't be selling gun parts on the Internet either. Well, there you go. It's
all part of the economic embargo against actual Americans, against actual patriots.
And another example of that economic embargo is happening right now against our friend
Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com. And Mark joins us by phone to give us the latest
breakdown of what's happening to him in Michigan.
Mark, thank you for joining the show. How are you doing today, man?
Good, Mike, how are you doing?
Well, I'm flipping out. I'm just looking at all this news. It's so insane. It's off the
charts. And what you're experiencing is similar to it. Go ahead and give our audience, go
back to the beginning, but keep it brief in case people aren't familiar with your story.
Take us back to what happened in the beginning and then bring us up to date.
Okay. One year ago, about, we were told that the pigs that we raised are going to be considered
illegal in the state of Michigan because they have one of nine characteristics that the
Michigan Department of Natural Resources outlined in their declaratory ruling. The characteristics
are as crazy as if a pig has a straight tail, it's illegal. If a pig has a curly tail, it's
illegal. If a pig has a straight ear, it's illegal. Floppy ears, illegal. And then number
nine is other characteristics not currently known.
So anything they just want to invent, basically.
Right, anything they want. And so we were told that we had to depopulate our animals
by April 1st of 2012.
And when you say depopulate, you mean kill them.
Kill them, push them in a hole. I'm former military and I know that if I'm given an order
that is illegal or unlawful, it is my duty to not carry that order out. So I chose to
decline the order and we've leveled suit against the state for relief so we could go on and
continue our business.
The pigs that we raise are Mangalita and Mangalita hybrid and we use a Russian boar cross and
they have some of the characteristics that the DNR has outlined. Anyway, we took them
to court. It has dragged on. We still haven't argued the case in court and it's on and on
and on. Finally, the last shot across our bow was two weeks ago. We wanted to have some
of our animals butchered through the USDA slaughter plant that we've used for five years.
And the man that owns the plant says he wasn't able to because the USDA showed him pictures
and if our pigs had those characteristics, they couldn't go through it.
So the order has come down from the USDA to all the pig processing plants, pork processing
plants there to deny any farmer, to deny service to any farmer that comes in with a pig that
matches those pictures. Is it like grunted by the FBI picture where they have floppy
ears on there and curly tails? Is that what it is?
You know, I wanted to get a copy of all that stuff from the guy at the plant but he's afraid
of the USDA because they can shut him down. So I don't have any of that yet. Our lawyers
are procuring that as we speak.
Wow. So I guess porky the pig is the new al-Qaeda. But this sounds like an economic embargo against
you where they, like you said, you had used this plant before. They had processed some
of your pigs before for years.
Yeah, five years we've used them.
And now they say, sorry.
Yeah.
So you couldn't get your pigs processed which means you couldn't sell them.
Right, right. And if we can't sell the pigs, then we can't afford to feed the ones that
are coming up, the younger ones. And so we were forced to make some decisions and decisions
that we made was right before Christmas, we would slaughter our mature cows, which are
like 400 pound animals. And so we did that the weekend right after Christmas and then
last weekend we finished, got them all slaughtered.
So the government has forced you to kill your own animals, which will hurt your future business
and they're denying you a source of revenue because your pigs have a characteristic that
they don't like.
That's it.
Like fur color, it's almost like skin color. It's like saying, it's almost a kind of animal
racism you could say.
Well, it really is. They're saying that we have a problem with feral animals and feralness
is a behavior, right? And now they're saying that if my pigs are black or they're black
and white or they're black and red, then they are more likely to be feral. So I have to
get rid of them. And the only cut out, the only carve out that they've given is the guys
that raise pigs in confinement. And those are usually corporately held.
Yeah, like corporate feedlot operations.
Right, right. So they're not affected by this at all.
Got it.
It's the family farm that's affected. And you know, if you were to call, if your listeners
were to call the Michigan DNR right now, they'd probably get a story like, oh, that doesn't
apply to people that raise 4-H pigs. But then if you take the law that's sitting in front
of me, it's the declaratory ruling that's available on our website if someone wants
to download it, and you read it and then you have some pigs in your backyard and you look
at them, you're going to say, well, by golly, my pigs do have floppy ears. That would make
them illegal under the declaratory ruling.
It's the floppy ears law. But look, listeners, check out Mark Baker's website, bakersgreenacres.com.
There are some great videos there that describe all of this in more detail. And if you're
able, you may also wish to offer some small donations of support. Mark Baker and his attorneys
are fighting this, fighting against the highly oppressive Michigan government over this issue.
What's the next step for your lawsuit, Mark? I know that the courts have been denying you
an actual trial, but what's the next step? You mentioned something happening maybe in
June of this year. I mean, what's going on?
Right. The last step that we had, I mean, that will help put it in perspective, we filed
a motion with the court and said that we believe that the declaratory ruling is vague, and
therefore it's unconstitutional if it's vague, because if they're going to charge me with
a felony for these pigs that I have, and that is what harboring an invasive species is punishable
with, if they're going to charge me with a felony, then it cannot be vague. It has to
be very to the point, very clear, so a person knows that they're breaking the law. And we
felt as though the ninth characteristic, where it says other characteristics not currently
known to the DNR, as a characteristic that could make me a felon, we felt that that was
vague. And so we filed a motion with the court. The judge heard the motion. The judge said
I'll let you know in 30 days, 35 days come, and he says, no, I don't think it's vague.
I think it's good. So now we have to go back to court, and trying to schedule a court is
tough, and they're telling us we're not going to be able to get in until June.
All right, so he doesn't think that whatever we want to make up, that that's not vague,
huh? That's wild. That's kind of like the United Nations treaty, human rights treaty,
that says something like, yeah, you have all your rights, unless it opposes whatever we
want the UN to do. Is it just a very general, vague statement that is kind of a blanket
statement that nullifies everything else they just said?
Right. Well, let me ask you a bigger question here, Mark. Let's take your situation and
expand it to the nation. So just as you have been denied your right to engage in farming,
and your food freedoms have been taken away, and you used to be in the military, you served
this country.
Right.
Now, all Americans are being threatened with having their rights taken away by Dianne Feinstein,
Obama, Biden, all the other gun grabbers who are suddenly saying, well, the Second Amendment
doesn't apply, Bill of Rights doesn't apply, we can just take these away from you because
we want to.
Yeah.
What are your thoughts on what's happening in America as a whole today?
Well, did you ever see the movie Ants?
Oh yeah, yeah, I saw that.
I think that's my feeling. I was at an event yesterday and I looked out over the crowd
and I saw probably 300 men from ages, say, 20 to 60. And the nature of that event, I
felt as though most of those men feel the same way that I do about our country and our
freedoms. And we have a few people like Dianne Feinstein that are going to level some new
law because there's been some tragedies in the country. I think it's about time the men
get together and start saying, we're going to come to the table and offer you our suggestion
of what the way things ought to go. And it wouldn't be the first time that's been done
in this country.
Well, and when you say come to the table and offer you our suggestion, I mean, wouldn't
that suggestion be to basically have all of you gun grabbers arrested as traitors? I mean,
isn't that what the constitution really says?
Yeah, if I was one of those gun grabbers, I think that I'd be barring the door.
Good point. Hey, in fact, I've got an article that I'm going to read here, not the whole
thing, but I'm going to read this in the next segment. This is by Paul Howe from combatshootingandtactics.com.
Paul Howe, he is an outstanding firearms instructor. You may know who he is, Mark.
I don't.
Well, he's an incredible tactical instructor. His article is entitled Second Amendment and
the Kool-Aid Drinkers. And I'm going to go through some of the highlights of that. It's
very powerful because he talks about, and he's not a radical guy or anything. He's a
constitutional patriot, very upstanding citizen.
And he talks about like this, after the first few raids, he's talking about if gun confiscation
is kicked off, the word would get out and Americans would start to fight back. It would
only take one good ambush from a house or along a travel route to decimate a tactical
force or make it combat ineffective. That seems to be what I'm hearing from more and
more people, in fact.
Well, they have to get young men to perform these gun confiscations. And those men have
lives. They only have one. They have families. They have things that they like to do on weekends.
And they would be going into a very precarious situation. These are American citizens we're
talking about here. These are not Canadian. This isn't Australia. This is the United States
of America. I think they better rethink what they're talking about.
Well, I think we need more Americans to stand up like you have done. You refuse to lay down
to the Michigan DNR and you're fighting it. And that is the path to victory. The victory
is within our reach. All we have to do is call their bluff and stand up to them.
All these people that are calling for gun grabbing, they don't have experience in the
field with firearms. They're hoping someone else will do it for them.
Oh, right.
You know, Senator Feinstein, she's not gonna grab a gun and kick in your front door and
throw a flashbang in there and say, I'm Feinstein, here to get your guns. No, she's gonna try
to recruit somebody else to do that. Although, it would be an interesting video if she actually
tried to do that, but she's probably not.
No, no. She'll get some other American to do it, some 23-year-old kid that wants to
be law enforcement. And yeah, they don't do their own dirty work, that's for sure.
No, never, never. Even in war, they send somebody else's kids off to fight their wars to fight
and die in too many cases, sadly. Well, where do you think this is all going? Either, not
just in Michigan, but where do you think it's all headed?
Because look, I think your issue that you're facing there, Mark, is just a symptom of America,
the erosion of freedoms and liberties. It's all the same issue.
I agree, Mike. Like with the gun issue, they want to take everybody's gun because one nut
did something crazy, right? It's the same thing with the pigs. They want to take the
farmer's pigs because there are supposedly some feral pigs that are doing damage to golf
courses. It's kind of the same thing.
Well, that's like saying that if somebody's bull gets loose and their bull runs around
the golf course tearing up the golf course, which I'm sure a bull would have a wonderful
time doing that, to say, well, now all bulls are going to be illegal or cows are going
to be banned in Michigan. It's the same thing.
Sure, it's the same thing. Or if a dog bites somebody, let's do away with all dogs.
Right, right. Yeah, it's a felony to have a dog.
Yeah. So this thing with Americans picking up guns, that's a really hot topic. And I
know I come in contact with a lot of people that talk about this, and I think that is
the one issue that is really going to kick the can over. And we're coming to a showdown.
There's no doubt about it. And it's going to go one way or the other. And it's the same
thing with the pigs. We're coming to a showdown. Either we have the right to farm or we don't.
But if they want to take that right away from us, somebody's got to come take it.
Well, Mark, I am confident. I'm absolutely confident. In fact, I have a great sense of
optimism about all this over the last few days after really digging into this. The gun
owners are going to win big time, big time, because the insanity has gotten so bad that
it can't continue. I don't know if you heard the first part of the show, but did you hear
the story out of the New York Post that welfare recipients now are using their EBT cards,
that's their government handout cards, at strip clubs, liquor stores, and X-rated shops.
That's where they're using your tax money, Mark.
Well, yeah, I don't like that too good.
Yeah, that's how insane it has become. But anyway, stay with us, Mark. We'll be right
back after this break. More from Mark Baker here on the Alex Jones Show. This is Mike
Adams sitting in. Stay with us a lot straight ahead.

Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online so go to weirddevice.com
before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.
All right. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger
filling in for Alex. I'm the editor of naturalnews.com and a frequent contributor to infowars.com.
Go to infowars.com right now, by the way. A lot of news stories being posted there.
Every morning, Kurt Nemo and Don are cranking away and Paul Joseph Watson, of course, also
working at the early hours of our morning in the US. He's based, obviously, in the UK.
A lot of great information there. I was just thinking, we need a new B, like a B movie
called Invasion of the Zombie Redcoats. You know how they have all that zombie ammo out
there now?
Like Hornady and all these companies have zombie ammo, Zombie Max. And there's even
a company that has a varmint round called Zombageddon or something. It's really great.
We should have a new B movie, the Zombie Redcoats, to try to take over Washington. I'm not going
to go into that too much more. Sorry, I get carried away.
But let's go into this article and ask for Mark Baker's feedback on it again. Mark Baker
joins us with bakersgreenacres.com. And he, of course, has been threatened with felony
crimes by the state of Michigan for raising pigs that he's been raising for many, many
years.
In fact, his family has been in the farming business for, I think, generations. Mark,
we talked about what the reaction might be from Americans if there were a gun confiscation
order. But I think people don't realize that if they turn in their guns, then they're going
to lose all their other freedoms, such as farming freedom, as you're also experiencing
now.
But food freedom, medical freedom, freedom to say no to vaccines, all these other issues
that people want to have a choice on. What are your thoughts on that, Mark?
Oh, that's the easy one for me. I'm a student of history, and I know that gun registration
is always followed by gun confiscation. And when the people don't have guns, the people
who do have guns can tell them to do whatever they want. So if your guns are being confiscated
from you, you might as well get ready to get herded onto cattle cars next, because they'll
be able to do it to you, and you won't have any choice.
Everybody knows that the right to own and bear arms is not about hunting or keeping
the Indians out of the camp. It's really about the balance of powers. We're supposed to have
federal troops, state troops, and then citizen militia. That's how it's supposed to be set
up, so that the citizens can come to the table and have some say in what's going to happen
across the country. Right now, we've got the federal government, the state government telling
us, the citizenry, this is how it's going to be.
Well, that's what's fascinating. You see, the gun-grabbing liberals, and I don't want
to always use the term liberal in a negative connotation, but in this context, it is, in
the sense that they're so naive. Apparently, they've never studied history. They don't
know that they, too, will be rounded up eventually or oppressed eventually.
You see, they want to have the federal government take away the guns, but then they don't think
about, well, what about the next election? What if there's another tyrant that gets the
White House, even the Republican tyrant, let's say, who's worse than Obama, worse than Clinton,
worse than Bush, or whatever? And that person uses the power that Obama took from the people
to then commit genocide.
You see, the liberals don't think ahead. I don't know. I don't get it.
Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of shortsightedness, but that's typical of what they do.
Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess foresight requires intelligence, and that's just asking too much.
But Mark Baker, thank you for joining us today. It's been a pleasure having you on.
Thanks for having me on, Mike.
Thank you, and go to bakersgreenacres.com. Learn more about the fight that Mark Baker
is having with the state of Michigan and their attempts to oppress farm freedom and food
freedom right under our noses. We'll be right back.

the second hour of the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams, the health ranger filling in
for Alex today, who is on an airplane to New York right now to appear on CNN later tonight
talking with Piers Morgan. And so I'm filling in for Alex today and having a good time doing
it too, because you can't help but make comedy about all the insanity that's going on out
there.
It's so insane that you gotta laugh at it. But we also have some solutions that we're
talking about today. I've got a good solution, in fact, coming up here. But first, let me
give you a preview of what's happening this hour. At the bottom of this hour, we're gonna
be joined by John Rappaport from nomorefakenews.com to discuss psychiatric drugs and how the government's
surveillance of your prescription drugs could be turned against you to deny you your constitutional
rights.
I also hope to take some calls when John is on the air with us. So I'll announce the phone
number in the next segment. We'll get some calls queued up for John. And then in the
third hour, Aaron Dykes is going to be taking command of the chair here and possibly reading
from a Paul Revere book I heard. I don't know if that's true or if that was just some banter
around the office here, but maybe something to do with Paul Revere.
We'll find out, and I'll let you know as soon as I know. Now in the meantime, I've got a
solution for all the gun grabbers. This is the perfect solution for liberals. You can
opt out of the Bill of Rights. If you hate the Second Amendment, give it up. If you hate
the Bill of Rights, give it up. All you have to do, folks, here's all you have to do. Take
your passport down to the US passport office, denounce your citizenship, book a flight to
a nation called North Korea.
Once there, they will give you a new passport and you can enjoy utopia under the new regime
of freedom. What's the guy's name there? Not Kim Jong-il, it's Kim Jong-un. Yes, because
every generation they change one syllable. Next time is gonna be Kim Jong-un. But all
the liberals could go there.
And there you have no Second Amendment, therefore everything must be A-OK. Never mind the barbed
wire facing inward at the border checkpoints to prevent North Koreans from escaping their
own country. Never mind that. Never mind the fact that the guards face inward with their
assault rifles. Yes, they have guns in North Korea, but only in the hands of the government
guards.
But I think the liberals would love that. So you see, the Bill of Rights is optional.
You can simply give it up for yourself, but you can't take it from me. You got that? You
can't take it from me. And you can't take it from the other patriots and the other veterans
and the other lawful and legal gun owners and the other peace officers who are actually
trying to restore peace and liberty and freedom in this country.
You can't take it from us, you can only denounce your own. In fact, we should just have a website
for liberals called Opt Out of the Bill of Rights. The leaders of that movement up there,
put Michael Moore up there, you know, put Feinstein up there. The leaders of the Opt
Out of the Bill of Rights effort, that would be very popular in certain circles in Hollywood,
I imagine.
Now there's another thing that we have to remember here, that this very idea that because
one person in Sandy Hook committed a terrible crime of violence, that everybody else in
the country is supposed to give up all their rights. Wait a minute, wait a minute. One
citizen does something bad, every citizen gets punished for it.
Well, by the same logic, if one government bureaucrat ever abuses the freedom of an American
citizen and my gosh, they never do that, then we should ban all government. We should eliminate
all government. I mean, using their logic, one person does something wrong, ban everybody.
We should say one government official does something wrong, defund the entire government.
That's their logic. But of course, they want it selectively applied, not rationally applied
across the board. We'll be right back, stay with us.

Yeah, we're back on the Alex Jones Show. This is Monday. It's another Monday for just joining
us, January 7th, 2013. This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today
with some pretty energetic music. Thanks, guys. Always appreciate the extra boost, not
that we need it around here, powered by freedom and superfoods. That's our slogan. That's
our motto. And speaking of freedom, we've got joining us today, I guess, the executive
director of the Illinois State Rifle Association, ISRA, is just going to be joining us for about
five minutes or so to give us an update on this sneak attack that happened last night
in Illinois, in Springfield, to try to destroy the Second Amendment rights of all citizens
of the state of Illinois.
So Mr. Pearson, Richard Pearson is his name. And guys, if you'll bring up the website,
I'll mention the URL during the interview. Mr. Pearson, thank you for joining us today
on the Alex Jones Show.
Hey, I'm glad to be here. Well, thank you, sir. Appreciate your time.
Give us an update, a breakdown. What happened yesterday in the state Congress there?
Well, what happened was we had been working all weekend with phone calls, and I got lots
of complaints in that the phone lines were jammed up, melted down, plugged up, and they
decided to withdraw all the bills yesterday at four o'clock.
So they were trying to sneak it through on a Sunday.
Right. But on Sunday, we were there, and they decided to voice the white flag at least temporarily.
So if this bill had passed, tell us exactly what it would have done in terms of criminalizing
firearms in the state.
Well, you wouldn't have been able to own any semi-automatic anything, including 22 rifles
with magazines.
Wow. Do these people not realize how many farmers and ranchers are in Illinois, and
they need these as tools of the farm?
They don't care. They don't like anybody that owns guns. They don't like you because
you like guns. They don't like me because I like guns.
So surely they must realize that Chicago is already the murder capital of the world, even
though it's a, quote, gun-free zone.
Well, that's right. But it's because of those guns, it's the murder capital of the world.
So the second largest city, which is not a gun-free zone, had no murders last year.
And which city would that be?
That would be Aurora, Illinois. And so I don't know how they reconcile this, but they can
do it in their own mind because they have magnificent mental power.
How angry are the legal firearms owners in the state of Illinois right now? Because I'm
sure you've heard from a lot of them. What's the word on the street there?
They are angry. But that doesn't mean that this is piloted by the city of Chicago and
Rahm Emanuel until they're going to bring this back again. It doesn't matter to them
how angry they are. But so we'll see this again and we will resist with every effort.
But sir, do they think that they can just make a law on a piece of paper and that nothing
is going to happen in response? Do they think that all the people of the state of Illinois
are just going to turn in their guns and become slaves to Rahm?
Do they really believe that's going to happen?
Well, I actually think that they do actually believe that's going to happen. But I think
the last few days have shown that that might be outside of what's going to happen here.
What is your website, Mr. Pearson, so that people can visit?
www.isra.org. ISRA.org. Okay. And I see you have an urgent alert posted there. That's
from yesterday. Yes.
Are you getting a lot of additional press right now across the country or across the
state? What's happening with the media angle on this?
We are getting lots of interviews, lots of phone calls, lots of emails. We have people
joining. We have members from Texas, by the way. And so we appreciate everyone going to
the website and joining. And we thank you for that.
Excellent. All right. Well, I appreciate the update, Richard. Thank you for joining us
here on the Alex Jones show today and keep up the fight because we, the gun owners of
America will win this. We just have to continue the fight. That's all.
Oh, yeah, we do. And we have to stick together too.
Absolutely. Well, good job defeating that bill and keep up the effort to fight for liberty
and freedom in America.
I will. Thank you and thank everyone out there.
All right. Thank you. Take care then. All right. That was Richard Pearson from the Illinois
state rifle association. And I'm sure similar events are happening elsewhere across the
country. There are probably various nefarious plans by the state representatives of certain
cities, let's say, to try to take away the second amendment rights of lawful and legal
gun owners, which by the way, include many peace officers, many returning veterans, many
active duty military and active duty cops as well.
And I did a story the other day too about airline pilots. Most people who fly airplanes
don't realize that about 17% of the time, you're flying in a plane with an armed pilot.
And that's a good thing. It's a good thing because we don't want pilots to be overpowered
by terrorists, right? Or hijackers or anything else. So we arm the pilots and they carry
concealed weapons in the flight deck and they're prepared to use them.
And I'll tell you what, the pilots that I know, one pilot in particular, he's a very
good shot with a Colt 1911 and a 45 caliber. He'll put two right in the forehead of any
terrorist that tries to break into the flight deck. No questions asked. So there you go.
Pilots, yep, good guys and gals, a few gals, but mostly good guys. All right, let's go
on to this story here. Second amendment and the Kool-Aid drinkers. This was posted by
Paul Howe. I mentioned it earlier. This was ahead of us being joined by John Rappaport
at the bottom of this hour.
This is a very important story. And this was the most important story of the day in my
opinion. Paul Howe is the creator of combatshootingandtactics.com. Combatshootingandtactics.com. Paul Howe
is a very intelligent firearms instructor. I've learned a tremendous amount of information
from his videos posted over at makeready.tv. That's the website, makeready.tv. I normally
don't endorse just third party video companies, but in this case, I've seen so many millions
of Americans purchasing firearms but not necessarily getting good training on how to use them.
And makeready.tv is a great place. You can get online training, tons of videos. I use
it. It is top notch, top quality production. Panteo Productions is the company. And no,
they didn't pay me to say that. I'm just a customer and a patriot. So go to makeready.tv.
You can see Paul Howe in action. Now getting to his article though, this is brilliant.
Second amendment and the Kool-Aid drinkers. Paul Howe discusses what would actually happen
if gun confiscation were attempted in the United States. He asked the question, who's
coming to get them, meaning the guns? Who's coming to get the guns? And he breaks it down
because look, he trains with military. He trains with law enforcement and he has for
decades. He knows all the tactics. He knows all the people. He knows their attitudes,
their belief systems, their loyalties. This guy knows what he is talking about. The most
qualified person to talk about this issue of gun confiscation in my opinion.
He says that, first of all, if the military were tasked with gun confiscation, here's
what would happen. He says, quote, remember, these forces, the military forces, would have
to come from a military base that is surrounded and supported by American communities. If
the military began gun confiscation, the civilians would simply stop supporting the base, cut
off the fuel, food, electricity on the bases, and it would stop the silliness, Paul Howe
says in his article.
And he says also many service members that live in those local communities would have
to travel from their houses to their base unless they were locked down. And the families
in the community would not be too friendly to those engaging in gun confiscation. That's
another way of saying, you're not gonna make it to the base, buddy. You may not even make
it out of your house if you're one of these gun grabbers.
Now, another quote, if the federal government tries to engage in gun confiscation, DHS or
TSA, can you imagine the TSA trying to engage in gun confiscation? These pathetic people
wouldn't last a day. They'd be outgunned by all the patriots and all the police officers
and all the preppers in no time.
TSA, give me a break. What are they gonna do, raid our house with a latex glove? Really?
Paul Howe writes, after the first few raids, the word would get out and Americans would
start to fight back. Yeah, no kidding. It would take one good ambush from a house or
along a travel route to decimate a tactical force or make it combat ineffective.
Yep, that's all it takes. If you're gonna try to declare war on the American people
by taking away their guns, you're gonna have a guerrilla war on your hands. And you're
gonna lose, you gun grabbers, you're gonna lose big time. Paul Howe continues in his
article, he says, quote, most federal agencies work out of a fixed location centrally located
in a community.
Ah, yes, we know where you are. We know where you're based. And he goes on, those were my
words, we know where you are, not Paul's words. But Paul goes on, also, their personnel live
in those communities along with their families. Once the word got out that they were doing
raids in violation to the Constitution, they and their families would be at risk.
Yeah, they and their families would be more than at risk. They would probably have their
homes burned out. Because think about it, think about it. If you're on a tactical police
team and you're conducting armed raids on houses around your community, they know where
you live. It's not a secret, your names, if you're on a force that's doing that, they
know where your homes are.
You can expect your home to be burned out probably if this kind of thing gets going.
You're putting yourself in danger is what's gonna happen. And most sheriffs and deputies
and police officers are gonna say, no way, I'm not doing that. Besides, I believe in
the Constitution, I support the Second Amendment. That's what they're gonna say. I'm not gonna
just run around and kick in people's doors.
All how continuous tactical teams could probably do only eight to ten hits in a day and then
they would need a break. That's a lot of hits. So they hit ten houses and seize their guns,
the word gets out. It would not go well. And if one or two determined Americans or combat
vets fought back, the team would lose many, the TAC team would lose members to death or
injury and they would admit, and well, they have to stop doing their raids cuz they're
losing guys.
That's the way it would really work. So there you go. That's the truth on the situation
of gun confiscation from Paul Howe. We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show. Stay
with us.

On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
to retire and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost
of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
line. Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal
Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These
questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from
Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about
central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking

You are listening to the Alex Jones Show. Alex is on an airplane headed to New York
to be on a show tonight. This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
Sort of a last minute deal. He called me over the weekend and was like, hey Mike, can you
fill in? I said, okay, you got it, you got it, man. Anything for the cause of liberty.
So I am here. And by the way, a friend texted me over the break that we just had. And because
earlier in the show, I sort of joked about Senator Feinstein kicking in doors and throwing
flashbangs and engaging in her own gun confiscation. And my friend texted me and said, I'd pay
good money to see that. I would pay money to see Senator Feinstein throwing a flashbang
and kicking in doors and seizing guns.
Yeah, we all would. They said, hey, Joe Rogan out there, you should get a pay-per-view thing
set up with the UFC called the Ultimate Confiscation Championship and have Senator Feinstein and
Schumer and Michael Moore and dress them up in body armor and put guns in their hands
and have them try to kick it. They probably couldn't even kick in the door. They just
couldn't even get that far.
They could kick the door and break an ankle. You know what I mean? It would be that pathetic.
But I think all these people talk about gun confiscation. Do it yourself, man. Don't hide
behind a bunch of laws. If you wanna take our guns, do it personally, face to face.
Bring it on. All right, man. Okay, drudgereport.com right now, top link. Showdown, talk host Alex
Jones detained by the TSA. This is true. This is top link on Drudge. And there's a picture
of it.
Go to drudgereport.com right now. There's a picture of it, I guess, looks like another
passenger traveler grabbed this photo and sent it to Drudge. And Alex called me from
the airplane right before I went on the air here, about 20 minutes before I went on the
air today.
He was very angry and he said that the TSA had detained him and threatened him with arrest.
And really, what's this officer's name? Okay, John Bowne here just said that that's the
same officer in the photo that detained or that threatened them when they were filming
at the Austin airport.
So that officer, whoever, I don't know his name, apparently does not understand the Bill
of Rights and the Constitution. And I guess we should thank that officer because what
he did is he just sent Alex Jones to New York with extra steam. That's what he really did.
But there's gonna be a video on this later today. Alex filmed some of this on his iPhone.
I've been told. And that video is going to be edited shortly. There has to be some other
travelers taken out of the video who don't have anything to do with it.
So they're gonna be edited out to focus on the actual conflict. Alex Jones detained,
threatened with arrest at the Austin airport today, this morning, just hours ago. So that's
the new America. You can't even get on the plane and fly to a media interview without
being threatened with unlawful arrest by a bunch of goons who think that the Constitution
doesn't apply in an airport.
People are fed up. I'm fed up. You're fed up. Patriots are fed up. Gun owners are fed
up with the insanity. And this is not gonna last, folks. This is not going to last, believe
me. And in just a couple of minutes, we've got John Rappaport joining us by Skype to
give us some additional thoughts on where this was all headed.
But first, let me finish up this article about the Kool-Aid drinkers from Paul Howe because
he has a couple more quotes in here that are very powerful. I just wanna get these in.
Paul mentions, and Paul's a firearms instructor, one of the best, most widely recognized in
the country. I believe he trains people at a facility here in Texas, in fact. He says
that America is a nation of combat veterans and patriots. We have the guns and ammunitions
out there and the talent to use them because thanks to the fact that we've been at war
since about the early 1990s, our nation has effectively trained hundreds of thousands
of soldiers how to use firearms.
And those soldiers, their loyalty is to the Constitution to which they took an oath. So
that's a very positive outcome of the fact that we've been at war, even though I don't
support all the wars. But I am happy that our soldiers have gained the skills that come
from conflict so that we can protect our liberties here at home.
Paul Howe again, in every law enforcement, government, and military agency or branch,
he says there are a small number of Kool-Aid drinkers who would blindly follow orders.
They would either be purged internally by their co-workers, he says, or the people they
attacked would, quote, stop their gene pool. That's another, that's a euphemism for being
terminated as a traitor to America. Those are the words of Paul Howe.
We'll be right back. Stay with us. John Rapoport coming up after this break. This is the Alex
Jones Show. Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in, fighting for liberty.
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

We know who you are. We know you're a critic. And just so you understand, Alex, we're in
charge, not you. So that's the point that we're trying to make. But of course, they
didn't make it because he got on the plane.
It's the raw exercise of juvenile tyranny. These people, they must have such small little
souls. They must be such children inside these TSA officers. I can't even call them officers.
TSA goons, thugs, absolute thugs. They must be little emotionally immature children inside
to get off on making people take their shoes off when they know that person's not a threat.
They know the person.
Of course. They absolutely know that. And then you've got other people because I mean,
I fly. I've seen TSA people who themselves are trapped in the system because, you know,
they're broke. They're out of work. They can find a job. So they take the job and they're
standing around. I've watched them and they look at the whole charade and they're thinking
to themselves, you can see it written on their face. This is complete insanity, but I have
to pick up a paycheck. And so they do this, right? And when I've talked to them, I can
see that they know I know and I know they know I know. This is all insane, right? And
yeah, that's what's going on. It's a police state in action.
Yeah. Well, and they're standing around and radiating themselves, giving themselves cancer,
which I guess in a funny kind of Darwinist kind of way, they are actually eliminating
themselves from the future human gene pool through infertility and they don't even know
it. They're so uninformed. What was it Melissa Melton was telling me this morning when I
walked through here, she said that there was a TSA agent who told her that the machines,
they don't emit radiation. They only emit x-rays.
Oh, great. Yeah, really. Got that now from the top of the food chain. No x-rays. I mean,
no radiation, just x-rays. Only x-rays. Yeah. Because in their minds, x-rays are not radiation.
And you know, where do you find these people? Do you put out ads to say, you know, maximum
IQ allowed 72, you know, or, or answer this question, are x-rays and radiation the same
thing as it says? No, you got a job, baby. Oh man. You tell him what you ask him, what
is the table of elements? And they think that's the place where they eat in the break room.
It's like, okay. Oh my God. We're being ruled by morons.
The Twinkie element on the chart. Yeah. It's completely insane.
And it's like, Alex Jones, take off your shoes. Take off. We know who you are. We know you're
a national radio host. We know you're no threat to anybody. We know you've never been arrested.
You have no criminal record. We know you, but take off your damn shoes or I'm going
to arrest you. That's a quote. It's incredible. Yeah. Oh, okay. Do we have any, I'm sure there's
no, nobody was there taking video of this where they, Alex was taking video and he said
he's going to upload it. So we're going to, we're going to get to see some video tonight.
It's not during this broadcast because Alex is on the plane and it's not landing for another,
I don't know, hour or whatever. So tonight there will be video and I can't wait to see
it personally. I'm just, you know, I think it'll be a great lesson. But the other point
is if, if it was, if it was someone other than Alex Jones, they would have been arrested.
You see, they let Alex go because they knew what would happen if they arrested Alex Jones.
Exactly. So if it was just somebody who said, no, you can't, you know, you can't make me
take off my shoes. That guy's in jail. Right? Exactly. Exactly. So, so even Alex only got
through there by his wits and his notoriety. If it had been someone who wasn't well known,
they would have been in jail and probably, you know, punched in the face, beat up and,
and whatever, tortured, who knows? And, or even sometimes killed, you know, they've been
killed after being detained at the airport. Or somebody would say, well, this is prima
facie evidence that you're a terrorist because you wouldn't take off your shoes. Right? Yeah.
You have, you have al-Qaeda shoes on. I see. I see your al-Qaeda. All right, let's go on
to the other issues today, but it's just, it's, it's infuriating how much tyranny we're,
we are suffering under in America today. And that all these, these, these liberals, I got
to say that they, they think the answer is more tyranny. The answer is more government.
The answer is to take away more rights from the people. Put the, put all the guns in the
hands of the worst goons imaginable. People like the TSA. Can you imagine if the TSA were
armed?
Oh yeah. Well, you know, that's another incident and they will be armed.
They I'm sure that's the plan. I'm sure that's what some of the 1.6 billion bullets are for.
The 40 caliber hollow points. They're going to arm the TSA, which, you know, that's going
to be interesting because I bet these people can't hit the side of a barn with a firearm.
You know-
Guns, guns fired in the airport. Five innocent spectators killed, you know?
Right. Right. All right. Let's, I'm sorry. This, this, I'm sorry to get off, off topic,
but let's, let's get back up.
No, no. This is, I mean, this is completely on topic because it's happening right now.
Well, yeah, it is happening right now. You know what? Let's open up the calls, the call
queue guys at GCN there. Let's open it up. Let me give out the number 1-800-259-9231.
800-259-9231. If you've got a question or comment for John Rappaport or myself, a comment
about Alex Jones being detained and threatened with arrest this morning at the Austin airport
or comments about gun rights, you name it. Call in, we'll take some calls.
Now let's get to the article. I got to give you credit for this, John. You called me yesterday.
We had a short conversation on the phone. You brought up this idea that the prescription
drug records of patients all across America could be used to label everyone that's on
antidepressants, for example, as being mentally unfit to own firearms and then deny them the
right to own or possess firearms.
Absolutely. And then you took off from that. I mean, this just knocked me over that you've
discovered that there is indeed one giant database of Americans who are on medical drugs.
Yes. Yes. I took your idea and I did some additional research on it last night and I
found this National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act, NASPR, signed into
law by George Bush in 2005. And then a multi-state data sharing prescription drug surveillance
program now run by 48 states that goes by a different name, which is funded by the U.S.
Department of Justice and the website is pmpalliance.org. So I got to give you credit, John, for bringing
this up. And I think it's a huge story. Your thoughts?
Gigantic. I mean, I have to assume, Mike, without having actually looked at this database
because I'm sure I can't get into it, but whoever can get into it is going to be able
to find out the names of people. Right. You take the drugs. Otherwise, what good is the
database, right?
No, it's got to have your name and the drugs that you're taking. That's in the database.
That's the whole point of the database.
So therefore, inferring from that, somebody knows right away, right now, what psychiatric
medications Adam Lanza was on. James Holmes was on. Any one of these people that I've
been knocking on this door and you have and other people, who's the guy's doctor? What
psychiatric meds was he on? Let's find out because we know these medications induced
violence. Well, now you've proved people already know, people who have access to the database.
They could tell us.
And there's this article this morning in WorldNet Daily by David Kapelian that he called
it the giant gaping hole in Sandy Hook reporting where they're not talking about the prescription
drugs. They don't want us to know what drugs they were on because if we knew, then they
couldn't blame the guns, John.
Exactly.
They have to blame the guns.
Exactly. So they don't want to say, they won't say the drug companies are in on this because
the drug companies want to blame guns too. I mean, the drug companies are behind gun
control because that deflects all responsibility away from the psychiatric drugs.
Well, right.
So you've got this giant juggernaut monopoly, corporate government, et cetera, all against
the guns. Let's take away the guns. We know it's the guns. Of course, the guns jump off
the shelves and kill people themselves. It's not the drugs.
No, it's not the drugs that alter the mind that controls the muscles that move the finger
that touches the trigger that actuates the firing pin that strikes the primer. No, it's
not any of that. The gun is a magic device, a magical device that leaps out of the holster
and starts shooting children all by itself at like some kind of anime horror film or
something.
I don't know. It's bizarre. Let's go to calls, John, if you're up for it.
Sure, let's go.
All right. Let's Mark from Oregon. You're on the line. Welcome to the show, Mark. What's
on your mind?
Well, welcome to my home, gentlemen. I really appreciate all your great work. You're wonderful.
Thank you.
You're most welcome. Thank you so much. Couldn't do any more than you've done.
Hey, we're just like you. We're just fighting for liberty here. That's it. That's it.
Yeah, but you do it with such gusto, mate.
Well, that's because we are real Americans. We are the real America. We are the ones who
broke off from tyranny and we're going to defend the constitution that we were built
on. That's it. Bottom line. End of story.
We have to move into the spirit of 1776.
Absolutely.
Mike and John, I called in today about the... It's based around the Sandy Hook shooting
and there are two areas I'd like to cover very quickly if I could. One is the situational
basis and the legal basis of what everything is being revolved on against us as the American
people being prepared to go into physical slavery relative to this last step which occurs
historically before the actual physical enslavement of the people of a nation.
Right. We're going through the cycle of civilizations right now and you're right. We're at that
point of enslavement which is usually followed by revolution, by the way, historically.
So realizing how important this is, if I have the time to cover these two, I think it would
enlighten you and the audience because it's just the conglomeration and the result of
all the information I've taken in which is substantial from good men such as yourself.
Well, hit them as fast as you can. Go ahead. Get right into it.
Quickly here.
In the situational basis, you have the glaring inconsistencies all around the Aurora shooting
in Aurora, Colorado, the movie theater as well as Sandy Hook, moving back into 9-11,
coming forward a ways to the underwear bomber. We have glaring inconsistencies which are
in a court of law would eventually prove that U.S. government black operations were involved
in all of these different false flag terror attacks.
So you have this existing in the Aurora, Colorado shooting in various places as well as up on
the screen. The Joker points on a map to Sandy Hook.
Let me ask John to comment on that, Mark. That's a really great point. John has done
more research on this than most others.
You know, this business with the Sandy Hook map in The Dark Knight Rises and Gary Oldman,
the police commissioner, Gordon, pointing to it in the movie.
Hey, we got to go out to break, John. Sorry to interrupt you, but continue to answer that
on the other side of this break. And thank you for your call, Mark. We will be right
back with John's answer to the inconsistencies in the shootings that continue to happen as
a pretext for gun control in America. Stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show. We'll
be right back.

Alright, in the next hour, by the way, Aaron Dykes is going to be taking over the broadcast
at the bottom of the hour and covering some historical quotes on the Second Amendment
and really breaking down where the Second Amendment comes from and why it is merely
a confirmation of a sacred right that we're born with. A birthright, in other words, and
he's going to have a very interesting collection of quotes of both patriots as well as historical
gun grabbers such as Stalin. Well, they love guns too. They just love them in their own
hands, not in the hands of the actual people.
In any case, we are taking calls right now with John Rappaport, the author of a wonderful
new article that's posted up on Infowars.com right now that talks about psychiatry becoming
the new police, where this national prescription drug database that we've now confirmed exists
could be used to deny you the right to own a firearm or even other rights, perhaps the
right to free speech, perhaps the right to have a website if you're on antidepressants
or other drugs.
So this could be used against you in the days and months ahead. John, welcome back to the
show. Do you want to continue with that question that was posed right before the break?
Yeah, this has to do with this boggling coincidence in heavy quotes in the movie The Dark Knight
Rises, where Commissioner Gordon, the character, is pointing to a map that says Sandy Hook
and big letters on it. You can't see anything else on the map. You can't read anything else.
And he's pointing to that talking about an attack. So, you know, this is just one of
a list of boggling quote coincidences tied to the Sandy Hook murders that I wrote about.
Well this morning, I come across a piece, and it looks solid to me so far, that the
property master on the film The Dark Knight Rises, the guy responsible for all the props,
like maps and so forth, and bringing them in.
Yeah.
A guy named Scott Getsinger died in an auto accident in April of 2012, several months
before, you know, Sandy Hook and so forth. And he died in a mysterious auto accident
in Newtown, Connecticut.
No way.
Right?
All right, so I understand that's still preliminary. You're going to check it out some more.
Yeah, but I mean, I saw the article in a Newtown, I mean a Connecticut paper, that said he died
in April of 2012 in the accident, gave his name, said he was the property master on The
Dark Knight Rises. This wasn't, I mean, it was just a regular local newspaper.
Yeah, here's the story. It's up on screen here, that Scott Getsinger was killed Friday
night in a head-on collision in Stamford, Connecticut, when his truck was struck by
a car. His credits include The Dark Knight Rises.
Property master, yeah.
And Men in Black.
And Men in Black, and many other movies.
Wow.
Okay, so I'm just adding that to the boggling, you know, list of coincidences here.
Well, I know the map you're talking about, the Batman map, the Gotham City map that has
Sandy Hook on it. I remember seeing that map, and it actually has circled in red the area
on the map that is that school. And that it has written in red something like the first
strike point or something, right?
Strike zone one.
Yeah, strike zone one, pointing to the school.
Yeah, I mean, so people say, well, this is just obviously an accident. I mean, it couldn't
be anything more than that. But you keep piling these up, and you get storyline that is just,
I mean, boggles your mind, right? And as you wrote in your article, Mike, you know, if
somebody had said 15, 20 years ago, guess what? We're going to have airports where we're
going to have basically cops strip-searching you and examining your orifices.
Yeah, we're going to go to break again, John.
How boggling is this?
Well, I hate to interrupt such a fascinating sentence, but we'll be right back after this
break. Stay with us, John. We'll continue on the Alex Jones Show.

GCN Radio Network. Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
Well so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas,
Alex Jones. Welcome to the third hour of this broadcast today on Monday, January 7th, 2013.
This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex Jones, who is on an airplane right
now headed to New York to appear on mainstream media today. And John Rappaport is our guest
right now. And if you're just joining us, Alex Jones was nearly arrested this morning
at the Austin airport after being threatened, threatened with arrest by some TSA goons there
who demanded that he take off his shoes.
They knew him by name. They approached him by name, said, hi, Alex, take your shoes off.
And I have now been informed of the reason why. Alex was hiding in his shoes the Dianne
Feinstein sock puppet. And here it is. We have a copy of the Dianne Feinstein sock puppet
right here in studio today. And let's see what Dianne Feinstein has to say on camera.
I'm gonna raid your homes and throw flashbangs and take your guns. Yeah, yeah. All right,
sorry, John, you didn't get a chance to see that, but we actually do have a Feinstein
sock puppet. And she's quite animated.
Alex told me he was gonna take that inside his shoes, you know.
That's the secret weapon, comedy.
That is the secret weapon.
He was hiding comedy in his shoes.
Well, that's a crime. You can't do that. Everything that you're talking about, Mike, especially
with what's happening here with Alex, imagine this now up in the future. You go to fly,
and they type in your name, and they get that medical drug database that you were talking
about.
Right.
They say, okay, here is so-and-so. Let me see, he's taking pro sex. Well, he's a mental
case. So we have to be very careful about this guy. We have to, you know, please take
him in a room. We have to ask him questions, examine him, look at his papers. You know,
because now with all these databases connected, whether it's, you know, about gun ownership,
about medications, psychiatric meds, and so forth, they're just constructing one gigantic
database.
So at the airport-
Oh, yeah.
For any travel checkpoint, they will be able to completely profile you in many ways that
you don't even imagine, and then decide whether or not you can travel.
Well, no, let me tell you, this is a true story. James Stewart, the raw milkman from
California, they profiled him. They had him flagged in the California database as a quote
sovereign. And this is a new checkbox they have for criminals, so-called criminals. You
know, this guy, all he did is distribute milk and cheese that the state didn't like.
And so they flagged him with the word sovereign. And then when they booked him into LA County
Jail, he said one of the booking guard staff members there looked up from his computer,
backed away from his desk, and said, my God, you attack guards. And so just being flagged
as a sovereign now, and then they bound him with chains on his feet and his arms, and
they put him in an isolation room, a very cold room, no light, you know, very cold hypothermia
almost.
And then he got away from that starvation. I mean, they can flag you with anything now,
John, and then treat you worse than you'd be treated in a third world country.
Absolutely. So if they see, okay, this guy's taking psychiatric drugs, whatever, okay,
let's not let him fly. Or let's arrest him if he causes any trouble or objects to what
we're doing to him. Let's provoke him, in other words, and see how he reacts. And then
we'll put him in lockup because he's a psychiatric patient. I mean, all of these things can be
manipulated any way they want to manipulate it.
And when they say the word sovereign, which is now a code word for them for terrorism,
all they're really saying is this is an independent mind.
Yeah, right, right.
So we have to kill that off cuz that's the biggest threat to the country.
Diane Feinstein wants to say something else, the sock puppet. Mr. and Mrs. America, we're
gonna profile your prescription drugs and use it to take away your rights.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Has she, by the way, given up her security guards with guns?
No, no, they're all armed and they're probably all on psych drugs as well. By the way, we're
gonna take calls when we come back. So Lori, Bill, Jason, Nick, Greg, and others, stay
with us.
We'll take calls when we come back in the next segment with John Rappaport. Stay with
us here on the Alex Jones Show. We'll be right back and we'll get more serious when we get
back. Enough of these Feinstein sock puppets, okay? Get them out of here. All right, we'll
be back.

We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
All right, we're continuing on the Alex Jones show. This is Mike Adams, the health ranger
editor of naturalnews.com joined by John Rapoport, our guest right now from nomorefakenews.com
and we're taking calls from people on all the issues of the day, including Alex Jones
almost being arrested this morning at the Austin airport as a TSA tyrant demanded that
he take off his shoes because I guess shoes are just too much for the globalist to bear.
You can't have shoes, John. Did you know that? Not only can you not have guns, but you can't
have shoes because they need to have the exclusive right to stomp on you with their boots. So
you can't have shoes. Does that make any sense to you? That's right. Yeah, it makes perfect
sense to me if the world is completely insane. Yeah. And apparently it is. Are you up for
taking calls or you got a comment? Yeah, let's go. All right, let's go to Lori in West Virginia.
Lori, welcome to the show. Thanks for joining us. What's on your mind? Hey Mike, it's John.
I'm calling in because I'm part of a farm extension. Well, I'm a member of the farm
extension and we were trying to start a program for the farm to schools. Have you heard of
that? Not in West Virginia. I mean, just generally speaking, I've heard of those kinds of programs.
Okay, they're trying to take where we supply those small local farmers to the school kids.
Well, when it first started and we had our meeting, a representative from the school,
the purchaser, she brought her little price list of what she's paying the big shipping
companies for food. And on there at first, the price list seemed like, okay, we could
do this. We can afford to do this. It's not going to be that great big profit, but we
can do this. And then we had another meeting four months later and just like in the first
meeting, a dozen of eggs was going for $3 for them. But the second meeting, now they're
paying $1 for it. And yeah, and the whole price list went down like that.
So it's kind of like they're trying to bankrupt the local farms then?
Yeah, that's what it sounds like. A lot longer than we can. And then everybody
got discouraged and said, well, we can't do this. Well, anyway, another reason why I'm
calling is because in the newspaper yesterday here at the Charleston Gazette Mail, they
have an article that says the FDA proposes sweeping new food safety rules for outbreak.
And in the article, it says that it's going to cost farmers $30,000 a year to implement
and food manufacturers $475 million annually to implement these programs.
Yep, it's true. Let's go to John on that with a comment. And thank you for your call,
Lori, and for your question. But John, this is a big epidemic year for the flu virus,
but it's hitting mostly those people who are vaccinated. That's the thing the CDC won't
admit. What do you think, man?
Well, sure. I mean, what better way to pump up an epidemic than to give people an unnecessary
and dangerous vaccine that actually causes what you're supposedly preventing.
Yes. And then you come in behind that and you say,
wow, we have a heavy epidemic year. So everybody's got to get vaccinated.
No, you nailed it. Vaccines are a medical false flag. They create the condition that
sells more vaccines that causes more of the condition that the CDC uses to declare a state
of emergency to sell more vaccines. It's a total false flag.
Total false flag, and fewer people are going for it, but there's still a lot of people
who are. What the caller was talking about is basically, look, if you're a gigantic Monsanto
and you control huge amounts of farmland through your genetically modified seeds and so forth
and it's all industrial farming and whatever, then we'll protect you from all of these unnecessary
expenses and regulations and so forth.
But if you're a small farmer, we're going to find a way to put you out of business because
we want to take your land and give it to the big corporations. I mean, that's what they're
doing in every way possible.
Well, that's what they're doing to Mark Baker, the guest we had in the first hour from bakersgreenacres.com.
Yeah, they're trying to put them out of business with an economic embargo by the USDA. Let's
go to another caller, Bill in California. Thanks for calling, Bill. You're on the air
with John Rappaport.
Well, thank you. My question for all of your viewers is how do the constitutional patriots
identify each other? After all, not all-
It's a secret handshake.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.
No, not all police, not all soldiers are going to want to be on the gun grabbing, but we
need to know how we can identify each other.
Yeah, that's a really good question. Of course, there's the obvious way to wear an Infowars
shirt or something or a hat, but I think what you mean is, yeah, there they are, infowarsstore.com.
You can get some good patriot gear, including and the TSA t-shirt. Wonderful. Good timing
for today. But to answer your question, sir, I don't think there's any covert system that's
known. What do you think, John?
No, unfortunately, I mean, the whole idea of being a patriot to the founding principles
of the republic is that you're out in the open about it.
Yeah.
I mean, that's the whole idea. The Bill of Rights means you don't have to hide in a closet.
So you find people, they find you. You decide whether you can trust them or not. You see
how much knowledge they have. Do they really understand what the basic principles of this
country are all about? And do they think they're important enough to live by and defend? I
mean, that's all I can say.
I think you're right. I think it just comes down to knowing your neighbors, knowing the
people in your community. And like you said, caller, most police officers and law enforcement
and soldiers, they are pro-constitution. They took an oath to it, unlike the TSA, which
never took any oath to anything, except maybe swearing to their paycheck.
All right, let's go to another caller, Nick in New York, it looks like. Nick, you're on
the air with John Rappaport and Mike Adams. Go ahead, sir.
Good afternoon to both of you gentlemen.
You as well. Thank you.
Yes, two quick things. First of all, Mike, the gentleman that you had on earlier when
you were speaking about the farm, the pigs and all that, my heart goes out to that to
that gentleman. I know she's probably still listening. My question is, is this how in
the world, how in the world or where in what rock are these judges going to hide under
if this whole thing implodes? And one of the main causes of this thing imploding is because
these judges are upholding illegal, illegal laws or face color, whatever they want to
call it. It's all color of law. It's all illegal. And what rock are they going to hide under?
Because these are the main perpetrators of the whole system falling in the direction.
So I mean-
Nick, you're right. You're right. I can only imagine that right now, people who are true
Americans are making lists, lists of traitors. And that list is getting larger by the day.
And it probably includes court judges who are openly violating the Constitution. I think
you're right. I think these lists are being made. What's going to happen to the list?
I don't know. Hopefully, it just means those people are voted out of office. In no way
am I condoning violence against those people. But at the very minimum, we should distribute
these lists and kick these people out of office, strip them of their power. Your comments,
John.
Yeah, well, they're publishing, aren't they, lists of gun owners and where they live and
their addresses and everything? I mean, to me, a court of law, the origin of the idea
was it's local. People are there. The citizens are there. You see a trial. You want justice.
The people have presumably some degree of common sense. And now we have this system
which is so remote, so complicated, so insane, that anybody with an agenda who has power
can decide a case any way they want to, really.
Well, and the courts were created so that people didn't have to settle things by shooting
each other.
Exactly.
But if the courts become so corrupt-
Yeah, exactly. The courts have become so corrupt.
That's how it leaves then, it seems like. What option is left? When justice is taken
from the people, what option do they have left?
Nullification.
Yeah.
Any follow-up comments, Nick?
Yeah, just one other thing. With regard to your other presentation, first of all, I want
to say that I completely support everything that you guys do and your arguments. It just
makes so much sense. And after being detoxified from all the fluoride, years of fluoride and
all that through the Infowars program, I can honestly say that my head's on straight.
My question is, with regards to these people, let's say, who you said a little while ago,
and I'm trying to understand your argument. You said that it's a violation if they come
after people who have prescription drugs or for depression, all kinds of stuff, and yet
they would be able to get guns and stuff like that. But isn't that the case with this kid
who went out and did this horrific thing over in Connecticut, where he was on drugs and
then he got into his mother's case, and she had legal firearms.
So my question, how do we reconcile the two? Because the other side of the argument is,
well, if you're on drugs, you shouldn't be able to get-
No, no, you're exactly right about that point. And I want your comments, John, but let me
throw mine in first. I agree that people who are undergoing psychiatric care should not
be allowed to purchase firearms.
But the problem is, and this answers your question, caller, is how wide are they going
to cast that net? Are they going to say one person who had one bottle of antidepressants
at some point 10 years ago, they're denied the right. Or are they going to limit it just
to the true psychopaths, devil worshiping, drug taking, whatever. That's who we have
to limit it to. But I don't know the right answer. What are your thoughts, John?
Yeah, it's a tough issue because look, on the one side, you've got psychiatry which
wants to bring millions and millions more people into the system where they can drug
them and so on. And so as that list expands, then they can say, well, all these people
can't have guns because that satisfies the gun control agenda at the same time. So the
ultimate solution from the medical point of view, to me, is you ban the drugs.
You destroy that industry. You expose it completely and you alert all citizens everywhere to never
let their children see a psychiatrist. Never let them take one of these psychiatric drugs.
Never get on one of those lists and just completely destroy that criminal poisoning industry altogether.
This is a better solution. Sorry to interrupt you, John. We're about to go to break. But
yeah, to the caller, you're right, John. If we gave these children fish oil supplements
or omega-3 fatty acids or trace minerals, all those things are crucial for healthy mind
function. If we gave them those instead of the drugs, then they wouldn't be psychopaths.
They wouldn't be devil worshippers, probably, because their heads would be on straight.
Nutrition has a role in all of this. If you don't talk about nutrition, you aren't talking
about the real cause of violence in America. Most people in the prisons have nutritional
deficiencies. We'll be right back after this break.

Injuries, slow healing, aches and pains, constipation, weakness, fatigue are all common the older
one gets. The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the
older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention
to nutrition. If the Hanselman can play rugby in their 90s, then it is possible for everyone
in North America to experience a more youthful life as well. One key ingredient to warding
off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed. All
protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged, destroying 50-75%
of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids. One World Whey is not heat damaged
and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids. This feat no one else has achieved.

Making the right decisions is a challenge to investors. Are we going to see economic
growth, slide into a recession or at worst depression? Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety

are turning toward gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.

All right, the caller from the last segment brought up a really good point and a good
question. He said, shouldn't we deny people who are on psychiatric meds the right to own
the firearms? And Rappaport and I both agree that we don't want firearms in the hands of
medicated psychos, but that the real answer is to just stop medicating our children and
put them on nutrition instead of psychiatric drugs.
That's the real answer here. Any more thoughts on that, John, before we go to the next call?
Yeah, that's the answer. The answer is looking at what creates health rather than what destroys
the brain.
Do you have a cough today, John? You got a little cough going on?
I do indeed.
Oh, man. Did you forget your vitamin D or something?
Actually, I've been taking it, but I don't know what's going on. It's something in the
air and I have no idea what it is, but-
Well, it's probably the superbugs that the CDC is releasing to encourage more vaccinations.
Possibly, or maybe they're spraying today. I'm not sure, but I'm okay.
All right, good. Yeah, I know you're generally healthy. You'll be back on your feet in no
time, but yeah, good point. We got to keep these kids healthy instead of keeping them
medicated. Are you okay to take another call now?
Absolutely.
All right, let's go to Jason in Ohio. Jason, thank you for your call. You're on the air
on the Alex Jones show. Go ahead, sir.
Hi, John and Mike. How are you doing today?
Doing good.
All right.
My question is, man, I kind of had the same question that the other guy asked. I mean,
kind of relevant to the same deal on the energy.
Hey, Jason, your phone is really not working. I'm sorry. I'm going to have to let you go.
I apologize, but it was breaking up there. Let's go to Thomas in Texas. Thomas, you're
on the air. Go ahead.
How are you guys doing today?
Hey, doing good.
All right.
I just want to say that I can definitely agree with the genetically modified foods, how it
is having an effect on the brain as far as, and the drugs and everything, how it's having
an effect on the brain as well. But I think that we're kind of overlooking at the same
time, the evil and the darkness that kind of became over the world, as well as like
the United States as a whole. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah. You mean like this demonic influx of energy that a lot of these kids seem to be
attached to? Is that what you're talking about?
Exactly. Exactly. Especially just throughout the years with all the terrorist attack, and
then you relate back to the movies. And it shows before these incidents happened, boom,
it was seen in a movie preview or something. And it's like, bam, it's happening. I think
we got to start getting healthier, start cleaning our minds, start just cleaning up things period
in this country.
We need some exorcisms is what we need around the country.
I do, really.
Go ahead, John. Good question, caller. Good question. Go ahead, John. What are your thoughts
on it?
I see this all the time when I force myself to go to the movies, which is less and less.
You know, these films, for example, that are all about disasters, dystopian futures, horrible
things going on. It used to be that when you saw movies where there were superheroes and
so forth, the general impression was the good guy won. It was very kind of uplifting in
a certain kind of way. And then gradually we saw this whole thing darken, where it doesn't
really matter anymore in these movies who wins. Because the whole overall mood is evil,
dark, gloom, disaster, diabolical forces at work.
Oh, and it's cool. It's cool, right? The kids are taught that worshipping the devil is cool
or being an agent of darkness is hip or whatever.
Exactly.
It's pretty safe.
You're just programming. It's another way, along with the video games, of programming
these kids' minds to accept the general darkness over everything and then to proceed from there.
Well, what's going to happen?
Well, I think-
I'll tell you what.
I think the caller is hinting at this combination. You take someone who's a devil worshipper,
like Adam Lanza reportedly was, you put them on psychiatric drugs, you put them on violent
video games and slashers and so on. This combination creates a monster. And then they go steal
someone's gun and use it to kill children.
But the gun is not the origin of the problem. The origin is all these other things that
haven't been addressed and that they refuse to talk about. John, I got to let you go.
We got to go to break, but it's been fun chatting with you today.

The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are back at info wars.com. I'm Aaron Dykes. I'm sitting in
Alex's of course on his way possibly already arriving in New York to appear on Piers Morgan
tonight on the CNN program, obviously to discuss the second amendment. If you want to tune
into that, it's going to be 8pm Central, 9pm Eastern Time. Other time zones you figure
it out. But that should definitely be interesting. Now something I want to talk about today is
what is the second amendment? I realize I'm preaching to the choir regarding most of our
audience and many of them probably know a lot more about it than I do.
But I know this much. You can't repeal the second amendment. You can't infringe on it
through legislation. Congress, the president can't just decide to suspend it. And there
are many fold reasons for that. They are philosophical and they are grounded in history and common
sense. And I just want to talk about some of that because that is a God given right.
What is a God given right? It means that man cannot be the arbiter of whether or not you
have a right on any given day under any given climate. Now here's from the 10th amendment
center. Repeal of the second amendment would not abolish any right.
And they bring up of course the many so called news articles and letters to the editor that
are calling for a repeal of the second amendment. You've seen many of them. These individuals
believe that a right to own a firearm is based upon the second amendment and the right will
magically vanish if the amendment can be repealed.
Of course, the Bill of Rights came up after the Constitution. They were proposed starting
in 1787 and added by demand then ratified by the states by 1791. By demand, many of
the states, many of the founding fathers would not approve the Constitution, would not ratify
it, would not sign off on it until the Bill of Rights were added to guarantee our individual
rights, to guarantee the rights of the state.
They are of the utmost importance. And if you infringe on the second amendment, you're
infringing on all of them. No one is going to stand for this, ladies and gentlemen. And
the people in power know it, but we just want to put them on notice. Now they bring up this
very important point. The modern additions of the Bill of Rights typically don't contain
the very important preamble, the paragraph preceding the listing of the first ten Bill
of Rights.
And there's generally a pretty good reason for that. I'm gonna read that to you right
now. Again, from the preamble to the Bill of Rights, which itself is in addition to
the Constitution. The first paragraph to that preamble after announcing how it's from the
Congress of the United States begun and held in the city of New York on Wednesday, the
4th of March 1789 reads, the conventions of a number of the states having at the time
of their adopting the Constitution expressed a desire in order to prevent the misconstruction
or abuse of its powers that further declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added.
And as extending the ground of public confidence in the government will best ensure the beneficent
ends of its institution. This, ladies and gentlemen, points out that the Bill of Rights
was specifically added to acquiesce the demands of founding fathers who didn't wanna see their
new government destroyed by people greedy for power, people who would use loopholes
in the Constitution to concentrate and exploit the populations.
In other words, among the other rights listed in the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment
shall not be infringed. Well, one good reason why is that armed citizens make good government.
Now I'm gonna read a number of quotes that refute these terrible ideas we've seen in
the press from all kinds of hacks. One of the most extreme was in Vanity Fair last week
from Kurt Eichenwald, whose headline was, let's repeal the Second Amendment.
He wants to replace it with this clause. The people retain the right to keep and bear arms
subject to reasonable restrictions deemed necessary by the Congress and the President
to secure the lives and well-being of others. Now this sounds similar enough to the right
to keep and bear arms, and yet it completely is not. Notice again the language of this
proposed hack writer from Vanity Fair.
The people retain the right to keep and bear arms, sounds good so far. But subject to reasonable
restrictions deemed necessary by the Congress and the President to secure the lives and
well-being of others. Reasonable restrictions means that the idea is you have no right at
all.
But the fact is, even if you did outright repeal the Second Amendment and replace it
with legalese lawyer language, you still can't legally suspend the Second Amendment cuz it's
a God-given right. They talked as far back as Dante's Inferno, that even if you don't
agree that there is a God or who is God or what God would want, in absentia, in absence,
you should still throw to the higher powers rather than let man dictate what your rights
are.
And that's really what America is all about. Here's this caption right here, rights are
not gifts from government. And now I'm gonna move on to a number of Founding Father quotes
that point out this point. Now the Founding Fathers never agreed on much of anything.
There were different factions who fought vehemently over how centralized their government should
be, how much power should remain with the states, all kinds of other clauses. To what
degree should we let bankers have power? What should the currency be? But I have yet to
find any Founding Father, I'd love to get emails on it, any Founding Father at all,
no matter how reprehensible they are individually, who is against the right to keep and bear
arms.
They all seem to have backed it. Now here is Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, who
upheld very early on the right to keep and bear arms. Quote, the right of citizens to
keep and bear arms has been justly considered as the palladium of the liberties of the Republic,
since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of the
rulers.
It will generally, even if they are successful in the first instance, enable the people to
resist and triumph over them. It's to restrict the arbitrary power of the rulers, never forget
that. George Washington said firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself.
They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence. Now let's
juxtapose these with just a few quotes from the modern 20th century dictators.
Joseph Stalin said one death is a tragedy, one million is a statistic. An anonymous American
adage reads, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Samuel Adams said the Constitution
shall never be construed to authorize Congress to prevent the people of the United States
who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own arms, shall not be construed, shall not
infringe.
Now this is a key quote right here. Tench Cox, he's not that well known of a founding
father, but he was a federalist from Pennsylvania. In 1788, he said, who are the militia? Are
they not ourselves? Is it fear then that we shall turn over our arms, each man against
his own bosom? Congress have no power to disarm the militia, their swords and every other
terrible implement of the soldier are the birthright of an American.
Now there's all this legalese debate over the Second Amendment and the wording having
to do with the militia. Who are the militia? Again from this founding father Tench Cox,
who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? They certainly are. Now James Madison said
the Constitution preserves the advantage of being armed which Americans possess over the
people of almost every other nation where the governments are afraid to trust their
people with arms.
President Stalin on the other hand said ideas are more powerful than guns. We would not
let our enemies have guns. Why should we let them have ideas? Zbigniew Brzezinski said
quite recently, in earlier times it was easier to control 1 million people than to physically
kill 1 million people. Today it's infinitely easier to kill 1 million people than to control
them.
And of course, through democide, government sanctioned murder, government is the number
one non natural cause of death throughout history, particularly in the 20th century.
Joseph Stalin said death solves all problems, no man, no problem. He also said the only
real power comes out of a long rifle. Alexander Hamilton who I'm critical of for his banking
stances even upholds the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment. The best we can hope for
concerning the people at large is that they be properly armed.
Then you've got things like the Nazi law from 1938. Those now possessing weapons and ammunition
are at once to turn them over to local police authority. Firearms and ammunition found in
a Jew's possession will be forfeited to the government without compensation. Whoever willfully
or negligently violates the provisions will be punished with imprisonment and a fine.
We know where things went in Nazi Germany, of course. Thomas Paine, arms discourage and
keep the invader and plunder and all and preserve order in the world as well as property. Horrible
mischief would ensue where law abiding, deprived of the use of them. It is the duty of the
patriot to protect his country from its government, Thomas Paine also said.
And Thomas Jefferson said quite famously, when governments fear the people, there's
liberty. When the people fear the government, there's tyranny. The strongest reason for
the people to retain the right and keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves
against tyranny in government. Again, it has nothing to do about hunting, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm just trying to point out how together the founding fathers were on the right of
the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. Benjamin Franklin sort of foretold this common
era of communism, where one of the big slogans, whether it's Mao or Stalin is turn your sword
into a plowshare and basically be a slave to the government.
Ben Franklin said those who beat their swords into plowshares usually end up plowing for
those who didn't. Those who didn't turn in their swords, their arms, their guns, whatever.
To disarm the people is the best and most effective way to enslave them. That's the
founding father, George Mason, one of the individuals most responsible for getting the
Bill of Rights instituted in the first place. Compared to disarm the people is the best
and most effective way to enslave them with what Joseph Stalin said, if the opposition
disarms well and good, if it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.
What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time
that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms, Thomas Jefferson. A free
people ought not to be armed discipline, not only to be armed discipline, but they should
have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might
attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government, George Washington.
Now, Patrick Henry is another person who was individually greatly responsible for demanding
and eventually getting the Bill of Rights to preserve the rights of the people and the
states. He said, quote, guard with jealous attention the public liberty, guard it. Suspect
everyone who approaches that jewel.
Unfortunately, nothing will preserve it but downright force. Whenever you give up that
force you are ruined. The great object is that every man be armed. Everyone who is able
might have a gun. Are we at last brought to such a humiliating and debasing degradation
that we cannot be trusted with arms for our own defense?
It's also Patrick Henry. And here's another Alexander Hamilton. If the representatives
of the people betray their constituents, then there is no recourse left. But in the exertion
of that original right of self-defense, which is paramount to all positive forms of government.
First Alexander Hamilton and the Federalists, number 28. The supreme power in America cannot
enforce unjust laws by the sword because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute
a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be or on any pretense raised in America.
That's Noah Webster in 1888, 1787. I'm sorry, 1787. And the whole point is they want to
disarm us because they want to institute unconstitutional arbitrary rule. They want dictatorships, whether
it comes in an overt form that looks like Joseph Stalin or a friendly form where they
continue to rotate presidents.
Thomas Jefferson said a free people claim their right is derived from the laws of nature
and not as a gift of their chief magistrate. 1774, the balance of power is the scale of
peace. The same balance would be preserved for all the world destitute of arms for all
would be alike.
But since some will not, others dare not lay them aside. And while a single nation refuses
to lay them down, it's proper that all should keep them up. Hard mischief would ensue where
one half of the world deprived of the use of them. Thomas Paine, 1775. Mao Zedong, 1938.
Chairman Mao, political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. He said the people must
understand this for the revolution, the great revolution of China to take place. To preserve
liberty, it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be taught
alike, especially when young how to use them.
Richard Henry Lee, 1778. The right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against
arbitrary government. One more safeguard against the tyranny, which now appears remote in America,
which historically has proved to be always possible. That's from 1960, Hubert Humphrey,
a little bit unexpected but nonetheless right on the money.
Adolf Hitler, of course, said or is quoted to have said in 1942, the most foolish mistake
we could possibly make would be to allow the subject races to possess arms. History shows
that all conquerors who have allowed their subject races to carry arms have prepared
their own downfall by doing so.
Why would a dictator not want an armed population so he can run roughshod over them, so he can
try to rule them? Orrin Hatch, still in the Senate or maybe just possibly just retired.
If guns in fact, if gun laws in fact work, the sponsors of this type of legislation should
have no difficulty drawing upon long list of examples of crime rates reduced by such
legislation that they cannot do so after a century and a half of trying.
That they must sweep under the rug the southern attempts at gun control in 1870 to 1910 period,
the northeastern attempts of the 1920 to 1939 period. The attempts at both federal and state
levels through 1965 and 1976 establishes the repeated, complete and inevitable failure
of gun laws to control serious crimes.
And again, the Columbine school shootings happened during the assault weapons ban under
Clinton. All these school shootings have taken a rise ever since they signed the gun free
school zones. And ever since all these people have been on medications, SSRIs. William Burroughs
in 1991, the author said after a shooting spree, they always want to take the guns away
from people who didn't do it.
I sure as hell wouldn't want to live in a society where the only people allowed guns
are the police and military. George Washington said the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere
and everywhere restrains evil interference. They deserve a place of honor with all that's
good. And the Second Amendment itself of course reads, a well regulated militia being necessary
to the security of a free state.
The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Now the choice is
clear here, folks. It's freedom or tyranny. Disarmament is tyranny. It's a recipe for
enslavement. If we want to uphold the rest of our freedoms, we have to stand by the Second
Amendment. Even if you individually personally don't like guns, aren't comfortable around
them.
You should get guns and train them and learn how to use them safely so that bad things
don't happen. And so there's a buffer against intruders, against robbers, and against government
itself, which is very quickly becoming more tyrannical by the day. Of course, this has
nothing to do with just Obama. This has been going on through Bush. It's been going on
ever since 9-11 through the Patriot Act.
It's been going on through Clinton who put in the assault weapons ban. It's been going
on through government, through Reagan who was going to scale down government even though
government grew two or three fold times under his watch. It's been going on under Carter
and under Ford and under Nixon. And for a long time, if nothing else since the assassination
of JFK, it's really been going on since the time that Harry Truman seceded FDR after he
took a broad executive power.
And claimed that the buck stopped with him, the president, even though a shadow government
was emerging under the 1947 National Security Act. And we've been in dire straits ever since.
Do not give up your arms, people. Government democide and disarmament are the greatest
threats of violence. That is a study academically at the University of Hawaii. We've communicated
with RJ Rummel and we're looking to get an interview with him in the future.
He's the one who's compiled statistics on more than 262 million deaths at the hands
of government just in the 20th century alone. Mike Adams has wrote about it. Our writers
at InfoWars have wrote about it. And it's something we better pay close attention to.
We'll be back after this with a few more thoughts. But just remember, folks, the Second Amendment,
the right to bear arms is a guarantee. It's a God-given right. It can't be given by men
or taken away legitimately. InfoWars.com. Tune in to Piers Morgan tonight. Alex is going
to take him on and explain what the Second Amendment's really all about. Stay tuned.

It's the only one you've got. Ladies and gentlemen, the Second Amendment
is in place to restrict tyranny. It's not about offensive action. It's not about enabling
murders to kill more people. It's about the tendency of mankind individually and as groups
to be corrupt. It's a tendency for mankind to want power, to want to hold on to power
and then to crave more power because something inherent in us is wicked.
There's of course a lot of good as well. And the whole point that our founding fathers
saw, many of them were corrupt individuals themselves. Many of them were very good and
brilliant people was to balance that power because anyone given too much power will become
corrupt. There's that old adage, I forget the name of the guy off the top of my head,
but power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
And absolutely that's a theme throughout history. That's why the Obama administration wants
to see the assault rifle ban renewed, but even that's not good enough for them. So they
want thumbprinting and registration and closing the gun show loopholes, but that's not enough
either.
So they're going to take executive action and use new ATF policies and Joe Biden's gun
panel to figure out what they can do outside of law, outside of Congress, not waiting on
even that body to legislate against the Second Amendment. Again, you can't legislate against
the Second Amendment, even if all of Congress and the President were unanimously in favor
of scrapping the whole ordeal and completely disarming, that's an illegitimate law.
First of all, they took an oath to uphold the Constitution and fight off all enemies,
foreign and domestic, to that Constitution. Not to whoever's in charge, not to whoever
has the reins of power during that season or that moment in time, but to the Constitution
and Bill of Rights upholding and enshrining our individual rights and trying to maintain
a balance of power so that nobody gets too much.
Now the entire American Revolution was based on many things, of course, but it was sparked
specifically by an attempt at disarmament at Lexington and Concord on April 19th, 1775.
That's over a year before July 4th, by the way. And I think really that's probably why
they chose April 19th as a favorite false flag date for Waco, for Oklahoma City, to
kind of send the message that maybe patriots, armed patriots are somehow the enemy in this
country.
But then there's that little wink of the eye, that underlying message that government has
come to try to disarm you on April 19th, as it seemingly always does. Now here's a letter
dated April 18th from Thomas Gage of the British military to Lieutenant Colonel Smith, 10th
Regiment on foot. Sir, having received intelligence that a quantity of ammunition provisions,
artillery, tents, and small arms has been collected at Concord for a valid purpose of
raising and supporting a rebellion against his majesty, you will march with me to the
core of grenadiers and light infantry.
Put under your command with the utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord, where you will seize
and destroy all artillery, ammunition, provisions, tents, small arms, and all military stores,
whatever. But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or
hurt private property. You have a draft of Concord, on which is marked the houses, barns,
etc, which contain the above military stores.
You will order of Trunian to be knocked off each gun. But if it is found impractical on
any, they must be spiked and the carriages destroyed. The powder and flour must be shook
out of all the barrels into the river. The tents burnt, the pork and beef destroyed in
the best way you can devise. And the men may put balls of lead into their pockets, throwing
them by degrees into ponds, ditches, etc. But no quantity together so that they may
be recovered afterwards.
If you meet any brass or artillery, and it goes on from there, that letter, that action
of disarmament sparked the American Revolution, because you should not try to disarm the militia.
They are legitimate people armed to restrict an overreach of power. There are many other
abuses, of course, and we must keep that in mind.
Tyranical government is not welcome in the United States. Let's never give in. Let's
defend the Second Amendment. Alex Jones, CNN, Piers Morgan, tonight, 8 p.m. Central. Nightly
news tonight. We'll cover the TSA.
