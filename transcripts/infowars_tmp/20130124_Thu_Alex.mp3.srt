1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,720
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:37,520
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the 24th day

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,240
of January 2013 transmission. Feinstein had published on her Senate website a month ago

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,720
or more the bill and people said there's no way she's actually gonna introduce this. They'd

6
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,480
introduced copycats of her bill, so technically she hadn't introduced it a few weeks ago.

7
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,200
But it was the same bill introduced by others, which they may try to sneak through when people

8
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,780
target her bill. But she has now officially today introduced it, had the press conference,

9
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,200
we watched it. We're dumping down the full video clip right now so we can play clips

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
later.

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,760
She just concluded about, I don't know, an hour ago or so. Here's some of the headlines

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,880
that are up at drudgereport.com. We're also getting some of this news over to infowars.com

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,080
and prisonplanet.com. In fact, can you guys punch up Drudge for me? Fantastic, let me

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,040
punch that up then so folks can get that.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:40,600
Or you can punch it up in there. Dems target 150 weapons, seek national registry. So they

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,120
wanna ban 150 handguns, rifles, they admit they're targeting everything. And the purpose

17
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,480
is to dry up the supply of these weapons over time. So there you go, outright move to ban

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
them over time, at least at admission.

19
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,440
Feinstein got special permission to display guns in DC, cuz he's trying to take them from

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,880
the rest of the country. And NRA boycott kills nation's largest outdoor show that had been

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,960
going along with the gun grabbing. And that's the way to handle these people. You've gotta

22
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,040
start boycotting Time Warner, because they're not letting gun ads for gun shops run on any

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
other systems.

24
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,840
While they put out some of those violent movies out there like the new movie coming out, Bullet

25
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,680
to the Head with foe tough guy, Sylvester Stallone. I shouldn't say foe tough guy, I

26
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,460
don't know if he's a tough guy or not. The point is, is that in the movies, his movies

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,300
are ridiculous and just totally unrealistic, but that's a side issue.

28
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,520
Guns ban targets, handguns and rifles, and that is in her official bill. Yeah, no, no,

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,560
it goes after shotguns that are pump, that hold four rounds. I mean, it just goes after

30
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,260
everything. In fact, it's worse than the original bill that she put up on her Senate website.

31
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:03,400
It's worse than the bill she introduced in 1993. It is unprecedented, and remember what

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
happened yesterday.

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,320
In fact, I'm gonna re-pull that article out of yesterday's stack, cuz I didn't get to

34
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,400
it properly. Kurt Nemo wrote about it and linked to the Australian newspapers. They've

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,640
banned everything down to bolt action and single shot, and now they want those bans

36
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,680
saying you have no reason to have these.

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,440
So first they take the full auto, then they take the semi-auto. Come on, none of us wanna

38
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,360
take your guns, just turn in the semi-auto and we'll leave your other guns alone. And

39
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,320
then they ban, of course, those. So that is now happening saying, hey, you could have

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,360
a school shooting with a bolt action.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,200
Well, yeah, and a meteorite could hit a school, or a 747 could crash in a school, or a school

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,000
teacher could molest children, as we see more news out today. Does that mean you're gonna

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,400
ban school teachers? We're not all collectively guilty because you've got a bunch of wound

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,540
up Prozac heads out there and people with all sorts of neurological disorders from vaccine

45
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,680
damage more and more being linked to an upsurge in mental illness.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,600
But overall crime is dropping because gun ownership is up. And we did file the statistics

47
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:11,700
from FBI.gov, locally compiled, 49% in the last 20 years in overall violent crime dropping.

48
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,240
Gun violence is actually even higher, it was better than I even said. So I was just looking

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:21,200
at the basic numbers and dead reckoning them, they're very complex. And 21% as I dead reckoned

50
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,680
that was accurate since 2007.

51
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,080
So the the drop in crime is accelerating, accelerating. That's violent crime and crime

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,200
with guns. People robbing your house when you're not there, people busting out your

53
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,400
windows robbing your stereo, people stealing bikes out of your yard, petty stuff where

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,360
they don't get their butt shot off.

55
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,200
That is increasing dramatically. All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,

56
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,440
on the other side of this quick break. Stay with us, big transmission, Piers Morgan's

78
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,120
lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The

79
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,760
globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

80
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,900
to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness

89
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:30,720
information war, it's Alex Jones. Well, the Republican establishment is starting to wake

90
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:42,800
up and realize what is happening in this society. In fact, Rush Limbaugh has come out and pointed

91
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,640
out that Obama is trying to cause culture wars, financial wars, and race wars. And that's

92
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,360
exactly what Obama is trying to do.

93
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,320
And if constitutionalist, if libertarians, if liberals, if conservatives, if whatever

94
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:07,160
you call yourself, if you wanna have a free and open and happy, successful society, then

95
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:15,680
you desperately need to understand we have diabolical people in control of our country.

96
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,260
And not coming at it from the understanding that these are larcenous individuals that

97
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:28,520
wanna bankrupt the nation and domesticate the population, collectivize the population.

98
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:34,120
And then say that anyone, I mean, I have a Daily Beast article here, Piers pressure is

99
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,440
what it's called, where they admit, yeah, we're going under global government, we're

100
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
going under globalism, and it's good to put it in our face that the communist Chinese

101
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,420
are telling us what to do.

102
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,040
And it's good that our debt is owned by foreigners and it's good that Piers Morgan's a foreigner

103
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,440
and let Alex Jones try to fight us, we're gonna deal with him. And I read the quotes

104
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,840
yesterday and they went on to say, it's not just gonna be the blacks and browns against

105
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,520
the whites, it's not just gonna be the women against the whites, it's gonna be the government

106
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,840
and it's gonna be foreign governments helping us.

107
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,040
And it's like the weatherman wrote it or something, those weatherman testimonies that came out,

108
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,240
we played the video clips here that came out in the trials about how they would use foreign

109
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,160
governments to come in and use ethnic uprisings to bring in a communist state in America.

110
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,160
And even I have trouble believing they're actually trying this. And again, the public

111
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,600
is so dumbed down out there generally, politically correct, whites, you name it, that even when

112
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,360
they're on MSNBC saying we've got to deal with white people.

113
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:47,660
And even when we see moves out there by people like Rangel saying, we've got to overcome

114
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,080
the Constitution, that's a quote, we've got the video, you've seen it, posted it on Infowars.com

115
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:59,800
two days ago. We've got to overcome the Constitution, we've got to overcome Southerners. Now again,

116
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,520
that's more divide and conquer, play the North off against the South.

117
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:09,560
They're trying to re-upload the 1860s and Obama used to be Abraham Lincoln. And that's

118
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,520
why they say, you don't like socialist healthcare, you're a racist. That's why they come out

119
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,080
and say, you won't turn your guns and you're a racist. What does that have to do with race?

120
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,880
They go, shut up, racist. And again, there are black people all over this country that

121
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,360
have guns to protect themselves. There are people in California, there are people in

122
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,800
Michigan, there are people in Florida, I mean, people are people.

123
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,520
And gun crimes, crimes using guns has gone way down, it's the FBI's numbers. Overall

124
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:43,120
violent crime in the last 20 years, 49%, we showed you those numbers yesterday from FBI.gov

125
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,120
and have a video posted at infowars.com for radio listeners, you can go watch it right

126
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
now.

127
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,360
They are desperate to cover all this up and just get us all fighting with each other.

128
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,560
Women against the men, Hispanics against whites, whites against Hispanics, black against white,

129
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,440
white against black, Protestant against Catholic. While these mega banks, these globalists,

130
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,880
these collectivizers are busy bankrupting the country and sucking us dry. And it is

131
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:20,040
outrageous to every day see Fox Sports, CNN, MSNBC, I mean, I saw headlines yesterday.

132
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,240
Gun owners are the new Nazis, gun owners are Hitler. We defeated Hitler last week, CBS

133
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:34,220
News, Bob Shafer, we can defeat gun owners. I mean, it is now 100% clear that my analysis

134
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,060
over the last decade is spot on.

135
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:49,160
And the whole homeland security grid is designed and set up for the American people. The whole

136
00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:00,800
thing is set up and designed and timed to unfurl this economic collapse to domesticate

137
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,400
as many people as they can and get you dependent. And tell you it's good to be dependent, ship

138
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,440
your jobs overseas and put taxes on American businesses so they can't operate unless they're

139
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
select insiders.

140
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
And then as the crime rate increases, it's been going down but they know during a collapse

141
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,520
they'll start going back up. They're going to demonize and are already demonizing people

142
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:26,680
that maintain law and order in their areas with firearms. And it's so crazy, I have an

143
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,080
article here, I actually bought this two weeks ago for my son, he hasn't put it together

144
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,600
yet, the Star Wars Jabba the Hutt Palace Lego set.

145
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,440
And the Austrian government is looking at banning the toy set. And the Turkish Association

146
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,160
there is calling for it, calling for apologies from Lego. And I guess George Lucas on top

147
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,080
of it, saying Jabba the Hutt is supposed to be an Arab. And because the desert building

148
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,440
has a dome, that it's bashing Arabs when actually that mosque is a Christian church.

149
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,640
It doesn't even look much like it. This is the type of crazy political correctness. We

150
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:08,760
had a video the other day that Mike Adams did about, we don't want kings, we got rid

151
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:16,600
of King George III. And I saw comments by black people who were serious, because I went

152
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,200
to their YouTube channels and looked.

153
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,680
Saying why are you bashing Dr. Martin Luther King on Dr. Martin Luther King Day on Monday

154
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:31,160
by saying, we don't want any more kings, we got rid of King George. The thinking the word

155
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,840
king was a code word for Martin Luther King. When actually Mike Adams talked about how

156
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,480
Martin Luther King wouldn't support Obama and his torture and wars.

157
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,520
And Martin Luther King went out to get a gun permit to protect himself, that's on record.

158
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,840
We actually had pro Martin Luther King stuff on the show that day. But see, it's like a

159
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:57,520
mental illness where you're gonna be put off guard and off balance. You said you didn't

160
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,200
like King George, perhaps code word for Martin Luther King?

161
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,960
And then there was a whole debate in that video on YouTube from the radio show of them

162
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,020
debating whether Mike Adams was a bad guy or not. And that type of mental illness really

163
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,600
hurts me, because I want those people to be free. I mean, black communities are being

164
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,360
targeted by eugenics, by the drugs being shipped in, by their leaders trying to collectivize

165
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
them.

166
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,920
By all these things, and you can't get through because it's all racism pumped in by the media

167
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,880
and their leaders and others to create division in the name of unity. And then they tag on

168
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,320
the agenda, support gun control, support socialism, support corporate fascism, support police

169
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,280
state, support control, or you're a racist.

170
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,360
And you're like, explain to me how not turning my guns in is racist. And they go, shut up

171
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,520
racist. And the media just says it and says it, and then everywhere. We went out and interviewed

172
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:01,080
people at UT, and I said, did you find them? They said, no, every woman we talked to, cuz

173
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,440
they show a couple of them that piece we heard yesterday, says, the South is racist and bad,

174
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
turn your guns in.

175
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,280
And these are white women, and they said it with pleasure. They go, the South is bad,

176
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,320
which is a code word for white people. And you just don't need guns, and that time is

177
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,120
now. I mean, totally disconnected from reality. Going to the University of Texas, guaranteed

178
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,580
you got middle class parents that buy into all this.

179
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,000
No idea what's happening worldwide, no idea about the new world order. Everywhere I go,

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm scum because I'm a Texan. Piers Morgan wrote an article saying Texans are animals.

181
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,420
And how I have the paw, the giant paw of a gorilla. And how I'm like a gorilla that is

182
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,840
at the zoo at feeding time. And Texans are dumb gorillas and all this. Texans are dumb

183
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,920
gorillas, Southerners are trash.

184
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,280
White people are all racist, gun owners are racist, gun owners are Nazis. Meanwhile, Planned

185
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,320
Parenthood's main job was founded to, quote, kill black people, to kill black weeds. And

186
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm like, hey, I don't want you to abort your kids. I wanna try to have them free and strong.

187
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,960
Shut up, racist. You're like, I understand it's fun to say that. Just you're just trying

188
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:16,280
to prove you're not a racist. We know you're a racist. It's a total mental illness.

189
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,600
And it is cultural programming. And the Democrats up there, the old white people, they're the

190
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,180
buddies of the, quote, minorities. And they're gonna get rid of the borders for you, and

191
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,600
they're gonna get you free welfare. And they're gonna take those guns, and they're gonna get

192
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,080
whitey for you.

193
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,600
I mean, it is nothing but them playing us off like two different Indian tribes, two

194
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,040
different Native American tribes. Early on, the natives outnumbered settlers at some points

195
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,200
100,000 to 1. There's like 15 settlers and estimated however many natives on the continent.

196
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,120
But during some of the biggest Indian wars, 10 to 1, 20 to 1, 30 to 1.

197
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,100
But it wasn't even the superiority of arms cuz there were the French and others constantly

198
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,000
always selling armaments to the natives who were very proficient with them very quickly.

199
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,780
It was that the natives were always fighting with each other. And well, they live across

200
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,620
that river. They all look the same, act the same, and they're basically the same culture.

201
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,660
But it didn't matter because the British intelligence and others could come in and manipulate them

202
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:21,760
off against each other.

203
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
And the French tried it. It's called the great game. Who can do it the best? The Spanish

204
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,680
tried it. They weren't as good. The British were the best at it, so they took over the

205
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:36,440
world. That's why global imperial, imperial measurement, imperial language is English.

206
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:43,560
The global imperial language is English. That's the global language. It's called imperial

207
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:49,520
in establishment textbooks. I speak imperial. Most of you speak imperial. And the point

208
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,320
is they don't want other people coming in from Mexico to ever speak imperial cuz they

209
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,040
don't even want you able to communicate in the culture. They want you under their control.

210
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:06,060
So we come down to this point now, ladies and gentlemen, where the Democrats have introduced

211
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,660
a bill worse than what she posted on her Senate website, worse than copies of her other bill

212
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,440
that she had before that other Democrats introduced, hoping that we miss those and they pass as

213
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,640
riders on larger bills that bans all semi-automatic handguns, most pump shotguns.

214
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,840
It's worse than what her other bill said. Dem set sights on 150 weapons seek national

215
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,640
registry, open press conference with prayer. Purpose is to dry up the supply of these weapons

216
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,680
over time. Feinstein got special permission to display guns in DC NRA boycott, kills nation's

217
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:50,560
largest outdoor show. Now remember, remember they're talking about banning a Lego toy cuz

218
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,800
the Arabs say Jabba the Hutt's supposed to be them. I mean, that's like saying ban a

219
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,600
tree cuz you're saying Arabs look like it. I mean, it's just.

220
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,600

Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors

226
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:39,280
won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't

Is 2013 your year to achieve more? More vitality, more health, more wellbeing? Hi, this is Pastor

232
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,680
Jenny. For 25 years I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more. But in

233
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,520
2010 I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions of gene

234
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,040
switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator. I

235
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,960
learned by taking RNA drops I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve

236
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,240
the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a

237

260
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:14,840
Berkey Water Filters, for the love of clean water. You know, the British government and

261
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,720
others are warning that what should be listed as one of the biggest apocalyptic threats

262
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,120
is not terrorists blowing up a bus and killing 10 people, which turn out to be staged to

263
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,880
begin with. But antibiotic resistant bacteria, and there's a London Guardian report on that

264
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,040
I'm gonna be getting to a little bit later.

265
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,320
But what needs to be realized here is that over 100,000, some numbers are as high as

266
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,580
200,000 people die from infections that were preventable in hospitals. Are you seeing a

267
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:52,240
bunch of, five year old Billy died riddled with sores as the bacteria ate the flesh off

268
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:59,880
his body. And he went into a coma over two weeks and died. Tom Daschle or somebody like

269
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,080
Joe Biden, former and current politicians running around crying, they decide when to

270
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,520
punch the buttons.

271
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:17,200
They decide. And now we've got a press conference being opened by the Democrats saying, I believe

272
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,160
the gun lobby is no match for the cross lobby. And we're getting a full press conference,

273
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:30,440
it is unbelievably disgusting. And in there, they have forced buyback provisions. She lies

274
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,800
and says, we're not gonna take guns from anybody.

275
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,640
They always register, you have to come in and get them registered, they always confiscate.

276
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,680
It's been done in Europe, it's been done in Australia. Australia is down to bolt action

277
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,600
and single shot, and it is in their official newspapers. You can just type in Australia,

278
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,160
get to ban bolt action, and you will pull up the mainstream articles.

279
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:56,200
We covered it yesterday. So it's always the same pattern. England did the same deal. And

280
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,420
then they say, okay, you can keep the bolt action. It's gotta be checked in at a local

281
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:07,720
shooting club with police there, paid off duty when you shoot. And then they just ban

282
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,840
the hunting clubs.

283
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,880
Now they're banning those clubs. So this is how they totally eradicate them. And several

284
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,520
countries in South America are doing this where they're banning hunting and guns. So

285
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,620
they want it all gone. They try to make it about hunting, which it isn't, but they understand

286
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,620
that's part of the culture.

287
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,080
So they wanna kill that too. In fact, you think you're gonna hunt foxes that are breeding

288
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,600
like rats? That's why they have fox hunting. With your beagles and your other fox hounds,

289
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,280
you think you're gonna ride out in the country and have your dogs hunt like they're supposed

290
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,280
to?

291
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,840
So the foxes don't kill your cat. Paul Watson lives outside London. There are foxes running

292
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,540
around. He sent me photos of them. I've retweeted them at Real Alex Jones, just like roaches.

293
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,320
And they're vicious. Foxes have come in and killed babies and things. They're in the dog

294
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,440
family at about five times more vicious per pound.

295
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,760
And can't hunt them, so they're like roaches now all over the UK. Beautiful animals, but

296
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,720
they are like roaches. See, all the ancients knew what to hunt. You didn't hunt big, beautiful

297
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,560
animals. You hunted things that would get out of control if you didn't hunt them.

298
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,200
Like take here in Austin, we have whitetail deer getting run over everywhere, eating in

299
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,840
the yard, starving to death. I mean, I can barely drive home during the day or at night.

300
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,880
Just deer everywhere, I see them hit everywhere I go. But you're not allowed to hunt them

301
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
inside the city.

302
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,520
And sometimes they'll pay people like $3,000, $4,000 apiece to cage them and then fly them

303
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,520
to West Texas. And then they get out in West Texas with wolves and mountain lions, half

304
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,120
starved, they're domesticated, they get killed in hours. Thousands of dollars to fly mountain

305
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:51,360
lions free meals in helicopters, cuz you don't want them to die on a long truck ride.

306
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,580
So you fly them in a helicopter, half the time they die of having a heart attack. I'm

307
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:02,320
not kidding, they've had cases of up to $5,000. These yuppies will pay to have deer trapped

308
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,240
in their yards, put in big cages, they go in to get food.

309
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,460
And then they, see I'm already ranting, I haven't even gotten to it yet. Let's play

310
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,200
a clip of Feinstein saying we wanna dry up the supply of the quote assault weapons, which

311
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:24,720
is now your handgun. Here it is. Diane Feinstein in her press conference today, here's that

312
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,720
clip.

313
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,420
Hunting rights, we have tried to recognize legal defense rights. We have tried to recognize

314
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:41,120
the right of a citizen to legally possess a weapon. No weapon is taken from anyone.

315
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:48,640
The purpose is to dry up the supply of these weapons over time. Therefore, there is no

316
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,400
sunset on this bill.

317
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,580
There you go, there is no sunset on this bill and she literally smacks her lips with pleasure.

318
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,760
That is an insider trader, one of the top insider traders in Congress. When they got

319
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,040
caught, as you know, last year, they did a gangster trick on you, a mafia trick, a lawyer

320
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,040
trick, it's on record.

321
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,100
They said, it's not against the law for us to do it, which it actually was. We've done

322
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,280
whole reports on that. We'll pass a law making it illegal. And the law actually made it legal,

323
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,560
it's not constitutional. Where if the Ethics Committee of the House or Senate run by the

324
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,520
insider traders says it's okay, that it is. It's like, we got caught murdering, well murder

325
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,480
is not illegal for us, we'll pass a law making it illegal. And then the law says, well, we

326
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,840
can kill somebody if the Ethics Committee says it's okay.

327
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,040
I mean, that's the games that this big swollen, pus-filled pig of a woman, this tyrant is

328
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,800
engaged in. We'll be right back, stay with us.

329
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

338
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,800
How can you say that didn't make me sick? The biggest thing going against the flu shot

339
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,800
is a mom gives their five year old a shot and the kid swells up and has a convulsion.

340
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,800
That'll cure you of vaccines for the rest of your life. The biggest thing going against

341
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,800
the flu shots is my mother was, I don't know, it was like 10, 15 years ago, I forget, was

342
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,800
really into triathlons at the time and doing a great job even winning silver medals and

343
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:51,800
stuff at some big ones in her age group. And she was advised by the team coach, the local

344
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,800
sponsored group, going to be in this big state triathlon, take the flu shot a month before

345
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
because it's in the winter.

346
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,800
You don't want this to knock you out. And herself and some of the others got sick. And

347
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
I mean, my mother was sick for a month and she never gets sick like that. And this is

348
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,800
like hospital level bad. She didn't go to the hospital, but she was down. And we're

349
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,800
talking like a day after she took it. My uncle, my dad's brother, almost died when he was,

350
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,800
I think, seven years old from a tetanus shot, swole up, had to go to the hospital.

351
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,800
So the biggest thing running against him is cause and effect. To the point of now, before

352
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,800
they would deny, your kid had a convulsion as we gave him a shot to, it's normal to have

353
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,800
a seizure. But if you're going home and now the doctors tell them, this came out three

354
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,800
years ago, three and a half years ago, there were so many convulsions from the H1N1. They

355
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,800
said, look, just put something hard in their mouth, wooden or whatever you've got, not

356
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
metal to break their teeth off.

357
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,800
You gotta shove something in their mouth. Okay, I'm gonna give them this shot. And if

358
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,800
they have a convulsion today, it's quite normal. Just put something between their teeth. Imagine,

359
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,800
this is quite normal, but they may have a convulsion. And of course, I laugh because

360
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,800
it's so sick. It's the laugh of pain. I mean, I have been on vacation or on the streets

361
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,800
and you'll run into people and they'll have a five year old that's autistic sitting there,

362
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,800
talking to themselves.

363
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:20,300
Sometimes it'll be a younger child, older child, beautiful soul that had a great future

364
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,800
ahead of him. And I'll say, when did that happen? Were they born like that? Very nice

365
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,800
child. And they'll go, no, Billy was 18 months old and we went in for a second round of shots

366
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,800
and he couldn't wake up the next morning. He didn't talk for a week and he never talked

367
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
again.

368
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,300
He was talking so much and so happy and he hadn't talked since. And he's seven years

369
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:47,500
old now and we believe it's the vaccines, but the doctors say it isn't. Yeah, cuz the

370
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,600
doctors gave it to your kid. They're never gonna say they're wrong. Once the Nazis started

371
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,600
killing people, and Hitler said now killed millions, they couldn't say no cuz, well,

372
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,600
they've done the right thing before. Same thing with the Soviets, same thing with all

373
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,600
these pundits and people wanting to take our guns and wanting collectivism and wanting

374
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
tyranny.

375
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:16,200
They cannot and they will not ever say they were wrong. No matter how crazy it gets, no

376
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:23,480
matter how out of control it gets, most of them will commit to evil forever. If you see

377
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,280
the corruption, if you know about liberty, thank God you grew up, had the genetics, had

378
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,620
the locale, had the mentors to be able to have common sense.

379
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,660
People that get into fraud, it's like gamblers I've known. I've known people that are very

380
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,100
successful in business, but blow all their money on gambling. And I'm like, listen, stop

381
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,260
gambling and you can get out of all this. No, no, no, I'm gonna go gamble more and I'll

382
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:54,980
get on top of this. And I'm like, listen, it's designed that big thing out in the desert

383
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,600
and all these systems to separate you from your money.

384
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,920
The House will always win long term. They trumpet the winner, sometimes staged, to make

385
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,440
you think everybody's a winner, okay? But statistically, you lose about 70% of the time

386
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,280
or more. Don't be a sucker. If you wanna gamble, gamble in business and real life where you

387
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
have a chance of winning.

388
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,480
Cuz the gambling spirit is actually something genetically and chemically they've proven

389
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,300
in the brain that is actually associated with leadership. But they take it and misappropriate

390
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,640
it like a mind control system. It's like the snake in the Jungle Book trying to hypnotize

391
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,940
people. That is a facsimile. It is a fraud. You wanna go play poker with your buddies,

392
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
that's one thing.

393
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,600
At least you got an even chance of winning. That's why you don't see a lot of poker going

394
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,500
on at the big casinos. Blackjack, you might have a chance to win, but everything else

395
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:55,180
is a fraud at the end of the day. I mean, if you bet your buddies 20 bucks on a football

396
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,900
game as it makes more interest rate, I get that.

397
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:11,680
But how do I even get off into gambling? Vaccines. With vaccines, it is just a complete and total

398
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:20,420
fraud. And it's not my opinion of that. And I have a stack of articles here. Piers Morgan

399
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,660
falls ill days after receiving flu vaccine. In fact, let's work into these videos right

400
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,660
now and then back into the guns and then your phone calls.

401
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:34,900
Piers Morgan falls ill days after receiving flu vaccine. And I desperately try to get

402
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:41,300
mainline talk show host who are intelligent and see a lot of what's going on to talk about

403
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,140
vaccines. But they don't wanna do it because the corporate media has put a stigma on it

404
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,420
of quote, conspiracy theorist.

405
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,000
And run other hoaxes where they claim Dr. Wakefield was involved in a fraud. He's never

406
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,420
admitted to that. The evidence has been proven to be a fraud. Turns out the evidence against

407
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:01,220
him has been a fraud. There were three previous studies, two of them in England, finding what

408
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:09,200
he found years before. And there's a major association with autoimmune disorders and

409
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,460
vaccine contaminants in the intestines in the brain.

410
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,460
That's why you drink alcohol to affect your brain. It's the same thing. And so much of

411
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,300
what he said was dead on, that's why they've gone after him. So they run these hoaxes,

412
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:30,380
kinda like free energy or things like that. They run a hoax 20 years ago saying, no such

413
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,420
thing as that. And say, it was done in a mayonnaise jar. So it's all a scam. And then meanwhile,

414
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,500
all these real things that get developed never can be deployed as people were told it was

415
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,940
a fraud.

416
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,420
So there's all these hoaxes going on. But in Adan Salazar's excellent article, he links

417
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,820
to the CDC's own seasonal flu vaccine fact guide. In fact, I'm gonna get Adan to also

418
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:01,620
link to their adverse reaction page where it says death, seizures, narcolepsy. I mean,

419
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:06,500
just hundreds of things. And then I can show you mainstream news articles where they say

420
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,940
there is no side effects.

421
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:11,980
It's a conspiracy theory. In fact, I've read those articles where it says, crazy people

422
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:17,080
like Alex Jones and Dr. Blaylock. They say vaccines are causing brain damage and autoimmune

423
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:22,380
disorders and swelling in the brain. There is no proof and the government says zero side

424
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:31,700
effects. You go read the inserts of all these vaccines. All of them include death, death,

425
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:41,520
death. And it's so frustrating to know that aspartame and Diet Coke and thousands of products

426
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,500
causes macular degeneration.

427
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,340
And to know people that drink these diet drinks and eat the diet candy and go, hey, I hear

428
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,700
you're going blind. Can I give you some literature? No, I don't wanna see it. Cuz see, they don't

429
00:41:53,700 --> 00:42:00,020
wanna admit they were wrong to do this. I mean, look, I know it's wrong that I like

430
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:02,260
to eat 30 ounce steaks.

431
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:07,540
I know it's wrong that I do unhealthy things. At least I know it. But I mean, a steak's

432
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,620
a lot better than aspartame. I know getting angry is not good for me, but I still do it

433
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:18,580
cuz it's who I am. This stuff is meant to hurt you. And people say, like the young Turks

434
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,900
guy, I admit it's all happening, but they don't mean it.

435
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,300
Well, I've got books where they admit, like Eco Science, they're doing it on purpose.

436
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:33,820
And see, that's the issue. That's what's so frustrating about this is that I have watched

437
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,220
people. I know two local talk show hosts. One says I can talk about it, the other says

438
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:46,780
I can't, that work at the same company who took the H1N1 shot, despite everything I said

439
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,580
to them four years ago, who got mild cases of Guillain-Barre, neurological disorder so

440
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,500
bad their hands and feet became numb.

441
00:42:54,500 --> 00:43:01,520
Sometimes it totally paralyzes you and kills you. And the doctors even told them this is

442
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,340
a vaccine reaction. One of them was Dale Dudley, one of the top morning shows in town on 93.7,

443
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:15,980
the sister station to our AM 590. And I was on his show and he said, I haven't told anybody

444
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:18,260
this yet, but I'll go ahead and tell you how to go to the doctor's stuff.

445
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,580
The crew knows, remember for a couple months, my hands got numb, my feet, I went to the

446
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:27,580
doctor, I was so scared, I got a mild case of Guillain-Barre. Yeah, what about the articles

447
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:33,420
from yesterday, 800 European children developed narcolepsy after receiving H1N1 vaccine. Here's

448
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,300
another one, at least 50 African children paralyzed after receiving Bill Gates backed

449
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,740
meningitis vaccine, natural news, links to all the mainstream articles.

450
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:49,760
I mean, it's in major newspapers like CBS that 60 something thousand Indian children

451
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,940
last year got paralyzed, many of them died after taking the UN polio vaccine, because

452
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:02,580
it is polio. I mean, it's so cold blooded that Stalin said one man dies, it's a statistic,

453
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,380
a million dies, or one man dies, it's a tragedy, a million dies, it's a statistic.

454
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,140
And to know, it's like back of the paper, 60 something thousand kids, thousands of them

455
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:17,500
died. They're like, well, it's a side effect, no big deal. It's like, hey, yeah, 60,000

456
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:23,780
kids paralyzed. But you hear about the 20th Sandy Hook, yeah, I mean, it's so over the

457
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,540
top how they decide when to punch the buttons of what's said.

458
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,580
And Alex, what about the kids? Turn your guns in. I'm like, but crimes drop 49% violent

459
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,620
crime. Here, let me give you the actual, I don't believe those statistics. Thought you

460
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:40,940
don't believe the government? Well, no, these are locally compiled, some of the most accurate

461
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,020
statisticians world over say these are some of the most accurate in the world are the

462
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,580
example of what's accurate. It's something good set up 50 years ago, very accurate crime

463
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
statistics.

464
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:55,820
I don't wanna see that, I don't. They don't wanna hear the reality, but reaching out to

465
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,180
Piers Morgan, people say, well, why are you making a big deal to Piers Morgan if he has

466
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,380
a half million viewers? That blow up on air was aired on every major English station in

467
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,380
the world that I know of.

468
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,820
It's one of the biggest media events, not just of this year, but last year, and it's

469
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:18,700
been rated as such. And I didn't really do all that on purpose. I just said, God, whatever

470
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,860
you want me to do, have me do it, and that's what happened. And notice they're not having

471
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,200
me on all these other shows.

472
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,560
They could have me on MSNBC and get double ratings for the week. They could have me on

473
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,180
all these Fox News and increase their ratings, they know that. I mean, I've talked to executives

474
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:37,660
of these companies over and over again over the years. We really want you, we're trying

475
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,820
to get you, but there's no way that the execs are gonna kill it.

476
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:45,260
And I'm like, that's fine, I don't wanna be on there, stop calling me. But don't you wanna

477
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,140
come up here and shoot a pilot? I mean, they wanna meet with you and stuff, but they just

478
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,660
wanna know that, are you gonna work with them? No, I'm not gonna work with you, I don't care.

479
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:01,020
I can't be around all those plastic fake people and all the bleach blondes and all the soulless

480
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,020
people.

481
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:10,140
I'll build my own thing, thank you. But that's not what this is even about. My point is,

482
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:15,900
why haven't they had me back on these shows? Because they acted like and spun it. Discrediting,

483
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:20,260
look at the crazy gun owners. They don't want you getting out of your trance. They want

484
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:25,580
a calm English accent or an NPR accent selling you on tyranny.

485
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:28,460
They don't want somebody getting up and going, don't take the shots, they're designed to

486
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:35,300
hurt you. Here's proof, wake up, get out of your trance. Wake up, wake up, wake up. I've

487
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,180
been effective with my approach, not because I even calculated it, but because it's real

488
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,820
and organic and it speaks to people's common sense.

489
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:48,500
Everybody listening took the flu shot or knows somebody that did, that almost died. Everybody

490
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:52,620
knows they took the flu shot and got deathly ill that week. They're giving you the flu.

491
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,300
And the more people take the shot, they've got studies, the more flu there is that year,

492
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:03,740
cuz there's flu in it. And I've got top scientists on about this. How many medical doctors, how

493
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,420
many endocrinologists, how many virologists?

494
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,460
British studies, Canadian studies three years ago, it doubles your chances of getting the

495
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:17,060
flu when you take the shot. That's in Adan Salazar's article. I mean, that's why I'm

496
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:23,020
frustrated, that's why I'm angry. I mean, I know this stuff's hurting people. Every

497
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,940
time I go on vacation, every time I'm in a shopping mall, every time I'm in a restaurant,

498
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,300
almost every time in a movie theater, the whole front row is autistic kids.

499
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:37,740
Yelling and screaming during the whole thing, just their minds completely attacked. The

500
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:43,500
cerebral cortex attacks, so they can't process their subconscious info coming out. So that's

501
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,660
why things are so intense to them. These are damaged, partially wrecked human souls. And

502
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:54,060
it gets to me because I have empathy, ladies and gentlemen, not because I'm a hero.

503
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:58,940
My programming is if the children are being hurt, mine aren't safe. And that's not a conscious

504
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,180
cold-blooded thing. I can analyze why my programming gets upset. It's self-preservation, folks.

505
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:10,920
It isn't cuz I'm goody two-shoes. It's because I am a rootin' tootin', out of control hillbilly

506
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,300
Yosemite Sam. And I know corrupt thugs when I see it, and I go ape when I see it.

507
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:22,340
So I guess it's true, Piers Morgan, I am a gorilla from Texas. But this gorilla knows

508
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:27,780
which way his soul is pointed. This gorilla has his head turned around straight. And you

509
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,700
took the shot with Dr. Oz a week ago, and we said he's gonna get sick, or that's fake.

510
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,860
Cuz it's turned out the politicians in Europe have been caught taking fake shots, and they

511
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:42,700
get their own shot, or a sugar water shot that came out three years ago with the H1N1.

512
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:48,100
And he's on there with Dwight Yoakam. And Dwight Yoakam, well, I mean, here is the clip.

513
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,740
After he takes the flu shot, he gets super sick. He's having trouble getting over it.

514
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,420
And he's asking Dwight Yoakam why this happened. Here it is.

515
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,260
25 million records. Dwight Yoakam is much more than a country superstar. He's a talented

516
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,740
actor with a lot to say about issues that matter to America. Dwight's latest album is

517
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,260
three pairs. Welcome to you, Dwight.

518
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,260
Thank you.

519
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:06,260
If we go any further, you're a singer.

520
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,260
Yeah.

521
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,260
You must have had sore throat.

522
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,260
I hear this.

523
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,540
Well, as you can tell, things are deteriorating. Is there any advice you can give me?

524
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,540
Don't ever take a flu shot again. Now, I watched that night with Dr. Oz, and in deference to

525
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:29,260
Dr. Oz, I think he's, he seems like a completely competent doctor. And I don't understand any

526
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:35,060
of the kind of biological aspects of the meds that-

527
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:39,340
But we're both doing the maths, aren't we? We both saw him put that thing in my arm.

528
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,340
Yeah.

529
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,340
And within ten days, I've been struck down.

530
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:46,940
And I just, you know what? I don't want to tell anybody out there I'm not a medical advisor.

531
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,260
Get your vaccines if you, I don't believe in them. I'm just suspicious by nature, and

532
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,620
I saw you get it, and here we are.

533
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,980
Well, let's try, we'll try and plow on with the interview, not withstand the fact I can't.

534
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,700
Yeah, that's good. And you can go read the full transcript at info.wars.com, and Morgan's

535
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:08,380
like yeah, you can't disagree, I take it and I'm sick. And of course, that could be anecdotal.

536
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:14,240
But it's not with the thousands of cases we all know about, okay? I mean, my grandmother's

537
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,580
best friend, registered nurse, whole nine yards, constantly takes vaccines. Takes the

538
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:23,060
single shingle shot, gets the shingles.

539
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:28,220
And then my dad is a oral surgeon and a dentist, and he talks to people. And he goes, yeah,

540
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,780
I've talked to, this is like a month ago, I never told the story. Cuz I've talked to

541
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:36,860
three people that took the shingle shot and got it. I mean, it's just insane that this

542
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,660
is going on, okay?

543
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:43,220
And we're gonna come back and get into the guns, get into the whole Dianne Feinstein

544
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,400
situation, and then open the phones up in the second hour. And then you remember the

545
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:52,780
guys that dressed up like pimps and brought down Acorn and exposed Planned Parenthood's

546
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,260
open plan to kill black people, kill black babies?

547
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,660
The legends are gonna be joining us here on air, James O'Keefe.

548
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,400
If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer

549
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,340
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.

550
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:15,180
Here's why. Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,

551
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:20,260
solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when

552
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,420
the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

553
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,760
Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't

554
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,460
sell as new. We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily

555
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:39,020
at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like

556
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:44,700
new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

557
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:51,180
Don't wait, they go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

clearly see tomorrow and yesterday, today.

565
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:03,680
Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial

566
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:08,920
affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation

567
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,960
of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the

568
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,740
right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and

569
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:22,820
Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy

570
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,960
Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings

571
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,040
are subject to government intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared

572
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,960
a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you

573
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,280
have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives

574
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:47,040
to give this report out free. Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237. When investing,

575
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:54,040
always proceed with caution. Again, call 1-800-686-2237. Exercise your legal right to trade metals

576
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:12,040
privately. 1-800-686-2237. You see, the globalists, they want to just

577
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:20,040
normalize everybody to get accustomed to tyranny and, ah, cancer rates up several thousand

578
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,080
percentage and everybody gets breast cancer and everybody gets testicular cancer early

579
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,640
and yeah, you know, childhood cancer didn't exist 100 years ago, it was super rare 50

580
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,640
years ago.

581
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:36,800
You know, now it's up over 10,000% on average. And yeah, if a girl has a Hello Kitty bubble

582
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,480
machine that is in the shape of a gun because it's handheld but it's not even called a gun.

583
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:46,000
My kids actually have had one of those, my four-year-old. The police come in, you get

584
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:55,400
questioned, we're gonna expel her. All of this is going on and it's insane and it's

585
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,320
political correctness and total control.

586
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,400
And then a girl draws a paper gun and the police are called. She just, again, it's an

587
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,800
attack on ideas. It's authoritarianism in the name of the nanny state and the people

588
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,920
running it, they're the ones buying the 1.6 billion bullets. They're the ones talking

589
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,600
about a revolution. They're the ones fantasizing about bringing in Chinese troops against us,

590
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,280
whether that's feasible or not.

591
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,680
They're the ones in the Daily Beast saying, we need to have the Communist Chinese tell

592
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:27,180
us what to do. Alex Jones is the enemy. I read those quotes yesterday. I mean, it's

593
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:32,780
bizarre stuff in the peers pressure story. Look at this article if you're watching on

594
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,780
TV.

595
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:39,680
A London Telegraph, Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set. Now, my son is building

596
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,640
this right now. And I'm gonna bring this in, I'm gonna try to get him to finish it, it's

597
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:49,240
really big. Lego has been accused of racism by the Turkish community over a Star Wars

598
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,240
model that supposedly resembles one of Istanbul's most revered mosque.

599
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:58,080
And folks, it has a slight dome on it, looks almost nothing like it. By the way, that's

600
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:03,760
Christian architecture there. That was a Christian church. So is the big church in Istanbul.

601
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,440
The point is it looks almost nothing like it. And they say Jabba the Hutt is meant to

602
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:18,360
look like Arabs. I mean, Jabba the Hutt is a giant space alien worm who talks like Cookie

603
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,360
Monster.

604
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:30,440
Teeny Jedi. I mean, this is what it's reached. Hello Kitty guns, bubble guns, Jabba the Hutt

605
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:35,460
things and the media takes us and goes, no, it's quite normal. Robin Page of the BBC was

606
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,720
arrested for saying rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.

607
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,040
And they said the word homosexual is judged to be mean and the guy's not even a conservative

608
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,040
and they go on arresting.

609
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,560
And of course the charges were dropped cuz there were no real charges. It's great the

610
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:56,360
idea of you have no speech. They're gonna be able to ban real guns if kids, I see articles

611
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,960
every month where somebody will do a zombie story. I've seen this dozens of times, I know

612
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,960
you've seen it.

613
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,480
They'll write an article about zombies that are so popular and about a fictional school

614
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,800
attacked by zombies and how they shoot the zombies and they will arrest you. And in one

615
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,400
article it was the dad's parents were split up, the grandparents were raising the top

616
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,320
honor student football player.

617
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,160
And though it was fictional, the grandpa called the police and they are charging him saying

618
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,220
it's terroristic threats even though it's a fictional school. I remember that a few

619
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:32,240
years ago. And it's like where'd Bob go? He drew a gun. I mean, all we did was draw army

620
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,560
fights and stuff when we were doodling as boys and the girls drew girls in dresses.

621
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,640
I mean, that's what you do. All we did was play soldier. They're making normal human

622
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,960
activity illegal. It's not illegal yet, but they're still acting like it is. To the point

623
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,960
of ladies and gentlemen, we own the job of the hut set.

624
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:55,180
I was playing with the figures last night saying you gotta get this built. And I was

625
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,480
looking at how cool, it's got like a dozen figures. I'm gonna bring it in here as soon

626
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,140
as it's done. In fact, will you call my house? I know my son's homeschooling today, but will

627
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,520
you ask him as soon as you can to get this done?

628
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:11,620
I wanna bring this in, folks. These creatures look nothing like Muslims. I mean, Star Wars

629
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,720
is incredibly politically correct and is all about all cultures and groups coming together

630
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:22,320
including aliens. It's like Star Trek, it's the opposite, is my point. But no, it's racist.

631
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,220
Job of the hut's palace makes the Arabs look bad. And in Austria, they're like, we may

632
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:31,100
shut this down actually, yes. Again, to set the precedent so they can shut anybody down

633
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:35,000
they want. Be sure and support the broadcasters who have read the word about it and get the

634
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
new Come and Take It T-shirt at Infowarsstore.com.

635
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:50,640
This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

636
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:54,680
Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

you get sick and die? Start purifying your water with ProPure. My friends, I've done

647
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:07,080
Reaching war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream

648
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:16,400
media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN

649
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:23,720
Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

650
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:31,360
All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to open the phones up in the next hour. Diane

651
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:37,880
Feinstein posted her bill on her Senate website over a month ago now, and people couldn't

652
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:42,940
believe it. And then others have introduced kind of copies of it themselves. So technically

653
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:46,760
I'd said her bill was introduced. It's officially been introduced today. And it's worse than

654
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,880
we even thought. We're going to be going over some of that. But I'd said, the way the other

655
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:57,080
one was written, it could be handguns, shotguns, even pump shotguns, or pump rifles.

656
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:59,680
People say pump rifles. They do have a lot of pump rifles, folks. You don't seem to be

657
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:06,100
aware of that. Anything with a pistol grip on it. It's just incredible. And she is so

658
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:11,400
disgusting in her press conference, we're going to play this clip coming up, talking

659
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:22,520
about the gun lobby can't beat the cross lobby. Using Christianity, is Diane Feinstein a Christian?

660
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:27,280
And speaking for Christians, even if she was a Christian, you do not speak for me, lady.

661
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,940
And I think it's just outrageous that people think it's okay to walk on Christians. Can

662
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:41,080
you imagine if I got up here and spoke for Islam when I'm not a Muslim or a follower

663
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,200
of the Prophet Muhammad?

664
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:50,480
Can you imagine what would happen? Can you imagine if I got up here and if I spoke for

665
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:58,800
Jewish groups? Or if I spoke for atheist groups? Well, as an atheist, I believe in God. And

666
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,160
as a Christian, I believe in turning your guns in, even though I'm not a Christian.

667
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:07,560
I mean, it is over the top. We're going to open the phones up in the next segment. I

668
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,960
want to give the number out in the next segment, we'll open the phones up then. But start your

669
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:16,160
engines, I want to specifically hear about that. But how big is this article? This article

670
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:22,600
needs to get out to everybody because you've got Dwight Yoakam on with Piers Morgan.

671
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:25,800
And Piers Morgan said, I got the flu shot and now I'm really been sick for a week. And

672
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,440
he's like, well, don't take the flu shot. I want to get Dwight Yoakam on, I've always

673
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:36,800
been a fan anyway, so let that word go out. By the way, my buddies here in the office,

674
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:42,560
Weldon Henson was hanging out with Mike Judge again this weekend. Aaron Austin and Mike

675
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,560
Judge, he's gone back to California, said, Alex, call me, I'll come on.

676
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:50,840
I got all these big guests I could get, but I've got to call them. And so, Chris, it is

677
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:56,520
a direct order at the end of the show that you are to make me, see, I hate calling people,

678
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:01,320
I hate bugging people. Yeah, no, but all of them, all the celebrities I need to call,

679
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:07,360
okay, it's just time for me to do it. I guess I could turn you guys loose on them, but it

680
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:08,920
didn't matter.

681
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:13,080
I was just watching Idiocracy a few weeks ago, I just got to get Judge on. Because we

682
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:22,320
are entering the Idiocracy where Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set, London Telegraph,

683
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:28,080
and the official Turkish group is complaining to the Austrian government. I mean, I guess

684
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:33,840
you can't show any desert motif or desert design. By the way, that design is a medieval

685
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,840
Christian design.

686
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:44,040
And it doesn't even look anything like the mosque. I mean, just incredible. I mean, obviously

687
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:47,560
those that built the architecture went for a desert look. I mean, it looks like a lot

688
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,300
of the Middle Eastern architecture, but a lot of what you call Middle Eastern is really

689
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,400
Roman or Christian. That's a Christian built building right there, the one they're saying

690
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,480
it looks like.

691
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,680
And so because in it is Jabba the Hutt, they say Jabba the Hutt's supposed to be Arabs.

692
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,400
Man, now everybody will think that cuz you said that, it's just bizarre. But again, it's

693
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:13,120
a political weapon. Here's an example, I'm gonna cover this when we come back. Sigmund

694
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:18,280
Freud said a fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity.

695
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:24,000
Retarded just simply means lowered. But then the word retarded became politically incorrect.

696
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,400
So you can't say he's had retarded growth from lack of protein. My gosh, you're gonna

697
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:33,920
be arrested in England. But that's a hate term. They choose whatever it is. You called,

698
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,400
you said that bonsai tree by not giving much sunshine or water was retarded in its growth.

699
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:45,500
That's hateful. You hurt someone, you hurt someone. And it's just a weapon that is used

700
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,640
to then put guilt onto people.

701
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:51,800
You won't turn your guns on cuz you're a Klan member. What's that have to do with it? Don't

702
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:57,560
try to cover up your racism. We all know what you're really up to. It's to create division.

703
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:01,040
It's to create a race war.

704
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:05,020
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

705
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:09,760

Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

735
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:21,400
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

736
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:26,280
All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're joining us in the second hour, you probably

737
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:33,160
heard me break down the 150 plus firearms and their variants. The way I read our bill,

738
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:39,160
we've got a copy of it right here. The way I read the list, or their variants, it's way

739
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:44,880
more than 150. I know the Associated Press and others are saying 150, that is not the

740
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:45,880
case.

741
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:50,520
The way the ATF, in fact, man, sometimes I wish I could just be in their writing articles.

742
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,600
It's more effective than just being on air talking about it. But I'm putting it out.

743
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,240
People will go research it and get their own articles out of Not Our Guys, cuz we're just

744
01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:02,520
overworked here. There's just too many baseballs getting thrown at us here, too many news things.

745
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,960
All AK types, including the following, and then it goes on. All of these types, all of

746
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:15,760
those types, they say it over and over again. So they list 150 firearms on this page. It's

747
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:24,880
way over that in her official bill from page TNW M2HB, and this is just one of the pages.

748
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:31,000
I mean, it's way over 150. It's almost all semi-auto handguns, rifles, shotguns that

749
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,120
have got grips on them, but then shotguns that can also take clips, even if they're

750
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,760
only designed to take four rounds.

751
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:43,960
I mean, it's over. They're coming after everything. They are coming after everything. And this

752
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:52,080
is just completely, completely out of control. So I wanna get your take on the official bill

753
01:09:52,080 --> 01:10:03,360
here. But first off, I'm gonna give you the number. It's 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.

754
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:07,440
And we will get you up and on the air about this situation.

755
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:12,080
Now also, I covered it last hour. It's a big deal. We have time, we'll play the clip again.

756
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:21,360
Dwight Yoakam, I'm a big fan of. Piers Morgan falls ill days after receiving flu vaccine.

757
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:28,520
And he goes on the Piers Morgan show and Piers basically goes, yeah, I got the flu shot from

758
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:33,600
Dr. Oz and then got sick a week later, and I'm really sick.

759
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:39,580
Whenever this flu is, it also attacks your lungs. You have like a hemorrhagic light form

760
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:43,920
of hemorrhagic fever. You have some of hemorrhagic, is that the proper term, response in your

761
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:51,680
lungs. And it is certainly not a fun thing. But this is the type of thing. People won't

762
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:57,680
read the CDC's own admissions that it can kill you or give you its own autoimmune response

763
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:58,760
in your lungs or brain.

764
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,400
They won't tell you it can cause Guillain-Barre permanently or kill you. They don't tell you

765
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:08,320
it can cause hundreds of things. People don't go look that up. The media just says there's

766
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,120
no side effects, don't listen to conspiracy theorists. But when Piers Morgan gets sick

767
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:17,100
after the flu shot and Dwight Yoakam says don't take the flu shot, that's the type of

768
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,400
thing that will get to the sheeple.

769
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,400
The sheeple, a lot of them will go, I still take it even though I get sick usually when

770
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,160
I take it. I've talked too long, but you don't think there's a cause and effect there. We've

771
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:31,960
gotta try to help these folks. It's easy to laugh at them and get mad at them, they're

772
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,960
victims.

773
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:37,640
They were set in front of the television set in the last 60 years in their diapers as a

774
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:43,780
babysitter being programmed to be a bunch of mind-numbed robots. And we've got to deprogram

775
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:50,200
them or they're gonna be used as an army, a tidal wave of foaming at the mouth, slobbering,

776
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:56,480
drooling, miscreant, gibbering is the proper term, lemmings to run us over the cliff with

777
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,480
them.

778
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:03,060
We have got to get in there and help them. Now, I mentioned political correctness earlier.

779
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:07,680
Here's the CDC website if you're watching us at prisonplanet.tv. You can go read the

780
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:15,840
different vaccine responses including death and depending on the vaccine you take. But

781
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:21,280
getting back to political correctness, there's an all out attempt to make toy manufacturers

782
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,560
not have GI Joe, Star Wars with guns.

783
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,780
There's an all out attempt to not let boys play with toy guns or girls. That's why the

784
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:34,680
police come when your neighbors call them because the kid's got an orange or pink Nerf

785
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,640
gun in the yard. You see that in the news every day now. Or a girl draws a paper gun

786
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,720
or a girl has a Hello Kitty bubble projector, it's not even a gun.

787
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,120
My children have had multiple Hello Kitty, the exact same pink ones. And we've had a

788
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:54,440
Choco Cat one that's black cuz we're racist. Absolutely, my kids wear Choco Cat outfits

789
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:59,960
because we're racist, okay? I mean, the cat is black, ladies and gentlemen, Choco Cat.

790
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:06,040
My wife's got a Choco Cat nightgown. Total racism again. And you're saying, Alex, don't

791
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,600
be silly. Folks, they mean it to be mindless and over the top. Let's punch up for viewers.

792
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:17,160
I covered this last hour, but I'm gonna segue this into guns, then your calls. London Telegraph,

793
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,920
Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set.

794
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,840
The official Austrian government's looking at it. The big Turkish council, the biggest

795
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,680
minority council in Austria is outraged and is demanding an apology. And there may need

796
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:38,160
to be reparations from Lego because, ladies and gentlemen, they say Jabba the Hutt is

797
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:49,080
a Arab. Maybe Michael Moore. I mean, is the Goblin King supposed to be Rush Limbaugh?

798
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:54,180
I mean, does Rush Limbaugh get angry and go on the air and say, I'm gonna sue the makers

799
01:13:54,180 --> 01:14:00,240
of The Hobbit because that looks a little bit like me too. I don't mean to rush, the

800
01:14:00,240 --> 01:14:07,880
point is, that's it. That's it, let's put the Goblin King on air, okay?

801
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:11,440
People watching just Google the Goblin King, it looks a little bit like me, a little bit

802
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:17,520
like Rush Limbaugh in our heavier times. And that's it, I'm suing Lego. I'm announcing

803
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:23,400
it, I am suing Lego because my son has the Goblin King set as well. And I'm telling you,

804
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:25,240
it looks a little bit like me.

805
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:28,880
That's it, that's it, you're racist against white people. You're racist against white

806
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:35,040
guys that are a couple pounds overweight and have big heads, that's it. I am totally blown

807
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:41,840
away right now by, there it is. Look at that, they are making fun of me right there, click

808
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,300
it for people that are watching.

809
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:47,920
This is outrageous. That's me when I wake up in the morning and I've had too much to

810
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:54,800
drink. I mean, this is incredible, I am suing Lego. I want a press release right now. I

811
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,200
agree that the job of the hutch is supposed to be Muslims, it's obvious.

812
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,400
And it's obvious that the whole Return of the Jedi is to make fun of Muslims, it's absolutely

813
01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:07,520
proof. Even though it's a politically correct movie about integrating everybody, still it

814
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:12,620
doesn't matter. George Lucas should be arrested right now, he is a racist and gun owners should

815
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:14,600
be arrested because they're racist.

816
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:20,200
They're like Hitler, you hear it on every TV channel every day, everything, I agree.

817
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:26,400
Amazing, and by the way, if you're a new listener, I'm joking about the Goblin King stuff in

818
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:30,420
the lawsuit. The point is they really are looking at legal action in Austria over the

819
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:36,840
Star Wars job of the hut palace that I bought just about a week and a half ago for my son

820
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:37,840
at the Lego store.

821
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:43,400
Only reason to go to the mall is to go to the Lego store. The Turkish community said

822
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:49,840
the model was based on a mosque in Istanbul and that the accompanying figures depict Asians

823
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,240
and Orientals as people with deceitful and criminal personalities, the Turkish cultural

824
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,240
community.

825
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,880
Well, I guess Emperor Palpatine's meant to make white people look bad, I think this is

826
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:02,600
just total bull. Why is Mace Windu a good guy? He's a black guy, I thought mostly blacks

827
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:07,960
look bad, he's racist. The Turkish cultural community of Austria released a statement

828
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,920
calling for Lego to apologize for affronting religious and cultural feelings.

829
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:16,320
And they go on to say they believe that Jabba the Hutt is supposed to be a Muslim. I mean,

830
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:21,720
folks, this is so over the top, I just can't get over it, but they know what they're doing.

831
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:27,600
This is cultural Marxism, this is the type of control they admit they're using. Here's

832
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,920
an example, you use the word homosexual in a news article in England, you will be arrested

833
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,240
because they say the word homosexual offends people, even though it's the scientific name.

834
01:16:37,240 --> 01:16:41,120
If you use the term Caucasian now, they're saying it's racist cuz it's a racial name,

835
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:45,640
even though it's just a scientific designation, caucus mountains. If you use the word Negro,

836
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:51,540
which comes out of Latin for Negro or black, it has nothing to do with the N word.

837
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:55,840
People think it does, and they get in trouble. I've seen articles where they take people

838
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,720
to jail for using that word. It's amazing how they do this. And again, it's to get you

839
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:08,680
so scared, you won't talk. I better not have Hello Kitty bubble gum, it shoots bubbles

840
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:13,880
as evil. Better not buy my son a Nerf gun to play in the yard, the cops will come.

841
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:19,360
I better not, I better not, I better watch my speech, I better, I better. And the other

842
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:24,520
night on the nightly news, we had this quote that I was actually familiar with cuz I read

843
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:30,120
some of the writings over a decade ago, Sigmund Freud. What he says is totally true. You notice

844
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:35,400
people that are anti-gun always say we have the guns because we have small members.

845
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:43,600
Which is just absolutely asinine, guns are about self-defense. But Sigmund Freud said

846
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:49,400
a fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity. General introduction

847
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:54,560
to Psychoanalysis published 1920. And I read that book. That's why when I saw them, they

848
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,560
said, is this a real quote?

849
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:58,840
Well, it looked it up, confirmed it wasn't. No, actually, he does a whole chapter of how

850
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,800
ridiculous people are that are scared of weapons in the hands of citizens. He even talks about

851
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,240
when they see soldiers with guns, they're not scared cuz it's the state. They're scared

852
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,240
of other people having guns cuz they're scared of what they would do with guns.

853
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,760
That's why they're always talking about how they wanna kill people. Piers Morgan and Buzz

854
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,320
Bissinger and the rest of them because Bissinger on the show said, I'm mentally ill. I'm on

855
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,000
drugs. He said the next day when people said, why'd you say kill Alex? He goes, well, I'm

856
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:28,320
mentally ill. See, that's their excuse to be what they are because they are mentally

857
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,320
ill.

858
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,400
You understand? They don't want you having a gun cuz they're scared of a knife, the studies

859
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:38,960
show. I mean, I've been around liberals and people in college and pulled out a knife or

860
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,980
something to cut something. Watch out with that. I mean, they're just totally scared

861
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:43,980
of everything.

862
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:47,400
And then see, politically correct, Jacobson's like, man, I bet when you read that they're

863
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,320
gonna get politically correct. Retarded just means you didn't feed the bonsai tree enough

864
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:56,160
water so it's small. But the term becomes like a pejorative so they say, don't use it.

865
01:18:56,160 --> 01:19:00,680
Sigmund Freud says they have never developed their sexual and emotional maturity. And the

866
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:07,000
word to describe that is stunted or retarded. But see, my gosh, I hear about talk show hosts

867
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,080
getting fired for using the word.

868
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:18,760
See how we're losing our language? Can't say cockazoid, can't say oriental, they say that's

869
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,300
racist now. Everything, put suicide nets around the Apple factory with hundreds of people

870
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:27,080
jumping off of it where they have to put suicide nets up. That's no big deal. Fourth abortion's

871
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:28,880
no big deal.

872
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,880
You wanna inject a bunch of Guatemalan kids with syphilis and kill them, go ahead. That's

873
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:39,440
the government. But hey, Hello Kitty, bubble guns that shoot bubbles. You know what? Let's

874
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:44,480
call the cops. I mean, let's call them right now. Let's call them immediately. The way

875
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:49,760
to handle this political correctness is what's happened with these outdoor shows that banned

876
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:54,720
guns at them. Everybody just boycotted it, now it's been canceled. Okay, that's the answer.

877
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:59,440
They're trying to boycott us and have a revolution against us to shut us down. We shut them down.

878
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:00,960
It's us or them.

879
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,800
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

880
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,400
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

881
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:15,480
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

882
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,580
Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm

883
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:24,100
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

884
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,880
wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

885
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:34,520
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

886
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:39,120
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

891
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:10,560
Box. I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan

892
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,680
requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

893
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:20,260
President could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are

894
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:24,800
used around the world to keep people healthy. Now, you can protect yourself and your loved

895
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:30,480

01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:35,680
to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy,

897
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,920

Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors

907
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:38,360
won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry

908
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,980
won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments

909
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:49,760
yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

910
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:55,600
Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure

01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:58,920
your future and call 1-800-686-2237.

912
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:05,880
Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out

913
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:12,000
280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd

914
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:17,300
device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former

915
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:21,360
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning

916
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,200
about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.

917
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:30,920
It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend

918
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:37,000
just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors

919
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,680
off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover

920
01:23:42,680 --> 01:23:47,880
exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this

921
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:53,120
deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com

922
01:23:53,120 --> 01:24:10,080
before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com. James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project. You

923
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,960
know him from bringing down an acorn exposing Planned Parenthood, taking money to make sure

924
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:20,440
blacks get exterminated, and a lot more. Now they're going to anti-gunners houses and putting

925
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,880
up that it's a gun-free zone up front their house. So he's gonna be joining us in the

926
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:24,880
next hour.

927
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,360
We're going to your phone calls right now, but if you're watching on TV or a radio listener,

928
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:33,600
I'm not joking about the fact that they're talking about going after Lego and the Austrian

929
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,260
government and other areas because the Muslim groups say that the Jabba the Hutt is supposed

930
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:45,020
to be a Muslim. Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set, a set I own, that my son owns

931
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,320
and has nothing to do with it.

932
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,920
So I'm making the announcement. I believe the Goblin King, if Jabba the Hutt's supposed

933
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:56,920
to be Arabs, the Goblin King, I'm even a public figure versus just Muslims in general, and

934
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:02,540
I've had a little bit of jowls before being overweight and having a large head. So I believe

935
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:07,880
Lego, based in Europe, is racist and made the new Goblin King, even though he was described

936
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:11,920
in The Hobbit written 70 years ago or so, to look like this.

937
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:15,000
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if Star Wars was written back in the 70s. It has nothing

938
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,260
to do with Arabs. I am right now saying that is supposed to be Alex Jones. And I am going

939
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:27,160
to file suit on Lego for putting out a set to demean me and describe white people as

940
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:29,880
big and fat and ugly.

941
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:35,560
That's obviously me right there. And how dare them? Where do they make Lego? Is it the Fins

942
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:41,280
or the, yeah, Denmark, okay, the Danes. Well, that's it, they're racist towards white people,

943
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:47,040
and it's obvious. They've got white figures that are fat and ugly, and I'm going to sue

944
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:52,040
you. You are doing this to me. I'm filing a report with the FBI, and I'm going to the

945
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,040
cultural organization.

946
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:59,280
I'm going to the Austrian government too. How dare you? I think I'm going to put a press

947
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,440
release. I think I'm going to do that. I think I'll actually go and officially say, cuz you

948
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:08,280
know what? You're right, Jabba the Hutt is to make fun of Arabs. Shut Lego down, racist,

949
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:13,960
this is racist. Hello Kitty bubble guns, arrest the children, this is completely normal.

950
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:18,920
Blame all gun owners for bad people. Put everyone on Prozac so they kill more people, so the

951
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,760
psychiatrists get more money to put more people on it to kill more people. That's the answer.

952
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,960
I've been wrong all these years. The liberals are right. They're not authoritarians, they're

953
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:33,000
good people. They're right, gun owners are like Nazis. And we defeated Hitler, we can

954
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,320
defeat America.

955
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:38,920
I agree with all the people on MSNBC. I have been wrong, and I want to apologize here on

956
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:46,160
air right now. It's so obvious. My gosh, you can all sue. That looks like McAdoo, the one

957
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:53,640
with the beard. My gosh, it's racist towards, it's racist. My gosh, it looks like the crew.

958
01:26:53,640 --> 01:27:00,840
There's Wes right there. I mean, that's us. It's obvious, I'm suing. It's my gosh, Lego

959
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:07,200
is so evil. And it's copyright infringement. They've used my likeness without getting the

960
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,200
authorization.

961
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:14,240
You should know I actually played the goblin king. Good to see you today. I'm glad you

962
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:19,400
could drop by. Actually, I'm gonna assume over Jabba the Hutt too. That's actually meant

963
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:24,040
to make fun of me as well. I mean, just total mass liberal schizophrenia. But the establishment

964
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:31,120
knows. Teenage Jedi. You guys gave me some of the text of Jabba's talk, but I think it's

965
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:32,120
from one of the later movies.

966
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:37,640
Yeah, this is Phantom Menace. Yeah, I need him from Return of the Jedi if I'm gonna do

967
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:48,240
a. I actually need him going to actually do a better one. All right, that's enough, ladies

968
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,020
and gentlemen. If you just tuned in, I'm illustrating their absurdity by just showing how out of

969
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:58,540
control this is. And of course, Han Solo, punch it up, is shown as silver.

970
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:06,200
That's racism towards the Tin Man. That's why they did that. My gosh, whoa, whoa, better

971
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:14,840
have the owners of the franchise of the Yellow Brick Road, the Wizard of Oz sue immediately.

972
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:18,520
I just can't believe the racism that we're seeing. See, you're meant to look for all

973
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,560
this imaginary stuff. Well, meanwhile, they're taking everybody's rights and select corporations

974
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,640
are exempt from taxes, but you and I aren't.

975
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:29,080
That's the real discrimination, but they want us all fighting with each other, divide and

976
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:34,960
conquer. We're all a bunch of mentally ill twits obsessed with political correctness.

977
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:43,300
My dad, at one of his dental offices, bought a bunch of 1920s Art Deco Vogue art. And in

978
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:50,520
one hanging in a dark corner, in a hallway, it's from the 1920s and it's Vogue. And it's

979
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:55,640
a bunch of women dressed as flappers and one of them has a cigarette.

980
01:28:55,640 --> 01:29:00,200
And he's had now multiple people, we're talking about it again. One lady came to him and said,

981
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:05,800
I'm calling the police. It's illegal to show cigarette smoking. And he went, it's a museum

982
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:12,560
piece. And she just was freaking out and some other woman got mad. And imagine, this is

983
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:16,120
a poster with a woman about three, four inches tall.

984
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:22,280
You have the look of a bunch of people on it with a cigarette. And again, these people

985
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:25,500
want all the old movies banned cuz they show cigarettes. They already got most of the old

986
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:33,760
cartoons banned. They're gonna ban everything. These people are 1984 tyrants. They want control

987
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,760
of information.

988
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:38,980
I got a bunch of articles today where the EU is calling to be able to arrest any journalist

989
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:42,560
they want for any reason, if what they say is politically correct. In fact, that's on

990
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:47,520
infowars.com. I mean, it's out of control, I promise. Your calls on the other side of

991
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:50,160
this break.

992
01:29:50,160 --> 01:30:00,880
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

993
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,740
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

994
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:10,320
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

995
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:15,400
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

1009
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,520
gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver

1010
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:41,060
at the surface. But rather, we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing

1011
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:46,140
chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

1012
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:54,540
silver more effectively. Visit www.SilverLungs.com and click on our store page to find what silver-based

1014
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:31,540
Thank you.

1015
01:32:54,540 --> 01:33:01,540
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.

1016
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:37,440
Okay, folks, let's go to your phone calls. As promised, again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.

1017
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:43,240
The news websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and they are some of the biggest and most

1018
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:48,740
important and most accurate outposts out there trying to warn people about the incredible

1019
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:53,420
tyranny that we're going into. And again, if we succeed and hold back the tyranny, which

1020
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:58,940
we've done at many levels, then people say, there's no tyranny.

1021
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:03,780
But if we don't succeed, well, then the show will just get bigger and bigger and bigger

1022
01:34:03,780 --> 01:34:08,060
until it's finally shut down because we're going to see the tyranny expand. And that's

1023
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:14,220
why the show, the broadcast, the news organization is exploding right now is because the country

1024
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:18,580
is going to hell in a handbasket. And all the different tyrannies that I've warned you

1025
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:22,060
about are happening because the globalists write white papers.

1026
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:26,380
The Rand Corporation has been public about this. Dianne Feinstein has said she wants

1027
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:31,060
a total abolition of guns in the past. So has the Attorney General, so has Obama as

1028
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:36,300
a state senator. The UN treaty, the UN has said they want the abolition of civilian firearms

1029
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:40,580
on her ship because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of a state.

1030
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:49,300
That is a Unideer quote, July 7th, 2001, New York City, addendum to the treaty. I mean,

1031
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:53,180
I know their goal. I've read their book. I've read their handbook. It's kind of like the

1032
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:57,740
New England Patriots getting the playbooks and spying on the other team. They knew what

1033
01:34:57,740 --> 01:34:58,740
they were gonna do.

1034
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:03,820
I mean, I'm sitting here, they're not even hiding it. They've got a whole plan. And then

1035
01:35:03,820 --> 01:35:15,100
they've got every day I see CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, you name it, running around saying to everybody

1036
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:20,980
that gun owners, our Klan, our racists, our Nazis, we defeated Hitler, we can defeat them.

1037
01:35:20,980 --> 01:35:25,900
I mean, it's everywhere. You're seeing it. We're mass murderers. We're causing the deaths.

1038
01:35:25,900 --> 01:35:30,300
People have a right to have us not killing them as if our guns are killing them, not

1039
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,580
criminals.

1040
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:37,260
And this is an authoritarian takeover. And it's over the top because they're going for

1041
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:43,180
broke. Meanwhile, they're saying Southerners are crud. Southerners have to be overcome.

1042
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:47,140
The Constitution has to be overcome, Rangel and others. You go down to UT, talk to the

1043
01:35:47,140 --> 01:35:51,740
students, that's all. The Southerners must be overcome. We have video of them shot last

1044
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:57,180
week edited over the weekend that aired after Rangel, and it's girl after girl.

1045
01:35:57,180 --> 01:36:00,440
The Southerners have to be dealt with. They must have their guns taken. He will be our

1046
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:05,580
new Lincoln. I mean, this is the battle plan. And you're like, whoa, Southerner, I just

1047
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:09,420
want freedom. What's this about Southerner? You're gonna be the Southerner, all whites

1048
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:15,260
nationwide. You're the enemy, you did it. Unless you join us, well, okay, guns are bad.

1049
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:20,020
I join you, I admit I'm evil. Meanwhile, they're so politically correct, you can't have a job

1050
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:22,980
with a hut toy, that must mean he's an Arab.

1051
01:36:22,980 --> 01:36:26,620
As Ashenon is saying, I'm the Goblin King, or Rush Limbaugh is. And they're talking about

1052
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:35,360
going after Lego in Europe because of the new Lego set I just covered. Notice how you

1053
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:39,780
can't draw a gun. You can't have a bubble projector that looks like a gun with Hello

1054
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:45,500
Kitty. You can't have that. But we're gonna kill you, Piers Morgan says, and his other

1055
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:46,620
host.

1056
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:51,420
And we're gonna take your rights, and we're buying 1.6 billion bullets and militarizing

1057
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:56,660
police in black uniforms, marching like stormtroopers and federalizing everything. But we're liberal

1058
01:36:56,660 --> 01:37:02,560
and sweet, and you're a scumbag white person. I mean, they have white guys on, you've seen

1059
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,260
them on MSNBC, going whites are scum, southerners are trash.

1060
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:11,580
I mean, that's real bigoted attacks, real division. And a lot of whites are like, well,

1061
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:18,060
I wasn't racist, I got a lot of friends. But man, okay, you're saying it's a race war?

1062
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:22,500
You're making me do this? It's like prison. They send you to prison, it's how Wacken Hut

1063
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,140
and all other big correction systems have it.

1064
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:28,900
And it's shut up where, okay, you're white, you go in the white area. You're like, well,

1065
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:32,660
why do I go there? Well, you're gonna get killed if you don't. You're gonna get beat

1066
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:36,660
up, at least raped. You get in, they go, all right, we are the white supreme brotherhood,

1067
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:41,700
or we're the Aryan nations, or we're the brotherhood of Krom or whatever.

1068
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,000
And you're gonna deal drugs for us, and you're gonna do all this, or we're gonna let those

1069
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:51,140
folks kill you. And you've got the white supremacists, the black supremacists, the Hispanic supremacists,

1070
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:55,340
on the east and west coast, the Asian supremacists. Four different blocks in the prison, and they

1071
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:59,380
all go to the warden, and the drugs are brought in, and the whole thing's run that way.

1072
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:02,300
And if they want somebody politically killed, they just say, go ahead and take that guy

1073
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:08,060
out. Go ahead and take that guy out. And see, it's a prison culture. I mean, I see it on

1074
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:12,580
YouTube about, you don't wanna deal with the blacks and the Jews and kill them. They're

1075
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:17,020
gonna kill us. You're working for them. Yeah, I learned that. You go to their website or

1076
01:38:17,020 --> 01:38:20,220
their YouTube channel, and you'll hear them bragging, yeah, I've been in the pen for ten

1077
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,220
years for armed robbery.

1078
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:24,820
I don't know how to deal with it. I mean, I know who you guys are when I hear you, cuz

1079
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:28,580
you always talk about, yeah, I'd like to get you and rape you. It's always the standard,

1080
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:34,900
I'm gonna rape you, cuz you're an ex-con, okay? You were put into a college to be brainwashed,

1081
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:41,660
and you're tough cuz you got the prison tats and even, it's all social engineering.

1082
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:47,260
See, I know how it all works. It's the same thing with the Mexican extremists. You don't

1083
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:53,100
like it, we're taking over. When we get you, we're gonna rape you, Whitey. You're a convict.

1084
01:38:53,100 --> 01:39:00,060
See, my guns are to protect me from the government and their convict armies that they run. And

1085
01:39:00,060 --> 01:39:04,380
they run all the capos, the white supremacists they run, the black supremacists, the Mexican

1086
01:39:04,380 --> 01:39:06,740
supremacists, all government funded.

1087
01:39:06,740 --> 01:39:10,620
It's all come out on record, all of it, all of it. You're all government, you're a disgusting

1088
01:39:10,620 --> 01:39:15,220
disgrace. You're pathetic. You don't care about humankind, and it's all done under political

1089
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:22,060
correctness. All this racial harmony crud is absolute bull to make middle class, wealthy

1090
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:26,780
people. No matter what color you are, be all, I'm conforming, I'm not in part of any of

1091
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:28,980
all this racial stuff that's going on.

1092
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:32,820
I'm going to, okay, I said I go to your calls, I'm going to them right now. William, John,

1093
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:38,540
George, Jerome, Truth, Raider, and others, but this is what's going on. This is what's

1094
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:42,380
going on. I mean, I was at the airport about a year ago, a year and a half ago, flying

1095
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:43,380
back from the talker's conference.

1096
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:47,380
I don't think I've ever even told this story. Actually, I have, but Rob Dew was there. And

1097
01:39:47,380 --> 01:39:52,820
I guess this guy who I was, and he was a big white guy, tats all over him. I could tell

1098
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:56,700
convict type guy, and he comes over. He gets to my face, obviously knew who I was, it was

1099
01:39:56,700 --> 01:40:00,540
some kind of setup, and grabs my breast.

1100
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:06,420
That's what he called them, my pectorals, and twist them trying to get a response. And

1101
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:10,340
I knew it was a setup, and I could see cops and stuff about 50 feet away. I was like,

1102
01:40:10,340 --> 01:40:17,340
okay, this is all a setup. And he goes, I'd like to get you, I'd like to rape you.

1103
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:23,020
And I'm like, wow, they got a convict waiting for me at the Austin airport knowing I'm getting

1104
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:28,140
off. I mean, I guess I do gotta get bodyguards just to watch my back, just so people can't

1105
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:36,860
come up and do that. And he grabs me, total convict stuff, twist the skin on my pectorals,

1106
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:37,860
twist them.

1107
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:43,540
And then goes, I'd like to get you, I'd like to rape you. And he, I'd rape you. And that's

1108
01:40:43,540 --> 01:40:47,420
who they are. That's who they are. That's who they are. That's what they want. They

1109
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:52,060
want to dominate, they want to control. They can't invent things. They don't know beauty.

1110
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:55,500
They don't know strength. They don't know family. They never had a family. Their daddy

1111
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,500
beat them.

1112
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:00,820
They sat in a crib with flies all over them while mama smoked crack, or while mama did

1113
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:04,460
methamphetamine. And then they grew up and went to prison and learned to be a tough guy.

1114
01:41:04,460 --> 01:41:09,380
And now that's all they've got. I've got justice on my side. I would have climbed up on top

1115
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:14,020
of that guy and just rub his head right like that. You understand that, boy? You think

1116
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:15,020
you're tough?

1117
01:41:15,020 --> 01:41:18,940
The devil doesn't give you strength. Life gives you strength. You're weak and you're

1118
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:24,340
empty. And you grew up in crap filled diapers and I grew up with love. And that's why you

1119
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:28,780
think evil's giving you strength, because you're a pathetic little boy. All of you who

1120
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:33,660
serve evil, you're a joke. Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls. William in New

1121
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:36,700
York, you're on the air.

1122
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:41,740
That is good, Alex. I appreciate that. Listen, man, my family and I pray for you and your

1123
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:46,740
family every day. I appreciate everything you're doing for everybody. But listen, we're

1124
01:41:46,740 --> 01:41:52,060
in a hell of a jam here in New York. I mean, I'm getting sick of it. What do you suggest

1125
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:55,260
that, I mean, I know what I'm gonna do, but what do you suggest that people in New York

1126
01:41:55,260 --> 01:41:56,260
do about what's coming down?

1127
01:41:56,260 --> 01:42:00,460
I have to say we had a lot of affiliates in New York, great people in the big cities,

1128
01:42:00,460 --> 01:42:04,940
but also in the rural areas. I would leave. Or I would get super aggressive and try to

1129
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:10,780
repeal it, but exodus is always the best thing. And then, of course, they'll corner you somewhere

1130
01:42:10,780 --> 01:42:17,060
else. But I'm not a big fan of the small community that tries to go to the local system with

1131
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:20,140
bargaining power to be left alone.

1132
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:25,420
I think it's good to go to areas where people know about liberty and you know there's a

1133
01:42:25,420 --> 01:42:33,320
lot of liberty lovers. And so that will percolate out into the system. I would do like a lot

1134
01:42:33,320 --> 01:42:36,660
of New Yorkers are doing. Come to Texas, man. The New Yorkers I meet down here in Texas

1135
01:42:36,660 --> 01:42:40,900
are all great people. Californians are great people, but the really nasty ones are the

1136
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:42,740
socialists from California.

1137
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:46,780
And they've just overrun everything and are trying to take over. And they even talk about

1138
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:52,620
that. I mean, the agenda 21 shows a triangle map of San Antonio, Austin up to Dallas and

1139
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:57,020
Fort Worth and Houston. And they say we are taking these areas over. And they go into

1140
01:42:57,020 --> 01:43:01,980
government, they go into the meetings, they are there as brutal authoritarians to take

1141
01:43:01,980 --> 01:43:03,800
control.

1142
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,540
Wearing their camouflage of being liberals. What do you think of Feinstein as saying we're

1143
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,540
going to phase out your guns?

1144
01:43:09,540 --> 01:43:14,340
I hate it. I hate it to death. I mean, talking is over, Alex. I mean, I know you talk a lot

1145
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:19,940
about handling things through activism, rioting, protest, things of that nature. But I mean,

1146
01:43:19,940 --> 01:43:25,380
come on, talk is over. I mean, the talk key time, the only thing these barbarians understand

1147
01:43:25,380 --> 01:43:26,380
is aggression.

1148
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:31,500
Listen, I hear that, but they're losing politically. Obama wasn't really elected. They ran a fake

1149
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:35,660
guy against him. I'm seeing the numbers. A lot of you aren't public figures, you don't

1150
01:43:35,660 --> 01:43:41,380
know. I mean, I go sit in the hot spring on the Texas-Mexico border with 15 people wearing

1151
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:43,140
a ball cap.

1152
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:47,860
And one person hears my voice and goes, Alex Jones, next person, Alex Jones, Alex Jones,

1153
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:53,100
they were from New York, California, San Antonio, France. I come back the next day to the hot

1154
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:58,620
springs. Most of the people knew who I was. Everywhere I went, I'd be talking up on a

1155
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:02,100
mountaintop and somebody 50 feet down would go, is that Alex Jones?

1156
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:05,740
And I mean, let me tell you, the globalists are going for it all right now because they're

1157
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:09,500
a paper tiger. And I'm not bragging, hey, I'm this big shot, everybody knows who I am.

1158
01:44:09,500 --> 01:44:13,940
If people know who I am and then say they agree with me, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't

1159
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:19,020
matter, it shows. Now, obviously, that's gonna be a higher educated group that knows how

1160
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:22,340
to go find a hot springs in the middle of the desert somewhere.

1161
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:27,580
It's gonna be a more educated group climbing 8,000 foot mountains. But where you go and

1162
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:32,620
there's like middle class, upper middle class, but also some areas of blue collar. Where

1163
01:44:32,620 --> 01:44:38,060
you find highly educated liberal idiots, they will spout Marxism and not even know it's

1164
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:43,340
Karl Marx. And they're in their own world, man, and they are openly saying Obama is Lincoln

1165
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:44,940
and is going to conquer us.

1166
01:44:44,940 --> 01:44:49,060
You can look it up, I mean, they're coming. So I hear what you're saying, but they wanna,

1167
01:44:49,060 --> 01:44:53,860
they provocateur events like Oklahoma City because they can't win the cultural debate

1168
01:44:53,860 --> 01:45:00,100
with us. So whoever fires first loses, that's why they're gonna fire and say we did it or

1169
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:03,660
push people into a corner and get them to fire, okay?

1170
01:45:03,660 --> 01:45:08,900
So it's like, I don't want it to go to the shooting war, they want it to. So does that

1171
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:11,860
tell you a shooting war is a good thing, William?

1172
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:16,820
I'm really frustrated with the pain for our catered weapons and more security.

1173
01:45:16,820 --> 01:45:23,700
What would have happened when that guy grabbed my pectorals and tried to rip my, well, you

1174
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:27,820
know what they're called, I'm gonna stand on radio. Did a you know what twister on me.

1175
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:33,260
What would have happened if I would have attacked the convict?

1176
01:45:33,260 --> 01:45:38,860
Yeah, that wouldn't end well. Yeah, no, no, they were gonna have their victory. They had

1177
01:45:38,860 --> 01:45:42,140
a convict and it's on record, the police were ready to arrest him after the whole stage

1178
01:45:42,140 --> 01:45:43,140
thing happened.

1179
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:49,700
He was like, what? Hey guys, come on, it was a wink wink. But I was smart enough cuz the

1180
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:52,980
cops that were there watching it, they left when it happened and I didn't take the bait.

1181
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:56,180
And then I went and called the TSA all that freaked out and was watching and called other

1182
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:58,940
people and this all happened on record.

1183
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,860
That's why that, well, anyways, it's a side issue, but they don't like me too much over

1184
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:06,460
there. I have to go to the lion's den every time I fly. I mean, they were planning, see,

1185
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:11,580
I knew, I mean, it hurt when the guy did it, it hurt real bad. He grabbed and twisted as

1186
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,420
hard as he could, a full grown man.

1187
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:17,500
And I just cut off the pain and went, what's your problem? You're gonna get in a lot of

1188
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:20,380
trouble for that. He couldn't believe I just stood there totally calmly. I just turned

1189
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:27,820
it off. Okay, just turn the pain off. So what are you gonna do? And then he called me a

1190
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:31,580
wimp and said he was gonna rape me and all this waiting for me to do something.

1191
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:38,340
And again, ABC Nightline implied that I have fake anger. No, I just let myself, where I'm

1192
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:42,500
somewhat safe here, then I can show you what I really think. But out there, I know when

1193
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:46,120
to hold them, I know when to fold them, I know when to walk away, I know when to run.

1194
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:49,140
You never count your money when you're sitting at the table. There'll be time enough for

1195
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:53,100
counting when the dealing's done. And the money I'm after is liberty. The goal I'm after

1196
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:55,020
is freedom and defeating these globalists.

1197
01:46:55,020 --> 01:47:00,620
I take it personal, the children they brain damage with vaccines and GMO. I take it personal,

1198
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:05,080
the children they abort. I take it personal, cuz you know why? It is personal. I'm a human

1199
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:11,260
being and I have an allegiance to humanity and the God that created us. God gives you

1200
01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:14,540
life and joy and children and everything wholesome.

1201
01:47:14,540 --> 01:47:19,220
The devil gives you death and destruction and poverty and pain. And the New World Order

1202
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:24,020
is the devil. Let's go ahead and talk to John in Pennsylvania. You're on the air.

1203
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:29,980
Hey, Alex, thanks for listening to me. I just wanna thank you for being who you are and

1204
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:32,060
also all those info warriors out there.

1205
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:34,140
Well, thank you, brother.

1206
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:39,540
Basically, what I was calling about is just, I'm just sticking here and all this spin.

1207
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:45,180
And they keep on comparing the United States with other countries. I think, first of all,

1208
01:47:45,180 --> 01:47:49,620
the United States became the great country that it is today because of what we stand

1209
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:52,420
for, not what other countries stand for.

1210
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:58,140
Absolutely. I mean, did you go read the Daily Beast article that said, peers pressure? Or

1211
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:01,340
it said it's good to have the Chinese and the Russians and peers telling us what to

1212
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:02,340
do.

1213
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:07,580
This is globalization 2.0. Let Alex prepare his flamethrower. We're coming for him. And

1214
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:12,140
the ABC Nightline says Alex is now under very serious scrutiny. And they're saying they

1215
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:18,100
wanna kill me and that my kids hope they're safe at night. I mean, that's who they are.

1216
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:22,740
Look, guys, I know you're a bunch of gangster thugs or a bunch of wannabes. I get that I'm

1217
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:28,660
in danger. And that's the point. I know America is in danger. And yes, they're trying to get

1218
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:32,860
us used to foreigners telling us what to do under global government.

1219
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:39,740
Yep. Also, also the fact is that, you know, they're using the oldest strategy, the divide

1220
01:48:39,740 --> 01:48:44,580
and conquer, you know, mind, body, spirit. We've been hit with that. I mean, I hate to

1221
01:48:44,580 --> 01:48:48,860
be redundant, but you've said it time and time again. As far as everyone who's listening,

1222
01:48:48,860 --> 01:48:53,540
the ones that are awake need to wake up the ones that are sleeping. And the spin is the

1223
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:57,660
way they're doing it, divide and conquer. They wanna keep on pulling the Americans away

1224
01:48:57,660 --> 01:49:02,220
from each other. And we have to keep on using our voices and get out there and support our

1225
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:08,020
local gun shops and speak to our neighbors and get out there and not text.

1226
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:12,100
Because if we're using the technology, don't take it from us, too.

1227
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:18,100
Well, we need to engage with the latest technology, but also engage with low tech and build multiple

1228
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:22,540
pillars, multiple tentacles against the enemy. We need to move against them on every front

1229
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:26,700
as they've moved against us. Listen, if somebody doesn't sell so-called semi-autos, assault

1230
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:31,340
rifles, boycott them. I mean, I'll never go into exporting goods again.

1231
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:37,780
And I've been in there and bought stuff. I will never support anybody. I mean, here's

1232
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:42,780
the article, NRA Boycott Kills Outdoor Show That Banned Assault Weapons. The massive boycotts

1233
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:47,700
sparked by NRA and other gun rights outraged by the nation's largest outdoor show.

1234
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:51,300
Banned the exhibition of assault weapons has caused the show organizers to abruptly cancel

1235
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:55,500
the week-long event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It's gone on forever. It's the Reed exhibitions.

1236
01:49:55,500 --> 01:50:02,780
I mean, it's over. And listen, they want to intimidate us, take our language. I mean,

1237
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:06,580
how mad does it make you? I don't care where you live. I mean, I always see these comments

1238
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:10,660
in YouTube going, you dumb southerner, Texan, you pathetic gun owner.

1239
01:50:10,660 --> 01:50:13,820
And I always see folks, I'm from New York, I'm from California. It isn't about being

1240
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:18,060
a southerner owning guns. See how they try to play that game and then say southerners

1241
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:23,700
are racist. I mean, southerners, I mean, how many blacks in the South own guns? It's all

1242
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:30,860
over generalizations. Can you imagine if I came out and said New Yorkers are scum, I

1243
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,500
mean, what the media would do with that?

1244
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:37,100
Imagine they're on TV calling everybody in the South scum. What do you make of that?

1245
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:42,980
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, what I'm saying is basically as far as like they got to stop

1246
01:50:42,980 --> 01:50:47,340
these puppets. They think these puppets think that they've had loss. They don't know what

1247
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:50,740
loss is until they've seen it, because I've seen it.

1248
01:50:50,740 --> 01:50:55,260
I've watched my family systematically get killed in another country.

1249
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:58,020
I want to hear this from you when we come back. I want to hear about your family. Stay

1250
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:01,020
there.

1251
01:51:01,020 --> 01:51:05,860
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters

1252
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:10,460
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1253
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:15,380
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

1254
01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:19,620
Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather a life storm

1255
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:24,140
by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City

1256
01:51:24,140 --> 01:51:29,820
wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time

1257
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:34,580
to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

1258
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:39,180
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

1262
01:52:00,540 --> 01:52:04,380
My name is Steven Heuer. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that

1263
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:09,100
most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So

1264
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:13,200
whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters

1265
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:17,580
like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's

1266
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:22,620
brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number

1267
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:28,060
one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production. My name is Angie and my son has

1268
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:33,460
suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got him on One World Way and in two months

1269
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:38,380
his constipation is gone. He's become friendlier. He can carry on a normal conversation with

1270
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:42,860
me and he has made his first friend. He's doing great and he looks forward to taking

1271
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:48,220
One World Way every day. You could offer him a present or a cake and he would prefer the

1272
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:57,300
One World Way. Go to OneWorldWay.com. That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com or call 888-988-3325.

1273
01:52:57,300 --> 01:53:06,780
That's 888-988-3325. You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa where a nicely

1274
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:13,420
furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

1275
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:19,580
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins. You're on a golden stag safari for

1276
01:53:19,580 --> 01:53:27,020
big game. But it's not Africa, it's Argentina. One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo,

1277
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:34,140
huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America. All gold medal

1278
01:53:34,140 --> 01:53:41,860
quality. All the action you can handle. Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food,

1279
01:53:41,860 --> 01:53:47,500
beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included, and more. All more affordable than

1280
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:55,180
you can imagine. The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com. The big game

1281
01:53:55,180 --> 01:54:12,220
hunting ranch. GoldenStagSafaris.com.

1282
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:34,060
We're back live. We're gonna go back to John and then George, Jerome, Truth, Raider. We'll

1283
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:38,380
get to all of you before our guest comes on. Briefly, I wanna do a big roll out on this

1284
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:46,340
tomorrow. This has been two years in development. A anti fluoride filter and heavy metal filter

1285
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:55,620
in the regular silver-based ceramic filter in one. And if you go to Infowarsstore.com,

1286
01:54:55,620 --> 01:54:57,900
you can see the roll out with Propure.

1287
01:54:57,900 --> 01:55:02,620
By the way, we're discounting at 10% out of the gates. Normally, people don't do that.

1288
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:05,660
And we don't do like Walmart where we increase the price and then discount it to say it's

1289
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:12,980
a discount or others have been caught doing. You can get the new all-in-one filters made

1290
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:17,460
in England, developed by scientists here in the United States. This is what I use. It

1291
01:55:17,460 --> 01:55:25,500
has just come out. It is amazing. No priming required. The new filters are available. It's

1292
01:55:25,500 --> 01:55:28,500
called ProOne from Propure.

1293
01:55:28,500 --> 01:55:35,060
And it fits into all of your Propure units. No one else has this. And it also takes out

1294
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:39,900
the hydrofluorosolic acid base that the other filters don't. And all the scientific data

1295
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:44,420
and side-by-side comparisons are up on the site and the studies. And it also cuts out

1296
01:55:44,420 --> 01:55:52,540
the sodium hexafluorosilicate, which is the real stuff they're putting in the water.

1297
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:56,160
The truth is most other fluoride filters, and we've sold these too, only reduce it and

1298
01:55:56,160 --> 01:56:02,380
they don't get out a lot of the acid-based systems. But this does. It's the new Propure

1299
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:07,460
ProOne available at Infowarsstore.com. And your purchase supports the broadcast or call

1300
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:16,500
888-253-3139, 888-253-3139. Two years in development. In fact, I was first talking to Propure when

1301
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:20,580
they were starting this development. It took them two years to get it all certified, made.

1302
01:56:20,580 --> 01:56:24,220
They can only get it made in England because of the high-tech process. England's always

1303
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:27,380
been at the top of the chain when it comes to water purification because their empire

1304
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:28,380
needed purified water.

1305
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:32,460
The point is they've got the factories that can make this. So designed in the US, made

1306
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:38,020
in England, and it's available right now at Infowarsstore.com. Okay, tell folks, and I've

1307
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:44,820
talked to so many people from Ukraine, people from China, people from other areas of Eastern

1308
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:49,380
Europe, where they come and take the guns, and then next, your family starts disappearing.

1309
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:53,780
Stalin did that, took them to the 30s to start getting the guns, and then it was a mass culling.

1310
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:55,260
Tell folks what happened to your family.

1311
01:56:55,260 --> 01:57:01,600
Okay, Alex, all I can say is the cost of disarming the people psychologically, physically, spiritually

1312
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:08,180
is staggering. And those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it because

1313
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:13,860
I've experienced it myself, and the government is probably, you know, although they've given

1314
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:18,140
me a new identity here in the United States, and I always promised myself I would never

1315
01:57:18,140 --> 01:57:22,540
get involved, but it's come to this where I need to speak out because my children's

1316
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:28,360
future are at stake. But, I mean, they're hoping that, you know, those who have died

1317
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:33,420
in the Vietnam War and those who are still alive are maybe too old to fight, but guess

1318
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:38,540
what? There's still voices out there, and I'm one of the voices that, I've experienced

1319
01:57:38,540 --> 01:57:39,540
it.

1320
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:41,540
What happened to your family?

1321
01:57:41,540 --> 01:57:47,820
Well, my grandfather was assassinated, and my whole family, we're only three of us that

1322
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:52,260
are survivors here in the United States, but all of them were systematically killed trying

1323
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:58,940
to leave the country, trying to speak up for their rights, and basically, you know, it's

1324
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:03,540
terrible. And if people don't wake up now to see this, they're gonna be-

1325
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:06,580
Where were you, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia?

1326
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:08,700
Oh, yeah, Vietnam.

1327
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:14,340
Vietnam, oh, so your family was trying to get out, what, in the early 70s?

1328
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:17,580
Yes, sir.

1329
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:22,380
And was this after they left Saigon, or was this before you couldn't get out?

1330
01:58:22,380 --> 01:58:27,940
This is after, or actually at the end of the, where they were starting to pull out everyone.

1331
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:33,420
And of course, for those that don't know that they said, the North Vietnamese, turn your

1332
01:58:33,420 --> 01:58:37,020
guns in, we'll give you amnesty. What happened when you turned the guns in? We're gonna come

1333
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:38,500
back to you after this.

1347
02:00:23,660 --> 02:00:28,780
Coming up in the start of the next segment, James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project. You

1348
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:32,540
know him from bringing down A-Kern and so much more. Going to be joining us. We're taking

1349
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:36,580
a few more of your calls right now. You know, they took the guns in Turkey and then killed

1350
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:40,740
over a million Armenians after they took their guns. That's just one of the smaller cases.

1351
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:44,900
Paul Pot, the list goes on and on. Hitler, Stalin. But you're saying your family was

1352
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:50,460
in southern Vietnam after the US pullout. And I've read the history. Tell people briefly,

1353
02:00:50,460 --> 02:00:54,460
John, then we'll go to others. The history of what happened. Because I remember reading,

1354
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:58,420
they told people turn your guns in, we'll give you an amnesty, everything's fine. What

1355
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:00,420
happened once the guns were turned in?

1356
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:06,820
Well, they systematically started killing everyone that was against the government.

1357
02:01:06,820 --> 02:01:15,300
Basically I was born in Da Nang and my grandfather was a politician there and he was killed publicly.

1358
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:24,980
And the rest of our family was killed for being part of the family. It's just the loss.

1359
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:29,140
People don't realize the loss that they're gonna experience if they follow through and

1360
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:31,180
they don't speak up now and pull together.

1361
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:35,700
By the way, I've been around all these so-called leftists. They say the plan is to kill us

1362
02:01:35,700 --> 02:01:39,580
once they get our guns. I mean, these are monsters. These are not liberals.

1363
02:01:39,580 --> 02:01:44,460
The war's already been on. You're absolutely right. I mean, they've been working on us

1364
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:49,380
psychologically, spiritually, and physically. And as an educator, I'm telling you, I know

1365
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:55,060
I work with IDD children. And I'm telling you, there's no way in heck a couple that

1366
02:01:55,060 --> 02:01:59,060
are healthy and everything, and they keep on telling you that, oh, it's genetics. It's

1367
02:01:59,060 --> 02:02:00,060
not genetics.

1368
02:02:00,060 --> 02:02:04,780
There's something that they're doing. It's a slow kill. And this is a culling, cull,

1369
02:02:04,780 --> 02:02:11,660
whatever you like. But it's a depopulation program that has been going on for years.

1370
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:17,220
And it's ridiculous. And I'm just at the point where the best defense right now is to speak

1371
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:22,940
out and everybody needs to get out and talk to your neighbors and get everybody on board.

1372
02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:27,860
No, you're right. The globalists are all obsessed with organic and purified water. They won't

1373
02:02:27,860 --> 02:02:33,260
eat anything, the GMO, the vaccines. It's all a giant eugenics operation. God bless

1374
02:02:33,260 --> 02:02:36,580
you, and thanks for your testimony. George in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding here on

1375
02:02:36,580 --> 02:02:41,300
the air. Go ahead. What do you think of Feinstein and Cummings for all the semi-autos and more?

1376
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:47,020
I'd like to cover one other thing first. On the vaccines, the government has a website,

1377
02:02:47,020 --> 02:02:55,300
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS at HHS.gov, where if you have problems with

1378
02:02:55,300 --> 02:02:57,960
the vaccine, you're supposed to report it.

1379
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:01,460
But no one knows that, so they don't report it. Or if they do, they try to cover it up

1380
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,460
quietly, yes.

1381
02:03:02,460 --> 02:03:06,500
You might have a link on your site. One other thing about the vaccines, there's a group

1382
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:15,020
of mostly physicians with vaccine-damaged children, autism.com. That's Autism Research

1383
02:03:15,020 --> 02:03:18,900
Institute and it has a lot of listings there on things you can do when the kids do get

1384
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:25,300
damaged with vaccines, how to recover them, at least partially.

1385
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:32,100
Second thing is we need to group together. I agree with that. And I think maybe political

1386
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:36,180
correctness on your part would be a good thing. How about a constitutional recovery fund or

1387
02:03:36,180 --> 02:03:42,340
something to curb the illegal activities of the judges and the politicians?

1388
02:03:42,340 --> 02:03:45,500
We still have a process in place and I think we could be using it if you-

1389
02:03:45,500 --> 02:03:51,420
Well, look, they're on the news saying all gun owners are racist scum. The entire South

1390
02:03:51,420 --> 02:03:55,940
is filth, but then they're the politically correct people. No, they're a bunch of political

1391
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:59,660
monsters obsessing on race cuz they use it as a weapon.

1392
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:05,000
I mean, Lego can't even put out Jabba the Hutt toys now without the Muslims in Europe

1393
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:12,260
saying it's racist. I mean, this is a way to attack us and tell us we're bad. And I'm

1394
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:17,980
not bashing Muslims in general, the politically correct type. This is a cultural domination.

1395
02:04:17,980 --> 02:04:22,340
And then they're like, hey, be nice, have some hospitality, let the globalists run over

1396
02:04:22,340 --> 02:04:23,340
you.

1397
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:26,900
We've got to get angry and get out of a cowed position. They're always telling us we're

1398
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:31,820
suspect, we're racist, we're bad, we have guilt, we've done something wrong. Give them

1399
02:04:31,820 --> 02:04:37,420
control because we're bad. Let them in, let them boss us, give us their money. They're

1400
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:42,140
intimidating us until we get into them.

1401
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:46,260
Because the government's run by a bunch of raging criminals. And I hear you, I don't

1402
02:04:46,260 --> 02:04:50,140
know how it's politically correct to have a constitution recovery fund. Okay, our guest

1403
02:04:50,140 --> 02:04:54,220
is coming up, most of you know who they are, I'm just so excited to get them on. James

1404

02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:27,020
patriots worldwide Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, blasting out on XM

1441
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:32,960
over 140 a.m. and having affiliates the internet at info wars.com and prison planet.com streaming

1442
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:40,860
video at prison planet.tv and info wars, nightly news info wars news.com. Now I got to play

1443
02:08:40,860 --> 02:08:45,380
a few clips to introduce this guy and for whatever reason over the years I tried to

1444
02:08:45,380 --> 02:08:52,380
get him on, didn't get connected, but we've got him on now.

1445
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:58,140
And everybody listening probably knows who this individual is or you know his work and

1446
02:08:58,140 --> 02:09:03,220
this is the model. I've done a lot of similar things over the years when I was just out

1447
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:09,100
doing investigations, but none of them ever exploded like this. But we had some big victories.

1448
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:14,500
And this guy and his team is the model. In fact, I just want to say on air, I haven't

1449
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:19,220
told him this shit. He ought to make a how to be a real muckraking journalist for Liberty.

1450
02:09:19,220 --> 02:09:25,380
He'll make a film about it, showing how it's done because what he does, the corrupt that

1451
02:09:25,380 --> 02:09:30,260
run this system and I've said this for many years. You can, let me introduce our guest

1452
02:09:30,260 --> 02:09:32,680
here in a moment and play some clips first.

1453
02:09:32,680 --> 02:09:38,220
You can go and fight the globalist, the collectivist, especially Democrats for whatever reason.

1454
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:42,760
You can go follow them in their car when they're doing corrupt things and they will always

1455
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:47,540
be doing something horrible. I mean, it's hard to not catch them. I've caught bribery

1456
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:52,540
at the state capitol, just goes on everywhere, paying guys cash. The bill got defeated. It

1457
02:09:52,540 --> 02:09:57,900
was in the front page of the newspaper and that was back in 1999, just type in Alex Jones

1458
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,020
catches bribery.

1459
02:09:59,020 --> 02:10:06,060
I've done more than 50 or 60 things just like this. Not because I'm some great investigator,

1460
02:10:06,060 --> 02:10:13,020
the corrupt do this right out in front of you, okay? The corrupt do this right out in

1461
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:19,140
front of you and you've just got to go out and expose them and have the courage. But

1462
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:21,340
if we just engage these people, it's over.

1463
02:10:21,340 --> 02:10:26,220
James O'Keefe is the president of Project Veritas. I was saying Veritas Project, no

1464
02:10:26,220 --> 02:10:31,780
teleprompter. James O'Keefe is a graduate of Rutgers University. He has received a congressional

1465
02:10:31,780 --> 02:10:36,540
resolution praising him for his work and a receipt, a recipient of the Robert Novak Award

1466
02:10:36,540 --> 02:10:38,860
for journalistic excellence.

1467
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:45,460
He's best well known for the 2009 Acorn investigation, which exposed systematic corruption in multiple

1468
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:49,540
offices, different cities, different areas. You walk in and go, I have an underage prostitute

1469
02:10:49,540 --> 02:10:52,780
I snuck in the country. We're gonna play a clip of that. And I want to sell her out.

1470
02:10:52,780 --> 02:10:56,960
How do I keep her under the radar? Well, just make sure you put her in school so the government

1471
02:10:56,960 --> 02:11:03,660
gets theirs, but everything's fine. Gonna pimp her good. And forced the group to be

1472
02:11:03,660 --> 02:11:07,020
disbanded, losing them millions of dollars a year, and that was one of their big syndicate

1473
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:08,020
takeovers.

1474
02:11:08,020 --> 02:11:14,180
He's also exposed to NPR. The sting involved NPR executive Ron Shiller and senior director

1475
02:11:14,180 --> 02:11:20,580
Betsy Lilly. The two agreed to receive 5 million donation from a fictitious Muslim organization.

1476
02:11:20,580 --> 02:11:24,820
The two executives later resigned. The House of Representatives voted to defund NPR. And

1477
02:11:24,820 --> 02:11:29,520
again, folks, people don't believe I snuck into Bohemian Grove. They just can't believe

1478
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,140
I got in there and did it.

1479
02:11:31,140 --> 02:11:38,260
You've never tried things. People can't believe. You have power is my point. That's what I

1480
02:11:38,260 --> 02:11:42,300
want you to understand. You are the ones that are gonna defeat these people. And the model

1481
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:49,100
is somebody like James O'Keefe. The project veritas.org, theprojectveritas.org. And of

1482
02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:53,680
course it's supported by patriots like you, so go there and do that.

1483
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:58,100
Through Project Veritas, James has personally trained and equipped dozens of citizen journalists

1484
02:11:58,100 --> 02:12:03,780
in an effort to create transparency in government and spending. And of course, that's what their

1485
02:12:03,780 --> 02:12:07,840
job is. But I'm saying put it out to everybody, which I know they've done some of. Now let's

1486
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,540
play something he's not well known for.

1487
02:12:09,540 --> 02:12:14,160
And since then, there's new clips of Christians going up to abortionist and saying, hey, let

1488
02:12:14,160 --> 02:12:19,120
us adopt the babies. And they go, you don't want the ugly black babies. But you're racist

1489
02:12:19,120 --> 02:12:22,500
if you don't want them aborted. Remember that, cuz it's racist, don't wanna save them. And

1490
02:12:22,500 --> 02:12:25,860
it's racist if you don't like the communist Chinese and apple suicide nets if you wanna

1491
02:12:25,860 --> 02:12:28,580
save the Chinese little girls.

1492
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:32,500
You're liberal if you just let them all die. See, the liberals are eugenicist. I made the

1493
02:12:32,500 --> 02:12:36,260
film Endgame, exposing that. So let's go to this first clip, then a short clip of the

1494
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:42,740
next, then we'll do the rest of the hour with our guests. But it's so exciting, okay, because

1495
02:12:42,740 --> 02:12:44,940
I've been doing this type of thing for 17 years.

1496
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:47,860
He's been doing it, I don't know, for six, seven years. We're gonna talk to him in a

1497
02:12:47,860 --> 02:12:54,740
moment, James O'Keefe of theprojectveritas.org. But let's go ahead and go to this first clip

1498
02:12:54,740 --> 02:12:59,900
of him calling in to Planned Parenthood. This has been duplicated by others. Planned Parenthood

1499
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:05,500
was set up to, quote, kill the black weeds, Margaret Sanger, John D Rockefeller.

1500
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:06,500
Let's go ahead and play the clip.

1501
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:36,380
Afternoon, this is Autumn. Hello, Autumn. I mentioned making a donation today. Fantastic. What about abortions for the underprivileged minority groups? Oh, absolutely. We have, in fact, wonderful, fantastic news. We just received a very generous donation to our Women in Need fund. Wonderful. I wanna specify that abortion can help a minority group. Would that be possible? Absolutely. Like the black community, for example? Certainly. Okay. So the abortion could be, you know, I could give

1502
02:13:36,380 --> 02:13:41,660
money specifically for a black baby. That would be the purpose. Yeah, absolutely. If

1503
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:47,300
you wanted to designate that you wanted your gift to be used to help an African American

1504
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:53,180
woman in need, then we would certainly make sure that that gift was earmarked specifically

1505
02:13:53,180 --> 02:13:58,020
for that purpose. Great. Because I really face trouble with affirmative action and I

1506
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:02,500
don't want my kids being disadvantaged, you know, against black kids. I just had a baby.

1507
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:09,260
I want to put it in his name, you know. So that's definitely possible. Oh, always, always.

1508
02:14:09,260 --> 02:14:15,780
So I just wanted, can I put this in the name of my son? Absolutely. The name of my son,

1509
02:14:15,780 --> 02:14:22,980
great. He's trying to get into colleges. All right, let's stop right there. You know, and

1510
02:14:22,980 --> 02:14:28,460
you can go online and go to the Veritas project and see that report in full and others. And

1511
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:34,340
I have protested back when I had more time to do it. I'm protesting on air now, abortion

1512
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:40,620
clinics. And here in Austin, also in Dallas, and I've had them walk up to me and they go,

1513
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:42,420
no one wants these black babies.

1514
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:46,740
These people are a problem. And I'm telling you, most liberals at that level are not liberals.

1515
02:14:46,740 --> 02:14:51,060
These are flaming racist. See, real racists aren't wearing Klan outfits. Usually those

1516
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:58,340
are feds, you know, meaning to make gun owners racist or something. The real ones are trendies.

1517
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:03,140
I want to go to our guest. We'll play the famous clip of him dressed as a 70s pimp.

1518
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:07,540
Totally obvious with an underage girl telling him she's underage. And discussing how to

1519
02:15:07,540 --> 02:15:12,420
get the tax exemptions and things for his pimping operation and how to run little girls

1520
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:16,980
into the US. We've all seen that, so I won't play it now. We'll get to it later in some

1521
02:15:16,980 --> 02:15:17,980
other clips.

1522
02:15:17,980 --> 02:15:22,500
James O'Keefe, great to have you on. Again, I just salute you. You were on The Nightly

1523
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:27,180
News with Sha'Carri Jackson last week. You just heard the comments I made about liberals

1524
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:31,580
saying how much they want to kill the black people while saying all gun owners are racist

1525
02:15:31,580 --> 02:15:33,900
against blacks.

1526
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:37,700
How did you wake up to all of this? And let's just get into where you see the state of this

1527
02:15:37,700 --> 02:15:38,900
country right now.

1528
02:15:38,900 --> 02:15:43,980
Well, Alex, I think I was going to be on your show five or six years ago. We did that Planned

1529
02:15:43,980 --> 02:15:50,460
Parenthood investigation with a young woman named Lila Rose. And we called up, I'd say

1530
02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:56,420
about seven or eight Planned Parenthoods across the country. And I heard about Margaret Sanger,

1531
02:15:56,420 --> 02:16:03,580
who was a eugenicist back in the early part of the 20th century. And we called up these

1532
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:07,460
Planned Parenthoods. And right before you cut the clip, the vice president of Planned

1533
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:13,620
Parenthood actually said that it's understandable and exciting to abort black children. Because

1534
02:16:13,620 --> 02:16:17,060
I said there were too many, I was acting, I said there were too many black people in

1535
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:20,420
this country and we need to abort them, is what I said to Planned Parenthood. And the

1536
02:16:20,420 --> 02:16:25,300
vice president of Planned Parenthood resigned. And it was a national story at the time. And

1537
02:16:25,300 --> 02:16:29,980
that kind of got me into thinking that the way to expose malfeasance and corruption and

1538
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:36,380
fraud is to kind of just take it right to them and make them live up to their own principles.

1539
02:16:36,380 --> 02:16:40,140
And that's sort of what we do at Project Veritas. We make people live up to their own book of

1540
02:16:40,140 --> 02:16:44,900
rules, which is right out of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals.

1541
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:48,620
I remember, in fact, I interviewed people six or seven years ago about this. Have I

1542
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:50,420
interviewed you then?

1543
02:16:50,420 --> 02:16:54,140
We were gonna connect and for whatever reason, we just didn't connect.

1544
02:16:54,140 --> 02:16:57,860
I just remember playing the clip at the time because, listen, it's not like you're trying

1545
02:16:57,860 --> 02:17:02,340
to find a four-leaf clover and there's only a few of them that are eugenicist. I'm saying

1546
02:17:02,340 --> 02:17:08,260
about 80% of mid-level or higher ups I run into will go, listen, we gotta get rid of

1547
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:12,140
these black people. Stop protesting. What's wrong with you? You're white.

1548
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:16,260
And now more and more videos of that have surfaced. You don't want ugly black babies.

1549
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:20,920
The point is, I want the left out there, the mainline left who's idiots to understand.

1550
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:24,340
These people are monsters. Go ahead.

1551
02:17:24,340 --> 02:17:29,620
We found it. I mean, it's all on tape. I let the people speak for themselves. We call the

1552
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:34,980
New Mexico Clinic. This is Planned Parenthood, New Mexico. And when I said, and I'm acting,

1553
02:17:34,980 --> 02:17:39,660
of course, I'm acting like a racist, and I say, well, you know, it's just, it's terrible

1554
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:44,820
what's going on in our country with black people and affirmative action. And this Planned

1555
02:17:44,820 --> 02:17:49,780
Parenthood vice president said to me in New Mexico, she said, it's a strange time for

1556
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:55,260
sure. And this is what she's caught on tape saying when she does not know that she's being

1557
02:17:55,260 --> 02:17:59,940
videotaped. And it really cuts to the heart and soul. Why do they put all the clinics

1558
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:04,980
in the inner city neighborhoods? And what's really remarkable, Alex, is that the media

1559
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:10,720
tries to ignore it. But the good thing about Project Veritas is we, because we get results,

1560
02:18:10,720 --> 02:18:15,160
because these people resign or they're forced to resign, the Associated Press does not have

1561
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:19,580
a choice but to write coverage about it. And that's how it kind of gets it. And Lila has

1562
02:18:19,580 --> 02:18:24,460
gone on to do a lot of other videos. She did a video on Planned Parenthood and statutory

1563
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:29,680
rape. That got on CBS News. So the interesting thing about what we do as citizen journalists

1564
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:33,700
is that we force this stuff into the mainstream media.

1565
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:38,300
And I think that more people need to do that. Being around these people infiltrating them,

1566
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:42,620
I've discovered they're almost all really sick people and criminals are a mix of the

1567
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:49,460
two. In all your investigations, I mean, I found it's not like again, it's not like it's

1568
02:18:49,460 --> 02:18:54,700
hard to find this. This is a really group of vicious people. And do you agree that the

1569
02:18:54,700 --> 02:19:00,500
biggest hoax ever is that the liberal establishment is liberal? They're not. They're a bunch of

1570
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:02,100
monsters.

1571
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:09,340
I found it, the word that I use, and a lot of people think that it's absurd. I think

1572
02:19:09,340 --> 02:19:15,740
it's fascism. In my experience as a citizen journalist, I have been arrested. I have been

1573
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:22,660
falsely accused. I did a voter fraud expose last year on Eric Holder and a number of states

1574
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:28,940
giving out voting ballots in the name of other people. And these are facts, ideal in fact

1575
02:19:28,940 --> 02:19:35,140
as a journalist. And exposing this stuff on videotape, the reaction is always arrest O'Keeffe,

1576
02:19:35,140 --> 02:19:41,580
prosecute O'Keeffe, silence O'Keeffe, censor him, silence him, arrest him. And that to

1577
02:19:41,580 --> 02:19:48,780
me is not a liberal mentality. There's nothing liberal about wanting to jail journalists.

1578
02:19:48,780 --> 02:19:52,740
And this is not, this is just, I'm being straightforward. I was arrested in New Orleans.

1579
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:56,660
Let's talk about that. We're going to break riveting a live interview with James O'Keeffe

1580
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:58,660
from theprojectveritas.org.

1581
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:05,820
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

1582
02:20:05,820 --> 02:20:11,600
I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested

1583
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:15,880
that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could

1584
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:21,340
obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around

1585
02:20:21,340 --> 02:20:25,780
the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

1586
02:20:25,780 --> 02:20:31,620
this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal

1587
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:36,460
cells only without harming a single normal cell. If you want to stay healthy, now's your

1588
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:40,620
chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that

02:21:00,500 --> 02:21:04,780

1603
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:04,260
Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the

1604
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:09,540
last 90 days? Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your

1605
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:15,180
retirement plans? Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Put another

1606
02:22:15,180 --> 02:22:21,180
way, who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?

1607
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:25,860
Gold is the only monetary asset as no one else's liability. Gold still buys the same

1608
02:22:25,860 --> 02:22:30,800
amount of stuff it always did. Gold does not require trust in a third party. You can possess

1609
02:22:30,800 --> 02:22:35,820
it in your hand. You can take it with you. Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.

1610
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:40,260
My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources. To find out how you can protect your savings

1613
02:22:59,780 --> 02:23:04,700
It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device

1614
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:09,020
is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house

1615
02:23:09,020 --> 02:23:13,820
while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments

1616
02:23:13,820 --> 02:23:20,960
and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes

1617
02:23:20,960 --> 02:23:25,820
will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that

1618
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:30,820
looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look

1619
02:23:30,820 --> 02:23:36,220
like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp

1620
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:41,820
on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference

1621
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:47,380
between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or

1622
02:23:47,380 --> 02:24:14,460
call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

1623
02:24:14,460 --> 02:24:20,540
Ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening to this for the first time and you think this

1624
02:24:20,540 --> 02:24:27,300
is hyperbole, there are scores of clips on their website of acorn people saying, yeah,

1625
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:30,340
we'll help you do this illegal thing. We'll help you run child prostitutes. We'll help

1626
02:24:30,340 --> 02:24:35,820
you do that. And this is just how the system works. And they want to make every city like

1627
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:41,500
the big Chicago, New York mafia style systems. And we need to have the people in Chicago

1628
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:44,520
and New York and other cities stand up against this.

1629
02:24:44,520 --> 02:24:53,140
And the way to do it, if you were to follow a Planned Parenthood person, let's say you

1630
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:58,500
work next door to a bar and walk over and record them. Make sure it's a state where

1631
02:24:58,500 --> 02:25:01,260
you have one party consent saying, hey, we need to kill the black people. Why do you

1632
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:04,920
work there? They're gonna agree to you. They've all been told don't talk about it on the phone

1633
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:06,660
when you call.

1634
02:25:06,660 --> 02:25:10,660
And how it's a great civil right and all this stuff. The point is, these people, all of

1635
02:25:10,660 --> 02:25:15,420
them are so sick that if you just engage them, they're all involved in bizarre behavior.

1636
02:25:15,420 --> 02:25:18,100
Going back to our guests, this is a short segment, long segment coming up. We'll play

1637
02:25:18,100 --> 02:25:25,220
some clips during it. James O'Keefe, the head journalist of the Project Truth, Project Veritas,

1638
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:26,220
continue.

1639
02:25:26,220 --> 02:25:30,120
You were talking about how they're authoritarians, how they're always wanting you arrested for

1640
02:25:30,120 --> 02:25:31,940
exposing their activities.

1641
02:25:31,940 --> 02:25:39,420
Exactly, there have been a number of occasions where I've been subpoenaed. Most famously,

1642
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:43,820
there was a huge story where I was in New Orleans investigating Senator Mary Landrieu,

1643
02:25:43,820 --> 02:25:47,660
and she was not answering her constituents' phone calls during the health care debate

1644
02:25:47,660 --> 02:25:53,660
in 2010. I went into the federal building with a camera, a recording device, and as

1645
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:59,180
you pointed out, one party consent states, so it's legal to do it in Louisiana. But I

1646
02:25:59,180 --> 02:26:03,700
was in a federal building, I was arrested, and they were gonna let me go as a journalist.

1647
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:08,860
They said, oh, you're just there to ask questions. And then they found out that I was the acorn

1648
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:14,220
pimp. I went into acorn posing as a pimp and hooker, and they said, well, you know, based

1649
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:19,220
on the senator and these other situations, we're gonna have to keep you overnight in

1650
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:25,500
federal prison. And then I wake up the next day, and I find myself charged with some ridiculous

1651
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:30,940
felony. I had to get a lawyer, spent six months fighting it, finally got it down to a misdemeanor.

1652
02:26:30,940 --> 02:26:38,020
The US attorney resigned in disgrace just recently for going online. It's just so corrupt.

1653
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:42,740
And I've been, as a citizen journalist, I'm not like David Gregory. I'm not immune from

1654
02:26:42,740 --> 02:26:50,360
being prosecuted for committing crimes. But it's just unbelievable what they wanna censor

1655
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:57,540
us and silence us and even jail us for exposing them on tape. And the good news is I'm still

1656
02:26:57,540 --> 02:27:02,180
standing, and we haven't given up, and we've got a ton of stories under our belt. We're

1657
02:27:02,180 --> 02:27:05,220
developing a track record now.

1658
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:09,980
Talk about some of the other intriguing investigative reports you put out that haven't gone mega

1659
02:27:09,980 --> 02:27:12,700
viral that people may not be aware of.

1660
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:18,100
Sure, after the acorn story, the MTR story was on the front page of all the major newspapers.

1661
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:23,300
But after that, we did a story on Medicaid. Medicaid, entitlement programs in this country.

1662
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:29,380
We went into Medicaid offices in Ohio, Virginia, and Maine. And we said that we were Russian

1663
02:27:29,380 --> 02:27:40,080
drug dealers. We talked about pimping girls. We talked about importing exotic sports cars

1664
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:45,940
and putting drugs in. And we said, we just want Medicaid, even though we're multimillionaires.

1665
02:27:45,940 --> 02:27:49,420
See something, say something, like the Social Security Administration sending hundreds of

1666
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:53,340
millions to one address in Austin knowing it's a fraud.

1667
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:58,700
But then literally, the police are told to spy on gun owners and we're criminals.

1668
02:27:58,700 --> 02:28:03,540
In the case of Medicaid, what the woman actually told us, and this is on YouTube, it's got

1669
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:10,100
100,000 views, is I said, you know, what are we going to call our illicit drug business?

1670
02:28:10,100 --> 02:28:17,620
And she said, just say that you're a babysitter. And she was fired. This worker in Medicaid

1671
02:28:17,620 --> 02:28:22,540
was fired. And the state of Ohio said they were going to retrain all their workers.

1672
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:27,380
We did it in Virginia. We got the same response. The Medicaid worker told us not to put it

1673
02:28:27,380 --> 02:28:32,580
down on our forms. We did it in Maine. The governor of each state launched an investigation.

1674
02:28:32,580 --> 02:28:37,180
There is a criminal culture to liberals. I've got to be honest. Again, I don't like the

1675
02:28:37,180 --> 02:28:44,260
Republicans either, but downright local Democrats, when you really get near them, they're crooks.

1676
02:28:44,260 --> 02:28:50,780
As evidenced by the videos that we've produced, they certainly don't have a problem with helping

1677
02:28:50,780 --> 02:28:52,220
give money, give government-

1678
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:57,340
Telling somebody to falsify forms to cover up drug dealing is a crime.

1679
02:28:57,340 --> 02:29:03,180
That's absolutely right. And by the way, the police have gotten involved. They have Cuccinelli

1680
02:29:03,180 --> 02:29:08,300
in Virginia. He launched a criminal investigation, a criminal probe, and then most recently with

1681
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:13,460
our voter fraud video in Virginia. Many people, your listeners may know this story. It was

1682
02:29:13,460 --> 02:29:20,140
all over the mainstream media, but Congressman Jim Moran's son resigned in October over telling

1683
02:29:20,140 --> 02:29:27,020
one of our undercover reporters how to vote twice to elect President Obama, a forging

1684
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:31,740
utility bills, voting in the names of other people. So this is a Congressman's son who

1685
02:29:31,740 --> 02:29:37,180
was his field director. His name is Patrick Moran. He resigned and the police got involved.

1686
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:42,060
The detective in Arlington County called me, wanted me to cooperate with this investigation.

1687
02:29:42,060 --> 02:29:46,140
And then I find out this detective might be bought and sold by the Congressman. So it's

1688
02:29:46,140 --> 02:29:48,060
really, it's difficult being a citizen.

1689
02:29:48,060 --> 02:29:50,380
We'll be right back. This is amazing.

1690
02:29:50,380 --> 02:29:57,380
Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

1691
02:30:01,220 --> 02:30:06,060
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

1692
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:10,620
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

1693
02:30:10,620 --> 02:30:15,580
by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

1696
02:30:24,380 --> 02:30:29,140
wrote almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just

02:32:02,920 --> 02:32:08,680
lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The

1712
02:32:08,680 --> 02:32:14,720
globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1721
02:32:56,520 --> 02:33:06,360
You're getting prepared. Are you InfoWarsShop.com.

1722
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:30,360
I know we've had some callers holding for the last hour. You'll get a chance to bring

1723
02:33:30,360 --> 02:33:36,600
up your gun issue and also ask our amazing guest a question. Again, Alex Jones here back

1724
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:43,880
live James O'Keefe of the Project Veritas. Project Truth is on with us. The Project Veritas.org.

1725
02:33:43,880 --> 02:33:51,720
Of course, our sites are InfoWars.com and the nightly news is transmitted out via prisonplanet.tv.

1726
02:33:51,720 --> 02:33:57,520
By the way, one membership for $5.95 a month now is 11 memberships. Your membership and

1727
02:33:57,520 --> 02:34:02,880
10 other people simultaneously can use the same username and passcode. So use an original

1728
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:06,800
username passcode that's simple and then give it to friends and family because probably

1729
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:09,040
it's like 20 people.

1730
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,080
There's no way that usually all 11 people are gonna be tuned in at seven o'clock every

1731
02:34:13,080 --> 02:34:17,800
night when Info Wars Nightly News goes on. That's part of Operation Awaken the Sleeping

1732
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:24,120
Giant. We will officially launch the $100,000 film. I've gotten so behind with all the gun

1733
02:34:24,120 --> 02:34:30,360
grabbing all the tyranny we're facing that I have not lost the big $100,000 contest for

1734
02:34:30,360 --> 02:34:31,360
films yet.

1735
02:34:31,360 --> 02:34:36,640
We should have done that like three weeks ago, but we're gonna launch it with a film

1736
02:34:36,640 --> 02:34:42,920
promo tomorrow on the show premiered here. I shot the video, wrote the rules, went over

1737
02:34:42,920 --> 02:34:49,900
it with legal. It's $115,000 in cash prizes, $100,000 first place. That will be announced

1738
02:34:49,900 --> 02:34:50,900
tomorrow on the radio.

1739
02:34:50,900 --> 02:34:55,080
I know I said I would announce it a few weeks ago and never got to it because quite frankly,

1740
02:34:55,080 --> 02:34:58,660
everything comes secondary to free speech and the Second Amendment. I mean, when that's

1741
02:34:58,660 --> 02:35:03,660
getting attacked, you notice I haven't even plugged in products or things until last week.

1742
02:35:03,660 --> 02:35:08,000
And a little secret about radio, most of the real funding of the syndicated show itself

1743
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:09,680
is what they do live on air.

1744
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:14,680
You listen to most talk show hosts, it's into the show with a plug, out of the break with

1745
02:35:14,680 --> 02:35:18,440
a plug, five, six, seven plugs an hour. And quite frankly, I should be doing a couple

1746
02:35:18,440 --> 02:35:22,880
hour because that's how I can fund this operation. They're like, hey, there's not a lot of money

1747
02:35:22,880 --> 02:35:24,760
coming in, better plug stuff.

1748
02:35:24,760 --> 02:35:30,100
Plus I plug things I believe in, like the new Infowars.com come and take it shirt with

1749
02:35:30,100 --> 02:35:36,440
an AK-47 and inside of it the words, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

1750
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:42,200
And also, two years in the making, designed by scientists engineers in the US, now made

1751
02:35:42,200 --> 02:35:48,640
in England with the latest technology. And two years being built and approved and certified,

1752
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:53,280
read all that information side by side, gravity fed filtration system by ProPure.

1753
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:58,800
It's called ProOne and it is two filters in one. It's got the silver base system impregnated

1754
02:35:58,800 --> 02:36:06,280
with silver and ceramic. Under it, the system's to reduce down to 95% hydrofluorosolic acid.

1755
02:36:06,280 --> 02:36:12,200
The big secret is the other leading filters, and we've sold these with ProPure cuz it's

1756
02:36:12,200 --> 02:36:17,280
good to get most of it out. Only get around half of it out because the hydrofluorosolic

1757
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:18,720
acid goes right through it.

1758
02:36:18,720 --> 02:36:23,960
This 95%, okay, this is amazing. In fact, the other filters don't even really do anything

1759
02:36:23,960 --> 02:36:28,200
to hydrofluoric acid, but it tends to break back down. The point is it loses electron

1760
02:36:28,200 --> 02:36:32,520
or they pull an electron and then add it. All the science stuff's up on the site. This

1761
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:37,040
is a revolution. We are the biggest distributor of ProPure because I did my own research two

1762
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:38,320
years ago and got them as a sponsor.

1763
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:42,520
You notice for a year I didn't have a gravity fed sponsor because the quality unfortunately

1764
02:36:42,520 --> 02:36:45,120
with some of them out there just wasn't even good enough for me to promote it. You hear

1765
02:36:45,120 --> 02:36:49,880
ads on the network where I've already been approached and offered $500,000 in a year

1766
02:36:49,880 --> 02:36:55,280
to promote this. I go, no, I'm not gonna promote it. I don't believe in it. If I believe in

1767
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:57,140
something, you're gonna hear me promoting it.

1768
02:36:57,140 --> 02:37:06,880
And this is an amazing system, ProPure, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, or 888-253-3139. And it's

1769
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:14,480
10% off on all the stainless steel systems, the Traveler, the Big, the King, all of it.

1770
02:37:14,480 --> 02:37:20,620
And 10% off even the new filters that are launching today. Today, today, today, made

1771
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:25,920
in England. Not even factories that can make this in the United States or places like China

1772
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:29,480
or India. You can see right there on the filter it says made in England.

1773
02:37:29,480 --> 02:37:33,560
So there you go. All right, enough of me ranting and raving about that. It's just that your

1774
02:37:33,560 --> 02:37:42,800
purchase makes the transmission possible. So infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139. Films

1775
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:48,000
like Strategic Relocation and others that I produced also available at infowarstore.com.

1776
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,360
Or to understand the eugenics angle, infowarstore.com with end game blueprint for global enslavement.

1777
02:37:53,360 --> 02:38:00,640
I wanna go to this pimp clip in a moment. But continuing here with our guest James O'Keeffe

1778
02:38:00,640 --> 02:38:06,800
of the Project Veritas. What else do you wanna impart to viewers and listeners about the

1779
02:38:06,800 --> 02:38:08,120
state of the world right now?

1780
02:38:08,120 --> 02:38:12,080
I mean, I think the biggest thing I would ask you is, what is your rallying cry? Because

1781
02:38:12,080 --> 02:38:17,320
your rallying cry just from truth is what mine is. Evil men and tyrants flourish because

1782
02:38:17,320 --> 02:38:21,080
good men and women do nothing. These people, a lot of these people that run the system

1783
02:38:21,080 --> 02:38:26,400
are really stupid. But it's our weakness in bowing down to government that empowers them.

1784
02:38:26,400 --> 02:38:31,960
It's the ether in which these slugs thrive. You've got the floor, my friend.

1785
02:38:31,960 --> 02:38:40,160
Well, one thing that's unique about Project Veritas is that I don't advocate policy solutions.

1786
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:47,120
I don't tell people who to vote for. I don't tell people what to believe. I'm a strong

1787
02:38:47,120 --> 02:38:52,600
believer in the following statement. I believe in the, I have an infinite faith in the power

1788
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:57,120
of free people. That if they're just making their own decisions, if they have the truth

1789
02:38:57,120 --> 02:39:01,640
available to them, that they will make the best decisions to create a great, lasting

1790
02:39:01,640 --> 02:39:07,280
and moral society. I think what we need more of, we need more journalism. We need more

1791
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:13,840
people exposing the facts. And the fact of the matter is that there aren't a lot of journalists.

1792
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:18,240
There are a lot of stenographers, people who, you know, they write down what the politicians

1793
02:39:18,240 --> 02:39:25,520
say at the podium, or pundits, people who are, you know, on television, or they take

1794
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:29,800
preexisting content. But Alex, one thing I actually admired, you did, I must have seen

1795
02:39:29,800 --> 02:39:37,000
this video maybe eight years ago, but on YouTube, you went into the DMV, and they asked you

1796
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:42,120
for identification. You took out eight pieces of identification. What you were doing is

1797
02:39:42,120 --> 02:39:46,120
important. I mean, that's a direct action. You went in there and you sort of, you taped

1798
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:52,440
it, you exposed something. We need more people doing journalism, pure journalism. And I think

1799
02:39:52,440 --> 02:39:57,760
that people are smart enough. This recent video we did on the guns in New York and the

1800
02:39:57,760 --> 02:40:02,920
people pushing gun owners, I went up to the journalists and I asked them, would you put

1801
02:40:02,920 --> 02:40:06,960
a sign on your lawn that says that your home is gun free?

1802
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:10,080
By the way, let me stop you there. That's the original reason I wanted to get you on

1803
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:15,600
last week. Start over, and the video is on your website, it's amazing. We can probably

1804
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:19,440
play some here for viewers while he's talking, then I have the pimp clip. But I mean, this

1805
02:40:19,440 --> 02:40:23,640
shows their incredible hypocrisy. The truth is they've got guns, they've got bodyguards.

1806
02:40:23,640 --> 02:40:27,760
Their kids go to schools with armed men like David Gregory. So start over and tell people

1807
02:40:27,760 --> 02:40:28,760
about that.

1808
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:33,200
Sure, I was inspired to do this because of David Gregory and because I have been arrested

1809
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:39,720
and falsely accused and faced political prosecution. And the judge destroyed my videotape so that

1810
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:44,800
no one knows what I actually did in Louisiana. But when David Gregory on NBC News brought

1811
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:50,920
a magazine into the studio, which is a felony in Washington DC, and he was not prosecuted.

1812
02:40:50,920 --> 02:40:55,560
In fact, the DC Attorney General released a statement, I believe it was two weeks ago,

1813
02:40:55,560 --> 02:41:01,400
and the district, I actually have it in front of me here, he said that it was a clear violation

1814
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:06,760
of the law, what Gregory did. But it didn't, quote, serve the best interests of the people,

1815
02:41:06,760 --> 02:41:11,600
unquote, to prosecute David Gregory. Now, he does have prosecutorial discretion-

1816
02:41:11,600 --> 02:41:16,160
So he's Judge Dredd now. They tell juries we can't judge the law and the facts, which

1817
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:20,760
of course we can. But the police, especially high level ones, they're not supposed to do

1818
02:41:20,760 --> 02:41:26,640
that. It's a grand jury and it's the people. Well, that is, I know I've done a lot of constitutional

1819
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:30,920
law research. What that prosecutor did, I think was wrong.

1820
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:35,040
I think it's wrong because I think the Supreme Court says equal justice under law. And if

1821
02:41:35,040 --> 02:41:39,840
I did that, if I, for purposes of a YouTube video, if I brought a magazine in the District

1822
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:43,520
of Columbia from an AR-15, I'd be prosecuted, no question.

1823
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:47,560
If I did, I'd be arrested, you know it. There is a different, so I'm just getting

1824
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:51,840
to what inspired me to do this video, which I think is important, is the fact that there's

1825
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:57,160
a different class of people, the politicians, the journalists, they consider themselves

1826
02:41:57,160 --> 02:42:03,000
protected from the law. And then I got to thinking, now, what if I made them live up

1827
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:08,080
to their own principles, and I went to the, okay, you obviously don't like guns.

1828
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:13,160
So will you advertise that to the public? Will you put a sign on your lawn that says

1829
02:42:13,160 --> 02:42:19,480
this house is proudly gun free? Because journalists, you're willing to advertise to the world who

1830
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:24,160
owns a gun, you're willing to publish law abiding gun owners, therefore you should have

1831
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:27,800
no problem with doing it. They're terrorists, they're not journalists,

1832
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:31,760
they're saying the South is all scum, gun owners are scum, publishing where we live

1833
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:36,720
that we have guns. It's time to get angry at these people. I mean, that newspaper needs

1834
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:41,160
to be sued. We need to get aggressive with them. I'm sorry, go ahead.

1835
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:47,400
No, I mean, my way of doing that is by exposing them. I think that we need to, I went to their

1836
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:52,280
homes. I mean, there's nothing more aggressive than going to somebody's house and knocking

1837
02:42:52,280 --> 02:42:56,120
on the door. And I went to their homes with a camera. They didn't know they were being

1838
02:42:56,120 --> 02:43:00,960
taped. And I said, you know, I said that to the publisher of the Westchester Journal News,

1839
02:43:00,960 --> 02:43:05,520
that's the newspaper that printed all the gun owners in Westchester County. I live in

1840
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:09,400
Westchester, New York. That's where I'm from. I'm only a few miles away from these people.

1841
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:16,360
And we said, would you post the sign on the lawn? Nobody would post the sign. In fact,

1842
02:43:16,360 --> 02:43:20,440
if you watch the video, the most extraordinary thing about this YouTube video is that all

1843
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:27,640
these editors and reporters are justifying the Second Amendment. They're pro gun. They

1844
02:43:27,640 --> 02:43:32,040
just don't know it. Instinctively, their human nature informs them that they don't want to

1845
02:43:32,040 --> 02:43:36,960
tell people they're gun free. And that's what I'm trying to tell you. My message at Project

1846
02:43:36,960 --> 02:43:41,880
Veritas is that I have faith in free people if they're just given the facts that they

1847
02:43:41,880 --> 02:43:43,640
know what's good for them and their families.

1848
02:43:43,640 --> 02:43:48,400
Well, I'll say this. They're trying to physically make us turn our guns in, register them, ban

1849
02:43:48,400 --> 02:43:54,520
them. They're assaulting us. And our founders, you know, physically went after them. We need

1850
02:43:54,520 --> 02:43:59,840
to just go and get in their faces at public events. If they're publishing people's names

1851
02:43:59,840 --> 02:44:04,400
and where they live, we need to go to their house and say, hey, I'm out here with a bullhorn,

1852
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:05,400
buddy.

1853
02:44:05,400 --> 02:44:10,120
Anybody who got your name published in the newspaper, they assaulted your privacy. They

1854
02:44:10,120 --> 02:44:16,760
told criminals who to go rob. It's time to go to their houses and bullhorn them and to

1855
02:44:16,760 --> 02:44:20,640
come back the next day and bullhorn them. When the cops show up videotape it and go,

1856
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:23,280
officer, here's my name in the newspaper where I live and I have a gun.

1857
02:44:23,280 --> 02:44:27,160
I have a first right to be here and do this. And then if they arrest you, you sue them

1858
02:44:27,160 --> 02:44:33,880
because of the hypocrisy. I mean, it's time to get aggressive. Here's an example. 1996.

1859
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:39,040
They are taking veterans' homes, $2,000 a day fines. They had some registry at the hospital,

1860
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:42,960
I discovered. I learned this from hospital workers that they would know when somebody

1861
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:46,440
had bad cancer or had a heart attack and was a widow, a widower.

1862
02:44:46,440 --> 02:44:50,640
They would then go to the nice home in the million dollar area that they wanted to get

1863
02:44:50,640 --> 02:44:56,320
and force into foreclosure. They put $2,000 a day fines on it for three inch grass. Well,

1864
02:44:56,320 --> 02:44:59,560
a good cop called me and said, hey, I know where all the city council people live. A

1865
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:02,160
bunch of them have like three foot grass, the middle of the city, holes in the roofs.

1866
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:07,040
I don't know why they did. So I went to Jackie Goodman's house and others, went to the health

1867
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:08,520
department.

1868
02:45:08,520 --> 02:45:13,560
Showed they had like foot tall grass and trash on the ground and said, okay, let's put $2,000

1869
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:17,960
fines on you. And they dropped all these fines on old people. Here's the problem. My phone,

1870
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:22,840
I was one guy, two guys, ringing with old people having their houses taken for two inch

1871
02:45:22,840 --> 02:45:23,840
grass.

1872
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:26,440
And they always were like, let me ask, you should have a heart attack. You can't walk.

1873
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:30,560
Yeah, you just got out of the hospital last week and the notices are coming. Let me guess,

1874
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:34,040
you got, so you're dying of cancer. Yeah, I got a few months to live. They just want

1875
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:38,600
your house. They want to lean on it. I mean, that's a mafia right there. And you know what,

1876
02:45:38,600 --> 02:45:41,200
I couldn't, I bet it's still going on.

1877
02:45:41,200 --> 02:45:47,120
That's the frustration. We need 50 Alex Jones's in Austin. We need 50 in Rochester, New York.

1878
02:45:47,120 --> 02:45:53,880
We need 100 in Chicago. I mean, people are being abused, folks. And folks go in and turn

1879
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:57,480
their TVs on and watch sitcoms at night. And they don't know the old lady's having their

1880
02:45:57,480 --> 02:45:59,120
house stolen.

1881
02:45:59,120 --> 02:46:00,720
Go ahead, I'm ranting.

1882
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:07,320
No, I would respect if these journalists, for example, would put the signs on their

1883
02:46:07,320 --> 02:46:12,600
lawns. I would at least respect that because they would be philosophically consistent.

1884
02:46:12,600 --> 02:46:17,560
But the fact that they're inconsistent, the fact that they would be willing to publish

1885
02:46:17,560 --> 02:46:23,760
gun owners but be unwilling to advertise themselves as not owning guns. We went to MSNBC's Toure.

1886
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:29,720
Toure is a commentator on MSNBC. And he was unwilling to post the sign. He was stumbling

1887
02:46:29,720 --> 02:46:34,080
and stuttering when we asked him to. He said, you know what, I don't know if I want to do

1888
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:35,080
that.

1889
02:46:35,080 --> 02:46:41,400
And that's what makes them frauds and cowards. And nobody, nobody likes a fraud or a coward.

1890
02:46:41,400 --> 02:46:47,800
And nobody rides for free either. I'm sick of these slugs feeding off of us.

1891
02:46:47,800 --> 02:46:52,080
And what we tried to do, we want to measure the courage of their convictions. Do they

1892
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:55,760
actually believe in this thing? And at the end of the video, one of the most telling,

1893
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:59,960
I think this is the most fascinating thing about the video, is that one of the reporters

1894
02:46:59,960 --> 02:47:05,000
for the New Jersey Star-Ledger, who supported outing gun owners and printing their names

1895
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:10,120
and addresses, told us that he hates guns, he wishes they were banned and everything.

1896
02:47:10,120 --> 02:47:16,680
But if, this is his words, he says, when the right wing takes over the government, we need

1897
02:47:16,680 --> 02:47:22,080
to be armed to defend ourselves from that government. So even though he's putting an

1898
02:47:22,080 --> 02:47:26,840
ideological spin on it, he's actually making some type of justification for the Second

1899
02:47:26,840 --> 02:47:27,840
Amendment.

1900
02:47:27,840 --> 02:47:30,640
But they're so dumb, they don't get that right wing, left wings control at the top, there's

1901
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:34,400
gonna be Republicans in later. No, liberals, I all knew, went out and bought guns under

1902
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:37,940
Bush. And now they're like, let's turn them in.

1903
02:47:37,940 --> 02:47:42,720
It's just mindlessness. These people have no sense. And you know what, I wanna hold

1904
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:45,640
you if you can do it a little bit in the next hour and go into overdrive, cuz I promised

1905
02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:49,160
to go to phone calls. And I wanna play some of these reports of you going and doing the

1906
02:47:49,160 --> 02:47:51,480
guns. Can you do 30 minutes more into the next hour?

1907
02:47:51,480 --> 02:47:56,080
Sure, yep, absolutely. Okay, fantastic. I wanna play now, though, the pimp clip. Do

1908
02:47:56,080 --> 02:48:01,880
we have that queued up? Yep, cuz we're gonna go to the pimp clip first. Because this is

1909
02:48:01,880 --> 02:48:06,320
what you're more, I mean, this is super mega viral for months, brought down Acorn, got

1910
02:48:06,320 --> 02:48:09,080
it defunded. How many billions did it get defunded?

1911
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:15,240
It was allocated $5 billion in the stimulus package. And of course, they went bankrupt

1912
02:48:15,240 --> 02:48:18,520
after the videos, so they weren't given any of that.

1913
02:48:18,520 --> 02:48:21,920
Tell people a little bit more about that case, if they may have forgotten.

1914
02:48:21,920 --> 02:48:27,980
Sure, Acorn Association of Community Organized for Reform Now. President Barack Obama was

1915
02:48:27,980 --> 02:48:35,480
an attorney for Acorn, I believe in the 80s or 90s. Acorn, it has a couple different branches,

1916
02:48:35,480 --> 02:48:41,720
but they claim to help giving low income housing for people. What they mostly do is they get

1917
02:48:41,720 --> 02:48:45,720
out the vote efforts, they help with voter registration drives.

1918
02:48:45,720 --> 02:48:51,860
What we wanted to uncover was, what exactly this group is doing, where its money goes.

1919
02:48:51,860 --> 02:48:58,720
We visited Acorn branches across the United States, and I posed as a pimp. Of course,

1920
02:48:58,720 --> 02:49:02,680
I'm not the most pimp-like individual, but I-

1921
02:49:02,680 --> 02:49:05,960
No, welfare and all this, cuz I've talked to people involved, it's all designed for

1922
02:49:05,960 --> 02:49:10,400
fraud. You can go in and get 20 kids signed up. You can go in and they want control and

1923
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:13,320
they want to bankrupt the country. Let's go to this clip where you're saying, this is

1924
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:16,880
my underage girl I brought in from another country, I want to bring in more.

1925
02:49:16,880 --> 02:49:20,480
They're like, hey, we'll help you falsify everything, just make sure she's in school.

1926
02:49:20,480 --> 02:49:21,480
Here it is.

1927
02:49:21,480 --> 02:49:22,480
Cops on us before.

1928
02:49:22,480 --> 02:49:27,160
Right, and anything that's in Maryland, anything that's not governing the food, it's always

1929
02:49:27,160 --> 02:49:30,400
against the law. That's rule number one.

1930
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:33,280
Do you default to taxes?

1931
02:49:33,280 --> 02:49:34,280
No.

1932
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:37,360
Well, she gets paid mostly in cash, which makes a lot of money, though, so you could

1933
02:49:37,360 --> 02:49:38,360
afford something.

1934
02:49:38,360 --> 02:49:41,760
Okay, let me get somebody here for taxes so they can talk to you about how do you do this.

1935
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:42,760
It's not like that.

1936
02:49:42,760 --> 02:49:46,000
It's against the law, and law enforcement is very prejudicial towards us.

1937
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:49,960
But she's going to make us illegal books of this. That's like, yes, I got the taxes.

1938
02:49:49,960 --> 02:49:50,960
How can she do that, though?

1939
02:49:50,960 --> 02:49:58,800
Because she is good. I'm going to tell you, she won't know how you can make it legal.

1940
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:03,760
She's really good. She's not going to get drunk on herself.

1941
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:07,840
The type of business or service she provides, let me make sure there's a code for it, okay?

1942
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:09,240
A code for prostitution?

1943
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:14,040
Well, yeah, because I have to have a name and a code number.

1944
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:16,240
Well, I don't know if there's going to be a code for it.

1945
02:50:16,240 --> 02:50:18,240
But I'm going to look in there, I'm going to get my list.

1946
02:50:18,240 --> 02:50:19,240
Okay.

1947
02:50:19,240 --> 02:50:21,440
She's going to sit up and say she's good, that's what I'm saying.

1948
02:50:21,440 --> 02:50:23,720
She's going to make us illegal books of this.

1949
02:50:23,720 --> 02:50:24,720
Well, how can she do that?

1950
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,720
Let me make sure there's a code for it, okay?

1951
02:50:26,720 --> 02:50:27,720
A code for prostitution?

1952
02:50:27,720 --> 02:50:28,720
Okay, let's see what we got here.

1953
02:50:28,720 --> 02:50:29,720
Combination, food service, and drinking places.

1954
02:50:29,720 --> 02:50:30,720
Business and food department.

1955
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:31,720
Service out of the collection agencies.

1956
02:50:31,720 --> 02:50:32,720
Credit bills.

1957
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:33,720
You might have to name it something else.

1958
02:50:33,720 --> 02:50:47,640
I mean, there's hours of this stuff, and then they get into the underage people they're

1959
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:48,640
going to bring in.

1960
02:50:48,640 --> 02:50:49,640
That's all great.

1961
02:50:49,640 --> 02:50:50,640
We're going to go to break.

1962
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:51,640
Come back with our guests.

1963
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:52,640
Go to some of your calls that have been holding.

1964
02:50:52,640 --> 02:50:57,480
Jerome in Illinois, Truth Raider in Oregon, and others, and we're going to go into overdrive

1965
02:50:57,480 --> 02:50:58,480
with our guests.

1966
02:50:58,480 --> 02:51:01,240
With more, straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.

1967
02:51:01,240 --> 02:51:04,980
If you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but were waiting for an offer

1968
02:51:04,980 --> 02:51:10,000
so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.

1969
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Here's why.

1970
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:16,260
Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators

1971
02:51:16,260 --> 02:51:20,660
run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.

1972
02:51:20,660 --> 02:51:24,080
So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.

1973
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:25,720
Now here's the best part.

1974
02:51:25,720 --> 02:51:30,420
Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.

1975
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:35,600
We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of

1976
02:51:35,600 --> 02:51:36,600
each year.

1977
02:51:36,600 --> 02:51:40,320
We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.

1978
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:45,520
Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.

1979
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:46,520
Don't wait.

1980
02:51:46,520 --> 02:51:47,520
They go fast.

1981
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:48,680
Go to scratchanddentsolar.com.

1982
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:50,960
That's scratchanddentsolar.com.

1983
02:51:50,960 --> 02:51:55,800
For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com.

1984
02:51:55,800 --> 02:52:25,280
That's scratchanddentsolar.com.

1985
02:52:25,280 --> 02:52:29,240
Other than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so

1986
02:52:29,240 --> 02:52:33,520
it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning

1987
02:52:33,520 --> 02:52:35,200
and no obnoxious odors.

1988

02:52:57,320 --> 02:52:58,320
Tereganics.

1995
02:52:58,320 --> 02:52:59,320
Life's getting better.

1996
02:52:59,320 --> 02:53:00,320
Hi there.

1997
02:53:00,320 --> 02:53:01,320
My name is Frank Bates.

1998
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:06,760
What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.

1999
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:13,000
I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity

2000
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:17,760
monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that

2001
02:53:17,760 --> 02:53:22,600
are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.

2002
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:26,880
Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up, and you will be

2003
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:30,760
shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

2004
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:36,400
My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them

2005
02:53:36,400 --> 02:53:38,840
and how you can beat them too.

2006
02:53:38,840 --> 02:53:42,600
Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen

2007
02:53:42,600 --> 02:53:43,760
in the last three months.

2008
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:49,680
Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect

2009
02:53:49,680 --> 02:53:50,680
your home.

2010
02:53:50,680 --> 02:53:56,560
Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.

2011
02:53:56,560 --> 02:53:58,560
Again, that's 123coverup.com.

2012
02:53:58,560 --> 02:53:59,560
All right.

2013
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:20,640
In this segment, the next, we're going to take some calls with folks that have been

2014
02:54:20,640 --> 02:54:22,360
holding on the Second Amendment with James O'Keefe.

2015
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:26,840
Then we'll do 30 minutes with him in overdrive, which a lot of stations carry, into the fourth

2016
02:54:26,840 --> 02:54:27,840
hour.

2017
02:54:27,840 --> 02:54:28,840
We always do three hours.

2018
02:54:28,840 --> 02:54:31,880
For a while, I did four hours, so we still keep doing the fourth hour sometimes because

2019
02:54:31,880 --> 02:54:35,280
there's a bunch of other news I want to cover after he leaves us as well.

2020
02:54:35,280 --> 02:54:36,280
But it's official.

2021
02:54:36,280 --> 02:54:39,640
They're coming after the handguns too, and we're going to play some of the clips for

2022
02:54:39,640 --> 02:54:45,240
radio listeners and TV listeners of James O'Keefe going to Eric Holder's house and saying,

2023
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:47,120
will you put up a gun-free zone sign?

2024
02:54:47,120 --> 02:54:50,160
I mean, Eric Holder is a gangster, folks.

2025
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:55,800
I mean, hardcore, Fast and Furious, OKC, involved in it all.

2026
02:54:55,800 --> 02:55:00,040
And this guy's got gigantic huevos rancheros.

2027
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:02,000
James O'Keefe is our guest.

2028
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,520
Folks have been holding Jerome, Truther, and others.

2029
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:08,560
Jerome in Illinois, thanks for holding here on the air about the Second Amendment, I believe

2030
02:55:08,560 --> 02:55:09,560
you called him.

2031
02:55:09,560 --> 02:55:10,560
Go ahead.

2032
02:55:10,560 --> 02:55:11,560
Yeah.

2033
02:55:11,560 --> 02:55:16,620
Thanks for having me on your show, Alex, and it's good to hear that there's other people

2034
02:55:16,620 --> 02:55:21,120
in the world that share my thoughts about gun control.

2035
02:55:21,120 --> 02:55:25,520
You know, I keep hearing people ask the question about assault weapons.

2036
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:28,560
Do Americans really need an assault weapon to defend themselves?

2037
02:55:28,560 --> 02:55:32,600
And my answer to that question is absolutely yes.

2038
02:55:32,600 --> 02:55:36,120
I believe we do need assault weapons because it levels the playing field.

2039
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:40,360
That's right, the criminals are going to have them, so we need them.

2040
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:43,560
But I mean, they use that debate.

2041
02:55:43,560 --> 02:55:45,040
It's about enslavement.

2042
02:55:45,040 --> 02:55:46,320
Let's ask our guest.

2043
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:48,000
Why do you think they're coming after the guns?

2044
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,400
I mean, I think I know the answer I'm going to get.

2045
02:55:51,400 --> 02:55:55,640
Oh, you're asking me why do I think they're coming after like AR-15s and things like that?

2046
02:55:55,640 --> 02:55:57,520
It's because they love you, right?

2047
02:55:57,520 --> 02:55:58,800
They want to help you.

2048
02:55:58,800 --> 02:56:03,960
I mean, I think they're coming after them in order to...

2049
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:12,000
I think that they may have good intentions, but they're emotional and they don't understand

2050
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:17,400
that when you take away law-abiding gun owners that you, you know, you increase crimes.

2051
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:18,400
Come on!

2052
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:23,280
Diane Feinstein is a crime boss, insider, I mean, come on.

2053
02:56:23,280 --> 02:56:24,280
You're a smart guy.

2054
02:56:24,280 --> 02:56:25,280
You're not that naive.

2055
02:56:25,280 --> 02:56:28,080
You know the criminal elements the government want our guns to enslave us.

2056
02:56:28,080 --> 02:56:31,040
They even admit that in some of their white papers.

2057
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,240
Sometimes they do admit it, and you're right.

2058
02:56:33,240 --> 02:56:35,080
Other times, sometimes they're well-intentioned.

2059
02:56:35,080 --> 02:56:38,560
They just don't realize the policy outcome of when they do that, when they ban law-abiding

2060
02:56:38,560 --> 02:56:39,560
people from owning guns.

2061
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:44,960
Well, yeah, I mean, some of the little chicken necks and stuff that, you know, didn't have

2062
02:56:44,960 --> 02:56:46,480
somebody take them out shooting and things.

2063
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:47,480
They're scared of them, I agree.

2064
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:49,400
I'm talking about high level.

2065
02:56:49,400 --> 02:56:53,840
Why does the, why does the UN want guns worldwide?

2066
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:54,840
That's beyond my pay grade.

2067
02:56:54,840 --> 02:56:56,880
They want to be the only ones with guns.

2068
02:56:56,880 --> 02:56:57,880
That's their plan.

2069
02:56:57,880 --> 02:57:00,480
That's, yes, that's, that's very true.

2070
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:03,080
I mean, you know about the UN worldwide, what they do?

2071
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:07,160
I mean, they line people up in Africa and Latin America and just shoot villages to take

2072
02:57:07,160 --> 02:57:08,560
their property on record.

2073
02:57:08,560 --> 02:57:13,640
They killed 4,000 people in Burma on record in the 90s, just went in and killed all the

2074
02:57:13,640 --> 02:57:15,280
villagers to take their property.

2075
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:19,800
The UN is a giant murder crew, but they constantly have every Miss America saying, oh, they're

2076
02:57:19,800 --> 02:57:20,800
so sweet.

2077
02:57:20,800 --> 02:57:22,120
They're helping the children.

2078
02:57:22,120 --> 02:57:25,760
They go in and start the wars, but they're the UN, so it must be okay.

2079
02:57:25,760 --> 02:57:29,260
One of the interesting things that I've found in my research, one thing that we're working

2080
02:57:29,260 --> 02:57:33,760
on right now is the sort of, just like with Planned Parenthood and the racist elements

2081
02:57:33,760 --> 02:57:39,040
with that, some of the racist elements with gun control.

2082
02:57:39,040 --> 02:57:43,120
Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion on McDonald v. Chicago, and he goes into the

2083
02:57:43,120 --> 02:57:49,640
Ku Klux Klan and disarming African American people and what that means in the inner city

2084
02:57:49,640 --> 02:57:50,640
communities.

2085
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:54,680
And there are some people who are practitioners in the Heller case in DC.

2086
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:55,920
That's a very interesting angle.

2087
02:57:55,920 --> 02:58:00,080
No, exactly, and that's why they call guns racist, which makes no sense, is to flip it

2088
02:58:00,080 --> 02:58:04,400
because you notice it's the black areas where they always have the gun control so that only

2089
02:58:04,400 --> 02:58:07,300
the criminals have the guns and the crime rates explode.

2090
02:58:07,300 --> 02:58:10,240
They know it's gonna make it a crime pit.

2091
02:58:10,240 --> 02:58:15,720
And also, a lot of black people are dying because they don't have the ability to defend

2092
02:58:15,720 --> 02:58:16,720
themselves.

2093
02:58:16,720 --> 02:58:18,040
Jerome, anything else from Illinois?

2094
02:58:18,040 --> 02:58:20,800
Yeah, one other comment.

2095
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:25,780
I also wanted to say that I heard Alan Dershowitz say on Pierce Morgan's show that he would

2096
02:58:25,780 --> 02:58:29,760
be afraid to go into your home and have a disagreement with you because he would feel

2097
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:33,920
uncomfortable thinking that you might go for one of your guns.

2098
02:58:33,920 --> 02:58:39,240
And I would like to ask Alan Dershowitz how comfortable would he feel if he had a disagreement

2099
02:58:39,240 --> 02:58:40,240
with it?

2100
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:41,240
Stay there.

2101
02:58:41,240 --> 02:58:46,240

2103
02:58:51,640 --> 02:58:55,600
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu, and other illnesses.

2104
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:56,680
Don't be one of them.

2105

solution.

2107
02:59:03,120 --> 02:59:06,480
Recent advances in silver technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be

2108
02:59:06,480 --> 02:59:11,480
used daily to prevent bacteria, viruses, mold, and food poisoning, and help improve wound

2109
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:12,480
healing.

2110
02:59:12,480 --> 02:59:16,680
Supernatural Silver is safe enough to consume every day, while powerful enough to destroy

2111
02:59:16,680 --> 02:59:21,760
the causes of many serious diseases such as stress, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus, and

2112
02:59:21,760 --> 02:59:23,360
other harmful pathogens.

2113
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:28,240
This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several

2114
02:59:28,240 --> 02:59:32,380
hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

2115
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:36,040
The Science Digest Journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter.

2116
02:59:36,040 --> 02:59:39,900
It is virtually non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine.

Fantastic Coast, direct from Austin.

2120
02:59:55,840 --> 03:00:05,800
You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2121
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:10,640
Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.

2122
03:00:10,640 --> 03:00:11,640
You want answers?

2123
03:00:11,640 --> 03:00:13,760
Well, so does he.

2124
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:17,960
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2125
03:00:17,960 --> 03:00:22,680
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

2126
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:31,160
All right, we're into the fourth hour of overdrive here on this Thursday edition, and we're joined

2127
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:32,160
by James O'Keefe.

2128
03:00:32,160 --> 03:00:36,040
I get so relaxed by the fourth hour, I stop even pronunciating.

2129
03:00:36,040 --> 03:00:37,440
It's not like I'm drunk.

2130
03:00:37,440 --> 03:00:40,720
I've been on radio so much and TV so much the last 17 years.

2131
03:00:40,720 --> 03:00:42,760
Probably more airtime than anybody else out there.

2132
03:00:42,760 --> 03:00:47,760
I just kind of get like, man, yeah, next guest up, let's go to, I'm like, oh, wait, I'm on

2133
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:48,760
the radio.

2134
03:00:48,760 --> 03:00:50,320
Let me actually pronunciate my words.

2135
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:55,600
James O'Keefe, and he heads up the Project Veritas, and we're very excited to have him

2136
03:00:55,600 --> 03:00:57,240
on with us in another 30 minutes.

2137
03:00:57,240 --> 03:01:00,880
We're gonna start taking more of your calls, and then after we're done taking a few calls,

2138
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:05,120
we're gonna get into some of the other things they're working on right now and play some

2139
03:01:05,120 --> 03:01:08,840
more of the videos of him going to Eric Holder's house to say, hey, why don't you put a sign

2140
03:01:08,840 --> 03:01:10,200
up saying you don't own guns?

2141
03:01:10,200 --> 03:01:12,480
Oh, no, he needs guns to protect himself.

2142
03:01:12,480 --> 03:01:18,920
There's a lot of other key news up at Infowars.com right now, but Jerome, you were pointing out

2143
03:01:18,920 --> 03:01:24,440
that Alan Dershowitz, after I was on right before him on Piers Morgan, said I wouldn't

2144
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:29,880
be in that man's home if he disagreed with guns, implying I'm psychopathic and I'm gonna

2145
03:01:29,880 --> 03:01:31,600
kill somebody with a gun.

2146
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:35,020
This is a guy that promotes torture, secret arrest, all this stuff.

2147
03:01:35,020 --> 03:01:37,520
He's a joke in the legal system.

2148
03:01:37,520 --> 03:01:42,000
He's represented all the, some of the most horrible criminals ever known.

2149
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:47,360
And he is a monster, and he's implying I'm violent, I'm bad, cuz I said, look, foreigner,

2150
03:01:47,360 --> 03:01:48,640
stop trying to take our guns.

2151
03:01:48,640 --> 03:01:50,920
But what did you wanna say to Dershowitz?

2152
03:01:50,920 --> 03:01:57,600
I wanted to ask Alan Dershowitz, how would he feel if he had a disagreement with a dictator

2153
03:01:57,600 --> 03:02:06,400
and that dictator ordered that he be killed, cuz that's what dictators do.

2154
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:09,720
You're absolutely right, let's take another call with our guest.

2155
03:02:09,720 --> 03:02:12,960
But James O'Keefe, before we do that, do you wanna comment on my Piers Morgan appearance

2156
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:14,880
or the overall attack on guns?

2157
03:02:14,880 --> 03:02:19,400
I mean, I think it takes all kinds to make the world go round, but I think it's good

2158
03:02:19,400 --> 03:02:21,360
sometimes to get in their faces.

2159
03:02:21,360 --> 03:02:25,040
If what I did was discrediting the gun owners, which they tried to spin it, why would they

2160
03:02:25,040 --> 03:02:26,720
have me back on other shows?

2161
03:02:26,720 --> 03:02:31,680
Why was the producer crying and screaming, get out, get out, get out, if it was a defeat

2162
03:02:31,680 --> 03:02:33,760
for gun owners?

2163
03:02:33,760 --> 03:02:40,820
My comment on Piers Morgan is I only wish that Project Veritas went to his house and

2164
03:02:40,820 --> 03:02:45,700
asked him to put a sign on his lawn, cuz I've actually done some research and I actually

2165
03:02:45,700 --> 03:02:49,280
have both of his addresses out there in California.

2166
03:02:49,280 --> 03:02:53,000
So I think he has one property in Beverly Hills under a different name.

2167
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:58,600
So maybe you might see a video from us in the next week or two coming out on that subject.

2168
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:02,240
Oh, a little sneak peek, you're gonna be visiting Piers.

2169
03:03:02,240 --> 03:03:04,120
Maybe.

2170
03:03:04,120 --> 03:03:05,400
What do you need funding for?

2171
03:03:05,400 --> 03:03:06,400
I bet you're doing good.

2172
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:08,680
Oh, yes, well, we do need funding.

2173
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:13,600
How about I underwrite you go into Piers' house, and then I get a plug for M4wars.com.

2174
03:03:13,600 --> 03:03:15,920
You want some help there?

2175
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:18,440
We might be able to talk about that, yeah.

2176
03:03:18,440 --> 03:03:21,360
Maybe I'll go to his house.

2177
03:03:21,360 --> 03:03:25,320
We would like to go to his house and maybe not that idea because it might be he may have

2178
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:29,840
seen the video, but maybe something else, we'll have to think about it.

2179
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:34,960
Oh, I'll tell you, of course, Piers can't really come out during the day, though.

2180
03:03:34,960 --> 03:03:39,440
He is a vampire, so I would, who sucks the rights out of country, he's already into England

2181
03:03:39,440 --> 03:03:43,800
now, he's run over here, I would not go, I would go during the night if you wanted to

2182
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:44,800
actually come out.

2183
03:03:44,800 --> 03:03:46,480
That's a good idea.

2184
03:03:46,480 --> 03:03:50,520
Maybe when he gets home, I don't know, when he gets home for the weekend or something,

2185
03:03:50,520 --> 03:03:54,160
he's not working very late at night or very early in the morning.

2186
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:56,360
Yeah, well, I mean, it's well known he won't come out.

2187
03:03:56,360 --> 03:03:58,520
He's never been hit by sunlight.

2188
03:03:58,520 --> 03:03:59,520
Is that so?

2189
03:03:59,520 --> 03:04:00,520
Yeah.

2190
03:04:00,520 --> 03:04:01,520
I'm being sarcastic.

2191
03:04:01,520 --> 03:04:02,520
All right, we're gonna go to break.

2192
03:04:02,520 --> 03:04:03,520
This is a short segment.

2193
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:06,920
Come back with Truth Raider and a few others, and then we're gonna get into, for folks that

2194
03:04:06,920 --> 03:04:10,200
haven't seen it on your website, you went to Holder's house, you name it.

2195
03:04:10,200 --> 03:04:13,000
How did you have the huevos to do that?

2196
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:18,920
It was actually, I have to compliment my reporters, we got about 18 to 24 people that go out there

2197
03:04:18,920 --> 03:04:24,160
and do it, and there were three girls that went to his house, and no more than five seconds

2198
03:04:24,160 --> 03:04:27,880
after they knocked on Eric Holder's door, the FBI police showed up.

2199
03:04:27,880 --> 03:04:43,280
We're going to go to break, back it up, great job guys having that ready.

2200
03:04:43,280 --> 03:04:44,280
That was seamless.

2201
03:04:44,280 --> 03:04:48,000
We're going to come back and take a few calls, then play that, and then recap it.

2202
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:51,840
But notice the FBI's there to protect him because he's a big man.

2203
03:04:51,840 --> 03:04:55,960
You the common slaves though, you don't get a gun, so he agrees with the Ku Klux Klan.

2204
03:04:55,960 --> 03:05:00,640
The commoners don't get guns, only the big master gets the guns.

2205
03:05:00,640 --> 03:05:02,920
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

2206
03:05:02,920 --> 03:05:09,200
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we

2207
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:14,200
are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

2208
03:05:14,200 --> 03:05:19,840
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

2209
03:05:19,840 --> 03:05:20,840
your help.

2210
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:26,080
By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

2211
03:05:26,080 --> 03:05:32,120
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2212
03:05:32,120 --> 03:05:35,580
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2213
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:41,800
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2214
03:05:41,800 --> 03:05:49,240
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2215
03:05:49,240 --> 03:05:50,960
and ultimate extermination.

2216
03:05:50,960 --> 03:05:53,120
The war is here.

2217
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:55,000
It's an Infowar.

2218
03:05:55,000 --> 03:06:00,360
The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2219
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:06,080
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.

2220
03:06:06,080 --> 03:06:09,000
I want you to know some very important information.

2221
03:06:09,000 --> 03:06:13,840
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White

2222
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:18,160
House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.

2223
03:06:18,160 --> 03:06:23,720
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

2224
03:06:23,720 --> 03:06:28,800
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

2225
03:06:28,800 --> 03:06:33,940
occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single

2226
03:06:33,940 --> 03:06:35,080
normal cell.

2227
03:06:35,080 --> 03:06:38,840
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune

2228

That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove in a can.

He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2250
03:08:18,200 --> 03:08:22,320
And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

2251
03:08:22,320 --> 03:08:26,520
Yes, and riding shotgun with us from the bottom of the hour, James O'Keefe.

2252
03:08:26,520 --> 03:08:31,600
He, of course, is the legendary investigative journalist, a young guy as well, in the last

2253
03:08:31,600 --> 03:08:36,520
five, six years, has brought down Acre and exposed Planned Parenthood, gotten a bunch

2254
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:41,120
of resignations and congressional investigations over NPR.

2255
03:08:41,120 --> 03:08:43,520
We're going to be going back to him and a few of your phone calls that have been holding,

2256
03:08:43,520 --> 03:08:45,040
and then we're going to get into his program.

2257
03:08:45,040 --> 03:08:47,680
We're going to play some audio and video clips here.

2258
03:08:47,680 --> 03:08:50,920
Audio for radio, video for prisonplanet.tv viewers.

2259
03:08:50,920 --> 03:08:55,080
Going around to Eric Holder's house, the Attorney General, saying, hey, you want our guns, will

2260
03:08:55,080 --> 03:08:58,360
you turn your guns in, or will you put a gun-free zone sign at your house?

2261
03:08:58,360 --> 03:09:01,360
And within 30 seconds, the FBI pulls up.

2262
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:06,240
So they've got your tax money guarding all their houses, but you're not going to get

2263
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:07,240
see.

2264
03:09:07,240 --> 03:09:10,720
They're going to have guns, and they're going to have armed guards and red carpets.

2265
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:14,240
But you don't need to have a gun, okay, because they're government.

2266
03:09:14,240 --> 03:09:20,920
Some of the news up at infowars.com, Feinstein rolls out draconian attack on the Second Amendment.

2267
03:09:20,920 --> 03:09:25,520
That's all detailed in the well over 150 guns to be banned, because it says this gun and

2268
03:09:25,520 --> 03:09:29,280
all others like it, basically, it's that interpretation, it's so dangerous.

2269
03:09:29,280 --> 03:09:34,800
Congressman, Obama only upholds the Soviet Constitution, very powerful article that a

2270
03:09:34,800 --> 03:09:38,840
congressman's come out and basically made some powerful statements.

2271
03:09:38,840 --> 03:09:42,920
Here are the children murdered by drone attacks at the hands of Obama, showing you care less

2272
03:09:42,920 --> 03:09:43,920
about children.

2273
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:48,720
An Iranian ambassador, only war can stop us now.

2274
03:09:48,720 --> 03:09:52,480
And Michael Bloomberg's Twilight Zone, key article by Kurt Nemo, women to be drafted

2275
03:09:52,480 --> 03:09:53,480
under Pentagon plan.

2276
03:09:53,480 --> 03:09:57,120
That's what all this women in the military thing's about, is they want universal service.

2277
03:09:57,120 --> 03:10:01,480
But the women will just be the domestic enforcers, that's their own words, the Chicago boss's

2278
03:10:01,480 --> 03:10:03,280
words when he was at the White House.

2279
03:10:03,280 --> 03:10:07,800
Missouri law will force gun owners to register with schools.

2280
03:10:07,800 --> 03:10:11,760
This is the new thing to shame us, as the Attorney General has said, well, he should

2281
03:10:11,760 --> 03:10:12,760
be ashamed.

2282
03:10:12,760 --> 03:10:16,200
But we're gonna take a few calls and then get to James O'Keefe's breakdown of going

2283
03:10:16,200 --> 03:10:21,760
to people's newspapers that publish gun owners names saying, why don't you put a sign saying

2284
03:10:21,760 --> 03:10:22,880
no guns?

2285
03:10:22,880 --> 03:10:26,480
And going to Holder's house, the Attorney General, that's coming up.

2286
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:30,000
But right now, Truth Raider in Oregon, thanks for holding her on the air.

2287
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:33,360
Hey, buddy, hey, buddy, go ahead.

2288
03:10:33,360 --> 03:10:34,360
I've been vaccinated.

2289
03:10:34,360 --> 03:10:35,360
I'm sick.

2290
03:10:35,360 --> 03:10:37,360
Oh, are you Piers Morgan?

2291
03:10:37,360 --> 03:10:42,760
No, I'm glad I'm not him.

2292
03:10:42,760 --> 03:10:45,400
I would have terminal illness if I was that guy.

2293
03:10:45,400 --> 03:10:49,000
Okay, hey, you've been holding a while, what's on your mind, bro?

2294
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:52,240
Well, this is what's frightening.

2295
03:10:52,240 --> 03:10:57,960
I did a beta test, I went down to my local mall, wore a padded jacket.

2296
03:10:57,960 --> 03:11:03,400
I walked through, and anytime I say, wow, this is scary.

2297
03:11:03,400 --> 03:11:10,400
I could have had a Glock 19, a Tech 9, a Ruger, what have you, and I could have done business.

2298
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:15,480
Well, you're never gonna stop people that wanna do bad things, I mean, especially with

2299
03:11:15,480 --> 03:11:20,840
a sheep-like population, what's your point?

2300
03:11:20,840 --> 03:11:23,920
I mean, what is going on here?

2301
03:11:23,920 --> 03:11:32,640
They want to take our guns from us, but then they leave everything open for fair game.

2302
03:11:32,640 --> 03:11:38,240
Everything is left open, and it's like it's a hunting season.

2303
03:11:38,240 --> 03:11:39,240
Everyone's-

2304
03:11:39,240 --> 03:11:43,360
No, no, that's what they do, and they introduce the hunting season for crazy people is the

2305
03:11:43,360 --> 03:11:47,920
public schools to go shoot people where they've disarmed everyone and made sure, hey, here's

2306
03:11:47,920 --> 03:11:48,920
where the victims are.

2307
03:11:48,920 --> 03:11:55,440
So, let me go back to our guest on that subject, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas, investigative

2308
03:11:55,440 --> 03:11:58,060
journalist, Parx Salon.

2309
03:11:58,060 --> 03:12:02,240
What about making the school's gun free and then advertising and hyping it?

2310
03:12:02,240 --> 03:12:06,720
I mean, it's like they're hoping for another mass shooting to get our guns.

2311
03:12:06,720 --> 03:12:12,400
Well, that's one of the things that I thought about doing with this recent Citizens Against

2312
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:15,200
Stencils Violence mockumentary we made on YouTube.

2313
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:18,520
I thought about going to the Sidwell School.

2314
03:12:18,520 --> 03:12:23,380
This is the school where David Gregory's kids go in Washington, as well as Barack Obama's

2315
03:12:23,380 --> 03:12:25,080
kids go.

2316
03:12:25,080 --> 03:12:32,120
And I just thought it was too risky because there's secret services there, and it'd just

2317
03:12:32,120 --> 03:12:33,120
be too risky.

2318
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:37,440
They'd probably arrest me immediately, but I would have loved to go to the Sidwell School

2319
03:12:37,440 --> 03:12:42,820
where David Gregory's kids go and offer them to put a sign up that says this school is

2320
03:12:42,820 --> 03:12:43,820
gun free.

2321
03:12:43,820 --> 03:12:45,160
But see, that's your First Amendment right.

2322
03:12:45,160 --> 03:12:46,880
Maybe I should go there and do that.

2323
03:12:46,880 --> 03:12:50,960
And if they arrest you just to get some more news coverage, MSNBC and others said people

2324
03:12:50,960 --> 03:12:52,200
are attacking their kids.

2325
03:12:52,200 --> 03:12:53,280
No, we're not.

2326
03:12:53,280 --> 03:12:55,440
Their kids are protected by armed guards.

2327
03:12:55,440 --> 03:12:58,280
Why are they trying to block our children being protected?

2328
03:12:58,280 --> 03:13:00,760
Why do they tell them crouch down and wait to be killed?

2329
03:13:00,760 --> 03:13:03,440
I mean, we're not being aggressive to them.

2330
03:13:03,440 --> 03:13:06,320
They're trying to make sure we can't protect ourselves.

2331
03:13:06,320 --> 03:13:08,520
They're trying to make sure we're fair game.

2332
03:13:08,520 --> 03:13:09,880
They're assaulting us.

2333
03:13:09,880 --> 03:13:12,560
Well, maybe you should go to the Sidwell School and do it.

2334
03:13:12,560 --> 03:13:16,000
You'd have more moxie than me if you chose to do that.

2335
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:21,760
I've been arrested, Alex, and I have to raise the money privately, and it's difficult for

2336
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:22,760
us sometimes.

2337
03:13:22,760 --> 03:13:27,680
No, I've been arrested quite a few times too, but I always drop the charges because I haven't

2338
03:13:27,680 --> 03:13:28,680
done anything.

2339
03:13:28,680 --> 03:13:32,400
I mean, if I went up to the edge of the school and started and saying, I'd like to offer

2340
03:13:32,400 --> 03:13:33,400
or knock, knock.

2341
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:36,080
Hi, I'd like to offer you this sign that you're a gun free zone.

2342
03:13:36,080 --> 03:13:37,600
Oh, but you've got guns.

2343
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:38,600
Well, why is that?

2344
03:13:38,600 --> 03:13:40,600
Why do you have guns?

2345
03:13:40,600 --> 03:13:42,600
Do you not like children?

2346
03:13:42,600 --> 03:13:45,360
You want to support the death children or something like that?

2347
03:13:45,360 --> 03:13:49,000
Yeah, but I mean, and again, in the free country, we'd get arrested.

2348
03:13:49,000 --> 03:13:52,240
Well, let's talk about this clip, because some stations just joined us.

2349
03:13:52,240 --> 03:13:55,600
Tell folks what you did again, and then we're going to play the clip of going to the Attorney

2350
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:56,640
General's house.

2351
03:13:56,640 --> 03:14:00,880
So we posed this group called Citizens Against Senseless Violence.

2352
03:14:00,880 --> 03:14:08,520
We posed as an anti-gun group, and we made a little advertising campaign to go along

2353
03:14:08,520 --> 03:14:14,520
with it, with white t-shirts, and we said, we want to save the children, guns kill children,

2354
03:14:14,520 --> 03:14:15,520
guns are bad.

2355
03:14:15,520 --> 03:14:22,080
And we went to the homes of politicians, journalists, and Attorney General Eric Holder, MSNBC, Star

2356
03:14:22,080 --> 03:14:24,440
Ledger, Westchester Journal News.

2357
03:14:24,440 --> 03:14:27,280
They printed the names of gun owners.

2358
03:14:27,280 --> 03:14:30,960
And we went to the home of Eric Holder, which is a clip you're about to play in northwest

2359
03:14:30,960 --> 03:14:35,920
Washington DC, and within five seconds of knocking on Eric Holder's door to put a sign

2360
03:14:35,920 --> 03:14:40,660
on his lawn that says this home is gun free, the FBI police showed up.

2361
03:14:40,660 --> 03:14:46,920
Now imagine if the public schools had a couple cops at them, or just teachers trained and

2362
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:51,480
armed, it would be the same thing, but no, only he gets 24 hour guard service.

2363
03:14:51,480 --> 03:14:59,640
And Alex, not only does Eric Holder get FBI police protection 24 hours, journalists at

2364
03:14:59,640 --> 03:15:05,760
the Westchester Journal News had 24 hour armed guards protecting their homes as well.

2365
03:15:05,760 --> 03:15:11,120
Yeah, I saw that because the evil gun owners had been calling them and my gosh, they better

2366
03:15:11,120 --> 03:15:13,480
have armed guards now.

2367
03:15:13,480 --> 03:15:14,480
I saw that in the news.

2368
03:15:14,480 --> 03:15:16,720
Did that happen after you went to their houses or before?

2369
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:19,840
That happened before that started happening.

2370
03:15:19,840 --> 03:15:25,200
There was a program on Fox, Judge Janine, she actually went to two of their homes a

2371
03:15:25,200 --> 03:15:29,840
few days before we did, and she caught the same thing.

2372
03:15:29,840 --> 03:15:30,840
So they had been there.

2373
03:15:30,840 --> 03:15:34,520
And so they were scared of a Fox TV host like they were gonna come kill them.

2374
03:15:34,520 --> 03:15:37,920
I mean, again, these people are nuts, and then they have guns protecting them.

2375
03:15:37,920 --> 03:15:43,480
I mean, it's just, and they always say, Israel doesn't have guns, don't bring that up, NRA's

2376
03:15:43,480 --> 03:15:44,480
wrong.

2377
03:15:44,480 --> 03:15:45,960
It's wrong to say we're armed.

2378
03:15:45,960 --> 03:15:50,400
They say we're discredited by bringing this up because it's what discredits them.

2379
03:15:50,400 --> 03:15:55,480
And they're saying, please, throw us in the briar patch, stop doing this.

2380
03:15:55,480 --> 03:15:59,880
They know it's effective, that's why they're telling us, this isn't effective, stop it,

2381
03:15:59,880 --> 03:16:00,880
stop it.

2382
03:16:00,880 --> 03:16:08,000
Right, well, even the Washington Post, Alex, put out a piece that was very positive about

2383
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:09,280
this recent investigation.

2384
03:16:09,280 --> 03:16:14,320
So some people in the mainstream media appreciate the fact that we're exposing frauds.

2385
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:18,240
I think it's a winning issue when you expose them to be frauds and cowards.

2386
03:16:18,240 --> 03:16:19,240
Well it's more than that.

2387
03:16:19,240 --> 03:16:22,400
When the Washington Post came out and said don't publish people's names, this has happened

2388
03:16:22,400 --> 03:16:24,960
over the last few decades, people always get mad.

2389
03:16:24,960 --> 03:16:27,660
The Washington Post doesn't wanna upset us too much.

2390
03:16:27,660 --> 03:16:30,480
They're telling the other liberals, we'll get them later.

2391
03:16:30,480 --> 03:16:34,520
Don't rile them up, because they're scared of us coming to their houses.

2392
03:16:34,520 --> 03:16:38,160
They're scared of us pointing out they've got armed guards, they wanna shut this down.

2393
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:45,040
They don't wanna be, the journalists definitely do not want to be personally exposed.

2394
03:16:45,040 --> 03:16:50,960
But that's what they've been doing to us peasants, I call us peasants.

2395
03:16:50,960 --> 03:16:55,560
That's what they've been doing to the common people for decades, so it's time that we expose

2396
03:16:55,560 --> 03:16:56,560
the journalists.

2397
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:57,800
Absolutely, it's time.

2398
03:16:57,800 --> 03:17:00,920
Let's talk to, no, let's go ahead and play this clip.

2399
03:17:00,920 --> 03:17:05,400
Here's the clip with the group going to Attorney General's house.

2400
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:10,320
Home of Eric Holder, US Attorney General, Washington DC, here it is.

2401
03:17:10,320 --> 03:17:17,880
We're on camera, they say, three women, how can I help you?

2402
03:17:17,880 --> 03:17:25,240
Less than 30 seconds, the police, federal police.

2403
03:17:25,240 --> 03:17:45,120
We're in a newly formed group, the hair not home right now.

2404
03:17:45,120 --> 03:18:01,360
Four slam two, signs rejected two.

2405
03:18:01,360 --> 03:18:06,400
Why you don't want us to know that you don't have guns, cuz we know you do.

2406
03:18:06,400 --> 03:18:15,680
We're assuming this is a gun-free household, I think that's correct.

2407
03:18:15,680 --> 03:18:20,680
Thank you for the visit, I'm not gonna speak on your signs.

2408
03:18:20,680 --> 03:18:21,680
I appreciate what you're doing, but by the same token, I'm gonna pass on the signs.

2409
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:25,400
Yeah, nobody wants to say there's no gun in their house, they're all gonna have guns,

2410
03:18:25,400 --> 03:18:27,040
they've all got their little commie cards.

2411
03:18:27,040 --> 03:18:29,040
Violence, can we sign you up?

2412
03:18:29,040 --> 03:18:30,040
No thanks.

2413
03:18:30,040 --> 03:18:35,040
Yeah, any particular reason, are you gun owners or?

2414
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:39,080
I agree with you, I don't want to sign you up.

2415
03:18:39,080 --> 03:18:42,800
These so-called liberals, these authoritarians are so dumb, they're like, I agree with you,

2416
03:18:42,800 --> 03:18:47,000
every home should be gun-free, but no, I'm not taking your sign.

2417
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:48,000
Police getting called on them.

2418
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:51,960
A single member of the media, willing to live up to the strength of their convictions.

2419
03:18:51,960 --> 03:18:56,620
Now a final parting thought from our good friend Bob Braun at the Star Ledger, which

2420
03:18:56,620 --> 03:18:59,360
also wants to target law-abiding gun owners.

2421
03:18:59,360 --> 03:19:05,120
I was trying to get a nasty note from one of my most progressive friends who says, because

2422
03:19:05,120 --> 03:19:10,120
I wrote a column, I'm a columnist, and I wrote a column against, for sure your gun was, and

2423
03:19:10,120 --> 03:19:15,680
he said, you're a fool because when the right wing takes over the government, we're gonna

2424
03:19:15,680 --> 03:19:16,680
need guns.

2425
03:19:16,680 --> 03:19:19,680
So he's worried the right wing's gonna take over and then?

2426
03:19:19,680 --> 03:19:23,520
Yeah, and there'll be guns to fight them back.

2427
03:19:23,520 --> 03:19:27,520
Then I said, but they got the army, you know, they got the army and the navy and the marines

2428
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:28,520
and everything else.

2429
03:19:28,520 --> 03:19:32,880
Right, so he's gonna be a revolutionary too, but you know.

2430
03:19:32,880 --> 03:19:35,720
There you go, the insiders are talking about a revolution.

2431
03:19:35,720 --> 03:19:39,020
This is their revolution to get our guns and take over.

2432
03:19:39,020 --> 03:19:43,380
Final segment with our guest straight ahead, we'll give you the website as well to go see

2433
03:19:43,380 --> 03:19:44,380
all the videos.

2434
03:19:44,380 --> 03:20:01,520
I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, and we're streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.

2435
03:20:01,520 --> 03:20:07,920
Hello I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the infowars.com team want to relay to you and

2436
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:14,200
your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

2437
03:20:14,200 --> 03:20:19,840
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

2438
03:20:19,840 --> 03:20:20,840
your help.

2439
03:20:20,840 --> 03:20:26,080
By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at infowars.com, you will wake up

2440
03:20:26,080 --> 03:20:32,100
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

2441
03:20:32,100 --> 03:20:35,560
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

2442
03:20:35,560 --> 03:20:41,760
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

2443
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:49,240
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

2444
03:20:49,240 --> 03:20:50,840
and ultimate extermination.

2445
03:20:50,840 --> 03:21:01,520
The war is here, it's an infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

2446
03:21:01,520 --> 03:21:06,360
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

2447
03:21:06,360 --> 03:21:10,940
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

2448
03:21:10,940 --> 03:21:12,800
by a disastrous economy?

2449
03:21:12,800 --> 03:21:15,520
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2450
03:21:15,520 --> 03:21:19,320
At e-foods direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather

2451
03:21:19,320 --> 03:21:22,240
life storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2452
03:21:22,240 --> 03:21:26,780
After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

2453
03:21:26,780 --> 03:21:31,600
are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister

2454
03:21:31,600 --> 03:21:32,600
and niece.

2455
03:21:32,600 --> 03:21:36,400
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2456
03:21:36,400 --> 03:21:38,640
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

2457
03:21:38,640 --> 03:21:41,000

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

2470
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:35,720
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

2471
03:22:35,720 --> 03:22:36,720
IRAs?

2472
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:40,800
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

2473
03:22:40,800 --> 03:22:42,480
of gold for your retirement.

2474
03:22:42,480 --> 03:22:45,960
Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

2475
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:50,960
If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

03:23:04,080 --> 03:23:06,640
You need to come here and help us.

2480
03:23:06,640 --> 03:23:09,000
We need assistance, please.

Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in

2483
03:23:16,960 --> 03:23:19,040
Bell Harbor say show me.

2484
03:23:19,040 --> 03:23:21,480

Don't worry, this show is documented.

2494

Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

2495
03:24:10,400 --> 03:24:18,640
By the way, you know, I've got to spend time trying to make money to fund the syndicated

2496
03:24:18,640 --> 03:24:21,880
radio show, the crew, the filmmaking, the nightly news, all of it.

2497
03:24:21,880 --> 03:24:25,160
And you guys have done a great job out there supporting us over the years with the products

2498
03:24:25,160 --> 03:24:27,280
we sell at Infowars.com.

2499
03:24:27,280 --> 03:24:31,160
I got approached last year by one of the, and I wasn't even a big skater, though I did

2500
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:32,160
like skateboards.

2501
03:24:32,160 --> 03:24:34,240
I just wasn't very good at it compared to my friends.

2502
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:38,600
You know, we go skate at the parking garages, all of it growing up.

2503
03:24:38,600 --> 03:24:42,080
But I mean, everybody knows Alien Workshop, probably the name in skateboards.

2504
03:24:42,080 --> 03:24:45,680
They approached us about six months ago and said, would you like to put out a custom line

2505
03:24:45,680 --> 03:24:49,840
of Infowars skateboards that come out at the regular price but are custom?

2506
03:24:49,840 --> 03:24:50,840
And I said, absolutely.

2507
03:24:50,840 --> 03:24:55,780
So those are now available for sale at InfowarsShop.com and they're gonna come out with more and more.

2508
03:24:55,780 --> 03:25:01,160
But custom Infowars, limited edition, Divide and Conquer, look at that artwork inspired

2509
03:25:01,160 --> 03:25:03,200
by our work.

2510
03:25:03,200 --> 03:25:07,600
And they're great artists of the left and right and how they control both Republicans

2511
03:25:07,600 --> 03:25:09,120
and Democrats.

2512
03:25:09,120 --> 03:25:13,960
Divide and Conquer Alien Workshop, that's just one of them and they've got a brainwashing

2513
03:25:13,960 --> 03:25:14,960
one.

2514
03:25:14,960 --> 03:25:22,200
And this is just a test, Brainwash Skate Deck, 49.95, Divide and Conquer, 49.95.

2515
03:25:22,200 --> 03:25:26,920
I mean, that's a super high quality skateboard, $49 and you put your wheels on it wherever

2516
03:25:26,920 --> 03:25:29,520
you custom have there and like.

2517
03:25:29,520 --> 03:25:32,200
So there you have it and there's gonna be a bunch more coming out, but those are limited

2518
03:25:32,200 --> 03:25:35,360
edition, available right now at InfowarsStore.com.

2519
03:25:35,360 --> 03:25:40,880
James O'Keefe, we gotta talk in the next few days off air when you get time and I get time.

2520
03:25:40,880 --> 03:25:43,360
I've been meaning to get a hold of you for years, stuff falls to the cracks.

2521
03:25:43,360 --> 03:25:46,480
I salute what you've done, I salute your work.

2522
03:25:46,480 --> 03:25:50,000
We've got a lady who wants to talk to you, Susan, real fast in California, who says you

2523
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:51,000
inspired her.

2524
03:25:51,000 --> 03:25:55,280
Susan, real fast, you're on the air with the head of the Project Veritas.

2525
03:25:55,280 --> 03:26:00,240
Thank you very much, Alex and James, I met you a couple of years ago at a pro-life block.

2526
03:26:00,240 --> 03:26:05,600
You made a very inspiring speech telling everyone that even though we may be small in number

2527
03:26:05,600 --> 03:26:12,240
at the time, that everyone can make an action that causes a reaction.

2528
03:26:12,240 --> 03:26:18,440
And because of you, I started speaking up about the problems within Girl Scouts and

2529
03:26:18,440 --> 03:26:21,320
how they have a very pro-abortion agenda and-

2530
03:26:21,320 --> 03:26:24,400
Oh, it's total brainwashing, total brainwashing.

2531
03:26:24,400 --> 03:26:27,080
I would love for you to cover this because this is cookie season.

2532
03:26:27,080 --> 03:26:31,680
I mean, they are at the height of their selling at this very moment.

2533
03:26:31,680 --> 03:26:39,120
And if you would let your listeners become enlightened on how deep they go into indoctrinating-

2534
03:26:39,120 --> 03:26:43,200
Oh, no, no, no, type in Girl Scouts trained to fight terrorists.

2535
03:26:43,200 --> 03:26:46,200
And then you actually get the training, it's what are mommy and daddy doing?

2536
03:26:46,200 --> 03:26:49,840
In fact, were you aware of this, James, it sounds crazy, but it's really happening.

2537
03:26:49,840 --> 03:26:53,480
I've heard something about the Girl Scouts and abortion.

2538
03:26:53,480 --> 03:26:57,720
I haven't- Tell him what they're doing, Susan.

2539
03:26:57,720 --> 03:27:03,280
It's beyond that, just last month in December, the Girl Scouts representing its 10 million

2540
03:27:03,280 --> 03:27:08,080
members around the world were at the Global Youth Forum in Bali.

2541
03:27:08,080 --> 03:27:12,780
They actually were on the steering committee.

2542
03:27:12,780 --> 03:27:18,800
And they came up with a statement asking for legalization of prostitution.

2543
03:27:18,800 --> 03:27:21,080
Oh, my God, that's breaking news.

2544
03:27:21,080 --> 03:27:24,160
Do me a favor, send that to showtipsatinfowars.com.

2545
03:27:24,160 --> 03:27:25,760
Show tips, okay.

2546
03:27:25,760 --> 03:27:30,720
Yeah, show tips, and it's all about trafficking women, it's all about exterminating them once

2547
03:27:30,720 --> 03:27:33,520
they have babies, aborting them, just amazing.

2548
03:27:33,520 --> 03:27:35,760
We'll look into that, showtipsatinfowars.com.

2549
03:27:35,760 --> 03:27:40,160
James, thanks for all the time, we got three minutes in closing here in this segment.

2550
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:43,120
What else would you like to impart to everybody out there?

2551
03:27:43,120 --> 03:27:47,440
Well, I wanted to reemphasize what I said before.

2552
03:27:47,440 --> 03:27:51,680
I believe the way to change the world is through journalism.

2553
03:27:51,680 --> 03:27:56,520
And the listener in California just said, I actually did do a little site, it's remarkable

2554
03:27:56,520 --> 03:28:00,080
that it's a small world because I was out in California about three years ago giving

2555
03:28:00,080 --> 03:28:01,080
a talk.

2556
03:28:01,080 --> 03:28:05,800
And she's right, you produce a consequence that produces a reaction.

2557
03:28:05,800 --> 03:28:10,520
And if you expose something that's so outrageous that forces people to react to you, and it's

2558
03:28:10,520 --> 03:28:15,440
that reaction that gets into the news, and then whenever they, like in this case when

2559
03:28:15,440 --> 03:28:21,680
Toure reacted to our gun video, I'm sure the MSNBC people were saying, Toure, don't say

2560
03:28:21,680 --> 03:28:24,560
anything, you're just going to give oxygen to a story.

2561
03:28:24,560 --> 03:28:33,020
So we have proven that citizen journalists can actually change laws, force politicians

2562
03:28:33,020 --> 03:28:34,400
to act.

2563
03:28:34,400 --> 03:28:36,840
And in the next year, we're going to triple our efforts.

2564
03:28:36,840 --> 03:28:43,880
You can follow us at Project Veritas, that's Project Veritas.com.

2565
03:28:43,880 --> 03:28:46,760
And if you want to get involved in one of these video projects, if you want to be a

2566
03:28:46,760 --> 03:28:51,760
videographer, if you want to be trained to go undercover, contact our website, send us

2567
03:28:51,760 --> 03:28:54,820
a tip, and we'll put you out in the field.

2568
03:28:54,820 --> 03:28:56,880
There you go, info warriors.

2569
03:28:56,880 --> 03:29:01,680
The fight is now, the war is now, whether it's We Are Change or Veritas, or you want

2570
03:29:01,680 --> 03:29:05,520
to say you're an info warrior reporter just uploading to YouTube, then we can use clips

2571
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:06,520
on our show.

2572
03:29:06,520 --> 03:29:10,680
It doesn't matter, help out Veritas, help out info wars, get involved in We Are Change.

2573
03:29:10,680 --> 03:29:16,980
We're all in this together, and it is so exciting to see the powerful alternative media now

2574
03:29:16,980 --> 03:29:18,020
really together.

2575
03:29:18,020 --> 03:29:23,000
We overshadow the dinosaur media, and that's why they're panicking with the DrudgeReport.com

2576
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:26,800
and WorldNetDaily and countless others, very, very exciting.

2577
03:29:26,800 --> 03:29:30,920
Hey, tell my producer here, James, as you leave, when is a good time for me?

2578
03:29:30,920 --> 03:29:34,800
A couple of windows to try to give you a call the next few days, okay?

2579
03:29:34,800 --> 03:29:35,800
Okay, will do.

2580
03:29:35,800 --> 03:29:39,360
All right, James, thank you so much, very, very exciting, ladies and gentlemen, thank

2581
03:29:39,360 --> 03:29:40,360
you.

2582
03:29:40,360 --> 03:29:43,400
Ladies and gentlemen, they're attacking us right now, okay?

2583
03:29:43,400 --> 03:29:46,800
So I'm not looking for any trouble, but they started the fight.

2584
03:29:46,800 --> 03:29:50,720
I say we stomp their butt in the info war.

2585
03:29:50,720 --> 03:29:54,360
We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

2586
03:29:54,360 --> 03:30:01,160
