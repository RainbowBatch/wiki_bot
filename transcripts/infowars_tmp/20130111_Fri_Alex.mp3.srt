1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,720
he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:43,280
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday. This is your captain speaking. We've got some really

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,280
rough turbulence coming up ahead, so strap yourselves in. It is Friday, the 11th day

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,680
of January, 2013. You can see the shirt I'm wearing, Come and Take It, a variant of the

6
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,620
famous Texas saying that started the Texas Revolution for Independence against Santa

7
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,200
Anna when he came to confiscate the guns.

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,120
And in Gonzales, Texas, they hoisted up a flag with a cannon as the symbol and one white

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:13,760
star saying, Come and Take It. And then inside of the t-shirt I'm wearing is a AK-47, and

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,720
it says the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. We just put this t-shirt

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,320
up for sale, not starting the broadcast with a plug here for a product. I mean, I guess

12
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,220
I am, but I was just looking at the shirt that I was wearing this morning and thought

13
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,440
that I should mention it's now the best seller we've ever had of t-shirts, only been selling

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,480
for about a week, and is set to sell out very soon, but never fear, we're getting more printed

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,480
right here in the good old USA.

16
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,320
But there it is, ladies and gentlemen, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:52,460
and infringed is the barrel of the rifle. Come and Take It. And that's what I told Piers

18
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,120
Morgan on Monday. Now, again, I don't get sick very often, but I do get allergies every

19
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:09,720
year during the cedar season. It's not really Caesar, it's a mountain juniper.

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,060
And I get sore throats from it, so I've ignored for two and a half weeks really bad sore throat

21
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,560
until I finally got a fever two nights ago. And I said, no, you're sick, you're wheezing,

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,600
something's wrong. So I went to the doctor and they did the swabs and the checks. And

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,640
the physician's assistant that came in and did most of the work was a Afghanistan veteran,

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,760
a big listener. He talked about how they were in Afghanistan, would listen to the show and

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
how he's about to go back to be a medic over there.

26
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,880
They have the swab and the check, I have a bacterial infection and bronchitis going into

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:49,200
pneumonia. Now, the reason I mention that is that I've been kind of in a fog the last

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,160
week or so and could barely breathe when I was in New York. So I really couldn't decide

29
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,040
deep down whether I was just telling myself I did a good job when some people were saying

30
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,120
I did a bad job or whether it was because I was sick.

31
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,200
And I just couldn't basically analyze and make the right decision because usually I'm

32
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,440
very clear on things. But they put me on some powerful antibiotics in an inhaler yesterday.

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,520
And I'm all for antibiotics if they're not overused. Problem is everybody overuses them.

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,040
I haven't had antibiotics about four years since I was Bilderberg four years ago, since

35
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,480
I cut my leg in D.C. and I got infected.

36
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,840
And then that time I waited too long until it was all rotting inside and they did x-rays

37
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,180
of that and said, look at this. If this would have gone another week, you might have lost

38
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,020
your leg. I had like two different types of bacteria, one of them flesh eating inside

39
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,120
my leg. But again, that itself is a side issue. I immediately when I started taking antibiotics

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,720
yesterday afternoon and got on the inhaler and also took some of the decongestant cough

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,120
syrup they gave me. And the nasal spray, the guy said, you need all of this.

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,380
I'm surprised you're up walking around, which they always say that, but actually wasn't

43
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,000
walking around some of the time when I was in New York. I was laying there in a bed getting

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,120
ready to go on Piers Morgan. I couldn't tell, hey, I thought I did a good job, but maybe

45
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,120
it's because I'm sick.

46
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,320
Maybe my head isn't clear. This morning I woke up feeling like 80% better, 80% better

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:22,760
and just absolutely was clear that I did a darn good job. But within the response that

48
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:32,840
I saw for maybe 20, 30% of people negative, I really got a window into the mindset that

49
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,360
we have entered in this society.

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,080
So I want to talk about that when we come back here today. We got a bunch of clips I

51
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,640
didn't get to yesterday and a bunch of new ones. Piers Morgan is really getting his butt

52
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,600
handed to him. He had Ben Shapiro at Breitbart.com on and he just said, look, you're a big bully

53
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,560
using the deaths of those children to try to disarm us. And he's absolutely right. But

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,680
they are coming for the guns. We've got some really important news on that front. Stay

55
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,360
with us.

56
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,640

87
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,200
again if you try to take our firearms. It doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out

88
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,560
there on the street begging for them to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them.

89

Do you understand? Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.

90
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:40,720
I am your host Alex Jones. It is Friday, the 11th day of January 2013 and we are broadcasting

91
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,440
worldwide not just here in the United States but beaming out on Global Shortwave WWCR 100,000

92
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,520
pods, the internet at mfallwars.com, the audio streams and video streams at prisonplanet.tv,

93
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,320
XM166 and over 140 AM&FM affiliates here in the United States.

94
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,640
Okay, here's what's coming up. Eric Mankell Muller is going to be popping in in about

95
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,320
30 minutes to give us his take on the all out gun grab going on. Joel Skousen will pop

96
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,920
in in the last hour for 30 minutes. I wanted to get his take on the EU ministers. I wanted

97
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,960
his take a few weeks ago but you guys reprint me those articles dealing with EU ministers

98
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,400
want to merge with Russia and also the reports about the communist Chinese government saying

99
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
they want our guns and things.

100
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,520
I want to ask him how his view geopolitically how that fits into the UN gun treaty and why

101
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,960
they're pushing for victim disarmament so hard right now. They even started before the

102
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,000
Sandy Hook tragedy. So that's coming up today. Obviously, we're going to have open phones

103
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,800
as well once I start giving the phone number out and go over a plethora of news articles

104
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
that are up at info wars.com.

105
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,780
Right now, British host Piers Morgan calls US Constitution your little book and belittles

106
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,640
the Constitution and Bill of Rights and Nanny Bloomberg strikes again outlaws painkillers

107
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,560
in hospitals. So soda drinks, popcorn, milk products, and he's talking about outright

108
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,800
bans on cigarettes, you name it. It's all about control. But he's also going to make

109
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,360
you live in 250 square foot apartments, but he won't live in one. He'll live in a 15,000

110
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,760
foot penthouse, square foot penthouse.

111
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:25,000
Obama signs a bill giving him armed protection for life, amazing. Also nationwide ammo shortage

112
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,120
so severe that even cops can't buy bullets, ammo rationing imminent. That's one reason

113
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,280
they might have bought 1.6 million plus the last 14 months is to create such a crisis

114
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,240
they can nationalize ammo manufacturing and there's even some discussion of that.

115
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,560
That's what governments usually do that as in government shortages of quote, essential

116
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,760
material or products. That's in executive orders, by the way, already on the books is

117
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,720
unconstitutional but it never stops them. Sandy Hook massacre timeline, very important

118
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,400
new video report out from Rob Dube. They're also hyping severe flu reaches epidemic proportions.

119
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,920
That's actually not true. There's a lot of stuff going around this year, though, that

120
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
is certainly true.

121
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,840
I mean, I know more people that have been sick than I've seen in a long time. So I will

122
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,600
tell you that the flu itself is hype, but these bacterial infections, the respiratory

123
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,160
stuff, all the stuff being sprayed in the air. China has totally industrialized and

124
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,760
has dirty industries.

125
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,680
Their rivers every week or two set on fire. They make our industrial revolution look clean

126
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:33,400
and the jet stream dumps in all over the United States. But predominantly from Texas right

127
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,920
out of the Midwest, it comes in for more than 30,000 feet and dumps into a thousand feet.

128
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,120
That's why when the EPA goes out and does particulate measurements, it says, my gosh,

129
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,320
the air is so dirty. Yeah, they've tested it. The scientists have gone and checked it

130
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
in China.

131
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:58,480
You can pull all this up, it's well known. It's mainly Chinese and Indian and Pakistani,

132
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,760
you name it. I mean, incredibly dirty industries there. And the jet stream goes low on the

133
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,680
other side of the world, right over those areas. Bad luck for us the way God designed

134
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,480
it and then comes across.

135
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,240
That's just like with the Fukushima, why it came over here. The trade winds are lower,

136
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,760
also comes through those. The general prevailing winds go in some cases at 125 miles an hour

137
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,200
in the jet stream. That's why when you're in a jet going with the jet stream, the jet

138
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,120
stream was going really fast when I flew to New York, three hours.

139
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,960
It only takes three and a half with the normal jet stream. But the pilot talked about how

140
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:46,280
fast the jet stream was up over 125 miles an hour. And so we got there in right under

141
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:52,320
three hours. Now coming back over four hours, you're going into the jet stream. And I'm

142
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,720
already ranting about that. The point is, is that we have toxic waste raining down on

143
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:05,360
us and they're busy trying to tax people and make you have low flush toilets and mercury

144
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,880
filled light bulbs and taxes on carbon dioxide, UXL, and cals, methane flatulence, and there's

145
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,680
always been bovine animals running around passing gas.

146
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
They don't wanna go after any of the real environmental crises. They wanna go after

147
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,760
a bunch of stuff where they can tax everybody and continue all their GMO, genetic engineering,

148
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
the rest of it.

149
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:33,480
So we're gonna be looking at the flu situation some as well today. If you go to infowars.com,

150
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,640
you see what I think is the most important story of the day. Obama signs bill giving

151
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,180
himself armed protection for life. It's also, at least last time I checked 15 minutes ago,

152
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,440
the top middle story at drudgereport.com, so you can't miss it there.

153
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,960
With images of Obama and his Secret Service above it getting off Air Force One, and he

154
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,400
is expanding more armed protection. His presidents already have that, but now he's expanding.

155
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,340
He signed a bill to give even more armed protection despite launching a gun control agenda that

156
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,280
threatens to disarm the American people.

157
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:12,360
President Obama has signed a bill that would afford him armed Secret Service protection

158
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,520
for life. The legislation crafted by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina

159
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:22,920
rolls back the 1990s law that imposed a ten-year limit on Secret Service protection for former

160
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
presidents.

161
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,820
Bush's would have been the former commander-in-chief affected, reports Yahoo News. But they can

162
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:39,040
always use any threats once a year to keep Secret Service protection on the president.

163
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,440
I know cuz I've seen them mention that in the news that, well, as long as there's ongoing

164
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,080
investigations, one a year of threats to former presidents, they still get the guards. So

165
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,000
they still have them. In fact, we had Secret Service here a few weeks ago dealing with

166
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,360
something concerning a former Bush.

167
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,840
Not with us, but with some idiot making a comment. That's all I'll say. I can't even

168
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:08,800
get into it. The point is, is that that's how they keep it open. But now it doesn't

169
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,040
matter. They just get taxpayer paid for millions of dollars a year, 24 hours a day, multiple

170
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,320
armed guards.

171
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,320
The new bill, which will cost American taxpayers millions of dollars, is a reinstatement of

172
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,360
that in the 65 law, which will see presidents protected for life as well as their children

173
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,000
up to age 16. The irony of Obama seeking to surround himself with armed men for the rest

174
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,440
of his life while simultaneously working to disarm the American people via gun control

175
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:38,920
agenda that is likely to be enforced via executive decree represents the height of hypocrisy.

176
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,620
But it's not the first time Obama has lauded the notion of responsible Americans using

177
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,920
firearms to protect himself and his family while concurrently eviscerating the very same

178
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,360
right of American people.

179
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,480
During an ABC Nightline interview broadcast on December 26, yet recorded before the Sandy

180
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,000
Hook shooting, Obama said one of the benefits of his reelection was the ability to have

181
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,240
men with guns around at all times. We have a link to that video right there. But we ought

182
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,960
to get that video, guys. In order to protect his daughters, we ought to have that along

183
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,520
with Feinstein admitting she has armed guards and a concealed carry, but we shouldn't be

184
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,520
able to own a gun.

185
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,240
Mr. and Mrs. America, turn your guns in. In addition, the school attended by Obama's daughters

186
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,160
in Washington DC has no less than 11 armed security guards on duty at all times. Yet

187
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,880
the idea of arming teachers and school officials to prevent school massacres has been dismissed

188
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:35,000
by gun control advocates, their slave master advocates, who want school campuses to remain

189
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,880
gun free zones where victims are disarmed and shooters are free to carry out their rampage

190
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
unimpeded.

191
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,980
The hypocrisy of gun control advocates who feverishly work to create victim disarmament

192
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:51,100
yet surround themselves with armed men in rampant amongst the political class. As reported

193
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:56,040
last month, despite the same year calling for Mr. and Mrs. America to turn in their

194
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,120
guns, California Senator Dianne Feinstein authored draconian bill set to be introduced

195
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,480
later this month that would treat gun owners like sex offenders admitted to carrying a

196
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,760
concealed weapon for her own protection after she was threatened by a terrorist group.

197
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,720
She's actually already introduced the bill, but he was linking to a clip where she said

198
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,880
she'd introduce it. Other prominent gun control advocates such as Mayor Michael Bloomberg

199
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,080
have also aggressively pushed to disarm Americans, while themselves employing armed bodyguards

200
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,120
at all times. Michael Moore, another vehement proponent of gun control, also has armed bodyguards,

201
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,000
one of whom was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon in the New York JFK Airport in 2005.

202
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,920
His guns are banned there unless you get a license, which is like finding a Holy Grail

203
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:48,040
inside a unicorn's nose. A White House petition created at the end of last month calls for

204
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,600
making the White House and all federal buildings gun free zones.

205
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,240
If the government believes gun free zones are the solution for citizens, the same standards

206
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,480
you apply to government servants and employees states the petition, which currently has over

207
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:10,320
12,000 signatures. So there is the report at infoawars.com and drudgereport.com right

208
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:20,240
in the middle top column. I suggest that everyone go out and get that article at infoawars.com,

209
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,760
prisonblinder.com, drudgereport.com. You have no excuse. I know you already know the hypocrisy,

210
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,000
you already know it.

211
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,860
That doesn't mean your neighbor knows it. It doesn't mean your boss knows it. It doesn't

212
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,040
mean your employees know it. It doesn't mean your mother, your father, your sister, your

213
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,120
brother, your wife, your husband knows it. It doesn't mean the police chief knows it.

214
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,960
And by the way, this morning I'm watching Fox News and I was just going off violent

215
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,160
crime general statistics. And I'm watching Fox News on the morning show and one of the

216
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:57,120
hosts is debating Stromboli, that's how I remember his name, Geraldo Rivera.

217
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,440
And Rivera is saying, we need to restrict guns, basically agreeing with the owner of

218
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,800
News Corp, let's ban them basically. And the other host is putting up FBI statistics off

219
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,960
the same fpi.gov that I hadn't seen. And I'll be honest with you, I just said 21% cuz that's

220
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,800
what it showed over the last 15 years.

221
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,920
11 to 12% of it, depending on how you look at the graph, the last five or six since 2007.

222
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,840
I guess that's six, roughly. And I'm looking at it and they were going 49% drop in violent

223
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,800
crime. It was showing all these incredible numbers. So I grabbed my iPad and I went and

224
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,360
searched it and there were all these other breakdowns and I'm wrong.

225
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,440
It was, I can't believe it, it's true. Crime with guns in the commission of crimes has

226
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,960
dropped 49%. And by the way, I want to do a report on that tonight. I just, I know a

227
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,400
lot of you are watching Fox News this morning, you had to sit. Again, there I am again. People

228
00:19:53,400 --> 00:20:00,640
think I exaggerate. It's better than I even said. That's why the, oh man.

229
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,520
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

230
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,080
like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

231
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,040
by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything at e-foods

232
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,280
direct. We hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life storm

233
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,800
by having a supply of food on hand. After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York city

234
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,580
wrote almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just

235
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,240
in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

236
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,840
than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you heed the warnings and do

273
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,520
have open phones and we have another guest popping in. A lot of clips, a lot of key news

274
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:19,480
today. All right, so here's my bottom line on what happened with Piers Morgan. My original

275
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,280
gut statement that I think it was overall positive. Obviously, I could have done a better

276
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,040
job. I could have made a few of the points a little more fluidly, but in the moment,

277
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,920
in the adrenaline, and also now knowing that I had bronchitis, the beginnings of pneumonia,

278
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,680
I think I did a pretty good job. And Rob Duke can vouch for this. I was hacking and coughing

279
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,200
so hard, I could hardly breathe. But as soon as I went in there, they were asking, are

280
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,040
you okay? Are you okay? Here, have some tea, or you'll be off to go on air. And the producers

281
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
can vouch for that.

282
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,660
I may have overcompensated because I just absolutely felt horrible. That Sunday going

283
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,760
into that Monday, my wife is like, you shouldn't even go. She said, you're turning blue. Turns

284
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,880
out there's a lot of this really bad bacteria going around the country. They're hyping up

285
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:06,320
the flu, but that's not it so much. But I've gotta say, now that I've gotten a lot better

286
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,520
and feel good, and I've kinda got that more crystal clear thought process.

287
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Looking back on what happened with Piers Morgan, I think the hand of God was honored again.

288
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,120
And I don't spin things to myself. I'm my own worst critic. And when I do things wrong,

289
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll say it on air. There was an initial, even with my dad, my mother, and others, an

290
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,400
initial, man, you came off as really angry and in his face. Wouldn't have been better

291
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
if you'd been a little smoother.

292
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,600
You made some good points. It was very entertaining. But then they said, like a day later, we should

293
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,840
be angry about this. And that's what people on the street have told me. I was downtown

294
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,760
last night and this morning. That's what people everywhere, crew here, everyone has told me

295
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
that you know what?

296
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,120
They are coming after our guns and they're lying about the fact that they want our guns.

297
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,040
And I'm angry about that fact. And I'm angry about everything else they're doing. And I'm

298
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,800
glad you didn't just sit there and take that arrogant guy that even Larry King has now

299
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,960
come out against.

300
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,360
The guest last night called him a bully who's using the death of those children. And I didn't

301
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,640
intend to make that point, it was in my notes, but I never got to that. They're the ones

302
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,440
exploiting it. And it's that thing of we don't want your guns, we want reasonable restrictions.

303
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,480
I saw a LA Times article this morning attacking myself and showing me as a giant fat Michael

304
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:33,720
Moore type holding an M-16. And they said, these people won't be reasonable and realize

305
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,360
we don't wanna take their guns, we just want reasonable restrictions.

306
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,860
And I'm like, really, the bill introduced by Dianne Feinstein says they can make you

307
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,360
turn them in and makes everything else they say you can keep registered. All over the

308
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,640
world they end up taking the guns. The Attorney General, he was Deputy Attorney General, wrote

309
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:57,380
public statements saying I want total gunman. Obama has said it, the UN has said it. They've

310
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,480
all stated it, you know it.

311
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,720
You've heard Feinstein say Mr. and Mrs. America turn them in, we know the goal. And it's insulting

312
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
that they claim they care about 20 dead kids. It's about dominance and only government having

313
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,440
power. And that's why I blew up because I'm done. Patty caking, debating them in a nice

314
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,960
way. They try to set the agenda and say it's discrediting to get angry.

315
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,160
Don't do that, it's kooky. They say wanting to have a family's kooky, they say wanting

316
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,400
to own a gun is kooky. When Larry Pratt goes on and talks totally calm, they say he's a

317
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,920
kook, he's a weirdo, he's a nut. They are all about setting the parameters like they're

318
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,000
the boss and they decide what's kosher.

319
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,240
They decide what's okay, the system sets the parameters, they set the rules. They put themselves

320
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,480
in the position of authority in a big fancy set in a rotting CNN headquarters and sit

321
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:56,160
there and tell you they're in control and the emperor is wearing a beautiful cloak.

322
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:03,160
I call baloney. I say you're butt naked. And it just comes down to that. And I'll tell

323
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,800
you, you've seen me on many other national TV shows, C-SPAN, you name it. My wife's like,

324
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,140
why weren't you like when you're on C-SPAN? Or on The View you took over but you were

325
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,720
charming and focused and made all your points.

326
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,920
Why did you blow up? And I said, I think it's cuz I was sick. And he just made me mad. And

327
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,680
then I'm like, last night, I'm like, God, did I do the right thing? And I went to sleep

328
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:27,040
and I woke up this morning and it was all just crystal clear. And I already knew, even

329
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,560
though I've been sick and feeling out of it and couldn't really, maybe I did do it wrong.

330
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:38,800
That's them playing mind games with us. That's them all, I mean, when you watch these people,

331
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,000
they're talking to you like you're a person who's been hypnotized.

332
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:50,480
They're talking to you like you're fully under their control and they are the bosses. That's

333
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,840
what they're doing. They are setting the parameter like they are in control of everything. And

334
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,880
notice they always tell you, don't get upset, don't get angry. But when you see the governor

335
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,520
in New York saying, let's ban the semi-autos, he's yelling and screaming and hyping up his

336
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
troops.

337
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:15,080
Imagine if he told a football coach, cuz the whole world is a battle. Football's a battle.

338
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,600
Business is a battle. Raising your kids is a battle. And you've gotta decide you wanna

339
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,080
win the war. And win the war means raising them straight and strong and living in a free

340
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,320
country. They always are charging in, they've always got the force.

341
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,520
They're always trying to hype themselves up. But then they tell you, no, be passive, be

342
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,640
nice, sit down, go along with us. No, no, no, don't get upset. Sit down, sit down, don't

343
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,280
stand up, don't stand up. It's all a mind game. You've got to get mad. You've got to

344
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,360
get angry and realize there are a bunch of criminals lying to you. And you need to get

345
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,600
angry about the fact that there are a bunch of scammers. They're afraid of you.

346
00:29:49,600 --> 00:30:02,440
We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary

368
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,720
economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,880
and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

378
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:15,480
Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones. And that's what it comes

379
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:26,040
down to. I know you can see me. I see you. Piers Morgan, Dianne Feinstein, Barack Obama,

380
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:32,600
Eric Holder. They're all on record saying we shouldn't own any guns. Now they want to

381
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,200
have this debate and say, no, no, no, we just want reasonable restrictions.

382
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,480
Here's the LA Times today. If you're a prisonplanet.tv viewers, Alex Jones and other pro-gun paranoid

383
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,120
put the nuts in gun nuts. And then they show a fat guy with an M16 with a rebel flag on

384
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,280
a set. That's their image. That's what Piers Morgan calls Americans dumb and stupid. He

385
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,320
says I'm British. I've come to conquer America. That's in his tweets. And they go on to say

386
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:06,400
Jones is insane. He thinks we want to disarm and take the guns. They're crazy. I have John

387
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,560
Stewart saying we're crazy. No one wants to take our guns.

388
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,000
In fact, we'll play that clip coming up later with ManCal of mancal.com syndicated radio

389
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,320
host. They get his take on this because I was on his show yesterday and asked his take

390
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,160
and he thought it was a big victory. I was a little bit under the weather, a lot better

391
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,960
today. And I could really sit back this morning and look at it. And the fact that I blew up

392
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,580
at him, which I wasn't really intending to do, got people out of their trance.

393
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:39,560
Billy Corgan sent me a text and that night and said, you helped break the hypnosis. He's

394
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,760
a really smart guy. And that's why it resonated with so many people. I got sent emails by

395
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,120
psychologists and advertising people that I know saying, no, no, this is really good.

396
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,280
The reason the producer was crying, the reason they panicked and kicked you off the show,

397
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,000
the reason they were so scared is because if we ever stop letting them be in the position

398
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,320
of authority over us and they're like, you're going to be calm.

399
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,520
You're going to be nice. You're going to shut up. You're going to go along with this. And

400
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,880
if we ever break through that and go, you're a bunch of con artists. You're telling me

401
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,280
I'm crazy in the LA Times and you're telling me I'm crazy on The Daily Show. We have the

402
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
clips. Nobody's coming for your guns, crazy man.

403
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,280
Don't get upset. Don't get upset. They say it's crazy to get upset because that's where

404
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,520
they don't want you to go. They want to just, people keep saying, what does it take to get

405
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,600
America angry? What is it we won't take with the TSA sticking their hands on our pants

406
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,680
and the warrantless wiretapping and the checkpoints and the open borders?

407
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,200
And they just raised taxes again and lied to us about it. 77% of America's massive tax

408
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,700
increases when they lied and said they wouldn't. I was sitting there at the doctor yesterday

409
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,880
watching for like an hour. All these people come up and go, well, why has my money doubled?

410
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,720
It used to only be $100 when I came to the doctor. Why is it 200 now? Why is my medicine

411
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
so much more?

412
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,800
And they'd go, these are the changes. We're sorry, it's the insurance company. Next woman

413
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,480
comes up, all with the same chest cold I've got, all with the same pneumonia type symptoms.

414
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,200
And I'm sitting there for an hour, wanting to get into the doctor, an hour, an hour,

415
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,880
watching a packed big clinic, every person going up and paying, cuz they had a pharmacy

416
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,880
in there too.

417
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm watching the pharmacy, I'm watching the two lines, and they're all complaining, why

418
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,400
has it gotten so much more? Well, I already knew the insurance companies wrote the healthcare

419
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,440
bill. They're like, what does it have to do with guns? Everything. They wrote it to double,

420
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,720
they've now announced, that's the headlines, USA Today, AP Reuters, put it up, guys.

421
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:50,520
Premium set to double in 2013. Now they have now doubled, doubled. You got a discount,

422
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,920
you got a free ride. And now it does have death panels. Remember, these people are crazy.

423
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:59,560
There's no death panels. Now they're like Newsweek, Time, Reuters. We need death panels,

424
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,880
Slate Magazine, the case for death panels, the case for Kelly Granny, death panels, death

425
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
panels.

426
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,040
You know what, I'm sick of you. I read the stinking bill. I knew it was gonna rip everybody

427
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,040
off. I knew it set up death panels. And you know what, I can't hold it in anymore. Yeah,

428
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,120
Obamacare set the double premiums. That's Fox News, that's from last year, the new one,

429
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,480
it's now doubling. USA Today last week, they're now doubling.

430
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,960
And these people are like, why, why, why, griping out the nurses. And they're going,

431
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,280
look, it's your insurance company. It's the new act. That's why these companies are going

432
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,100
out of business. Doctors are retiring, because it's a scam. I'm sorry, man, Cal's on hold.

433
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,360
My point is, that's why I got mad. Because I was up there sick on the air, and I can't

434
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
put up with the crap anymore.

435
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,220
You know what, I'm glad I went to New York sick. And I'm glad I blew up now, because

436
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,760
we need to blow up. They're like, you're a kook, cuz you blew up, you discredited, and

437
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,880
we blew their mind game. My gosh, I got mad, I'm a kook. Our founding fathers killed people

438
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,680
that tried to take their guns. Our founding fathers rode around horses saying, get your

439
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,080
guns, get your guns, prepare for war, they're coming.

440
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:09,960
I'm not saying that, I'm a wimp. Paul Revere would walk up and say, coward, boom, slapped

441
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,440
me upside the head. George Washington saddled up with weapons and went up against the biggest

442
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:20,640
army in the world ever seen undefeated. 10 to 1, 15 to 1 some battles. Imagine Americans

443
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,600
today, and I had a huge, I'm going to mad Cal.

444
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:28,640
I had a huge epiphany today that my gosh, look what we've become. This is an example

445
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,800
of how pathetic we've gotten, some foreign usurper pig. In our country, and all these

446
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,640
other foreign globalists on purpose, getting us used to being told what to do and lectured

447
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:49,160
to. When the crime rate has dropped 49% with firearms, 21% total all violent crime in the

448
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,160
last 15 years. People like I thought you said it was 21, that was overall violent crime.

449
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,720
I was watching Fox, they had the FBI statistics up this morning. I couldn't believe they told

450
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,320
the truth, but still Geraldo said take the guns, that it was 49%. It was bad, there's

451
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,800
thousands of pages of fbi.gov, I didn't even read, but a few hundred.

452
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm sorry, man Cal, thank you for joining us, sir. I know you're a busy guy here, syndicated

453
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,720
radio hosts run a lot of the same stations. We're on the same station there together in

454
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,160
Chicago, what is it, 1530. Man Cal, you just heard my rant, my epiphany, do you agree with

455
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,840
it? What do you wanna add? What do you think about what happened?

456
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,360
Well, look brother, you and I are both alpha males. I think people need to know that first

457
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,480
of all, you have a great sense of humor. You really are a very funny guy and you're having

458
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:41,240
fun, you're enjoying this, you enjoy the fight. And I don't know that the lefties get that.

459
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:45,960
I can go on and on, look, I have all these politicians on, you do too. And they say,

460
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,720
well, do you need a machine gun to hunt deer? Do you need a handgun to hunt a deer? No,

461
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:57,480
it's not about hunting, it's about protection from you people. And boy, they're really,

462
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,560
I mean, the constitution be damned, the second amendment be damned, there's no laws for this

463
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,520
president, it's really something. Look, here was my take, and I know you don't agree with

464
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,720
me totally, okay? Can I get my take? Can you hear me okay?

465
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
Yes, I can.

466
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,880
Okay, I'm standing in the middle of the city of Chicago and okay, listen, folks, you have

467
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,320
to understand something. Land of the free, land of the free. If you say it enough, well,

468
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:27,720
it must be true. But we know the laws, everyday new laws, but just because you say something

469
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:35,360
doesn't mean it's true. It's brainwashing. The fact is that Piers Morgan in 2013 is insignificant.

470
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:40,880
I have more people on my little radio show and Alex has more people on his radio show.

471
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,900
More people are listening right now and paying attention to Alex than will be part of Piers

472
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:51,600
Morgan. If you read drugs, you saw all the hell that this man went through and I've gone

473
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:55,440
through and most of you people have gone through when he went through the airport. Take off

474
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,440
your shoes, jump down, turn around, pick a bale of cotton, yell that, hassled, harassed.

475
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,440
My family's been fighting the flu. I'm sure many people listening have been fighting the

476
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,440
flu. So here is Alex fighting the flu, going through the TSA, they're hassling him. He's

477
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:17,000
sick. Boy, flying is awful. Travel is awful when you're sick. Here is Piers Morgan, insignificant,

478
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,160
really insignificant and a complete failure for CNN. The ratings are a disaster. As awful

479
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,200
as the troll Larry King was, and I worked for Larry King, I like Larry, but come on,

480
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,640
way past his prime 20 years ago. As awful as Larry King was, Piers Morgan, if it's possible,

481
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,040
is doing even worse. So he's insignificant. Now, Alex, am I going on too long?

482
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,680
No, go, I'm listening. This is great. Mentally challenged people. I mean, people out of the

483
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:49,400
asylum that fall in love with me or Alex or, you know, a TV star or whatever. People that

484
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,160
have mental problems or don't think they're sufficient enough mentally will remember some

485
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,720
obscure fact to prove that they're smart, kind of like Rain Man. I'm not insulting people

486
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,640
with a mental illness. But what Piers Morgan did is he remembered how many people were

487
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,360
killed in England. How many people were killed in England? How many people were killed in

488
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:13,640
England? So he didn't hear anything Alex said. He was getting his ass handed to him. How

489
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,840
many people were killed in England? And Alex rolled over like a steamroller. He's a much

490
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:23,840
more powerful presence. I've been around Piers Morgan. I've been around Alex. Alex dominates.

491
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,560
Piers is not an alpha male. Alex is an alpha male. He's a man. I know we've forgotten what

492
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
that is. I know African Americans are encouraged to be tough. Watch the rap videos and white

493
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,680
guys are supposed to be little mealy-mouthed men without opinion. Turn on the TV. It's

494
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,800
just the way our culture is right now and I don't like it anyway. So, you know, how

495
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,040
many people were killed in Britain? Oh, you don't know? You've seen folks? I'm smarter

496
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,200
than him. And look, I rope a dope too. I do interviews every day. Alex does interviews.

497
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:56,920
Alex knows what the setup is. You come up with some obscure fact. They don't know it.

498
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,880
So you're smarter as the host and you go to commercial. Alex knew as soon as he couldn't

499
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,000
answer it because who gives a hairy rat's ass how many people were killed in England?

500
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,320
We're talking about America. They're trying to take our guns in America. So rather than

501
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:17,240
be run roughshod and cut to commercial and Alex looks stupid, he didn't answer it. He

502
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,240
didn't jump in the snare to get trapped. He didn't walk over the leafy path to fall under

503
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:27,320
the bungee stakes. And I think what you did, Alex, was absolutely brilliant. Who cares?

504
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:30,200
The only reason anybody's talking about the show is because you were on there. I don't

505
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,600
watch beers, Morgan. I watch because my buddy was on there. By the way, did you know their

506
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,680
ratings just came out? Anybody can look up TV ratings, just type it in. It's all there.

507
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,120
The ratings went from about 500,000 a night to 870 something thousand a night I was on

508
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,520
and then over a million the next night. Now they're already going back down. That ought

509
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,840
to tell those idiots something. No one wants to watch them. It's only when we go on those

510
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
shows.

511
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,440
You know, why not? Look, these people are propagandists. They're prostitutes. They are

512
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:07,160
the mouthpiece of government. CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC. So why play their games? And I think

513
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,920
Alex just had a ball. I mean, that really was my take watching it. My wife said, did

514
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,640
you think he went too far? For what? For nobody watching? Nobody cares.

515
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,440
The only reason they watch is because I

516
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,920
He got hassled by the TSA. It was all over Drudge. It was the most downloaded story on

517
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,640
Drudge. You went through hell to get there. They're hassling you. The cops are coming

518
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:35,440
out of the woodwork in New York. And you know, enough is enough. You're an idiot. You're

519
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,500
not an American. You want to take my guns, go to hell. And I thought part of it was done

520
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,480
tongue in cheek. And I had a ball with it. So I really, I thought, and you know what?

521
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,520
It was great TV. How about that? No matter what you think, no matter what your opinion

522
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,600
is, it was entertaining as hell. Isn't that supposed to be a rule on these shows? At least

523
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:59,120
be entertaining. The show's so damn boring. Well, let me raise this point. They're always

524
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:05,160
telling us to be calm, be calm, be calm, because they know that it's when you get active, that

525
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,160
you're able to take action.

526
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,520
I've been watching, and I'm putting a piece together on this, a bunch of different Democratic

527
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,440
political rallies with Feinstein, Cuomo, and all of them. And I'm going to play a clip

528
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,800
of Cuomo here in a moment, the governor of New York. They are really yelling and screaming,

529
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,440
but oh, that's normal when they do that. Or when Piers Morgan has guessed on getting all

530
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,920
hyped up, shaking their fists, saying, let's shoot Alex Jones.

531
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,280
Oh, that's cute and funny. But it's radical when I say, hey, you want my guns? And they

532
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,760
try this lie. One reason I blew up was this thing of, I don't want your guns. I mean,

533
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,960
the guy's on record saying we shouldn't own any guns. And their bills will take almost

534
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:45,960
all the guns.

535
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,560
So I'm tired of them lying to their audience. But I'm gonna play this Cuomo clip, but first,

536
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,960
what is your take on this attempt to tell us we shouldn't get upset? I've actually found-

537
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,960
Alex, can I say something about that?

538
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Yes.

539
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,280
Folks, look, first of all, we should be upset. But I don't think you're, Alex, you're not,

540
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:09,680
I've been out with you. It's not anger. I mean, look, you get angry, you get happy,

541
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,480
I understand that. But what happened with passion? Why can't we care? Why can't we care

542
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,960
that our country is being destroyed? Alex, can I say one more thing totally off the subject?

543
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
Sure.

544
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,960
I know when people do this, I know you will too. Can I say something?

545
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Whatever you want, man. Go ahead and ask it.

546
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,400
Everybody, every successful person I know, everybody that works for a living, okay? Half

547
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,520
the country isn't paying in. So, you know, those of you that are getting a free ride,

548
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,600
you won't understand what I'm talking about. But anybody that's listening, that has people

549
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,560
that, anyone that works is gonna know what I'm saying. I found it so interesting all

550
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:46,720
over Chicago, everybody is walking around going, I got less money. And they were going

551
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,960
to, they're going to their bosses saying, hey, you goofed up. There's less money in

552
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:56,560
my paycheck. Are you going to compensate me? No. Did you vote for Obama? There you go.

553
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,040
You get to buy cell phones for everybody in the ghetto. You get to pay to arm Libya. You

554
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,920
get to buy 200 tanks for Morsi in the Muslim Brotherhood. They always like to bring up

555
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,160
teachers. You know, whenever they talk about gun control, it's muskets. Well, they were

556
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,440
talking about muskets. And whenever they talk about how they want to steal more money from

557
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:15,680
us in taxes, they always bring up teachers. And I like to bring up, well, how about the

558
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,080
fact that we're arming the Muslim Brotherhood, and some of the other nonsense that we're

559
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:23,760
paying for. So I just love all these brain-dead morons that weren't paying attention. And

560
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,440
you and I told them, canary's in the coal mine. We told them, and everybody's walking

561
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,440
around going, where'd all my money go? No, no, no, I'm hearing the same thing. I mean,

562
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,440
I'm- You're going to leave anything for your kids

563
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,160
because they're going to take it all now. I mean, it's just, people get what they deserve

564
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,760
with this guy. I mean, you know, why isn't everybody angry?

565
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,640
Well, that's what I was mentioning at the doctor's office yesterday. Literally-

566
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,760
And I wanted to tie into it. It was stuck in my craw and I wanted to get this out.

567
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,760
Well, listen, they're not even going to know. And by the way, this is only the beginning.

568
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,760
It's 3% for everybody because of social security they're taking more. By the way, guys like

569
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,760
us, we're not going to see any of that money anyway, Alex. You and I are too young. We'll

570
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,760
never see social security. And it's for the Obama voters. They got their phone, their

571
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:07,760
new shoes. We know that welfare is being spent in strip clubs and liquor stores. That's where

572
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:14,760
it goes. And you and I will just keep working harder. Our kids have to do without so that

573
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:18,760
half the people can sit around on their fat asses. And by the way, when they're sick and

574
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:24,760
the Vatican need a foot lopped off, I guess I'll pay for that too. It's just repulsive.

575
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,760
I saw an article in the Chicago Tribune that had a straight face and it was an illegal

576
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,760
alien who was given by the government a free kidney. And he said, this isn't enough. I

577
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,760
deserve more. And I want you to give free health care to all the other immigrants who

578
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,760
already get it. And the article was like, you're right. We need to do more for you.

579
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,760
And we're not supposed to get upset. Oh, no, don't be extreme. It's not extreme to give

580
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:52,760
an illegal alien a free kidney when citizens go without. But and that's what's amazing

581
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,760
is I literally watch, no exaggeration, 15 people at least. And I almost started videotaping

582
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,760
it, but I don't want to be rude. At the doctor's office going, well, why is it more money?

583
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,760
Why is my insurance more? Why is the deductible more? Why does everything cost more? And I

584
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,760
started telling him, though, I said, hey, lady, it's Obamacare. And the woman started

585
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,760
arguing with me, one lady that said, no, it's true, but it's a fact.

586
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:25,760
And it's the same thing. The average paycheck in America gets $200 taken out of it every

587
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,760
month just for the 3.8%. And now they've got all these other taxes in there. And these

588
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,760
people are so dumb as they lose their jobs because some of the oldest companies in America

589
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,760
leave are shut down. They're gonna go get on food stamps and be even bigger supporters.

590
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,760
I mean, how do you stop something that stupid?

591
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Alex, brother, we are going to be nickel and dime to death where it was a quarter in the

592
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,760
parking meter. Listen to this where I do my radio.

593
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,760
Six dollars now.

594
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,760
It was a quarter an hour five years ago. Twenty five cents. It's 650 now. Welcome to liberalism.

595
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,760
And oh, by the way, if you want to come to my city of Chicago, where you can't you cannot

596
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:11,760
have a gun. Five hundred and thirty two people murdered last year. Five hundred and thirty

597
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,760
two. Less than half will be solved. If you're a new business, you don't have to pay any

598
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
taxes. I mean, so they do tax breaks to get new companies in. Everybody's trying to get

599
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,760
the hell out of Dodge. Everybody wants to get out of here. This is what liberalism does.

600
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,760
You understand? They jack up the taxes. All the businesses leave, like, you know, Gerard

601
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,760
de Pardue going to Russia. Everybody wants to get out of America. Anybody that has any

602
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,760
money, any company wants to get out of here. So then, you know, they offer and they're

603
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,760
telling us we're going to break. We're going to program because the jobs have left. Look

604
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,760
at Detroit. You know, Alex, I know you thought I'm sure you talked about this. They're bulldozing

605
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,760
Detroit. There's nothing left but rats. And do you know that the liberals are happy because

606
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,760
those are green areas? No, no, no. That's the USA today. Yeah, we got to go to factories.

607
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,760
There's nothing left but rats and trash. And the liberals are happy about it because it's

608
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:04,760
a green area. This is. Hello, I'm Alex Jones. Myself, my family, the info wars dot com team

609
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:10,760
want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the

610
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:16,760
globalist on every front info wars dot com is leading the fight against the technocrats.

611
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,760
But we can't do that without your help. By getting the films, bumper stickers and t shirts

612

614
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,760
wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

615
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:47,760
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

616
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:56,760
and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war. The spirit of 1776 versus

617
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:03,760
the mindset of 1984 weekend by GMOs stressed out about money and blasted by the electric

618
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,760
environment. Hi, I'm Pastor Jenny. And that was the state I was in back in 2010. Then

619
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,760
I learned about RNA drops. I learned that 97% of my DNA that scientists have called

620
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:19,760
junk is actually packed with millions of gene switches that play a critical role in controlling

621
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,760
how my cells, organs and other tissues behave. I learned I don't have to put up with disease

622
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,760
decay or decline like I've been conditioned to believe. I began taking RNA drops a 100%

623
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,760
natural formula designed to turn on those switches and provide me with amazing health

624

639
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,760
We're going to have a totally jam packed next hour with your phone calls and a bunch of

640
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:25,760
new clips today and some other clips I haven't gotten to yet, but Man Cow agrees with me

641
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,760
that we need to get out of our trance. We certainly know laying down and being passive

642
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:39,760
has gotten us to the point we're to here today and it makes me angry that these poor, sad,

643
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:47,760
most of them working class people, as I went to a clinic near my office and it's a working

644
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,760
class area, good people, not an elitist and it's a good clinic as well. I've been going

645
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:56,760
there when I have to for about 15 years with my dad's friends with the owner, so I know

646
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,760
him and I went and it's a big clinic and they were really, they were hurting. I mean there

647
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,760
were people in there trying to argue about how much they had to pay, just a couple hundred

648
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,760
bucks and it was very reasonably priced compared to most healthcare. I know the numbers, my

649
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:16,760
dad's in healthcare management and they were sad and some people came in and talked about

650
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,760
prices and said, listen, I can't pay that.

651
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,760
Doctor such and such said, no matter what, he'll treat me and the nurses would be like,

652
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,760
okay, we'll get him in. So I was seeing some free healthcare going on too and I was seeing

653
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,760
doctors and physicians assistants giving people free samples and I heard one going, I'm real

654
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,760
sorry, we've run out of samples. I can't give you a prescription, that's illegal. They can

655
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
only give you a sample.

656
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,760
America's running on empty folks and that's what makes me so mad at Obama and so mad at

657
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:51,760
the globalist and because their plan is to shut America down and Romney was their placeholder,

658
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:57,760
the fix was in, not that he was good either. It's that we're in trouble and I know that

659
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,760
healthcare bill is meant to hurt you. I know they want our guns and they said they want

660
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,760
them and you bet I get mad.

661
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:07,760
And yeah, some of it was tongue in cheek just because I like to joke around some, but a

662
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,760
few times I really was disgusted by Piers Morgan because in person he came off as cold

663
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:17,760
and evil and crusty looking. He looked like a reanimated corpse. And I was talking to

664
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,760
Man Cal yesterday, Eric Muller is with us. He agreed that he's been around a lot of TV

665
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,760
people, been on Fox for over, I don't know, 15 years, all over everything else.

666
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,760
Got a TV show right now, they're piloting nationwide and he's been around these people

667
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,760
and selling out to evil. I don't know what they get because Piers Morgan is a nobody.

668
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,760
The system tries to prop him up as a somebody, but he's got every TV show in the country

669
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,760
promoting him. And I was watching a movie and they had clips of him in it and CNN.

670
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,760
Now what's the movie? What's it called, Flight? Denzel Washington, the new one?

671
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Pretty good movie. I'm ranting, Man Cal, we got about three minutes till the hour ends.

672
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,760
Other points you want to make on where this country's going, how painful it is to see

673
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:03,760
them destroying us on purpose, shutting down our cities, people fleeing California, fleeing

674
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,760
Chicago. But when the Democrats and liberals get to Austin, they just do the same thing

675
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,760
they always do. I mean, why are they fleeing from themselves, but then doing the same thing

676
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:14,760
once they get here?

677
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:20,260
You know something, Alex, it's all very predictable. It's Mao's playbook, it's Hitler, it's

678
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:33,760
Pol Pot, it's all these guys, it's Castro. They got to take the guns, this is the final straw.

679
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,760
I've got little kids, you've got adorable little kids. The fact that they are using

680
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:46,760
these children, exploiting these children to destroy us, it really is an insidious evil, isn't it?

681
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Yeah, that's why I blew up at him. I genuinely, when I said, hey, let's have a boxing match,

682
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,760
I'll be honest, I was having an instinct to really want to physically deal with him.

683
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,760
But you notice the next night, they said they wanted to shoot me. It's that I knew that

684
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,760
they want to hurt me, they want my guns because they want to dominate me. And they said that

685
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,760
the next night, did you see that?

686
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:17,760
Alex, can you imagine going on the radio, just think about this, can you imagine going on the radio and saying,

687
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,760
I want to shoot Piers Morgan? Can you imagine? I would never even think of it to say something like that.

688
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
I wouldn't think of it and I would be arrested if I did.

689
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:33,760
Okay, if Rush or anyone else said that, but I mean, my God, if Al Franken said it, it's the funniest thing ever.

690
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:42,760
Back in 60 seconds, do five more minutes with us. We'll be right back with ManCal, mancal.com.

Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy

693
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,760
and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy?

696
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:16,760
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores are closed,

697
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:21,760
but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

698
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,760

Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.

703
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:12,760
Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.

704
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:21,760
He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

705
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:33,760
But what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for? The only reason I think you need it is Pierce,

706
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,760
challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop him.

707
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,760
I'd love to see that. In uniform.

708
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,760
And he says, yeah, he'll wear his brother's uniform. So Pierce Morgan agreeing, dress up in a uniform and kill me.

709
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:54,760
And that's a weird sycophantic thing psychologically that, oh, as long as he wears a uniform, see, they're the state.

710
01:00:54,760 --> 01:01:00,760
It's okay for the state to kill you. This is a cult of miscreants. And a few newspapers picked it up, drugs picked it up.

711
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:05,760
It became somewhat of a story. But it's like, oh, it's just a joke. We're going to shoot you.

712
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,760
But, oh, I was scary because I yelled at him a little bit and said, you will not get our guns.

713
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,760
I know it's about disarming us. They hate it when we won't play games with them. Eric, where do you see all this going?

714
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:23,760
You know, Alex, listen, you and I have a problem. We go out, it's over. That's what it used to be.

715
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,760
All right. This guy's going to put on a uniform, his brother's uniform and huge you with it.

716
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:35,760
I mean, it's just, they're so creepy. You're right. I mean, it really is a group of creeps.

717
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:43,760
And here's Morgan, I love the fact that you have this petition. And of course, everybody in England is saying, oh, please, we don't want him back.

718
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:50,760
That is America now, right? We're the dumping ground of all the losers. We get all the losers in America.

719
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,760
God, if you're a scientist from another country, we don't want you. But are you sick and you can barely get here? We'll take you.

720
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,760
God, where are we headed? We're headed to, you know, you know what's going on in Texas with the microchipping.

721
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:09,760
Microchipped, disarmed. You know, I was hoping for a Star Trek future. I think we're going to have a Mad Max future.

722
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,760
That really is what's going to happen.

723
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,760
By the way, I went and saw your friend last night, William Shatner, Shatner's World. I've never seen him in person.

724
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,760
I know you're friends with him. Very impressive.

725
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,760
You know that he was in my wedding and he flew in to be part of, to help me when my daughters were born. He's a very dear friend.

726
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:33,760
He's a, you know, he's a great man. He's a great man of honor. We don't, we don't agree politically, but the Shat abides.

727
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,760
Well, I mean, I like him even more here because he went for over two hours, you know, things only supposed to be an hour and a half.

728
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,760
And it was it was just a real guy. And you realize how much stuff he's done.

729
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,760
All these books, all these records, all these TV shows, all these movies.

730
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:53,760
Alex, can I tell you a great story? Sure. I'm with him. And I said, look, all of these actors, you've been around since the 60s.

731
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,760
All of these actors, I don't know their names. I know your name. And he held his hand out the window.

732
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:03,760
You know that when you're a kid, you put your head out the window to feel that he kind of does a wave.

733
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,760
And I said, oh, that means I said, why do I know your name? But everybody else is mostly has been forgotten of your era.

734
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,760
And he just puts his hand. He goes, he goes, man, peaks and valleys. I said, what does that mean?

735
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:17,760
He goes, you keep walking. When you have a table set with your enemies, you get up and you keep walking.

736
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,760
The Bible says to walk through the valley. And that's you, Alex. You know, it meant me.

737
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:28,760
We keep walking. We keep fighting. And that's why we're around and he's around and guys like that.

738
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:33,760
He really is. You know, he's in his 80s now. And he's just you know, he's a man's man.

739
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:38,760
And he doesn't believe in laying down. Can I tell another quick story?

740
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,760
I bet. OK. He goes through a divorce. He's completely broke.

741
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,760
He's doing dinner theater in Kansas City. He is living in the he can't afford hotel room.

742
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,760
He's doing Tiffany's at a dinner theater. He's sleeping in the back of his pickup truck.

743
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,760
Now, think about this. William Shatner, Captain Kirk. This is after Star Trek got canceled.

744
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,760
A kid comes up and says, hey, mister, is that three dimensional inside? Is that is that a spaceship?

745
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:13,760
He goes, yeah, kid. He's cooking in a Weber grill in a parking lot in Kansas City at a broken down dinner theater.

746
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,760
All right. This kid comes over and says, is that your spaceship? He goes, yeah, whatever, kid. The kid's on a Schwinn bicycle.

747
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:28,760
He goes, well, my dad has reached a magazine called Variety and they said they're looking for you and Star Trek's coming back in movies.

748
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:34,760
He couldn't afford a hotel room. He couldn't afford a meal. He kept going.

749
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:40,760
And I'm telling you, America's down right now. People may feel down. All it takes is one car, one break.

750
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,760
America needs that call. America needs a break. I need a break. We all need a break right now.

751
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:50,760
Hold on. Hold on. You've got to do five more minutes with us. I want to get your take after the break on how do we get that break?

752
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:56,760
How do we turn the tide? The globalists are scared of that. They're trying to suppress us. How do you see America coming back?

753
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:08,760
We'll be right back.

754
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,760

774
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:33,760
They're openly talking about executive orders to restrict the second amendment. All the globalist state run media, CNN, MSNBC and others are talking about, NPR.

775
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:41,760
Is be reasonable. Let us register and confiscate your semi-autos. But we don't want your guns. The LA Times, New York Times, you name it.

776
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,760
I'm crazy. Alex Jones is crazy. Because I say they want to confiscate our guns.

777
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:55,760
We're going to play the Daily Show saying I'm insane. Nobody wants my guns. Multiple other shows. Conan O'Brien. Nobody wants my guns.

778
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:02,760
I'm crazy. I've just got all the people that are in office saying they want a total gun ban and can play clips of them and have.

779
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:09,760
And have the UN treaty that says they can confiscate all the guns. And even Forbes is an analyst of it. An analysis that says the same thing.

780
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,760
But I'm still crazy. They play this game with us. There's no death panels in the healthcare bill. You're crazy.

781
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:27,760
Now they're like, yeah, we're going to restrict your care. Oh, the insurance companies didn't write the healthcare bill to rip you off and double your premiums and double the overall cost.

782
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:33,760
Oh, now it's in effect. Oh, it does double everything. AP, Reuters, USA Today.

783
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:41,760
And it was painful. I take it personally when con artists do things to me and others. And I sat there yesterday.

784
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:47,760
Happen to go to the doctor over a bad chest cold. Hadn't been to the doctor in three years or so.

785
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:53,760
And I watch people go, why is everything going up so much? Why is my premium double? Why is the deductible more?

786
01:09:53,760 --> 01:10:00,760
Why is the and they said it's the new health care law, ma'am. And then for some reason, it was almost all women.

787
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:05,760
And then there was a man saying, look, I can't afford this. I don't have as much money in the bank. Let me talk to the doctor.

788
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:14,760
And they were there begging and the doctors are like, all right, I'll do it for free. Like they're supposed to with a certain percentage, but people with insurance couldn't afford it now.

789
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:21,760
And of course, the insurance companies wrote it. And I know already talked about that last hour. It's just seeing this.

790
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:28,760
I got angry again. It's like the Dave Mustangs song. Angry again, angry again. That's normal.

791
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:36,760
It's meant to get me moving to do something. And they want to physically confiscate most our guns. The bills are introduced.

792
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:44,760
Massive ammo taxes, registration to buy ammo. And then I'm there and Piers Morgan's like, well, nobody wants to take your guns.

793
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,760
And I'm like, you're advocating. You've advocated in the past the abolition of citizen ownership.

794
01:10:49,760 --> 01:11:00,760
But I just want the British style where if you pay huge taxes and register, you can have a gun in a locker at a facility where you can go shoot at targets and hunting's been outlawed.

795
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,760
And it's one of course, that's exactly what I want. I was talking to him before the show. I'm like, oh, so that's a Second Amendment.

796
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:16,760
If I jump through eighty seven thousand flaming hoops on a blue moon, when the planets align, if I cross my fingers and stand on one leg, then I can go to a shooting range to shoot guns.

797
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:22,760
And that's what they're proposing in Connecticut now. And they're like, settle down, settle down. You're kooky when you get angry.

798
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:26,760
No, that's because anger is what will move America to wake us up out of the trance.

799
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:32,760
Now, I'm going to shut up. It's going to be a jam packed hour. I got like ten clips I haven't aired of powerful stuff.

800
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:36,760
I want to break down the latest legislation, world news, economic news. We're gonna get to it all.

801
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:42,760
But Eric Mueller, known as man gal, the syndicated radio host, get to be a good friend of mine.

802
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:46,760
I don't know about 10 years doing interviews. We've hung out a few times now and met him in Chicago.

803
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:53,760
He's come down to Austin and I enjoy doing this show once a week on Wednesdays and Thursdays sometimes.

804
01:11:53,760 --> 01:12:02,760
But he joins us. He's done a lot of national TV shows. His TV show now has exploded in Chicago on broadcast TV, about to get picked up nationally.

805
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:08,760
Don't want to have to knock on wood, but very exciting. The success he's having. And I went last night.

806
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:17,760
I've always liked William Shatner. Who doesn't? And so I took my wife to see William Shatner here in Austin at a packed Paramount Theater, great old theater.

807
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:23,760
And I like him even more. I mean, it was it was like, wow, my wife's like, he says so much of what you say.

808
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:31,760
Well, it's not because we're reading each other's notes. It's common sense life lessons. And Eric was telling stories because they're real good.

809
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,760
But retell the one because some stations don't carry that segment again. He came to your wedding, you know, your good friends. Alex, go ahead.

810
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,760
Alex, where do you want me to begin? Well, just finish. Tell us about William Shatner and then.

811
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:50,760
Let me tell you this. I went to visit him on the set of Boston Legal and have your guys look up right now.

812
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:56,760
The name behind Boston Legal. I can't think of the guy's name. He's a commie lib TV guy.

813
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:02,760
And the guy said, that's Mancal. He's not allowed on the set. And Shatner said, Mancal is my friend.

814
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:09,760
How dare you disrespect a friend like that? And Shatner walked off and security came to get me.

815
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:16,760
And Shatner said, are you serious? And we went as far as we could go legally at the set there.

816
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:22,760
And we stood on the line and we stood and talked for a couple hours while everybody waited.

817
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:29,760
David E. Kelly. It's a David E. Kelly show. And so Shatner.

818
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,760
I mean, he was screaming. This is my friend. You don't talk to my friend like this.

819
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,760
David E. Kelly, because I was on the Fox News channel every day for seven years.

820
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:41,760
I mean, this is the kind of guy Shatner is. Look, Shatner and I, we don't agree on a lot of stuff politically, but I love the guy.

821
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:50,760
OK. The other one was he was living in the back of his pickup truck, a little trailer, a shell and a sleeping bag and a Weber grill.

822
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,760
This is after his divorce in the 70s. Star Trek is canceled.

823
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:01,760
The wife waited till Star Trek got canceled. She filed for divorce, got all of that money.

824
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,760
He's now going where in that day where, you know, actors go to die.

825
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:13,760
He was doing dinner theater around America. He's doing dinner theater at Tiffany's Attic in Kansas City, Missouri.

826
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:20,760
He's cooking on a burnt out Weber grill, sleeping in a sleeping bag. A kid comes over on a Schwinn bike and says, Hey, mister, is that your spaceship?

827
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:25,760
Is it like bigger inside? Is it three dimensional? Is it an optical illusion? Captain Kirk?

828
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,760
And he goes, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the kid goes, hey, I hear you're you're you know,

829
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,760
they're going to be doing movies because of Star Wars. They're going to be in a Star Trek movie.

830
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:41,760
I don't think about it. And the kid goes, well, my father reads a magazine called Variety

831
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:46,760
and they say they're making a Star Trek movie and they're looking for you.

832
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:50,760
And in that moment, his life changed. Of course, those Star Trek movies were huge.

833
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:55,760
I think Shatner is bigger than the Star Trek brand. The guys are amazing.

834
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:01,760
And you know, look, the point is America's down. It takes one phone call. It takes one election.

835
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,760
You know, look, this guy's going to be a lame duck. We got another, you know, however many days, not many days.

836
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,760
This guy's not going to have much power. I wish that the Tea Party people and some of the others,

837
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,760
your friend and mine, Rand and others would would stir these guys up.

838
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,760
You know, you talk about getting angry, Alex. Do you want me to stop talking?

839
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:24,760
No, that's why I'm not interrupting. You talk about you talk about getting angry.

840
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:31,760
You know, I had a politician in yesterday, Bob Fioretti. He's like, you know, the second was about muskets.

841
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:36,760
And I just got a text. I believe it's from another radio host named Michael Savage who's listening to us right now.

842
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:43,760
You know, one of my buddies in radio. Anyway, he sent me this and he wants me to read this.

843
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:49,760
And it's from George Washington. And it's a free people ought not to be armed and disciplined,

844
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:57,760
but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain the status of independence from any who would attempt to abuse them,

845
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,760
including their government. I mean, this is George Washington. See, this is the thing. They love to twist it.

846
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:10,760
You know, it's not freedom. I don't want to see the Ten Commandments. It's not freedom from religion.

847
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:17,760
It's freedom of religion. These people take this and they mutate it and they twist it and they make it something it isn't.

848
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:21,760
This isn't about muskets and hunting. This is about having equal firepower to them.

849
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:28,760
OK. And in my city where 532 have been killed in the city of Chicago, folks, 532 murders.

850
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:35,760
When the gang bangers come, they don't come one at a time. They come and you need a machine gun to fight back these gangs.

851
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:41,760
OK, I know because I've seen it. By the way, it's not freedom from the press.

852
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:46,760
Well, there was no radio or TV back when they wrote this, so let's get rid of that. There was no Internet.

853
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:55,760
I mean, what is this nonsense? And this is what these politicians say. The Second Amendment was not about muskets and it's not about hunting.

854
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,760
So don't let them suck you into that stupid argument, folks.

855
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,760
I agree with you. I want to say hi to Michael Savage. Glad he's getting back on radio.

856
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:07,760
And if he ever wants to come on here, talk about his books or whatever, I know he goes on your show and you guys are friends.

857
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:12,760
He's absolutely welcome. Any time to come on the broadcast would love to have him on.

858
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,760
But I tell you, we're here at this crossroads now.

859
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:26,760
And I agree with you talking about the William Shatner analogy or allegory, because he actually talked about some of that story yesterday in his two hour talk.

860
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:31,760
But he didn't tell the part about how he said he was down and out after the divorce.

861
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:36,760
And the kid came over and he said, is that really a spaceship? And he let him go.

862
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:45,760
And he said the kid came in the camper and then he said, yeah, here's the controls of the spaceship with the knobs.

863
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,760
But he didn't tell the story of how his life turned around there.

864
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:57,760
But your point about America, the globalists, the New World Order, they know that they've gotten away with so much and that people are waking up to them.

865
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:02,760
They are desperate. And we just need to believe we can win and get angry.

866
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:09,760
Alex, tell you something that we don't need to quote George Washington or William Shatner.

867
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,760
How about we quote Alex Jones? And I really do think this could quote you.

868
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,760
I think this could be this could be the moment. This is our moment.

869
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:25,760
And I think when they go door to door and they're talking about Iowa going door to door and other places, I think this will be the moment.

870
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:31,760
And you said it will be 1776 over again.

871
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:39,760
I think enough is enough. You talk about at the clinic. Well, buddy, not everybody's sick, but every one of your listeners that has a job has looked at their paycheck now.

872
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:45,760
And this is only the beginning. I think the tide is turning.

873
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:53,760
And let's quote 2013 Alex Jones. It's going to be 1776 all over again.

874
01:18:53,760 --> 01:19:01,760
If they if they want to get rid of the checks and balances, if they want to get the judges, if they want to get the Congress and everything else,

875
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:08,760
if Obama wants to sign into executive order the destruction of the Second Amendment, it's an impeachable offense.

876
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:12,760
And I don't want anyone hurt. I really don't. I don't I don't want any of this.

877
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:18,760
I really don't. I just got it. I just want to raise my kids and and, you know, got guns and guts.

878
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:24,760
And these are real authoritarians. I mean, that's the thing. They're not going to stop. And they're waging war against us.

879
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,760
The power to tax is the power to destroy. And they're coming after us. And by the way, I'm seeing all these calls for gun confiscations.

880
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,760
I know you wouldn't just say that. I was talking about door to door now.

881
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:39,760
Yeah, I was one of the top politicians there. Hey, Alex, on the day of the Sandy Hook massacre.

882
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:48,760
OK, these little kids being killed on the day on the day on that day. Did you see the politicians on CNN saying that we did Obama?

883
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:54,760
And I quote Obama. And I'm sure you have the clip. But Obama should exploit this tragedy.

884
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,760
I saw them say all over. We need to use this. This is great. Rubbing their hands together, man.

885
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:06,760
Thank you. Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy

886
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:11,760
and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy?

887
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:15,760
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything at e-foods direct.

888
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:20,760
We hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.

889
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:26,760
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, Almost all the grocery stores are closed,

890
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:31,760
but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

891
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:37,760
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

892
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:47,760

895
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:08,760
Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?

896
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:15,760
This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known.

897
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:23,760
In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.

898
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:30,760
I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this. It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.

899
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:38,760
That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors off a conspiracy.

900
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:49,760
Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack.

901
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:58,760
I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com.

902
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:05,760
On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.

903
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:13,760
Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.

904
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:21,760
Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?

905
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:26,760
These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.

906
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:36,760
Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.

907
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:46,760

909
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:05,760
Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box. I want you to know some very important information.

910
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:14,760
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

911
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:20,760
Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

912
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:31,760
Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

913
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:39,760
If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

914
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:47,760
Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.

915
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:54,760
That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.

916
01:23:54,760 --> 01:24:16,760
Protect your immune system. It's the only one you've got.

917
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:23,760
You see, when you come up to a point when corrupt forces are engaged in a revolution against your free country, they're the revolutionaries.

918
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,760
They call us counter-revolutionaries, the globalists do.

919
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:34,760
In official publications, I mean, we've read the quotes, they're the ones bringing the change in. It's bad change.

920
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:40,760
And they're a mafia using high-tech advertising technologies, brainwashing, to manipulate people.

921
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:47,760
And I'm just using good old-fashioned truth and anger and focus, and none of it is even coordinated.

922
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:55,760
I'm just doing the best I can to wake people up, not even to convince you. This stuff is right there historically.

923
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:03,760
And we've got all the proof. I mean, when they say, we don't want your guns in the L.A. Times, Alex Jones is crazy. There's an article out today.

924
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,760
Alex Jones is a gun nut. He thinks we want their guns. Well, it's not my opinion.

925
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:14,760
And they think you're stupid on The Daily Show when he gets up there and goes, it's not like Hitler's invading.

926
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:24,760
Nobody wants your guns. This is a guy broadcasting, transmitting from a city where no one can own guns but government people.

927
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:28,760
This is a guy in a city where Bloomberg has said he wants to disarm the American people.

928
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:33,760
This is a guy that says hospitals can't give out painkillers.

929
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,760
Let me tell you, I had pretty much a compound fracture one time, the bone almost sticking out of my leg.

930
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,760
And I was real glad when they jabbed me with that morphine.

931
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,760
And Bloomberg said, I'm just going to tell the hospitals and doctors what they can do.

932
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:52,760
I'm going to tell you what you can serve, how much Coca-Cola you can buy. I'm going to tell you how big your apartment can be.

933
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:55,760
People like that's over the top. They're getting you used to it.

934
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,760
He's following a program. And then Cuomo says, we're going to sweep across the country.

935
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,760
We're going to ban the guns. You don't need those guns for hunting deer.

936
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:12,760
No, once you can ban those, you can ban them all. And they know that they follow the same pattern worldwide.

937
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:17,760
They're coming for the guns, ladies and gentlemen, and they're accelerating their program.

938
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:27,760
And we've got to get back in their face. Here's Governor Cuomo two days ago in a rally to come get our guns.

939
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,760
Now, now, why is he raising his voice? Why raising your voice is discrediting.

940
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:36,760
You're supposed to be calm. No, no, they always raise their voices when they're getting hyped up.

941
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,760
See, when they say kill Alex Jones, it's funny. If I said kill them, I'd be arrested.

942
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:46,760
See, because they define everything because they're the bosses. No, you're not.

943
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:54,760
You're a mirage. You're a facade. You're a paper tiger, a fraud, a projection.

944
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:02,760
A hologram. A lie. Smoking mirrors.

945
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:08,760
And I'm sick of it. Was it my opinion that the health care plan was going to rip everybody off and set up death panels?

946
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:14,760
The stinking thing said it. It's a copy of what they've done in other countries.

947
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:20,760
It's not like we're up here flying blind or something. We know where this thing leads.

948
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:27,760
Authoritarianism. I mean, I.

949
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:31,760
Let's go to the clip here. Here's Cuomo. Here it is. I know.

950
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:37,760
I know that the issue of gun control is hard. I know it's political.

951
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:43,760
Look at that monster. I know it's controversial. But we are proposing today common sense measures.

952
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,760
And I say to you, forget the extremists. I am Don Corleone.

953
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:56,760
No one hunts with an assault rifle. No one needs ten bullets to repair a deal.

954
01:27:56,760 --> 01:28:04,760
And too many innocent people have died already. And the madness now.

955
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:12,760
Pass safe, reasonable gun control in the state of New York. Make this safer.

956
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,760
Safer. Save lives. Like Chicago and New York.

957
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:23,760
An example for the rest of the nation. Let them look at New York and say, this is what you can do.

958
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:32,760
And this is what you should do. This is New York, the progressive capital. You show them how we lead.

959
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:38,760
Unbelievable. I mean, you've got.

960
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:44,760
These guys, Bloomberg, Cuomo, all of them.

961
01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:50,760
Nancy Pelosi, just all of them, Michael Moore.

962
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:54,760
Again, they talk to you like you're a five year old. Wayne LaPierre comes out and said what I've been saying.

963
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:59,760
Common sense. Hey, the Israelis arm all their people and school shootings stop.

964
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:05,760
And the Israeli foreign minister comes out and goes, well, technically we didn't arm people to stop school shootings.

965
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:11,760
We call it terrorism. And the media went, see, they told you. And they said, Wayne LaPierre lied.

966
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,760
I mean, that's the mind games, because they don't call it a mass shooting. They call it terrorism when somebody shoots people.

967
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:25,760
People are like, oh, well, I mean, they play these mind games with people and wake up out of your trance.

968
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:30,760
But I mean, why did he get so excited? His state of the union, his state of the state.

969
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:35,760
With all of his minions in the statehouse, a mafia.

970
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,760
I mean, New York legislature's famous group of crooks, just like Illinois.

971
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:46,760
And they're like, we're taking over America. We're going to take everybody's guns and then we're going to raise taxes up to 80 percent.

972

01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:35,760
What's happening is the gun culture and even the LA Times admits this is taking over and winning.

995
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:45,760
In polls, despite them trying to say gun owners are guilty for the dead 20 children, which is incredible exploitation, we're winning and a lot of leftists and women.

996
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:56,760
I even saw a CNN story yesterday when I was out. You guys type the other side of the gun culture, women, women, moms with guns, CNN. It was out yesterday.

997
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:04,760
I've already told you this for years. The women are getting into shooting groups. The liberals are shooting and going, wow, this is good to have a gun and feel secure.

998
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:17,760
I have an instant access pistol safe. My kids can't get to it. It's biometric or it's a hand code and they read locally about women shooting intruders or women who people try to rape out in the parking lot.

999
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:23,760
Women are getting empowered, which I wouldn't call feminism. I would just call being human, defending yourself.

1000
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:37,760
The feminists don't want that. They want you dehumanized, defeminized, unmasculated, I guess if that's a word, demasculated, but it's not a masculine trait, defeminized.

1001
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:43,760
And then the state is your husband. See, the man gets out of the way and the state is the husband. That's basically what this is.

1002
01:34:43,760 --> 01:35:02,760
But look at this LA Times article if you're watching on prisonplanet.tv. Alex Jones and other pro-gun paranoid put the nuts in gun nuts.

1003
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:19,760
And this article goes on to say that I'm making it up. No one wants to confiscate my guns. Now, I've got Dianne Feinstein. I've got Holder. I've got Obama. I've got Sarah Brady.

1004
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:30,760
I've got the quotes and video of all of them saying we want to take guns. There should not be a right to own guns. There is no Second Amendment. Remember, they used to argue that.

1005
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:37,760
There's a bunch of articles out saying I'm a nut because I said I know you want our guns, Piers Morgan. Let's just get the debate out in the open.

1006
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:50,760
Here's the Daily Caller, but it links through to the local newspapers where he makes the quote, Iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, confiscation of semiautomatic weapons.

1007
01:35:50,760 --> 01:36:02,760
Well, Cuomo called for that in the New York Times three weeks ago. Feinstein called for it. Iowa lawmaker calls for retroactive gun ban, confiscation of semiautomatic weapons.

1008
01:36:02,760 --> 01:36:20,760
An interview with the Daily Times Herald in Carroll, Iowa, state rep Dan Mulbar, I think that's how you pronounce it, said governments should start confiscating semiautomatic rifles and other firearms and other firearms down to.22 rifle.

1009
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:37,760
We've got big guns out there, out here as far as big guns that are out there. The semiautomatics and all of them, that's all of them. Mulbar, am I pronouncing that right, told the newspaper during a December 19th audiotape interview, we can't have those running around out there.

1010
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:44,760
Those are not hunting weapons. See, they say it's always about hunting. That's their fake argument. No, it's about defending against tyranny. We should ban those in Iowa.

1011
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:55,760
He then went on to say, we'll go door to door, street by street and get them. We need to get them off the streets illegally. And even if you have them, I think we need to start taking them.

1012
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:02,760
We can't have those out there. And he goes on to describe how to take them door to door.

1013
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:18,760
Ladies and gentlemen, now remember, I just showed you the LA Times, you're a radio listener, the headline is Alex Jones and other pro-gun paranoids put the nut in guns. And you read the article, they say not once but twice, we are imagining they want to take our guns.

1014
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:30,760
All they want is crazy people not to have them. And I was on Piers Morgan and tried to get to this point but could never get to it because I was gonna debate Alan Dershowitz about it, but they panicked and kicked me off.

1015
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:39,760
They keep saying, well, shouldn't we be able to stop mentally ill people, folks? Five times in the month before he tried to go in gun shops and buy guns, he went to a gun show too.

1016
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:50,760
And they wouldn't sell him a gun because in the next system, he looked crazy at the gun show. So they're not selling my gun to you, okay? Because that's a private sale.

1017
01:37:50,760 --> 01:38:00,760
But at the places with the background check, he'd been flagged, he was in psychiatric care. You go in and they flag you as dangerous, whether it's right or wrong, because they do it for a lot of veterans, I think it's wrong.

1018
01:38:00,760 --> 01:38:06,760
That's it, you can't buy a gun. He was refused through the next system.

1019
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:16,760
And what we've got clips of is Biden, the vice president, saying, we don't need to just ban gun shows and private sales, private transfers, period. Well, that's what their bills do.

1020
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:22,760
You can never transfer guns, not when you die, anything, kind of like the death taxes, can't transfer your money when you die.

1021
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:28,760
They're saying, can't transfer any guns, period, when you die, you go turn them in.

1022
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:37,760
And don't say they won't ban guns even though they can't enforce it like the drug war. That's the whole plan, is now to pack the prisons with gun owners and have the purges of us.

1023
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:48,760
Just like the attorney general has said, we need to make it like cigarette smoking, a dirty thing. Others have said, make it like us being a sex offender.

1024
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:54,760
That's why they put your name out in the news when you're a gun owner, when they have you registered. They want to shame you. That's a quote.

1025
01:38:54,760 --> 01:39:01,760
He says, we want to shame people into not owning guns. I mean, aren't you ashamed of having all the bodyguards and carrying a gun?

1026
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:09,760
You punk, you gangster, you thug who shipped 20,000 guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment?

1027
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:17,760
That came out in the CBS News. They got the memos first. I didn't need CBS News to tell me that was done to blame the Second Amendment.

1028
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:24,760
I had a DEA source told me about it before it even broke, Celica Steele. On record, go watch the video.

1029
01:39:24,760 --> 01:39:34,760
He's been in studio years before Fast and Furious even broke, because I'm here in Texas.

1030
01:39:34,760 --> 01:39:40,760
And now it turns out the ATF was actually shipping in 18-wheelers guns themselves to them.

1031
01:39:40,760 --> 01:39:48,760
They just, when it started breaking, because they just wouldn't go along with it, they just reported on telling gun shops, go ahead and sell to the illegals, go ahead and sell to the coyotes.

1032
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:54,760
They work for us. Oh, we're going to track it. That was their cover. They were shipping 18-wheelers of hand grenades down there.

1033
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:00,760
And this all comes out here and there in the news. How are we being lectured by the Fast and Furious crew now?

1034
01:40:00,760 --> 01:40:09,760
And then they play this game of, oh, we don't want your guns. And then Obama signs the bill giving himself secret service and other presidents,

1035
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,760
armed secret service protection of upwards of $4 million a year per president for life.

1036
01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:20,760
Normally it was only 10 years after. Now it's for life. You say, well, that's reasonable.

1037
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:26,760
Hey, most of us can't afford. I'm going to tell you right now, I don't want to bodyguard people around me all day.

1038
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:33,760
Plus, somebody really wants to get you, they can probably get you. A lot of times it turns out to be the bodyguard who they actually approached, be the one that kills you.

1039
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:40,760
But I mean, I can't afford a really good bodyguard. I'd rather put that money into getting the news out.

1040
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:45,760
I mean, man, I'm not going to start living where I've got a bodyguard with me.

1041
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,760
I might need one just to watch my back now if I go to New York or something where they got goons trying to set us up,

1042
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:59,760
just witnesses, maybe like an entourage or something when I'm in public, just to document things.

1043
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:04,760
Because they can set you up when you're alone.

1044
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:12,760
But we are going to go ahead now.

1045
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:19,760
And we are going to play this clip. This is a.

1046
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:26,760
This is a clip that we're going to go to of Mr. Stewart.

1047
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:31,760
And of course, he's an establishment guy, Stewart's his fake name so that you don't know his brother runs the New York Stock Exchange.

1048
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:36,760
And this is a guy who's very funny, very witty. I like him at many levels, but he's a globalist and he's anti-gun.

1049
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:42,760
And he's up there broadcasting and transmitting from a city that says you can't own guns unless you're basically government mafia.

1050
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:48,760
And he's saying Alex is implying Hitler is going to invade America. No, he thinks his audience is dumb.

1051
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:55,760
I'm saying Hitler, Stalin, Mao and all these others took the guns. Let's go ahead and go to that clip now.

1052
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:01,760
So this isn't really about the Constitution or efficacy of regulation or intruder defense.

1053
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:06,760
It's about how perilously close some people in this country feel they're living to a tyrant's rule.

1054
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:12,760
It's something we've seen happen time and time again in history with Stalin happened in Cambodia.

1055
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,760
And then, of course, the Third Reich. No one saw that coming in until it was too late.

1056
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:22,760
Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mao took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns. Hugo Chavez took the guns.

1057
01:42:22,760 --> 01:42:28,760
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.

1058
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:44,760
Holy ****. No one's taking away all the guns. But now I get it. Now I see what's happening.

1059
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:57,760
So this is what it is. Their paranoid fear of a possible dystopic future prevents us from addressing our actual dystopic present.

1060
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,760
We can't even begin to address thirty thousand guns.

1061
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,760
And I guess we need the full clip, but it's not thirty thousand gun deaths.

1062
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:11,760
It's eleven thousand, most of them gang bangers or suicide. I've been breaking down the actual numbers.

1063
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:17,760
I was seeing over four thousand. It looks like it's more like three thousand are actually people doing the murders or killing people.

1064
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:22,760
I mean, that's nothing in three hundred and fifteen million people.

1065
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:27,760
So, again, back that up a little bit, because there were several Stewart clips. I don't know if that's the one I actually gave you.

1066
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:34,760
I give you guys so many clips. Play play the Stewart part again for people, because I want folks to hear that.

1067
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,760
Just whenever you're ready or just play the whole thing.

1068
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:42,760
So this isn't really about the Constitution or efficacy of regulation or intruder defense.

1069
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:47,760
It's about how perilously close some people in this country feel they're living to a tyrant's rule.

1070
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:53,760
It's something we've seen happen time and time again in history with Stalin happened in Cambodia.

1071
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,760
And then, of course, the Third Reich. No one saw that coming until it was too late.

1072
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:03,760
Hitler took the guns. Stalin took the guns. Mao took the guns. Fidel Castro took the guns. Hugo Chavez took the guns.

1073
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:14,760
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.

1074
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:22,760
Oh, no one's taking away all the guns.

1075
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:27,760
But now I get it. Now I see what's happening. So this is what it is.

1076
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:38,760
Their paranoid fear of a possible dystopic future prevents us from addressing our actual dystopic present.

1077
01:44:38,760 --> 01:44:41,760
We can't even begin to address that.

1078
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:45,760
Yeah, when I saw the full clip, he goes on to say they think Hitler is going to invade.

1079
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,760
Will somebody get me the full clip? Because I wanted to play it a couple of days ago and never got around to it.

1080
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:55,760
I want them. I want the full thing, because the clip I want is where he says they're afraid Hitler is going to invade.

1081
01:44:55,760 --> 01:45:02,760
No, we're not afraid. It's my fault. I've just got to review every clip we're going to play.

1082
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:05,760
Because we've got so many, they always get mixed up for whatever reason.

1083
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:11,760
He goes on to say in my whole point of playing the clip that we believe he's going to just play it off YouTube.

1084
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:16,760
But then I turn into a big rocket science deal. We can just find it, get to it and play the part.

1085
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:23,760
He says that we think Hitler is going to invade. No, no, no. We know the same megabanks that funded Hitler, Stalin and Mao did that.

1086
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:29,760
That's what we know. That's what we understand. That's what we're aware of. That's what's going on.

1087
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:33,760
And plus, he says, we don't want the guns. No one's going to take them.

1088
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,760
They're talking about confiscating them. The bills are introduced and he's still up there.

1089
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:43,760
And in another clip, he talks about, you know, Biden said nobody's going to take your gun and nobody is.

1090
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:48,760
You can have your Beretta pistol. That's a handgun, not a pistol. It just shows incredible ignorance.

1091
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,760
Now, again, we've already played this, but here's a short clip of Conan O'Brien.

1092
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:59,760
Where he is talking about how.

1093
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:06,760
There was a debate between myself and Piers Morgan and Piers Morgan handled it very calmly and they put a gun in my hand,

1094
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:11,760
animated if you're a radio listener, but you'll hear it shooting and it's firing and I'm firing it at him.

1095
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:16,760
And the idea is the fact that I'm like, hey, governments have been tyrannical. Our government's clearly getting tyrannical.

1096
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:21,760
You're not going to get our guns. And the and the message is I'm the dangerous one.

1097
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:27,760
And see, that's how domesticated we've gotten. You raise your voice to a foreigner tyrant liar.

1098
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,760
And oh, my gosh, some conservatives said, don't get in anybody's face. Don't wake anybody up. No, no, no.

1099
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:37,760
That's just how the country was founded. Don't ever get your blood pressure up.

1100
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:44,760
Just go to sleep. Be calm. One of the clergy response teams that governments hired to tell folks to turn their guns in and submit to government.

1101
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:49,760
They go, just calm down. Do what's required of you. Do whatever the government says. The government's our boss.

1102
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:55,760
That's not what freedom is all about. We didn't get all this freedom because our forebears laid down.

1103
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:07,760
Here is the clip. Of Conan O'Brien.

1104
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:14,760
Everyone is talking today about Piers Morgan's interview last night with radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

1105
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:19,760
He's the guy who started a petition to get Piers deported from America.

1106
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:29,760
Now, the two men debated gun control. I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think Alex was the one who took the pro gun position.

1107
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:33,760
Tonight, I'll go head to head with a man who actually wants to deport me.

1108
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:40,760
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms. We will not relinquish this.

1109
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:55,760
Do you understand? Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Adele Castro took the guns.

1110
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,760
I think Piers handled these.

1111
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,760
Yeah, and the clip goes on to say, I think Piers handled things quite well.

1112
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:09,760
So this is the type of stuff that we're dealing with as a society and as a culture.

1113
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:17,760
And again, this is how they sit there and try to try to misrepresent everything to everybody.

1114
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,760
This is how the power structure tries to manipulate the population.

1115
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:29,760
And, you know, to go on and finish what Jon Stewart said in the full clip, he said Hitler's going to be invading.

1116
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,760
That's what we think. No, no, we don't think Hitler's invading.

1117
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:39,760
We know we live in the worldwide center of a globalist empire that is full spectrum dominance against human populations.

1118
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,760
The globalists fund all the major radical groups.

1119
01:48:42,760 --> 01:48:47,760
They fund our government, the other governments. They control the whole show through fiat.

1120
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,760
They fund the radical Muslims. They put them in charge. They have them menace us.

1121
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:57,760
Then they train the military and police to take on gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, constitutionalists.

1122
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:08,760
This is what we're dealing with. This is the problem that as a society we face.

1123
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:13,760
And they're bringing us into this crisis. They're economically imploding things.

1124
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:18,760
They want to make us poor so that we can never rise again against them. This is all their stated plan.

1125
01:49:18,760 --> 01:49:23,760
But during this period of takeover, they know we're going to get restless.

1126
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,760
So they're gauging things and they're fine-tuning things.

1127
01:49:28,760 --> 01:49:33,760
But their main message is you're discredited if you get upset and get involved.

1128
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,760
And that's a self-fulfilling prophecy. They're like, look at these kooks.

1129
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:39,760
These Tea Party people want lower taxes and they all want open borders.

1130
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:44,760
And they say health care has got death panels. Man, they're in loons.

1131
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,760
The bill has the death panels. Now they brag they're in there.

1132
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:50,760
Look at these kooks. They say we want their guns, but we don't.

1133
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:53,760
They're playing psychological gaslighting games.

1134
01:49:53,760 --> 01:50:00,760
If you don't know the psychological term, gaslighting, you haven't looked it up.

1135
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:05,760
And that's just where you sit there and tell somebody you're not on planet Earth, you're on planet Pop-Tart.

1136
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,760
They're like, really? I am? Yes, you fell down and hit your head.

1137
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:11,760
And some weak-minded people actually buy into it.

1138
01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:14,760
So they're up there going, yeah, we're going to take your guns, but we're not.

1139
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,760
Well, you just said you were. Oh, you crazy little man.

1140
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:23,760
And then they make the whole debate about whether or not we're going into this level of control.

1141
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,760
And, again, I'm going to do a special report with all these different clips together.

1142
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,760
The bizarreness of it is I heard a clip yesterday that were playing me.

1143
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,760
We'll play it later after Joel Skousen pops in.

1144
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:42,760
Where Howard Stern and Quivers, his co-host, were defending me and saying they agreed with me.

1145
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:46,760
Very, very strange to have them agreeing with me, but I guess they understand where the people are

1146
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:52,760
and that most people understand that guns make you safer, especially because society is degenerating.

1147
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:54,760
There's going to be a lot of craziness going on.

1148
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:56,760
And so we need guns to protect ourselves.

1149
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:19,760
Stay with us.

1150
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:30,760
And support our operation as we move to the next level.

1151
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,760
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

1152
01:51:34,760 --> 01:51:40,760
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

1153
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:50,760
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.

1154
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,760
The war is here.

1155
01:51:51,760 --> 01:52:00,760
It's an info war, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

1156
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:05,760
Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins that bears repeating.

1157
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:09,760
Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.

1158
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:13,760
And pro EM one daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.

1159
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:19,760
Pro EM one is a powerful liquid probiotic strong enough to cleanse gentle enough to use every day.

That's 866-369-3678.

1163
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,760
Pro EM one, the raw probiotic.

1164
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:12,760
You land in Buenos Aires, then a shuttle to Santa Rosa where a nicely furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.

1165
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:16,760
After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins.

1166
01:53:16,760 --> 01:53:20,760
You're on a golden stag safari for big game.

1167
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:23,760
But it's not Africa, it's Argentina.

1168
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:32,760
One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo, huger, bighorn rams, wild boar, and the biggest stag deer in South America.

1169
01:53:32,760 --> 01:53:37,760
All gold medal quality, all the action you can handle.

1170
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:48,760
Land rovers, top rental guns with scopes, all food, beverages, hunting guides, ground transportation included, and more, all more affordable than you can imagine.

1171
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:53,760
The adventure of a lifetime starts at GoldenStagSafaris.com.

1172
01:53:53,760 --> 01:54:21,760
The big game hunting ranch, GoldenStagSafaris.com.

1173
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:34,760
Again, the establishment would not be coming after our guns right now unless they were planning a lot of nastiness.

1174
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:36,760
Here's the Daily Times Herald.

1175
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,760
Ban and seize semi-automatic weapons.

1176
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,760
Boom, door-to-door confiscation being called for.

1177
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:45,760
And by the way, that's in Iowa.

1178
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:51,760
It was Arcadia, Iowa, that the U.S. Army did a gun confiscation drill, and it was in the paper.

1179
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:57,760
They practiced taking over the gun shop, arresting him in the drill, and then going door-to-door and taking the guns.

1180
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:06,760
And they got all 600, quote, households, estimated, I don't know, 3,000 people or whatever, to let the army in each house to search for guns.

1181
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:08,760
And then I read the article a few years ago on air.

1182
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:18,760
It created a national stir, and they had an article the next day saying the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is a liar and a horrible person and caused a panic.

1183
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:26,760
But I had the news article where they said they trained for gun confiscation, and then I had the colonel on who admitted it.

1184
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:31,760
And that's all in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.

1185
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:34,760
Two years ago came out, very important film.

1186
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:42,760
And you see that film from two years ago, all of it's now coming true because, I mean, they said they would do it.

1187
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:55,760
And that's what's so frustrating about all this is that this is real, this is happening, and I go and I get in the face of Piers Morgan going, I know you're coming after our guns.

1188
01:55:55,760 --> 01:56:00,760
Tyrants throughout history have tried to get our guns, and I'm not putting up with you.

1189
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:01,760
Is that clear?

1190
01:56:01,760 --> 01:56:02,760
You're on notice.

1191
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:09,760
I mean, which, do you think George Washington, they talked to the Red Coast like that for years before it happened, before the physical fight.

1192
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:13,760
Paul Revere did the exact same thing, and then some.

1193
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:23,760
I'm telling you, the average even conservative today, because some conservatives, a lot of them got mad at me, they would probably want to put George Washington in jail.

1194
01:56:23,760 --> 01:56:33,760
Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Payne, Patrick Henry, all of them.

1195
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:43,760
I mean, I bet, I bet if I drove with a car with bull horns on the top of it, if the army was coming door to door confiscating guns.

1196
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:51,760
I bet if I drove through the streets of Austin, even in a conservative area saying, they're coming to confiscate guns, they're coming to confiscate guns, prepare yourselves.

1197
01:56:51,760 --> 01:57:01,760
That a lot of people would come out and start shooting at me and would be proud when the police showed up and would salute them and say, here's my guns and I killed Alex Jones.

1198
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:04,760
In fact, I know that would happen.

1199
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:14,760
If Paul Revere had people like this, so-called conservatives like this, and libertarians in his day and age in 1775.

1200
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:23,760
He would have been riding through the countryside saying to arms to arms, the redcoats are coming to confiscate the ball and powder and muskets.

1201
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:30,760
Somebody would open their upper window, they would have slid a long rifle out, and they would have shot him right there on the spot.

1202
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:39,760
And then when the redcoats got there, they would have saluted and handed their gun in.

1203
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:48,760
And so that told me a lot about people that, I don't know, 20, 30% of folks got real mad at me and said, how dare you call him a liar?

1204
01:57:48,760 --> 01:57:49,760
How dare you get in his face?

1205
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,760
And you know what?

1206
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:58,760
Hey, may the change set lightly upon you, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you, forget that we were your countrymen.

1207
01:57:58,760 --> 01:58:01,760
Good, you like the way the mainline neocon talk show host have been taking you?

1208
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:04,760
You like Mitt Romney as the Republican nominee?

1209
01:58:04,760 --> 01:58:05,760
You like that?

1210
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:06,760
Well, good.

1211
01:58:06,760 --> 01:58:07,760
May your change set lightly upon you.

01:58:50,760 --> 01:58:56,760
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves how did we ever survive from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy

1222
01:58:56,760 --> 01:59:01,760
and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy.

1223
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,760
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

1225
01:59:10,760 --> 01:59:14,760
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote,

1226
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:21,760
Almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister and niece.

1227
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:25,760
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.

1235
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:40,760
Ladies and gentlemen, Joel Scowles is popping in for a couple of segments.

1236
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:45,760
And then I've got a review of World War Z, which is a bunch of U.N. world government propaganda.

1237
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:47,760
It's going to premiere here on air.

1238
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:50,760
We'll also post it at Infowars.com.

1239
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,760
In fact, it's just been posted with the full video at Infowars.com.

1240
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:59,760
What they did is they got the video up there just now.

1241
02:00:59,760 --> 02:01:07,760
So that is certainly good news that that is now posted up at Infowars.com.

1242
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,760
We'll be premiering that on the radio coming up at the bottom of the hour.

1243
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:14,760
I said I'd go to calls, and I'll try to do that.

1244
02:01:14,760 --> 02:01:17,760
There's just so much news to go over here.

1245
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:22,760
I've got a couple more news articles out today where people are being attacked in bars, in pharmacies,

1246
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:27,760
in businesses, in their homes, and they're defending and shooting the intruders.

1247
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:31,760
But it's only ever in the local news.

1248
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:36,760
That's why the real media, the citizen media, the alternative media that is diverse,

1249
02:01:36,760 --> 02:01:39,760
doesn't mean we have all the answers, but we are the real media.

1250
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:41,760
We're media.

1251
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:43,760
The globalists are fake media.

1252
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,760
People are always trying to figure out a name.

1253
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:51,760
Prestitude media, collaborator media, globalist media, corporatist media, collectivist media,

1254
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:59,760
fascist media, traitor media, New World Order media, anti-American media, the cesspool media,

1255
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:04,760
the sewer stream media, the Decepticon media.

1256
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:08,760
How about just they're the fake media?

1257
02:02:08,760 --> 02:02:09,760
I mean, that's really what it is.

1258
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:11,760
They are the fake media.

1259
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:16,760
And a lot of what they report on is true, a plane crash, a cat stuck in a tree,

1260
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:19,760
how many inches of rain fell this week.

1261
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:25,760
Most reporters are just doing their job, but when it comes to policy and politics and punditry,

1262
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:30,760
it is a bunch of spinning and obfuscation and outright lies.

1263
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:41,760
And I, for one, am just absolutely, totally, 110% sick of it all.

1264
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:47,760
And we are entering world government.

1265
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:52,760
World government is being announced all over the news, but we're told, you're still crazy, it doesn't exist.

1266
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:57,760
Yeah, all these states are announcing bills to confiscate all semi-autos.

1267
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:04,760
And there's bills federally introduced to do it.

1268
02:03:04,760 --> 02:03:06,760
But it's not gonna happen.

1269
02:03:06,760 --> 02:03:11,760
People say, Alex, we've heard you say that here today.

1270
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:17,760
About 150 times, we know, okay, well, you better get that word out to other people.

1271
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:22,760
Because they're trying to tell you to not get angry and not get in their face and not call them liars.

1272
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:26,760
They're trying to tell you that discredits you so that you just buy their propaganda and go,

1273
02:03:26,760 --> 02:03:31,760
oh, that discredits me, I better not do that, because that's what is effective.

1274
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:44,760
That's what historically has brought these people down over and over and over again.

1275
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:49,760
Oh, man, again, I've had this chest cold, starting to get over it here.

1276
02:03:49,760 --> 02:03:58,760
And it's kind of like a fireworks display, it goes and fits in spurts.

1277
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:01,760
That was kind of a grand finale right there.

1278
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:08,760
Those antibiotics must just be absolutely killing that stuff, because my chest just lit up on fire.

1279
02:04:08,760 --> 02:04:15,760
Excruciating pain is kind of, I don't like it, but at the same time, it's kind of an interesting phenomenon.

1280
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,760
As a little kid, pain really, really hurts, because you don't know how to cut it off.

1281
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,760
Just understand, well, that's pain.

1282
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:24,760
And then that's over there.

1283
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:26,760
And just kind of ignore it.

1284
02:04:26,760 --> 02:04:31,760
But it's also hard when it's in your chest and you're on the air, so excuse me there.

1285
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,760
We come back, we're going to go to Joel Skousen.

1286
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,760
I'm going to get his take geopolitically on what all this world government announcement means,

1287
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:41,760
why they're pushing so hard to get the guns, what he thinks is going to come out of this, why they seem so confident.

1288
02:04:41,760 --> 02:04:47,760
I'm going to continue with that World War Z film review here today.

1289
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,760
I'll also look at some of the other geopolitical news as well.

1290
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:57,760
And I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., Central Standard Time, live on the radio.

1291
02:04:57,760 --> 02:04:59,760
Pray for the info, Lord.

1292
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:08,760
Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.

1293
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:15,760
As silver lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

Our most popular silver-based products are the 32-ounce nano silver solutions,

1295

our 2-ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all-natural silver soaps.

1296
02:05:26,760 --> 02:05:30,760
Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.

1297
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:37,760
Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.

1298
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:42,760
We have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera

1299
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:47,760
to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:30,760
This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals, which is key.

02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:34,760
Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.

1304
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:37,760
Pro-Pyr is the best gravity-fed filter out there.

1305
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:39,760
It's what my family uses.

1306
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:42,760
Infowars.com already has the lowest price on Pro-Pyr.

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.

1317
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:41,760
Ladies and gentlemen, we are joined for the next two segments for a brief interview.

1318
02:08:41,760 --> 02:08:47,760
We'll be right back with Joel Skousen, political scientist by training, specializing in philosophy of law and constitutional theory.

1319
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,760
Of course, his uncle is Cleon Skousen.

1320
02:08:49,760 --> 02:08:53,760
He'll help expose how the new world order controls communism.

1321
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:59,760
And his book, Strategic Relocation, North American Safe Places is a bestseller in the Patriot movement.

1322
02:08:59,760 --> 02:09:03,760
And we sell the third edition discounted with the new film we put together, Strategic Relocation.

1323
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:10,760
And Infowarsstore.com, I should add, if you want to support broadcasting in an absolutely vital book and video together.

1324
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:16,760
And of course, he was also a Marine Corps fighter bomber pilot in the Vietnam era.

1325
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:21,760
And also, he's been the chairman of the Conservative National Committee of Washington, D.C.

1326
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:23,760
JoelSkousen.com.

1327
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:25,760
He's also the editor of World Affairs Brief.

1328
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,760
And he joins us.

1329
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:34,760
Now, I wanted to get him on last week, but the gun thing happened, so we moved him to talk about Hermann von Ruppe and others.

1330
02:09:34,760 --> 02:09:38,760
And there's video of this, an article saying, let's merge the EU with Russia.

1331
02:09:38,760 --> 02:09:45,760
Which the president of the Czech Republic has said that's been the plan and that it's communism.

1332
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:50,760
The globalists have always talked about creating three or four blocks and then merging those blocks.

1333
02:09:50,760 --> 02:09:52,760
But there is factions within those blocks.

1334
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:54,760
And I agree with Skousen's power breakdown.

1335
02:09:54,760 --> 02:10:04,760
But having the communist Chinese come out, official government TV and papers, and say, Obama, you need to wage a war against the Second Amendment.

1336
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:05,760
That's a quote.

1337
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:09,760
And having Russia today suddenly flip and say, Alex Jones is bad.

1338
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:10,760
Turn the guns in.

1339
02:10:10,760 --> 02:10:11,760
He's a radical.

1340
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:17,760
And suddenly have, you know, all these foreign outlets saying we need to get the guns.

1341
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:19,760
What does this signify?

1342
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:22,760
The state run media outlets suddenly becoming pro Obama.

1343
02:10:22,760 --> 02:10:26,760
Are they worried about a conservative libertarian retake of America?

1344
02:10:26,760 --> 02:10:30,760
Why do they want a more socialist system here?

1345
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:37,760
I wanted to get his because he does have considerable gravitas on the geopolitical interlockings to break that down.

1346
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:38,760
But here it is.

1347
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:40,760
Bilderberg picked EU leader Von Rump.

1348
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:42,760
He calls for global governance with Russia.

1349
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,760
That's the new American.

1350
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:46,760
Here's innocent blood demands no delay for US gun control.

1351
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:50,760
People's Daily out of China.

1352
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,760
Let's give up on the Constitution.

1353
02:10:52,760 --> 02:10:54,760
New York Times says get rid of it.

1354
02:10:54,760 --> 02:10:56,760
They're calling for gun confiscation door to door.

1355
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:58,760
Again, they're just conditioning you to this idea.

1356
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:04,760
Doesn't mean it's coming next month or next year, but it could be when, you know, the nuke goes off for another mass shooting.

1357
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:07,760
But I got to say, I've said the time frames longer.

1358
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:11,760
I think it's accelerating for whatever reason, because they know our gun culture is winning.

1359
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,760
OK, so, Joe, we don't have a lot of time, obviously.

1360
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:14,760
Condense it down.

1361
02:11:14,760 --> 02:11:20,760
Let's get first in the geopolitical and what all this signifies and the UN treaty coming up.

1362
02:11:20,760 --> 02:11:26,760
And then and then you wanted to say something about Mr. Hagman and his federal source.

1363
02:11:26,760 --> 02:11:31,760
And I mean, the fact is, we were following around and harassed quite a bit in New York.

1364
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:33,760
They look like New York detectives to me, not feds.

1365
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,760
But you wanted to say something about supposed federal sources.

1366
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:37,760
Go ahead.

1367
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:38,760
Well, let's cover that first.

1368
02:11:38,760 --> 02:11:40,760
Let me get that out of the way.

1369
02:11:40,760 --> 02:11:50,760
You know, the conservative movement has always been enamored by the fact that we might have one of our own inside government that's feeding us information and warning us about things.

1370
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:56,760
Doug Hagman claims that he's got such a source who works in supposedly high level in DHS.

1371
02:11:56,760 --> 02:12:03,760
And he got involved in your New York appearance with Piers Morgan by saying that you were followed around.

1372
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:06,760
And obviously, you know that that is true.

1373
02:12:06,760 --> 02:12:12,760
Heretofore, this particular source from DHS has claimed several things that simply have not come true.

1374
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:17,760
It's claiming the collapse of the economy in 2012, which didn't come true.

1375
02:12:17,760 --> 02:12:28,760
And worst of all, he claimed that a big black operation was, quote, going hot that was going to stop the election and bring Obama in through having no election.

1376
02:12:28,760 --> 02:12:30,760
And that didn't happen.

1377
02:12:30,760 --> 02:12:35,760
Hagman confronted him in one of his interviews and he gave some offhanded excuse.

1378
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:36,760
Hagman didn't pursue it.

1379
02:12:36,760 --> 02:12:42,760
But it should have been pursued because, you know, it really was wrong.

1380
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:49,760
What was more disturbing to me, which I covered in today's World Affairs brief of his after the fact.

1381
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,760
You know, I'll tell you what, Joel, we had good audio with you in the pre-interview.

1382
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:56,760
And I think your computer switches to internal, Mike, when you go on air.

1383
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:58,760
I don't know why we're going to have to go to phone only video Skype.

1384
02:12:58,760 --> 02:12:59,760
We're gonna do that now.

1385
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:02,760
We're not going to we're not going to have audio like that on air.

1386
02:13:02,760 --> 02:13:03,760
Sorry.

1387
02:13:03,760 --> 02:13:04,760
I'm trying to work that out with him.

1388
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:06,760
And I don't want to go too far off into this.

1389
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:07,760
He wanted to mention it.

1390
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:08,760
Get into it.

1391
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:09,760
We will.

1392
02:13:09,760 --> 02:13:11,760
I believe Doug has this source and believes what he's saying.

1393
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:15,760
And I think Joel, what Joel's told me off air is that he believes he has it, too.

1394
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:18,760
It's just that he thinks the guy is bamboozling him.

1395
02:13:18,760 --> 02:13:19,760
That could be the case.

1396
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:23,760
All I know is I've been given Homeland Security documents by state police, by feds, by others

1397
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:28,760
that turned out to be national news, like the clergy response team documents that turned

1398
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:31,760
out to be absolutely accurate about training preachers.

1399
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:36,760
Infra guard documents, my report documents, Homeland Security about veterans and gun owners

1400
02:13:36,760 --> 02:13:38,760
being the number one terror threat.

1401
02:13:38,760 --> 02:13:42,640
People could say, well, those guys leaked these to us because they wanted it out there

1402
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,520
because they're bad guys.

1403
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:49,320
You know, I talked to these guys on the phone, some of them, they've just gotten to a point

1404
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:50,640
where they don't care.

1405
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:56,600
And I know that people like Wayne Madsen have said that they've got whole NSA teams spying

1406
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:58,520
on people in government.

1407
02:13:58,520 --> 02:14:01,120
That's one of their main focus to make sure these leaks don't happen.

1408
02:14:01,120 --> 02:14:03,800
But they have a right and a duty to come out with all this.

1409
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:05,400
So there is an attempt for this to happen.

1410
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:11,040
But I don't think it's impossible to ever have real sources out there who aren't just

1411
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:16,200
feeding you something because I know I've gotten stuff from real people who are in briefings,

1412
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:20,940
get the documents, go to the library and send me the PDF.

1413
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:25,560
And I've had cases where I've had a preacher on with the clergy response team documents

1414
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:31,000
and they get called in at the hospital the next week where they go and do ministry by

1415
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
FEMA threatening them.

1416
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:37,640
So what Joel's saying does happen too, they go after you.

1417
02:14:37,640 --> 02:14:41,840
But I mean, so certainly they are tracking people.

1418
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:42,840
Joel is right.

1419
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:43,840
Okay, Joel, please continue.

1420
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:44,840
Go ahead.

1421
02:14:44,840 --> 02:14:47,960
Well, that's what I'm saying, Alex, is there's no way this guy could keep talking to Doug

1422
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:53,640
Hageman out of school, warning them about things or even revealing what should have

1423
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:58,720
been a legal operation of harassing you in New York, which opens up Homeland Security

1424
02:14:58,720 --> 02:15:02,760
and anyone else for a civil rights violation.

1425
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:06,520
They can't keep doing that and claim that they don't know about it.

1426
02:15:06,520 --> 02:15:09,120
I mean, they surveil everything.

1427
02:15:09,120 --> 02:15:14,960
And when it's published openly on Infowars.com, certainly we know that the government reads

1428
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,560
everything you put out.

1429
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:18,960
You're the biggest target they have.

1430
02:15:18,960 --> 02:15:23,060
They're not going to let somebody continue to talk to Hageman and then to you without

1431
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:26,560
shutting him down if in fact he is on our side.

1432
02:15:26,560 --> 02:15:32,720
If he's not on our side, if he's playing us, which I think he is, and that curveball

1433
02:15:32,720 --> 02:15:37,720
he threw about the election was just playing, targeting us to get discredited.

1434
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:41,720
Well, you know, they also line up for big things just to see who in the federal government

1435
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:45,520
will go along with it and tell people things are going to happen, even though it's not

1436
02:15:45,520 --> 02:15:46,520
100 percent.

1437
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:49,600
They kind of take the safety off, but then they don't pull the trigger.

1438
02:15:49,600 --> 02:15:50,600
They scrap missions.

1439
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,800
So that happens, too.

1440
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:54,040
All I know is this.

1441
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:58,280
Over and over again, we've found out that at Homeland Security, it's a clique of weird

1442
02:15:58,280 --> 02:16:03,120
women, to say the least, dominating men, harassing them, and the government settled.

1443
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:09,480
So a lot of it is they're getting so disorganized up there and so many people don't like what's

1444
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:10,480
happening.

1445
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:12,000
I mean, I know you've studied this.

1446
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,120
You've had family in and around FBI, you name it, that you have contacts and you believe

1447
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:18,840
they're more organized.

1448
02:16:18,840 --> 02:16:22,600
I'm not saying you're wrong, that he couldn't be being played.

1449
02:16:22,600 --> 02:16:27,000
But I'm also saying that, I mean, look at the hookers and the Secret Service and maybe

1450
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,080
something's behind that, too, to compromise them.

1451
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,880
But I mean, well, you heard my point.

1452
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:32,400
What's your take on that?

1453
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:36,480
Well, they're always having to do damage control.

1454
02:16:36,480 --> 02:16:38,120
Look at the Sandy Hook shooting.

1455
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:43,180
I mean, to send Eric Holder up there to have a secret meeting with all the state police,

1456
02:16:43,180 --> 02:16:44,560
he basically was setting down the law.

1457
02:16:44,560 --> 02:16:45,560
This is a matter of national security.

1458
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:49,160
If you've seen things that don't match the official story, you just shut up about it.

1459
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:50,320
He was quieting the opposition.

1460
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,580
They have to deal with that all the time.

1461
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:57,440
But they're also consolidating more and more at the top levels, and there is no dissent

1462
02:16:57,440 --> 02:16:59,240
at the top level.

1463
02:16:59,240 --> 02:17:04,520
Perhaps the only thing that really got out of hand was General Petraeus, and he ended

1464
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:11,520
up getting snookered by a Muslim agent from Lebanon and got close to General John Allen

1465
02:17:11,520 --> 02:17:12,520
as well.

1466
02:17:12,520 --> 02:17:16,920
And boy, that was a very embarrassing thing for the military, and Petraeus had to go.

1467
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:17,920
He was a big player.

1468
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:21,080
They had big plans for him, but he made a mistake.

1469
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:23,440
So they do have to do damage control.

1470
02:17:23,440 --> 02:17:27,800
But I don't believe that they're losing power.

1471
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,320
I think they're even more confident now.

1472
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:33,200
No, I agree that they're accelerating their power, but at the same time, just because

1473
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:38,280
they're winning the race doesn't mean their NASCAR isn't smoking and having problems.

1474
02:17:38,280 --> 02:17:42,080
Now expanding on that, you were just hinting at anomalies.

1475
02:17:42,080 --> 02:17:46,000
I mean, this wasn't just five-year-olds saying they saw multiple shooters.

1476
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,800
This has a lot of really bad signs.

1477
02:17:48,800 --> 02:17:54,080
So does Colorado, and look at all the timing, and they do seem very arrogant right now about

1478
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:55,080
the guns.

1479
02:17:55,080 --> 02:17:56,080
What do you see happening?

1480
02:17:56,080 --> 02:18:01,560
Well, as I pointed out in today's World Affairs Brief, they don't have the votes, in my opinion,

1481
02:18:01,560 --> 02:18:04,400
to ram through all the gun control they want.

1482
02:18:04,400 --> 02:18:11,880
They're going to get what they can, but that's the main reason why they're pushing for an

1483
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:13,680
executive order.

1484
02:18:13,680 --> 02:18:14,680
That's a sheer admission.

1485
02:18:14,680 --> 02:18:17,480
They've made that play twice now.

1486
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:20,400
That's a sheer admission that they don't think they have the votes.

1487
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:23,640
And I've looked at the law of what you can do with an executive order, and I want to

1488
02:18:23,640 --> 02:18:25,080
be very clear.

1489
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:33,840
Obama cannot legally include other weapons in class three, weapons like machine guns,

1490
02:18:33,840 --> 02:18:34,840
by executive order.

1491
02:18:34,840 --> 02:18:35,840
He cannot do it.

1492
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:36,840
It's not legal.

1493
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:40,000
Now that doesn't mean he can't do it and get away with it if the courts let him, but there's

1494
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,280
no way that an executive order can actually change law.

1495
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:46,880
He can direct federal agencies to implement the law.

1496
02:18:46,880 --> 02:18:49,640
He can tweak that a little bit, but he can't add weapons.

1497
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:54,000
And just to be clear, level three firearms are full auto.

1498
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:57,000
You've got to go get a background, waive your rights, get a stamp.

1499
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:01,640
They are wanting to include the semi-autos in level three and just say, by executive

1500
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:03,640
order, those are all added in.

1501
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:06,480
I believe that will cause resistance.

1502
02:19:06,480 --> 02:19:08,480
If they do that, I'm really concerned.

1503
02:19:08,480 --> 02:19:15,600
Well, it won't cause the same kind of resistance as if they tried to do something blatant and

1504
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:16,600
confiscate guns.

1505
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:21,400
But really, as you correctly pointed out, that's going to cause a revolution.

1506
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,120
They're not going to be dumb enough to do that.

1507
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:26,760
Besides, you can't do confiscation until you have registration first.

1508
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:31,880
So that's the first thing they really want out of this gun ban is to get a list of expanded

1509
02:19:31,880 --> 02:19:36,780
banning and then have this new form of registration, which is grandfathered.

1510
02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:41,080
You can be grandfathered if you agree to register and take your fingerprint.

1511
02:19:41,080 --> 02:19:42,080
That's right.

1512
02:19:42,080 --> 02:19:43,080
Exactly.

1513
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:46,000
It brings you in to get you on record so they know how to come take it.

1514
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,280
We're going to come back and talk about that.

1515
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:51,240
And then I got to get your take on the geopolitical, but I've also got to go to my breakdown on

1516
02:19:51,240 --> 02:19:52,240
World War Z.

1517
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:54,520
We're going to premiere here on the radio.

1518
02:19:54,520 --> 02:19:55,520
Stay with us.

1519
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:57,760
Joel Scowles and the World Affairs Brief is our guest.

1520
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:58,760
We'll be right back.

1521
02:19:58,760 --> 02:19:59,760
I'm Alex Jones.

1522
02:19:59,760 --> 02:20:00,760
Hello, I'm Alex Jones.

1523
02:20:00,760 --> 02:20:08,920
Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we

1524
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:13,920
are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.

1525
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:19,600
Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without

1526
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:20,600
your help.

1527
02:20:20,600 --> 02:20:25,840
By getting the films, bumper stickers and T-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up

1528
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:31,860
people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.

1529
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:35,320
We need your help to spread the word like never before.

1530
02:20:35,320 --> 02:20:41,520
They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.

1531
02:20:41,520 --> 02:20:48,960
You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization

1532
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:50,440
and ultimate extermination.

1533
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:52,880
The war is here.

1534
02:20:52,880 --> 02:21:01,020
It's an Infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.

1535
02:21:01,020 --> 02:21:03,240
It's time for a home security quiz.

1536
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:04,240
Answer this.

1537
02:21:04,240 --> 02:21:08,460
What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into

1538
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:13,060
thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is

1539
02:21:13,060 --> 02:21:17,320
recommended by many police departments and sells for less than $35?

1540
02:21:17,320 --> 02:21:19,920
Yes, it's fake TV.

1541
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:24,300
This year, about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break in with burglars usually

1542
02:21:24,300 --> 02:21:28,760
picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.

1543
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:33,660
Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching

1544
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:36,740
TV by simulating the light from a real TV.

1545
02:21:36,740 --> 02:21:39,740
Looks like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.

1546
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:44,460
And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure

1547
02:21:44,460 --> 02:21:46,760
house or one that's been ransacked.

1550
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,720
Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

1551
02:22:00,720 --> 02:22:06,600
As the economy continues to falter, one thing continues to grow, crime, burglaries, theft

1552
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:09,420
and home invasions are the fastest growing professions.

1553
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:13,060
Confrontation is never the goal, prevention by keeping them out is.

Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

1561
02:22:31,540 --> 02:22:35,300
Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold

1562
02:22:35,300 --> 02:22:36,300
IRAs?

1563
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:40,340
They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value

1564
02:22:40,340 --> 02:22:42,020
of gold for your retirement.

1565
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:45,500
Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

1566
02:22:45,500 --> 02:22:50,500
If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

1569
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:01,700
Food storage?

1570
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:02,700
Check.

1571
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:03,700
Survival tools?

1572
02:23:03,700 --> 02:23:04,700
Check.

1573
02:23:04,700 --> 02:23:05,700
Weapons and water filters?

1574
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:10,040
Well, what about a permanent source of cooking power that can run forever without buying

1575
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:11,820
fuel or paying for maintenance?

Cook hot meals with just a handful of sticks.

1586
02:24:02,780 --> 02:24:11,300
All right, look, we're running out of time.

1587
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:14,340
I'll have to get Joel back up in the next few weeks for a full hour to get into geopolitical

1588
02:24:14,340 --> 02:24:18,620
issues in his book and the new film we've put out, Strategic Relocation, available at

1589
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:20,620
info-war-store.com.

1590
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:24,180
But Joel, just finishing up and condensing it all, they're moving really fast on the

1591
02:24:24,180 --> 02:24:25,180
guns.

1592
02:24:25,180 --> 02:24:30,020
I'm seeing a lot of signs of arrogance from them, talk of confiscation.

1593
02:24:30,020 --> 02:24:35,180
They could want to go ahead and start a conflict here to paint libertarians, conservatives,

1594
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:36,180
Christians as radicals.

1595
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:38,060
We know Homeland Security was set up for that.

1596
02:24:38,060 --> 02:24:40,620
I know you think the timeline is longer.

1597
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:43,660
I hope that's the case, but they're moving really fast.

1598
02:24:43,660 --> 02:24:44,660
Finish your point on the guns.

1599
02:24:44,660 --> 02:24:49,900
Well, it always looks like they're moving fast when they build up a manufactured crisis

1600
02:24:49,900 --> 02:24:54,180
like the Sandy Hook, and they're trying to take as much advantage as they can.

1601
02:24:54,180 --> 02:24:58,740
It's going to move the debate to about 20 to 30 percent in their direction, which is

1602
02:24:58,740 --> 02:24:59,740
very, very dangerous.

1603
02:24:59,740 --> 02:25:04,380
Still, at the bottom line, I don't believe that there's very many congressmen that get

1604
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:08,180
away with, you know, we know what happened to the Democrats in 1996.

1605
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:13,420
They lost big because they voted for that assault weapon ban, and if it happens again,

1606
02:25:13,420 --> 02:25:17,020
I don't know of any Republicans, or very many, that are going to get away with voting.

1607
02:25:17,020 --> 02:25:22,420
But now there's a lot of election fraud which can trump that, and they know that there's

1608
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:26,420
an awakening happening, so they want to head it off at the pass, I think, with preemptive

1609
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:27,420
crises.

1610
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:29,380
I mean, I think that's in the cards.

1611
02:25:29,380 --> 02:25:35,820
Well, I think there's about a, frankly, about a 40 to 60 chance against being able to pass

1612
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:41,820
in Congress a major ban, but they're going to go, if that doesn't pass, they are going

1613
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:47,320
to go with an executive order, and boy, I just don't believe that Congress has the guts

1614
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:50,100
to impeach over the illegal use of an executive order.

1615
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:55,660
That's right, and we've got to drive, because they want to make us come to the ATF and re-register,

1616
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:57,220
turning a right into a privilege.

1617
02:25:57,220 --> 02:25:59,220
We've got to move towards Congress to block that.

1618
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:03,180
Now, geopolitically, what's happening with all this realignment we see happening?

1619
02:26:03,180 --> 02:26:10,140
Well, first of all, no major new world order with Russia is going to happen without war.

1620
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:12,020
I'm absolutely convinced of that.

1621
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:17,740
What we're seeing in the new American peace, Bilderberg picked EU leader Von Rompuy, calls

1622
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:19,920
for global governance with Russia.

1623
02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:24,900
And this doesn't mean that that's even close to a, you know, they're floating this

1624
02:26:24,900 --> 02:26:30,740
as a peace initiative, but there's kind of a double-handed back hand here.

1625
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:35,780
In other words, the West has continued to play like Russia is an ally, and this is part

1626
02:26:35,780 --> 02:26:42,220
of furthering that deception that Russia is an ally, in order to feign weakness, to give

1627
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:46,500
Russia more confidence that we're stupid, that we're incompetent, that we can infiltrate,

1628
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:51,600
and they're openly letting Russia infiltrate the EU and NATO.

1629
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:54,780
But it's only to facilitate an eventual third world war.

1630
02:26:54,780 --> 02:26:57,780
It's not because they're ever going to get complete global-

1631
02:26:57,780 --> 02:26:59,860
Sure, they're suckering them in.

1632
02:26:59,860 --> 02:27:00,860
That's right, they're suckering them in.

1633
02:27:00,860 --> 02:27:03,620
Now, let me just say, it's very important.

1634
02:27:03,620 --> 02:27:09,260
The globalists at Bilderberg, or at the Bilderberg Conference, this is really kind of a leadership

1635
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:14,340
conference where they're bringing along the up-and-coming leaders and exposing them

1636
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:17,900
to globalist viewpoints and testing how they react to that.

1637
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:22,760
They bring in not only bonafide globalists, but they also bring in people from the Socialist

1638
02:27:22,760 --> 02:27:26,180
International, which is tied to Moscow.

1639
02:27:26,180 --> 02:27:27,180
And that's important, different.

1640
02:27:27,180 --> 02:27:31,460
Now, for example, Tony Blair was a full-blown member of the Socialist International, I believe

1641
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:36,780
was a Marxist, same thing with Javier Solana, and they bring them into Bilderberg because

1642
02:27:36,780 --> 02:27:42,740
they want to make the communists who are associated with socialism feel like we're giving in

1643
02:27:42,740 --> 02:27:46,380
to them that they're snookering us.

1644
02:27:46,380 --> 02:27:50,900
They're playing soft, they're playing accepting, they're playing blind.

1645
02:27:50,900 --> 02:27:56,260
So at any given time, we don't really know when they attend Bilderberg, even if they've

1646
02:27:56,260 --> 02:28:00,580
been a Socialist International, if they've switched sides and become true globalists.

1647
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:03,580
Now, I think Tony Blair actually did switch sides.

1648
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:08,260
I think he was Marxist, Socialist International, he switched sides and became a full-blown

1649
02:28:08,260 --> 02:28:09,260
globalist.

1650
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:13,540
When Obama was Marxist, became a globalist, was bought out, and that's where you can tell

1651
02:28:13,540 --> 02:28:14,540
that-

1652
02:28:14,540 --> 02:28:17,740
Sure, they use Marxism to take over, but it's globalist on top.

1653
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:20,300
That's exactly from Carol Quigley's own book what they do.

1654
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:29,460
In closing, why am I starting to getting attacked by European TV, radio, and British, and especially

1655
02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:30,460
Russian?

1656
02:28:30,460 --> 02:28:31,860
Why are the Russians coming after me?

1657
02:28:31,860 --> 02:28:38,340
Well, first of all, the Russians are playing, have been playing the game through RT, through

1658
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:41,460
EU Times, which is a phony KGB front.

1659
02:28:41,460 --> 02:28:45,420
They've been facilitating and helping out the conspiracy movement here in the right

1660
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:50,740
wing, almost as if they want to foment this civil war between what they view as the right

1661
02:28:50,740 --> 02:28:53,420
wing and the government.

1662
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:58,460
Right now, you are the prime leader of that movement, and that's why Piers Morgan targeted

1663
02:28:58,460 --> 02:29:01,820
you to go after you and try to discredit you.

1664
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:03,660
That's why the Russians are after you.

1665
02:29:03,660 --> 02:29:05,660
But there's another side to that, too.

1666
02:29:05,660 --> 02:29:10,940
There are the free market people out there in Russia, like Stanislav Mishin, which wrote,

1667
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:13,780
you know, Americans don't give up your guns, you know.

1668
02:29:13,780 --> 02:29:14,780
No, no, we talked to him.

1669
02:29:14,780 --> 02:29:16,260
No, no, there are a lot of good Russians.

1670
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:20,380
That's why we want to stop this globalist Russian engineered war.

1671
02:29:20,380 --> 02:29:22,660
Is there any way to stop that?

1672
02:29:22,660 --> 02:29:23,660
I don't believe there is.

1673
02:29:23,660 --> 02:29:30,100
I think it's coming not only because the Russians want it, but the American Anglo-American establishment,

1674
02:29:30,100 --> 02:29:34,900
the globalist as we call them, wants that war, and you can't get to a full integration

1675
02:29:34,900 --> 02:29:36,940
and loss of American sovereignty without that war.

1676
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:39,380
I tell you what, this is a 14-minute report coming up.

1677
02:29:39,380 --> 02:29:40,860
We got three minutes on the other side.

1678
02:29:40,860 --> 02:29:41,860
Stay there.

1679
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:45,500
I want you to talk about that amazing article in Pravda, of all places, saying Americans

1680
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:46,900
don't give up your guns.

1681
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:50,500
It really gives a lot of real history.

1682
02:29:50,500 --> 02:29:51,780
We're on the march.

1683
02:29:51,780 --> 02:29:54,180
The empire's on the run.

1684
02:29:54,180 --> 02:30:00,940
Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

1685
02:30:00,940 --> 02:30:03,860
Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.

1686
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:09,020
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.

1687
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:15,060
The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

1688
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:16,060
to the global takeover.

1689
02:30:16,060 --> 02:30:22,060
That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.

1690
02:30:22,060 --> 02:30:25,700
These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.

1691
02:30:25,700 --> 02:30:30,700
You've got the life straw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.

1692
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:35,420
The Ktor hand-crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out

1693
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:36,420
in the field.

1694
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:39,460

1695
02:30:39,460 --> 02:30:41,940

1696
02:30:41,940 --> 02:30:46,860

1697

Infowarshop.com.

1703
02:31:00,020 --> 02:31:05,540
Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

1704
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:06,940

harmful pathogens.

hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.

1735
02:32:59,980 --> 02:33:14,500
Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.

1736
02:33:14,500 --> 02:33:23,500
That's Alex Jones.

1737
02:33:23,500 --> 02:33:29,060
Three days ago I saw the article out of Pravda that used to be a complete outlet of disinformation.

1738
02:33:29,060 --> 02:33:35,660
The joke was, hey our local paper is as bad as Pravda which I guess means truth.

1739
02:33:35,660 --> 02:33:40,820
But more and more it's like really good analysis, anti-globalist and there's a guy that calls

1740
02:33:40,820 --> 02:33:46,180
himself basically a white Russian that means, hey, I want to go back to the old Tsar monarchy

1741
02:33:46,180 --> 02:33:49,180
which has been the Russian culture for a thousand years or so.

1742
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:54,260
But he says your government and your banks funded the Marxist that came over here in

1743
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:55,260
1917.

1744
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,860
We were all armed.

1745
02:33:56,860 --> 02:34:01,420
That's how we beat Napoleon and that's how we fought Hitler because all the guns hadn't

1746
02:34:01,420 --> 02:34:02,540
even been taken by them.

1747
02:34:02,540 --> 02:34:06,600
People hit them and it's just a shame that you're run by these people.

1748
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:11,940
And to see that in Pravda, cuz that's what you've exposed and your uncle Cleon Skousen,

1749
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:16,420
that's what Carol Quigley later confirmed what your uncle had written about with the

1750
02:34:16,420 --> 02:34:19,540
mega banks were actually funding authoritarians and communism.

1751
02:34:19,540 --> 02:34:26,540
In closing, what do you make of the Russians starting to tell the truth like that?

1752
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:27,540
What does that signify?

1753
02:34:27,540 --> 02:34:31,980
Well, first of all, I was really surprised the first time I've seen someone out of Russia

1754
02:34:31,980 --> 02:34:37,340
recognize the role of the globalists in financing communism.

1755
02:34:37,340 --> 02:34:43,180
And he said very clearly, if it had not been for Washington's clandestine support of

1756
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:46,660
and for the Reds, history would have gone quite differently.

1757
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:49,820
They cut off the arms to the white Russians.

1758
02:34:49,820 --> 02:34:53,820
They refused to allow any military aid to be sent to them.

1759
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:54,820
They sabotaged them.

1760
02:34:54,820 --> 02:34:56,380
It was just like what they did with Mao.

1761
02:34:56,380 --> 02:35:01,260
They brought Mao to power by sabotaging, cutting off military aid, Chiang Kai-shek.

1762
02:35:01,260 --> 02:35:06,980
But what I want to say in conclusion is that there is a major division between those who

1763
02:35:06,980 --> 02:35:08,380
understand this.

1764
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:13,020
One believes that because they have facilitated communism, they own communism.

1765
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:14,020
They run it.

1766
02:35:14,020 --> 02:35:15,020
They control it.

1767
02:35:15,020 --> 02:35:16,220
And I don't agree with that.

1768
02:35:16,220 --> 02:35:21,560
I believe they're co-predators, vying to control a new world order which they each

1769
02:35:21,560 --> 02:35:22,920
want to control.

1770
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:28,300
The West is going to use war to destroy national sovereignty, so that's why they're building

1771
02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:32,340
the best enemies that money can buy, as Dr. Stan Monteith says.

1772
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:35,420
They built Marxism in China.

1773
02:35:35,420 --> 02:35:41,340
They gave Russia the first nuclear weapon weaponized uranium in order to build the first

1774
02:35:41,340 --> 02:35:42,340
bomb.

1775
02:35:42,340 --> 02:35:43,340
They helped create Hitler.

1776
02:35:43,340 --> 02:35:46,980
I mean, a lot of that came out, as you know, in congressional hearings.

1777
02:35:46,980 --> 02:35:52,520
Well, listen, I want to get you back sometime for a full hour to go over Cleon Skousen's

1778
02:35:52,520 --> 02:35:58,280
research and your updated research, Joel Skousen, to talk about how they funded Hitler and to

1779
02:35:58,280 --> 02:36:04,380
Anthony Sutton's research that helped Congress, how they funded the communists in China and

1780
02:36:04,380 --> 02:36:09,540
in Russia, and how they're funding the radical Muslims today to get your detailed geopolitical

1781
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:12,980
breakdown of the past, the present, and the future.

1782
02:36:12,980 --> 02:36:15,500
Joel Skousen, thank you so much for spending time with us.

1783
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:16,500
My pleasure, Alex.

1784
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:17,500
Bye now.

1785
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:18,500
All right, bye-bye.

1786
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:19,500
There he goes.

1787
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:22,900
Got that update from him.

1788
02:36:22,900 --> 02:36:32,180
This is from Genesis, some of our new affiliates that are turning the broadcast on, WTNY 790

1789
02:36:32,180 --> 02:36:35,260
AM, Watertown, New York.

1790
02:36:35,260 --> 02:36:40,080
And that is very, very exciting to have that news station.

1791
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:44,860
And again, I will plug several more on the Sunday broadcast.

1792
02:36:44,860 --> 02:36:51,260
We're getting about two to three new affiliates a week, so there's one today, WTNY 790 AM.

1793
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:55,580
And we need to focus also on some of the stations that have already been carrying us, but a

1794
02:36:55,580 --> 02:36:59,380
lot of new affiliates picking up the broadcast, praise God.

1795
02:36:59,380 --> 02:37:05,900
Okay, I wanna go to this report on World War Z, because it ties into the dehumanization.

1796
02:37:05,900 --> 02:37:12,380
We see people like Bill Maher saying, kill people, more shootings, more killings, more

1797
02:37:12,380 --> 02:37:17,580
car wrecks, more death, more abortion, on HBO a few months ago.

1798
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:20,060
But then he says, ban our guns, the 20 dead kids.

1799
02:37:20,060 --> 02:37:23,780
The globalists are not liberals, they say they're liberals, they want lower population.

1800
02:37:23,780 --> 02:37:27,980
And this zombie meme, now being pushed by the Marines and pushed by FEMA and pushed

1801
02:37:27,980 --> 02:37:32,380
by CDC, is to sell you the general public are ugly zombies.

1802
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:36,620
Now the video of this is extremely powerful if you're a radio listener.

1803
02:37:36,620 --> 02:37:39,300
But here's the audio, also very powerful for radio listeners.

1804
02:37:39,300 --> 02:37:43,740
But radio listeners, go to prisonplanet.com, go to infowars.com, you can see it now.

1805
02:37:43,740 --> 02:37:47,900
Video, secrets of World War Z leaked, here is that report.

1806
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:54,980
Then we'll come back with Howard Stern and his co-host saying that they agree with me

1807
02:37:54,980 --> 02:38:01,020
on this, Robin Quivers, saying they agree with me on the Second Amendment, pretty amazing.

1808
02:38:01,020 --> 02:38:04,500
Here it is.

1809
02:38:04,500 --> 02:38:09,080
The secrets of World War Z leaked.

1810
02:38:09,080 --> 02:38:12,180
What is the message behind World War Z?

1811
02:38:12,180 --> 02:38:25,020
We're going to leak those secrets right now.

1812
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:33,440
The core of the book is a UN plan developed to use survivors as bait to lure in the zombies

1813
02:38:33,440 --> 02:38:35,620
so they can be exterminated.

1814
02:38:35,620 --> 02:38:43,620
The number one enemy in this disgusting pro-genocide anti-human publication is that humans that

1815
02:38:43,620 --> 02:38:49,940
have not submitted to communism and the United Nations are undesirables that are worse than

1816
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:51,680
the zombies.

1817
02:38:51,680 --> 02:38:56,640
As the globalists prepare the worldwide collapse, they must condition the public that humanity

1818
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:59,140
is ugly and needs to be killed.

1819
02:38:59,140 --> 02:39:04,020
Those of you lucky enough to be behind the compact cities shouldn't complain and should

1820
02:39:04,020 --> 02:39:06,460
do any Marxist job you're told.

1821
02:39:06,460 --> 02:39:10,620
After all, only that can defeat the zombies.

1822
02:39:10,620 --> 02:39:15,100
World War Z is a regurgitation of the same message we've been hammered with our whole

1823
02:39:15,100 --> 02:39:16,380
lives.

1824
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:19,740
The UN is the planet's savior.

1825
02:39:19,740 --> 02:39:22,800
Humanity is the world's enemy.

1826
02:39:22,800 --> 02:39:30,700
Only world government will save you from the disgusting zombie filth that is humanity.

1827
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:34,740
The globalists have publicly bragged that they engineered World War I and World War

1828
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:39,740
II to create the League of Nations and UN and to begin the destruction of the nation

1829
02:39:39,740 --> 02:39:40,740
state.

1830
02:39:40,740 --> 02:39:47,220
So if World War I and World War II were wars against the nation state and national sovereignty,

1831
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:57,900
World War Z is a psychological warfare simulation declaring war on humanity itself with humanity

1832
02:39:57,900 --> 02:40:02,860
as the enemy and the UN as the savior.

1833
02:40:02,860 --> 02:40:09,460
Let's talk about Brad Pitt who was in a bidding war with Leonardo DiCaprio over the book World

1834
02:40:09,460 --> 02:40:10,940
War Z.

1835
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:18,700
We've analyzed it and I can say unequivocally this is a manifesto of United Nations worldwide

1836
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:22,420
genocide against nation states and individuals.

1837
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:29,780
It is a declaration of war and a sacrament to planetary bloodlust and the new world order's

1838
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:33,040
wish to reduce world population.

1839
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:38,140
In brief synopsis, the book begins with the disintegration of the world civilizations

1840
02:40:38,140 --> 02:40:45,740
by an outbreak of zombies and the world transforming itself under UN leadership as a single international

1841
02:40:45,740 --> 02:40:53,260
union to save humanity under Marxism and the extermination of all American gun owners.

1842
02:40:53,260 --> 02:40:58,940
From the book World War Z, that's when the UN multinational force was created and we

1843
02:40:58,940 --> 02:41:03,660
were pleasantly surprised by how many people signed up in the first week.

1844
02:41:03,660 --> 02:41:10,900
The biggest enemy for this communist UN takeover are domestic secessionists of the United States.

1845
02:41:10,900 --> 02:41:16,300
The Rebs only welcomed you with gunshots, the brass had special units for Rebs.

1846
02:41:16,300 --> 02:41:21,000
I saw them on the road once crossing the Black Hills, that was the first time since the Rockies

1847
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:27,740
that I ever saw tanks, bad feeling, you knew how it was going to end.

1848
02:41:27,740 --> 02:41:32,880
The ultimate crime is owning a gun, not under UN control.

1849
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:38,000
Those that submit and turn in their firearms are called Robinson Carusos and are given

1850
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:41,540
a nice job at the forced labor camp.

1851
02:41:41,540 --> 02:41:45,860
The body armor was for protection against some of the regular people we found.

1852
02:41:45,860 --> 02:41:52,460
I'm not talking organized rebels, just the odd LMOE or last man on earth.

1853
02:41:52,460 --> 02:41:55,940
Some dude or chick didn't manage to survive.

1854
02:41:55,940 --> 02:42:01,460
Most of the time we managed to talk them down, those we called RCs or Robinson Carusos, that

1855
02:42:01,460 --> 02:42:04,660
was the polite term for the ones who were cool.

1856
02:42:04,660 --> 02:42:11,620
If the UN concludes that you are not a communist socialist, you are used as bait to lure in

1857
02:42:11,620 --> 02:42:16,140
zombies because you are the number one enemy.

1858
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:22,100
Before you can be used as slave labor, you must submit to re-education camps, they actually

1859
02:42:22,100 --> 02:42:25,600
call them re-education camps.

1860
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:31,540
From the book, this was the National Re-Education Act, I'd say it was the largest jobs training

1861
02:42:31,540 --> 02:42:37,180
program since the Second World War and easily the most radical in our history.

1862
02:42:37,180 --> 02:42:43,480
This is a way to roll out authoritarianism and make it sexy and fun and condition the

1863
02:42:43,480 --> 02:42:47,540
public that this type of mass murder is okay.

1864
02:42:47,540 --> 02:42:53,000
This film talks about, man, my dad was smart, he loved Marxism.

1865
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:56,260
And now that we've got Marxism under the UN, it's so great.

1866
02:42:56,260 --> 02:43:00,860
Yeah, we put people in labor camps, yeah, we put them in re-education camps.

1867
02:43:00,860 --> 02:43:05,120
We used methods that were almost Marxist, the kind of collectivization that would make

1868
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:09,720
Anne Rand leap from her grave and join the ranks of the living dead.

1869
02:43:09,720 --> 02:43:15,700
I've always rejected the wisdom he tried to impart, running as far away as Wall Street

1870
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:16,980
to shut it out.

1871
02:43:16,980 --> 02:43:20,620
Now I'm racking my brain to remember it.

1872
02:43:20,620 --> 02:43:24,540
And if they didn't do what they were told they were killed, God, there's such a beauty

1873
02:43:24,540 --> 02:43:25,540
to that.

1874
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:30,140
Yeah, I guess if you're a dirtbag psychopath or somebody worth hundreds of millions of

1875
02:43:30,140 --> 02:43:35,220
dollars, like Brad Pitt, who's married to that angel of death, who's bragged she loves

1876
02:43:35,220 --> 02:43:36,580
death and evil.

1877
02:43:36,580 --> 02:43:42,940
Angelina Jolie, who travels the world to hype up NATO invasions and Al-Qaeda invasions of

1878
02:43:42,940 --> 02:43:47,060
free countries, where they line up blacks by the tens of thousands like Libya and kill

1879
02:43:47,060 --> 02:43:52,000
them, or where they attack Syria for 22 plus months and engage in all sorts of evil.

1880
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:56,140
And there she is saying, it's humanitarian, kill them, kill them, when she's not making

1881
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:59,620
an Illuminati Tomb Raider film.

1882
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:04,740
After all, they're all just Arab zombies, just like in this movie, trying to get over

1883
02:44:04,740 --> 02:44:07,140
the Israeli wall.

1884
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:12,060
Anyone that's infected with the virus, black vans come around and snatch and grab you and

1885
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:14,820
throw you in them to take you away and kill you.

1886
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:18,740
So it is pure conditioning for snatch and grab.

1887
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:26,260
It is pure operant conditioning and preparation to get the public ready for unbelievable evil.

1888
02:44:26,260 --> 02:44:32,020
And you're told you will serve the mega state, you will serve the greater collective of the

1889
02:44:32,020 --> 02:44:35,620
Supreme UN Soviet, or you will die.

1890
02:44:35,620 --> 02:44:41,380
Quoting the book World War Z, the Rebs on the other hand, armed organized political

1891
02:44:41,380 --> 02:44:46,280
secessionist, they were easily our most tangible danger.

1892
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:53,380
He would say in private, these must be eliminated swiftly, decisively and by any means necessary.

1893
02:44:53,380 --> 02:44:56,780
These were the enemies of our country, the domestic ones.

1894
02:44:56,780 --> 02:45:03,940
A floating UN command center off the coast of Hawaii consisting of 72 delegates controls

1895
02:45:03,940 --> 02:45:06,340
the fate of the world.

1896
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:12,220
Nations take to the problem, the UN's got the answers.

1897
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:17,300
I know I caught a lot of flack for going UN instead of making an all American crusade.

1898
02:45:17,300 --> 02:45:22,300
But to be totally honest, I really couldn't give a damn.

1899
02:45:22,300 --> 02:45:29,540
Throughout history, militaries and cultures have demonized their enemies and said that

1900
02:45:29,540 --> 02:45:30,980
they're not human.

1901
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:36,460
Now the whole of humanity is being taught that we're worthless, that we're garbage,

1902
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:37,460
that we're ugly.

1903
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:43,340
Part of the UN's agenda 21 is to teach us that humans are bad for the earth and that

1904
02:45:43,340 --> 02:45:49,500
the world would be a better place without us, that we are ugly parasites.

1905
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:54,820
I covered in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, where the elite openly

1906
02:45:54,820 --> 02:46:01,540
talk about how they're going to set up a police state surveillance control grid worldwide

1907
02:46:01,540 --> 02:46:10,220
to carry out the orderly extermination of 90% of the world's population, with the United

1908
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:15,500
Nations as the prime organizer and NATO as the physical enforcer.

1909
02:46:15,500 --> 02:46:22,620
And in all these documents, they talk about releasing or allowing the release of weaponized

1910
02:46:22,620 --> 02:46:29,420
mousepox and other pathogens, like airborne Ebola, that will take out more than 90% of

1911
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:32,500
the people that come in contact with it.

1912
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:37,880
And during an event like that, you're going to see civilization level collapse.

1913
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:43,500
And so the ruling class worldwide is setting up seed vaults, underground bunkers, putting

1914
02:46:43,500 --> 02:46:48,900
trillions of dollars in the aggregate of taxpayer money in Europe and the United States, Australia,

1915
02:46:48,900 --> 02:46:55,260
New Zealand, other Western countries into building incredibly resilient, heavily armed

1916
02:46:55,260 --> 02:46:58,860
underground shadow government systems.

1917
02:46:58,860 --> 02:47:04,300
And I said a decade ago, this zombie fascination was being pushed to dehumanize us and get

1918
02:47:04,300 --> 02:47:11,980
us ready with kind of a racial memory ahead of the fact, so that we will accept as prophecy

1919
02:47:11,980 --> 02:47:16,300
at a subconscious level, the mass culling of humanity.

1920
02:47:16,300 --> 02:47:23,820
Films like World War Z are meant to program people that they're lucky to serve as slaves

1921
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:30,100
of the UN and not be exterminated once these bioweapons are released.

1922
02:47:30,100 --> 02:47:36,980
And the zombie archetype is just a cover to demonize and dehumanize anyone who's even

1923
02:47:36,980 --> 02:47:44,460
suspected of being infected of bioweapons plagues the globalist are publicly preparing

1924
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:46,220
to release on the planet.

1925
02:47:46,220 --> 02:47:51,380
You see, for the new world order, world government is just the beginning.

1926
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:59,300
Once that panopticon surveillance control grid is in place, the mass extermination begins.

1927
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:02,940
Hollywood has more apocalyptic visions planned out for years to come.

1928
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:09,580
Steven Spielberg just started shooting robo-pocalypse, scheduled to be released in April of 2014.

1929
02:48:09,580 --> 02:48:13,980
Here a deadly supercomputer concludes that human beings are too much of a threat to life

1930
02:48:13,980 --> 02:48:14,980
on Earth.

1931
02:48:14,980 --> 02:48:20,100
In an attempt to save all non-human life on the planet, Arcos, the supercomputer, decides

1932
02:48:20,100 --> 02:48:25,180
to eliminate the human race with just a few human specimens to be left alive.

1933
02:48:25,180 --> 02:48:29,260
Sounds like the eugenicist programmed this computer.

1934
02:48:29,260 --> 02:48:34,180
This is how they introduce these sick ideas to the population through fiction.

1935
02:48:34,180 --> 02:48:36,900
It's the same thing that Hitler did.

1936
02:48:36,900 --> 02:48:38,680
It's the same thing the Soviets did.

1937
02:48:38,680 --> 02:48:41,160
It is beyond monstrous.

1938
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:46,180
This is undoubtedly a globalist propaganda production.

1939
02:48:46,180 --> 02:48:48,540
Oh, isn't that cute?

1940
02:48:48,540 --> 02:48:53,600
The Australian prime minister's tongue in cheek zombie apocalypse warning.

1941
02:48:53,600 --> 02:49:00,300
Right as the megabank signed the world and their peoples onto 1.5 quadrillion.

1942
02:49:00,300 --> 02:49:05,780
Right as they shut off the power plants and cut off the oil.

1943
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:07,140
Go look at it for yourself.

1944
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:15,820
The CDC and Homeland Security online describes people who get sick during a pandemic as zombies

1945
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:21,020
and they show the US army in America mowing down American citizens.

1946
02:49:21,020 --> 02:49:24,380
How would they ever introduce something like that to the public?

1947
02:49:24,380 --> 02:49:25,600
There'd be a revolt.

1948
02:49:25,600 --> 02:49:30,580
But if they do it like, hey, get ready for zombies, we're gonna have to mow some people

1949
02:49:30,580 --> 02:49:31,580
down.

1950
02:49:31,580 --> 02:49:37,580
You better get the vaccine, they say in here, or you're gonna get killed by the army.

1951
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:41,900
How would the government ever present the army and the police mowing people down the

1952
02:49:41,900 --> 02:49:42,900
street?

1953
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:48,700
Oh, they didn't get their flu shot, so they're zombies and they have to be killed.

1954
02:49:48,700 --> 02:49:55,020
And then meanwhile, we have all over the United States and in other nations, the military

1955
02:49:55,020 --> 02:50:00,600
training in martial law, civil unrest drills in major cities.

1956
02:50:00,600 --> 02:50:05,360
And the combatants that don't wanna give in to the UN takeover, why they're not even human,

1957
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:06,360
they're zombies.

1958
02:50:06,360 --> 02:50:11,720
So when the troops practice mowing down US citizens wearing football jerseys, well, they've

1959
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:17,320
got some makeup on, some green makeup and some slime, so they weren't really human.

1960
02:50:17,320 --> 02:50:21,260
So the next time the troops actually pull the trigger on real citizens during the engineered

1961
02:50:21,260 --> 02:50:24,260
collapse, well, they were zombies anyway.

1962
02:50:24,260 --> 02:50:29,380
They're teaching people that ancient thing that tyrants and corrupt militaries have done

1963
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:33,360
of dehumanizing their enemy before they kill them.

1964
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:38,880
The same thing was done by the Soviets in Poland and in Ukraine where they killed tens

1965
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:39,880
of millions.

1966
02:50:39,880 --> 02:50:41,720
They said these people are animals.

1967
02:50:41,720 --> 02:50:46,200
The Nazis said the Jews and others weren't human.

1968
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:49,060
The communist Chinese said the same thing about the shop owners.

1969
02:50:49,060 --> 02:50:53,760
They forcibly collectivized and put in slave labor camps.

1970
02:50:53,760 --> 02:51:00,240
You are a fool if you don't understand that the New World Order does not want you to be

1971
02:51:00,240 --> 02:51:01,460
in the future.

1972
02:51:01,460 --> 02:51:04,640
They want the planet's resources for themselves.

1973
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:10,260
They want the hard work and the scientific developments that free humanity has developed

1974
02:51:10,260 --> 02:51:12,100
to be their spoils.

1975
02:51:12,100 --> 02:51:15,220
They want you dead.

1976
02:51:15,220 --> 02:51:21,700
And people like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are nothing but propagandists selling the

1977
02:51:21,700 --> 02:51:26,740
population on mass genocide and megadeath.

1978
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:32,100
World War Z is a declaration of war against free humanity.

1979
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:33,720
I'm Alex Jones.

1980
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,300
You have been warned.

1981
02:51:35,300 --> 02:51:42,820
And if you are watching this transmission, remember you are the resistance.

1982
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:52,880
The secrets of World War Z, see the full video at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.

1983
02:51:52,880 --> 02:51:57,700
Right now at prisonplanet.tv production, and that's the type of special reports you see

1984
02:51:57,700 --> 02:52:03,160
every evening, 7 o'clock central at prisonplanet.tv or infowarsnews.com.

1985
02:52:03,160 --> 02:52:09,500
Time for plugging before I get to this Howard Stern clip today on this Friday edition.

1986
02:52:09,500 --> 02:52:15,300
If you go to infowarshop.com, you can get Strategic Relocation, the film, Strategic

1987
02:52:15,300 --> 02:52:21,260
Relocation, the book, both absolutely key, and a new t-shirt that's our best seller ever.

1988
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:25,460
It's already out selling a Liberty or Death shirt that was our previous best seller.

1989
02:52:25,460 --> 02:52:30,860
And it is an AK-47 with the right to keep mere arms shall not be infringed, the words

1990
02:52:30,860 --> 02:52:39,700
making up the AK-47 with a come and take it under it in the white star of Gonzales, Texas.

1991
02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:43,460
You say that in Latin, mona labe, or am I pronouncing that wrong?

1992
02:52:43,460 --> 02:52:48,700
I usually do, you can read it, but then if you've never pronounced it, come and take

1993
02:52:48,700 --> 02:52:49,700
it.

1994
02:52:49,700 --> 02:52:54,660
So the point is that is available at infowarsstore.com if you wanna go look at it.

1995
02:52:54,660 --> 02:52:57,480
Your purchase of the t-shirt supports the transmission.

1996
02:52:57,480 --> 02:53:03,600
We carry the pro-pure water filtration system that is excellent, that is stainless steel,

1997
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:07,780
and it blows the competition away side by side, and it has fluoride filters available

1998
02:53:07,780 --> 02:53:09,460
that are the best out there.

1999
02:53:09,460 --> 02:53:13,180
But also if you're on the road, or also if you want something that costs a little bit

2000
02:53:13,180 --> 02:53:19,100
less or you want handheld water bottles, I do the research for what my family uses, what

2001
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:20,400
we use.

2002
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:25,220
And we now have, for you on the road, water bottles that take the fluoride out and pitchers.

2003
02:53:25,220 --> 02:53:31,620
So you can just put tap water in them, goes to the pitcher, and then put it in the refrigerator.

2004
02:53:31,620 --> 02:53:39,860
So that is all available of the clearly filtered drink different system discounted at infowarsstore.com.

2005
02:53:39,860 --> 02:53:45,780
The new film agenda, the new come and take it ball caps, the new infowars.com Army Ranger

2006
02:53:45,780 --> 02:53:47,420
style caps.

2007
02:53:47,420 --> 02:53:51,820
It's all available at infowarsstore.com, and I haven't really been plugging it because

2008
02:53:51,820 --> 02:53:56,540
we sold out of almost all of the magazines, so I haven't been plugging it.

2009
02:53:56,540 --> 02:54:01,260
I'm told there's like 1,000 left if you want to get the January issue in bulk in groups

2010
02:54:01,260 --> 02:54:06,780
of 10 up to 100 at cost, you better order right now because by the end of the day, they

2011
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:07,780
will be gone.

2012
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:13,700
And then the only way to get the new January 2013, the year America dies issue of the magazine

2013
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:17,340
is to sign up for the subscription, which is great because that supports the broadcast.

2014
02:54:17,340 --> 02:54:21,540
And it's 59.95 for 12 issues, that includes the shipping, so more than half the cost of

2015
02:54:21,540 --> 02:54:22,540
that is the shipping.

2016
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:31,860
So help support print 2.0 and help get a big color magazine, let me show viewers.

2017
02:54:31,860 --> 02:54:36,900
You're a radio listener, you really should go and look at this, I mean, this is color

2018
02:54:36,900 --> 02:54:38,700
glossy magazine.

2019
02:54:38,700 --> 02:54:43,940
Our first was newsprint, and it's just got all the hard hitting articles with graphics

2020
02:54:43,940 --> 02:54:45,540
and everything else in it.

2021
02:54:45,540 --> 02:54:51,900
Thomas Jefferson quotes, just all of it, absolutely tailored to warn people about the facts, to

2022
02:54:51,900 --> 02:54:53,980
give them the facts for themselves.

2023
02:54:53,980 --> 02:54:58,820
This is a big 21st century version of the pamphleteers that the founders engaged in

2024
02:54:58,820 --> 02:55:01,820
to wake people up before 1776.

2025
02:55:01,820 --> 02:55:09,620
So it is essential, it's got artist profiles in there, it's got my breakdown of what we

2026
02:55:09,620 --> 02:55:11,360
face in the new year.

2027
02:55:11,360 --> 02:55:16,020
It's got the really important article 2013, the year America dies.

2028
02:55:16,020 --> 02:55:18,620
Globalists have conquered governments, now they wanna conquer the people, goes through

2029
02:55:18,620 --> 02:55:19,620
all the threats.

2030
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:29,620

day, we can take your calls, answer your questions or get your orders, 888-253-3139.

2032
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:38,580
The last month under the Second Amendment attack, you notice I'm doing about one tenth

2033
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:43,140
the on-air plugging I used to do, which all radio does, cuz that's part of financing operations,

2034
02:55:43,140 --> 02:55:44,140
especially news operation.

2035
02:55:44,140 --> 02:55:48,180
Cuz I've been so focused on the Second Amendment and defending it, I'm busy saying donate to

2036
02:55:48,180 --> 02:55:50,100
donors of America.

2037
02:55:50,100 --> 02:55:54,660
We're a major platform, we're the tip of the spear, go buy books and videos, buy t-shirts,

2038
02:55:54,660 --> 02:55:55,920
support our sponsors.

2039
02:55:55,920 --> 02:55:59,340
That's how you finance the show, that's how you get the word out, and support our local

2040
02:55:59,340 --> 02:56:01,340
AM and FM stations.

2041
02:56:01,340 --> 02:56:04,500
I don't know what to say about this, I'm not a big Howard Stern listener, just cuz I'm

2042
02:56:04,500 --> 02:56:08,320
not into fart noises and sex talk.

2043
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:12,900
But he is a smart, talented guy, I mean, sometimes I'd tune into it on XM and he's pretty well

2044
02:56:12,900 --> 02:56:17,360
informed on some political issues, but I don't like him on some others.

2045
02:56:17,360 --> 02:56:23,620
But he and Robin Quivers are pretty nice towards me, they play something they think is entertaining.

2046
02:56:23,620 --> 02:56:28,300
But Robin agrees with the Second Amendment here that they just want our guns to enslave

2047
02:56:28,300 --> 02:56:29,940
us, pretty amazing.

2048
02:56:29,940 --> 02:56:34,440
And of course, Howard acts like he doesn't know who I am, I mean, like six years ago

2049
02:56:34,440 --> 02:56:37,200
they wanted me on the show.

2050
02:56:37,200 --> 02:56:41,500
What they said now, but you do man cow, one of his producers, and we're kind of like at

2051
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:42,500
loggerheads.

2052
02:56:42,500 --> 02:56:45,580
And I said, look, I just get the word out, I'm not a minion of man cow, I'm not a minion

2053
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:46,580
of anybody.

2054
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:50,040
I'm just here to get to one venue is the same as another.

2055
02:56:50,040 --> 02:56:53,540
So Howard's like, I think his name's Alex Jones, the radio host, Howard Stern knows

2056
02:56:53,540 --> 02:56:55,020
full well who I am, here's the clip.

2057
02:56:55,020 --> 02:56:58,420
I know Piers Morgan is getting the s*** beaten out of him for being on CNN and not getting

2058
02:56:58,420 --> 02:57:02,080
any ratings, but I thought he did a good show last night.

2059
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:06,140
He invited a guy on who wants to deport him from the, remember there was a report that

2060
02:57:06,140 --> 02:57:13,440
Piers came up again, he came out against like gun bonds, he doesn't think that, he wants

2061
02:57:13,440 --> 02:57:16,080
more gun control basically.

2062
02:57:16,080 --> 02:57:19,780
So he invited the guy on who said they should throw Piers, we're starting a petition to

2063
02:57:19,780 --> 02:57:22,100
throw Piers Morgan out of the country.

2064
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:28,680
So he had the guy on and the guy was just like f***ing crazy, I mean like, I like this

2065
02:57:28,680 --> 02:57:29,680
kind of stuff.

2066
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:36,080
He was like a real American, listen to this, kind of crazy, well listen, this guy just

2067
02:57:36,080 --> 02:57:39,160
should, this goes for a while but it's good, well listen to it.

2068
02:57:39,160 --> 02:57:43,640
Those men raped that woman in India to death with an iron rod four feet long, you can't

2069
02:57:43,640 --> 02:57:49,480
ban the iron rods, the guns, the iron rods, Piers didn't do it, the tyrants did it, Hitler

2070
02:57:49,480 --> 02:57:54,560
took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mao took the guns, Fidel Castro took the guns, Hugo

2071
02:57:54,560 --> 02:57:59,980
Chavez took the guns, and I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to

2072
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:04,080
take our firearms, doesn't matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street begging

2073
02:58:04,080 --> 02:58:08,520
for them to have their guns taken, we will not relinquish them, do you understand?

2074
02:58:08,520 --> 02:58:09,520
London Telegraph.

2075
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:10,520
Here, let me give you more.

2076
02:58:10,520 --> 02:58:11,520
It's a simple question.

2077
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:12,520
Well, that's the oldest.

2078
02:58:12,520 --> 02:58:13,520
It's very loud, man.

2079
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:17,200
No, no, that's the oldest Perry Mason tactic to ask me some little fat toy.

2080
02:58:17,200 --> 02:58:19,200
Pretty good, right?

2081
02:58:19,200 --> 02:58:22,400
Actually, I'm with the guy who's arguing with Piers.

2082
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:27,520
Yeah, you're against any kind of gun control.

2083
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:28,520
I like that guy.

2084
02:58:28,520 --> 02:58:29,520
That is the best.

2085
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:30,520
Yeah.

2086
02:58:30,520 --> 02:58:31,520
We're going to be back with the rest.

2087
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:36,920
Yeah, back it up, we're going to be back with the rest, and I'll be back Sunday, 4 to 6

2088
02:58:36,920 --> 02:58:39,920

2091
02:58:51,240 --> 02:58:56,240
Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters

2092
02:58:56,240 --> 02:59:00,800
like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

2093
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:02,660
by a disastrous economy?

2094
02:59:02,660 --> 02:59:05,360
Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.

2095
02:59:05,360 --> 02:59:09,540
At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's

2096
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:12,080
storm by having a supply of food on hand.

2097
02:59:12,080 --> 02:59:16,640
After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores

2098
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:21,440
are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister

2099
02:59:21,440 --> 02:59:22,440
and niece.

2100
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:26,240
It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

2101
02:59:26,240 --> 02:59:28,480
I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.

2109
03:00:04,680 --> 03:00:10,760
We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.

2110
03:00:10,760 --> 03:00:13,480
You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

2111
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:21,280
All right, finishing up here, if you just joined us on this Friday edition, Howard Stern

2112
03:00:21,280 --> 03:00:25,780
playing clips to me from, the reason I'm playing it, it's just interesting that he's not going

2113
03:00:25,780 --> 03:00:30,800
with the establishment grain and saying that he likes what I'm doing and that Robin agrees

2114
03:00:30,800 --> 03:00:31,800
with the Second Amendment.

2115
03:00:31,800 --> 03:00:36,180
I mean, we should get angry at some foreign usurper who, by the way, has got dead ratings

2116
03:00:36,180 --> 03:00:39,480
until I came on there and they're already going back down again since I'm not on there.

2117
03:00:39,480 --> 03:00:44,760
And he says he wants to debate again, but I've called his producers and they've not

2118
03:00:44,760 --> 03:00:45,760
called me back.

2119
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:49,600
So he, by the way, had a protest or a Freudian slip.

2120
03:00:49,600 --> 03:00:54,260
He had a rally for him yesterday that four people showed up and he tweeted it out as

2121
03:00:54,260 --> 03:00:56,160
a big victory for him.

2122
03:00:56,160 --> 03:00:57,160
Unbelievable.

2123
03:00:57,160 --> 03:01:01,240
Let's go ahead and go back to the Howard Stern clip.

2124
03:01:01,240 --> 03:01:03,240
Pretty good, right?

2125
03:01:03,240 --> 03:01:06,200
Actually, I'm with the guy who's arguing with.

2126
03:01:06,200 --> 03:01:11,400
Yeah, you're against any kind of gun control.

2127
03:01:11,400 --> 03:01:12,400
I like that guy.

2128
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:13,400
That is the best.

2129
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:14,400
Yeah.

2130
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:18,760
Well, he's some sort of, I think he even has a radio show, the guy, you know, he seems

2131
03:01:18,760 --> 03:01:24,120
to have some facts and stuff, you know, but it's just funny when guys are yelling at Piers.

2132
03:01:24,120 --> 03:01:25,120
Piers is calm.

2133
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:26,120
And the guy is screaming.

2134
03:01:26,120 --> 03:01:27,120
Yeah.

2135
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:28,120
This is some other clips that are pretty good.

2136
03:01:28,120 --> 03:01:29,120
Let's try again.

2137
03:01:29,120 --> 03:01:34,520
How many gun lovers were there in Britain last year?

2138
03:01:34,520 --> 03:01:37,880
How many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin?

2139
03:01:37,880 --> 03:01:39,760
Hey, this guy's good.

2140
03:01:39,760 --> 03:01:40,760
I love it.

2141
03:01:40,760 --> 03:01:42,840
I don't know if Piers was good, but this guy was good.

2142
03:01:42,840 --> 03:01:45,600
No, that guy's great.

2143
03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:46,600
Good show Piers.

2144
03:01:46,600 --> 03:01:50,240
You know, Piers gets a lot of s***, you know, and I told you I like Piers.

2145
03:01:50,240 --> 03:01:52,480
Well, he better thank that guy.

2146
03:01:52,480 --> 03:01:54,280
They better be on together every night.

2147
03:01:54,280 --> 03:01:55,760
They should bring that guy back.

2148
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:56,760
Whatever.

2149
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:59,320
His name is Alex Jones.

2150
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:00,320
Okay.

2151
03:02:00,320 --> 03:02:03,360
Hey, you did start talking to Piers in a British accent.

2152
03:02:03,360 --> 03:02:06,200
Did you want to hear that?

2153
03:02:06,200 --> 03:02:07,200
Yeah.

2154
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,200
Okay.

2155
03:02:08,200 --> 03:02:09,200
And then it goes on from there.

2156
03:02:09,200 --> 03:02:10,200
Yeah.

2157
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:14,280
I mean, I knew that, that, that if he got in my face, I was going to get in his face,

2158
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:15,280
but I did plan.

2159
03:02:15,280 --> 03:02:17,120
I told Rob Dew was with me.

2160
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:18,640
I said, he goes, are you going to blow up on him?

2161
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:21,880
I said, no, I'll debate him on facts if he lets me get to my facts.

2162
03:02:21,880 --> 03:02:26,600
But I would say, okay, our crime rate's down over 20% violent crime.

2163
03:02:26,600 --> 03:02:29,200
By the way, I was, that was general violent crime.

2164
03:02:29,200 --> 03:02:32,240
I was watching Fox News this morning and I'm going to go dig this out because they were

2165
03:02:32,240 --> 03:02:34,160
showing fbi.gov the same place I go.

2166
03:02:34,160 --> 03:02:37,560
The problem is there's literally hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of pages on

2167
03:02:37,560 --> 03:02:38,560
there.

2168
03:02:38,560 --> 03:02:42,680
They've got all the local towns, cities, all the reports, all of it, and it's good government

2169
03:02:42,680 --> 03:02:46,600
numbers because it's locally gathered.

2170
03:02:46,600 --> 03:02:51,080
And I'm watching this morning, I bet a lot of you saw, we got to find that clip and put

2171
03:02:51,080 --> 03:02:55,160
it on YouTube because it's amazing.

2172
03:02:55,160 --> 03:02:58,600
And they've got Stromboli on there.

2173
03:02:58,600 --> 03:03:01,160
What's his real name, Rolando Herrera.

2174
03:03:01,160 --> 03:03:02,800
And he's thinking, let's just ban the guns, whatever.

2175
03:03:02,800 --> 03:03:08,160
And they're going, but look at these FBI numbers, gun crimes down 59%.

2176
03:03:08,160 --> 03:03:13,160
And they showed the years and I'm sitting there and it was the same FBI site, but I

2177
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:14,640
hadn't dug into all of it.

2178
03:03:14,640 --> 03:03:18,800
I'm like, my gosh, I've done it again.

2179
03:03:18,800 --> 03:03:22,440
It's so incredible what the revolution of guns taking over has done.

2180
03:03:22,440 --> 03:03:24,840
I mean, it is incredible.

2181
03:03:24,840 --> 03:03:29,720
That's why they're panicking because if we all get guns and crime rates go down to nothing,

2182
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:31,600
then their whole gun grab plan is over.

2183
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:33,760
That's why they're trying to get it all right now.

2184
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:38,960
So I got to find that, remind me right when the show ends, I've got to go dig that up

2185
03:03:38,960 --> 03:03:42,040
because they were showing it and I'm like, well, I said 20 something percent.

2186
03:03:42,040 --> 03:03:50,240
59 on the guns, 59% drop, unbelievable.

2187
03:03:50,240 --> 03:03:53,240
Let's play that clip again of Conan O'Brien implying I'm going to shoot everybody, putting

2188
03:03:53,240 --> 03:03:55,760
an animated gun in my hand.

2189
03:03:55,760 --> 03:03:59,960
Everyone is talking today about Piers Morgan's interview last night with radio talk show

2190
03:03:59,960 --> 03:04:03,040
host and conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones.

2191
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:08,240
He's the guy who started a petition to get Piers deported from America.

2192
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:10,760
Now the two men debated gun control.

2193
03:04:10,760 --> 03:04:16,080
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but I think Alex was the one who took the pro gun position

2194
03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:17,080
tonight.

2195
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:22,040
I'll go head to head with a man who actually wants to deport me.

2196
03:04:22,040 --> 03:04:27,480
And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take off firearms, we

2197
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:28,480
will not relinquish this.

2198
03:04:28,480 --> 03:04:29,480
Do you understand?

2199
03:04:29,480 --> 03:04:30,480
Stalin took the guns.

2200
03:04:30,480 --> 03:04:45,840
By the way, I'm going from memory here watching Fox News this morning and it's either 49 or

2201
03:04:45,840 --> 03:04:46,840
59.

2202
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:48,720
The point is, is it's not 27%.

2203
03:04:48,720 --> 03:04:49,720
That's a violent crime.

2204
03:04:49,720 --> 03:04:52,080
The gun crime, it's either 49 or 59.

2205
03:04:52,080 --> 03:04:53,240
We got to do a story on this.

2206
03:04:53,240 --> 03:04:55,240
I mean, this is incredible.

2207
03:04:55,240 --> 03:04:58,840
They were showing the FBI website areas I hadn't found.

2208
03:04:58,840 --> 03:05:00,640
We got to dig that up.
