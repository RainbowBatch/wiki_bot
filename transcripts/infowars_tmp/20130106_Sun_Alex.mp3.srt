1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We've got it

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,480
Waging war on corruption

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,400
It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,440
Every progressive show

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,920
As we progress into the future

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,700
Each passing broadcast is just getting more and more hardcore more and more jam-packed with absolutely off-the-charts

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,240
news and information

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,680
It is fortunate that you tuned in to this Sunday the sixth day of

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,520
January

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,180
2013 broadcast because it's going to be a very important transmission to say the least coming up in 30 minutes a police chief Mark

11
00:00:55,180 --> 00:01:02,220
Kessler is going to be joining us with state level nullification at the town council level

12
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,800
In Pennsylvania, they are moving to get a law passed to mobilize their town

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,100
against the globalist and violations of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and the Declaration of Independence gives them that power and

14
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,100
He is coming on the show. We found out he's a

15
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,620
Listener as well. That's good

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,580
It's good to know that there's a fellow Liberty Lovers out there across the nation in the world

17
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,580
And that's what my plan and Ron Paul's plan as well has been nullification

18
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,260
at the county city state level

19
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,240
Nullification short of secession, but if we have secession it's not from the United States. It's to have the states pull out of the federally

20
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,660
Occupied New World Order system and to re-upload the Republic and people are hearing that message

21
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,940
There's a bunch of states moving in that direction a lot of towns and counties and cities on different fronts and here's the deal

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,460
If 800 plus cities and more than 30 states

23
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,660
Do not arrest illegal aliens for having no insurance being drunk being here illegally

24
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,100
They're above the law because the police can't arrest them for other crimes

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,220
They don't arrest them basically for anything except aggravated assault

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,180
And then they're not even deported once they get out of prison and you can obviously see that in the news everywhere

27
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,620
That's an admitted fact. I'm not picking on the illegal aliens here

28
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,420
It's that it's a fraud that they're above the law because the system wants an incentive to have them here to drive down wages

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,780
Want to know why America is losing a standard of living. That's a big part of it prison labors displacing us

30
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:39,960
Obviously dollar devaluation too high a taxes make it prohibitive for companies to manufacture and develop things

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
in R&D here in this country

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,340
But my issue is if 800 last time I was like eight hundred and eighty something

33
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,860
It's almost nine hundred cities and towns every big city in the country

34
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,860
almost every small

35
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,180
city and many of the towns

36
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,940
medium sized cities you name it are sanctuary cities and

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,260
If

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,240
The cities and counties are getting away and the states are getting away with ignoring

39
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,640
constitutional federal law

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
They're getting away with crime

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,760
We can get away with something as constitutional

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,880
You know the feds are like oh, no you can't have nullification

43
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Civil war decided that there's no such thing as the states or counties or cities baloney, and it's all about our will

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,220
We control our local towns and cities we get people in there that say you know what?

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,260
We're not gonna enforce unconstitutional gun laws we catch the money in the commission of a crime of the legal gun

46
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
We'll throw the book at them, but we're not gonna pull over

47
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,500
Farmers and find a shotgun in the vehicle and take them to jail it isn't happening

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,620
Okay, it's real simple, so we're gonna be talking about that today

49
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,780
That's not even the top story

50
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,920
But it's very important because it ties in a lot of other ways we can resist this globalist takeover by realizing

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
We do have power and we can say no

52
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,080
there were federal law saying black people weren't human, but the Constitution and the Bill of Rights said they were and

53
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,240
So it took a hundred years, but down the road or a little less than a hundred down the road

54
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,920
Those rights were claimed those rights are there not given by the Bill of Rights and Constitution

55
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,760
Pointed out by it. They're simply signposts like there's Mount Rainier in Washington State

56
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,920
The sign doesn't make Mount Rainier it points at it the Constitution Bill of Rights points at what is already there now

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,280
Here's the deal Washington Post talked to the White House. They're talking about executive orders

58
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,880
And they're talking about extrajudicial activity to shut down the Second Amendment

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,600
Right here where I live the city's moving to just outlaw gun shows period that's deep in the heart of Texas

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,240
We've got a bunch of other really important news as well

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,000
They're talking about repealing the 22nd amendment. So Obama can be president for life. Basically stay with us

62
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:06,280
sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,400
Pro-pure my friends. I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar

64
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,920
None is pro pure and it's available discounted at info wars calm

65

It's filters are silver impregnated to prevent bacterial growth. There's no priming required. It's NSF 42 certified

66
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,800
Optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95% easy to set up and use doesn't require electricity

67
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,840
Purify water from lakes streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,460
Which is key save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic

69
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:48,340
Pro pure is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses info wars calm already has the lowest price on prop here

82
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,360
Okay, let me just mention what's coming up. It's the fullest plate. I've ever had on the Sunday broadcast and and next week

83
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Maybe even more full and more full

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,380
I mean the amount of tyranny we're seeing in a week is more than I would see in a in in a year

85
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,080
15 years ago 16 17 years ago on air

86
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,800
just simply

87
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Amazing to see all of this happening

88
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,280
Here is some of the news the 22nd

89
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:40,640
Amendment HJ res 15 has been introduced to overturn that so Obama could run for a third term

90
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,760
And I went and did a check a bunch of Democratic Party sites like daily costs and others are fantasizing about

91
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,260
Obama for life kind of like Hugo Chavez who by the way they say if they unplug him

92
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,480
He won't be coming back from Cuba

93
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,300
So we're gonna be looking at that also Assad of Syria not a fan of the guy

94
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,780
Definitely a dictator, but a soft dictator

95
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,900
He gave a speech obviously

96
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,020
today and

97
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,960
Said look al-qaeda is being funded by the West to attack Syria. We will fight to the death and it's true

98
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,380
I mean

99
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:23,260
It's a New York Times you name it that our government is putting al-qaeda in there to attack a country where Jews Christians and all

100
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,060
Muslim groups live in peace

101
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,480
His father was somewhat of a brutal dictator in the Hazi Mubarak stripe, which they call light

102
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,840
So he's a light light dictator, but al-qaeda is just unbelievable

103
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:41,680
We posted a video up at info wars calm that I'll play later in the broadcast in the second hour of the main brigades

104
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
on the suburbs of

105
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,920
Damascus the capital of Syria chanting we blew up the towers. We're coming to kill you America after we're done here and

106
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
It's it's even on Arab television stations

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,480
It's just unbelievable that and by the way a year ago when they killed Gaddafi

108
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,340
They had signs on BBC saying next stop Damascus. We're coming to Syria

109
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:14,360
So our government NATO and others the French are leading it. Normally they're anti-war. They're just leading this thing

110
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
The French are at the head of this

111
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Well, I've already talked about it a lot. I'm gonna talk about in the second hour

112
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,680
It's just incredible that we were talking about it two years ago with Libya when that started

113
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,360
Almost two years ago in Syria when it started and now it's like yeah. Okay, our government runs al-qaeda. Never mind that

114
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,400
And people send me emails going. Well, at least we got Arabs killing Arabs. You know, this is crazy

115
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Assad hasn't attacked anybody

116
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Assad wears a suit and tie

117
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Women can walk down the street and go to college there and nobody's wearing burkas. That's all ending al-qaeda is chopping

118
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,520
Christians heads off just type in just type in Syrian rebels chop Christians heads off

119
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:59,600
Stabbing them making father's truck bomber. They kill their whole families and our media has actually run articles saying

120
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,280
Oh, look at the rebels doing a great job

121
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:08,040
And then there's a backlash in the New York Times pulled a video a few months ago showing this our media thinks we're so

122
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,240
dumbed down they can show al-qaeda chopping a Christian's head off or throwing them off a church top or

123
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,360
Making them a car bomb or they kill their family and our media is so evil

124
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,200
They're like, oh look at the rebels. They're so wonderful

125
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,620
I mean, this is so Twilight Zone. I can't even register it. Okay, and I expect corrupt stuff out of government. I

126
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,120
Mean, I expect all sorts of this

127
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,200
I don't even know what to say at this point because now it's admitted and it's a back-of-the-paper issue

128
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,200
So that's coming up some of the second hour, okay

129
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,880
Hold on to your hats here ladies and gentlemen, because I told you this was coming there is an incredible

130
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,080
incredible Washington Post article posted up at info Awards calm

131
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:58,160
It's also on the easiest place to find it drug report calm on the left-hand side at least 20 minutes ago

132
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,440
Had it and here is the Washington Post

133
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,320
article White House ways broad gun control agenda in wake of Newtown shootings and

134
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,160
They say in here. We're just gonna have the ATF

135
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,600
Go in and and extra judicially with rulemaking exactly what Larry Pratt of Gunners of America has warned about here in the last month

136
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,160
We're just gonna go in and do it outside of law

137
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,760
Maybe even executive orders and yeah

138
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,440
We're just gonna ban gun shows and ban you giving your son or daughter a gun no more

139
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,800
Giving family a gun or transferring a gun and we're just gonna put giant

140
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,560
You know regulatory taxes outside of Congress on the bullets and it links to all the plans and it's a long

141
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,480
Four-page article with links. I spent two hours on this sucker last night two hours

142
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,760
I was up till about 1 a.m.. On this okay following what they're all saying. It's exactly what we knew it's all their old plans

143
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
regurgitated vomited onto us at once

144
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,040
And it is the repeal the Second Amendment that the Huffington Post the Atlantic wire

145
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,520
The economist and then the Chinese government the Russian government all these governments even USA today said what's with all the foreign?

146
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,660
Governments it's bad enough to have Piers Morgan over here lecturing us a redcoat by the way

147
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,600
I'm on his show tomorrow night in person in New York. I thought it'd be fun

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,680
But to make a long story short ladies and gentlemen Mike Adams is sitting in tomorrow

149
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,880
He'll sure do a better job than I do. I'm a fan of that guy

150
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,000
But continuing here. It is just off the chart insane. We'll be getting into that

151
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,680
We have a video clip and I remember seeing him say this everywhere, and we even found the text of it

152
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,000
I couldn't find the video

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,520
CNS news found it and the videos up at info Wars calm right now

154
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:46,600
And Obama says look I'm not coming after your handguns your rifles nothing anybody says it. They're a liar. He said that four years ago

155
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,700
And I warned people I said now in this campaign because the fix is in I said he's saying he's coming after handguns and rifles

156
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,260
They're coming after everything the Illinois bill that we barely beat

157
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,440
Last week

158
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,840
Openly made you turn in everything turn it in and everybody's registered there under the void card

159
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,040
That's why you don't want to be registered isn't they always confiscate go through the quote background check

160
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,360
They know you're a gun owner, but it's not registered when you waive your rights

161
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,520
And they said that you know everything's turned in including pump shotguns

162
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,080
Pump rifles people go their pump rifles. Yeah, a lot of pump rifles a lot of good ones out there actually the point is

163
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,920
If you want something reliable, they're actually pretty good some of them the point is is that it banned everything

164
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Except sim except bolt-action way beyond just semi-auto, so it's all here. It's all happening

165
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,560
We know what they want. We know what they're doing. We know what they're after and and by the way

166
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,720
I'm gonna go over some statistics here on air when we come back

167
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:51,880
From the Centers for Disease Control FBI and US federal government with links to it at info Wars calm

168
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,040
America's biggest killers the chart anti-gunners don't want you to see and

169
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,800
And by the way guns are at the end of the list

170
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,940
With eleven thousand four hundred and ninety-three killed in fiscal year

171
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
2011 you always get the numbers a year late and

172
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,600
There you go

173
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,520
But I'm gonna go over all those numbers here on air by the way an estimated seventy two percent of those were gang related

174
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,120
gang members killing each other so take seventy plus percent out of eleven thousand five hundred roughly and

175
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,240
We're now talking about three thousand five hundred or so

176
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,500
Maybe four thousand real deaths from guns folks. There's three hundred and fifteen million people here

177
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,080
Let me just give you one number, and this is a conservative number by the way

178
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,640
Guess how many people die from tobacco use five hundred twenty nine thousand medical errors

179
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,240
195,000 bad drug interactions goes on and on all right see I'm already starting to go to it

180
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,760
We're gonna cover that after the break after we get into these audio clips of Obama's saying

181
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Listen listen when you go home and your friends tell you that I'm coming after their guns

182
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,980
I'm not gonna take anything you got a Second Amendment. I believe in it

183
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:10,160
We're leaving your guns alone, and the Democrats is very telling are yay cuz most Democrats are gun owners

184
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Almost everybody's a gun owner now every liberal

185
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,240
I know in the last decade has figured out government can't won't protect you watching Katrina and Sandy

186
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,000
And all these other events and and once you go out and shoot again

187
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,640
You're like this is no big deal running a blender at your house. You have to hold it down is more dangerous

188
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,440
Running a egg beater is you know it takes more force. I mean guns are a piece of cake and

189
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
once you try one

190
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,480
once you go to a gun you never go back I

191
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,480
Mean it's that simple, and it's not that weird on power trips. We have guns. It's that we're in charge

192
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,600
We feel empowered I sleep so good no

Coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network

243
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,900
Crashing through the lies and disinformation

244
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,500
It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

245
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,900
to quote Thomas Jefferson

246
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,560
The great thing about the Second Amendment is you will only need it when they try to take it away

247
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,820
That is a Thomas Jefferson quote similar quotes by other founders

248
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:40,180
You know my family fought for the Second Amendment to be created in the Revolutionary War and my family fought

249
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,520
When Santa Anna tried to disarm the people?

250
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:50,020
at Gonzales and then on into the other battles on both sides and my family were involved in the founding of Texas and

251
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,660
I'm not turning my guns in

252
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:57,940
Because it's a symbol and we know what it means while the government buys another

253
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,100
200,000 hollow point bullets for the American people on top of the 1.6 billion. They already bought in the last 14 months

254
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,500
We're gonna be going to that report here today government is arming against us and then telling us turn your guns in because we want

255
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,380
To take good care of you

256
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:14,860
No

257
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,260
They want to be able to do to us whatever they want just like in Mexico

258
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:24,300
Where they have taken all the guns from the citizens 50-something years ago, and they have the highest crime rate in the world

259
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:31,740
For a nation the only city that's higher than one of their cities is Chicago where they have a gun ban

260
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,980
Again where the criminals run free in government and on the streets

261
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,860
Right now I want to go to a clip here

262
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,580
And I hope you were listening earlier

263
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:51,260
The Washington Post has come out and said that they've talked to the White House and that indeed they're going to use executive power

264
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,980
outside of Congress

265
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:01,980
To basically shut down gun shows tell shops not to sell semianos and and and just prosecute people

266
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,780
Outside of law just have the ATF plan. They have a rule if you transfer guns and things. It's it's a laundry list four-page article

267
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,660
White House ways broad gun control agenda in wake of Newtown shootings very chilling

268
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,940
But I wanted to play the liar-in-chief

269
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,620
Obama this is four and a half years ago

270
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,700
CNF news found this I remember him saying this over and over again that I'm not coming after your second minute

271
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,460
But we have a Biden saying the same thing

272
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,740
But here's Obama saying I'm not coming after your handgun your rifle none of your guns and now that he's not facing a reelection

273
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,820
He's like yeah, I'm gonna take everything here

274
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,440
It is when y'all go home, and you're talking to your buddies, and they say he wants to take my gun away

275
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,100
You've heard it here, I'm on television so everybody knows it I

276
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
Believe in the Second Amendment I

277
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,780
Believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away I

278
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,100
Won't take your hand gun away, and I will not hire any lobbyists broke all records

279
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,660
I will not sign executive orders to circumvent law

280
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,500
More executive orders and all predators before him from George W. Bush back to George, Washington

281
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,900
I will not have signing statements breaking all the records

282
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:27,300
But he's got a peace prize so he can put al-qaeda in the countries to chop Christians heads off. I mean it is just amazing

283
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Amazing

284
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:35,140
Let's go to Joe Biden during the same 2008 campaign saying the same

285
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:40,780
Thing here is Joe Biden talking about his Beretta handgun after he talks about a shotgun

286
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,300
Which is semi-auto which they would ban here it is I?

287
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,780
Guarantee Barack Obama ain't taking my shotguns, so don't buy that malarkey

288
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,460
Don't buy that Malarkey. They're gonna. They're gonna start peddling that to you. I got two of he tries to fool my Beretta

289
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,500
He's got a problem. I like that a little over-and-under. You know. I'm not bad with it

290
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,500
And he's talking about a very shotgun there the point is is that

291
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,700
There is Biden saying they're not coming after your guns

292
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:17,140
When he wrote the original assault weapons bill in 92 that they had to water down and we have Feinstein

293
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,620
We'll play it later

294
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,100
We played it last week and throughout the week saying mr.. Mrs.. America get ready to turn in your guns

295
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,500
and

296
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,180
his original bill banned all semi-autos period show

297
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
decades later or 15 years later

298
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,900
He's running around saying. Oh, I don't want your guns lying to people

299
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,740
And look some folks say oh Alex as I saw in the comments on info wars calm and prison plan calm

300
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,460
Okay, they all lie big deal see they just got you used to it now

301
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,700
no, whenever George Herbert Walker Bush lied and said read my lips no new taxes and

302
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:00,460
Then raise taxes. It was over and then of course. We just got something just as bad Bill Clinton William

303
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:06,780
Jefferson Clinton who I used to think was the greatest liar I'd ever known Obama definitely is better and tells more whoppers

304
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,540
But the issue is is that Obama has raised 14 taxes on the general public

305
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,980
You can just type in its USA today. It's Bloomberg

306
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
77% of Americans

307
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
That's working Americans

308
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,620
77 percent of the country everybody who works got a payroll tax increase

309
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,260
If you make thirty six thousand dollars a year on average. It's about two hundred dollars a month

310
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,700
$200 a month and and

311
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,340
that's just one tax we're talking about so and

312
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,300
Then there's another 13

313
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,140
Taxes on top of it and fines and fees and all the rest of it and then all those other taxes on people making over

314
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:54,180
125 thousand dollars a year individually quarter million collectively that all gets passed on to you when you get laid off or

315
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,260
Middle class folks don't come in by goods now there

316
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:04,700
It is fiscal cliff deal raise taxes on seventy seven percent of Americans tax policy center and analysis and now that's official

317
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,820
Okay, let's go ahead. That's now law. Let's go ahead and go to the clip of Obama saying. I won't raise your

318
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:17,420
Raise your any of your taxes not your payroll tax not your on on raising them all

319
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,020
Raising everything he said he wouldn't raise

320
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:27,620
In fact they've had Howard Dean come out and say if you make ten thousand dollars a year. You should pay taxes extra taxes

321
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,100
About two weeks ago. He's looking up Howard Dean says poor should pay more

322
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:38,220
Oh, yeah, because you want to get the economy going no you know that high taxes shut down economies

323
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:44,340
You know Kennedy cut the highest tax bracket by 50% the next tax bracket by 30 plus percent and tax receipts

324
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,340
Did what by the next year?

325
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:52,220
Did they go up 20% did they go up 30% 50 60 70 80 90 they went up over?

326
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,380
100%

327
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:00,020
More than double the tax receipts you'd think bureaucrats would want money. No they don't want money

328
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,460
They want to bankrupt your butt and get you on welfare. We've gone

329
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,500
from less than 2% of the country on food stamps in the 30s to

330
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,740
Now 50 million people it's doubled the last four years from 25 million

331
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:19,900
And they're set to double it again the name of the game is takeover. They don't want you uppity having any money

332
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:28,280
Let's go to this clip of Obama saying he wouldn't raise any of your taxes any of your payroll taxes here it is

333
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:33,740
And I can make a firm pledge a pledge under my plan no family

334
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
making less than

335
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:44,120
$250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase not your income tax not your payroll tax

336
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,160
Not your capital gains taxes not any of your taxes

337
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,880
by the way they have in the in the now law a

338
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
surcharge of what is it three point nine

339
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:01,560
Percent on all your 401k investments you've already paid taxes on this over and over again now

340
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:06,800
it's an investment for your retirement or for college whatever for your children, and they're going to tax that and

341
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,280
just I don't know how bad this has got to get here and

342
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,840
And and used to people get mad about this, but and a lot of folks are angry

343
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,880
I mean Congress does have a 9% approval rating

344
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,560
But I got to tell you the 35 40 percent of people in this country that really are Obama supporters

345
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,760
Is about half the people in the country voted and a little more than half voted for Obama?

346
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,360
The 25 30 percent 35 depending on how you look at it because he's got 30 million legal aliens supporting

347
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
So that's about 35 percent total

348
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,680
Are you people are just idiots?

349
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:44,280
I mean you're chumps this guy's a collectivist that wants to bankrupt everything and put America through emergency

350
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,080
Reorganization to make you step and fetch it they want to break your will

402
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,040

403

I am gonna get on an airplane

404
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Early in the morning. I'm gonna get on an airplane

405
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:56,000
Early in the morning, and I'm gonna fly up to New York to be in studio with Piers Morgan

406
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And they've got a bunch of surprises lined up for me

407
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,720
Alan Dershowitz and a bunch of others to sit there and

408
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,000
in Peck at me

409
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,600
But they would do it via satellite and and we were gonna do it be a satellite

410
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,520
And but I thought you know what I want to look that guy in the eyes

411
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,160
And so we'll see if they chicken out boy. They they swore to me. They won't

412
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:22,240
I've had CNN check it out before via satellite interviews, and I'll get really really upset if they do, but

413
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,400
That political rumble in the jungle is set for tomorrow night

414
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,440
9 o'clock central 8 o'clock Eastern in studio at the CNN command center that I've been in multiple times

415
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
So that should be interesting

416
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:43,000
Speaking of that let me just go ahead and play a clip again of Dianne Feinstein who's bill obama says he's gonna put his quote full

417
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,140
weight my

418
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:49,760
That's a quote to her last bill. She didn't have the votes for now. She has them

419
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,720
She says to make you mr.. And mrs. America turn your guns in here's that clip

420
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,920
California senator Dianne Feinstein worked for more than a year to get the assault weapons bill passed in the face of ferocious

421
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
opposition from the National Rifle Association

422
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,640
She says she got the best she could if I could have gotten

423
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,040
51 votes in the second round of the national rifle association

424
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,240
votes in the Senate of the United States for an

425
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,920
Outright ban picking up every one of them mr. And mrs. America turn them all in

426
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,680
I would have done it. I could not do that the votes weren't here

427
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,240
But that was over a decade ago now her bill says that

428
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,740
Because well a decade ago the American people wouldn't put up with the UN and NATO commanding our military

429
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:47,260
They wouldn't put up with the NSA spying on the American people without warrants and admitting. It's going after conservative libertarian and

430
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:52,620
Constitutional groups see the whole homeland system is now for us. They admit it I

431
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,060
Want to play another clip and then for the rest of this segment the next we're gonna go to our guest a police chief

432
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:05,540
I want to first play this clip from last year, Lubbock County, Texas with judge head. He's the county judge. That's like the county mayor

433
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,620
Talking about Obama's gonna come for the guns that judge had actually read Obama's quotes

434
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:14,920
And the UN quotes see they've all said over and over again. They want a total abolition of guns

435
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:21,660
That's in the preamble to the original UN treaty, but see when we're informed when judge head is informed

436
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,420
Or police chief Mark Kessler's informed or Ron Paul's informed

437
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,860
The con artist in corporate mainstream collaborator media they just go to the public. Oh, that's a kook

438
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:38,340
That's a conspiracy theorist don't don't listen to them. They don't know what they're talking about just listen to us

439
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,340
But see that doesn't work anymore

440
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:46,420
That's why they're so desperate to bankrupt America now and get our guns now because they know America's waking up

441
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,820
That's why they're trying to get in as many illegal aliens as they can get as much people on welfare as they can they paid

442
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,940
$22,000,000 to ship General Motors to China look it up barely made the news, but it's in the news

443
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
vault and Cadillac factories

444
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,420
I believe Cadillacs made in China most of them

445
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,740
Anything they can it's one thing if you move to China

446
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,540
It's another thing of my money paid to move it there

447
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,060
They're not liberals aren't screwing up. They're not liberals. They're authoritarians

448
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,460
they are engaged in economic siege, but here's judge head on local Fox News and

449
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,580
Now other police other county judges mayors are saying the same thing

450
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:30,900
If 800 cities and 30-plus states can nullify for illegal aliens

451
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,580
When that is a violation of federal and state law and just let them do whatever they want well

452
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,740
We can nullify illegal federal laws when they are unconstitutional

453
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,660
And say our local police under the mayor and under the county or whatever the sheriff. We're not taking people's guns

454
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:53,300
Okay, but this this this this police chief goes further. They make provisions to defend the Second Amendment. You've got to call these tyrants bluff

455
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,620
Ten years ago Feinstein said oh, I got to get votes to take your guns. We got to get an amendment lady

456
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:07,300
Constitutional amendment now a decade later. She's like. Oh, we'll just do it with an executive order. That's in the Washington Post

457
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,860
They're seeing what the public does there. They're seeing others a backlash right now

458
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,220
We're gonna go to our guests, but first here is judge head of Lubbock County, Texas

459
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:22,300
During the election warning of this eventuality coming to a head no pun intended here

460
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:26,260
It is he is gonna try to hand over the sovereignty of the United States to the UN

461
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:33,020
Okay, what's gonna happen when that happens? I'm thinking worst-case scenario right right understand civil unrest civil disobedience

462
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,340
Civil war maybe and we're not talking just a few riots here and demonstrations

463
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:44,280
We're talking we're talking Lexington Concord take up arms and get rid of the guy

464
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,140
Okay, now. What's gonna happen if we do that if the public decides to do that he's gonna send in

465
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,200
You in troops. I don't want them in Lubbock County

466
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:58,580
Okay, so I'm gonna stand in front of their person armored personnel carriers and say you're not coming in here

467
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:03,220
Mm-hmm and the sheriff I've already asked him. I said you're gonna back me said yeah, I'll back you well

468
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,300
I don't want a bunch of rookies back there all right

469
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,700
I want that's right

470
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,500
He goes on to say they had to create another unit just to deal with the feds and if every county did that it'd be

471
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:18,180
Over and people said well, that's that's crazy the feds are God the feds have been taken over by firing mega banks on record

472
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:21,540
Okay, I'm done ranting our guest is with us this segment and the next

473
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,140
And he joins us, but imagine ten years ago hearing that it would have been crazy four months ago

474
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,940
It sounded a little strange to people now

475
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:34,380
It's like oh yeah, she know that guy was just more informed than even the general conservative out there, okay?

476
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,380
This is what's going to happen

477
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,140
Okay, they plan on raising taxes now Obama's already calling for more tax increases

478
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,960
Same thing in 1775 eating out our substance

479
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:53,280
It's reducing us to ruin that was the plan so the British nobility could buy up all the businesses and

480
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,360
land for pennies on the dollar

481
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,560
Was Oliver Wendell Holmes the Supreme Court justice that said the famous justice that said

482
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Taxes are the price of civilization, and that's true to have somewhat of a civilization a small limited government

483
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,440
But what about when the government becomes evil and destructive of those aims which happens all throughout history and and uses

484
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,080
Civilization to destroy us and reduce us to slavery all right. We take you now to police

485
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,640
Chief Mark Kessler in a Pennsylvania a town of Gilberton

486
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,920
That's like Mayberry RFK and the citizens are backing in Pennsylvania police

487
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,800
She proposes Second Amendment preservation ordinance demand a real plan nullifying constitutional gun laws

488
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,760
And he joins us to talk about enact any and all measures as may be necessary to prevent the violation of the Second Amendment

489
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,120
That's right

490
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,000
That's right. Not just say we're not going to enforce unconstitutional laws and act whatever it takes any means necessary

491
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,920
I want to salute you serve for your stand for the Republic, and it's good to have you here with us

492
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,600
Tell us why this came to mind and where this is going. Well. Thank you very much Alex for having me on your show

493
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:07,400
This came to mind after after yes, and evil shooting and the outcry for everybody to

494
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,280
bad weapons

495
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,000
Hopefully

496
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,320
after three or four weeks of research I came up with the idea for the nullification process and

497
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,560
after several drafts I

498
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
planned on

499
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,120
Introducing to the borough council on our next meeting on January 24th

500
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Which I hope they do

501
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,240
pass

502
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,400
Well I hope it I hope it does pass

503
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,700
Why did you I mean did the clock get so close to midnight? Is that why you come up with this plan?

504
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,660
Around the country in particularly in Washington that everybody screaming to

505
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:00,420
Weapons and they realize that it's not it's not the weapon

506
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,300
That's causing the problem. It's the person behind the weapon

507
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:10,380
That's causing the problem and until they figure that out. They're never going to solve the problem. It's not the

508
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:17,540
Law-abiding citizens that are going out and committing these heinous crimes. They're so evil and

509
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,940
Unspeakable it's the mentally ill

510
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,620
Unfortunately they're doing a lot of these crimes and criminals. It's not the law-abiding citizens.

511
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,020
Well, that's right. I mean every day in this country unfortunately every day

512
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,620
I've looked it up or on average every day a mentally ill person takes a butcher knife and stabs their family with it

513
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:41,260
Do I have to lose my butcher knife because they do that and we're gonna be right back with the police chief

514
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,380
Pennsylvania police chief proposed a Second Amendment

515
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:49,820
Preservation ordinance we appreciate his courage and his forethought, and this is something that can really pick up steam everywhere

516
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,340
I mean if they let the illegal aliens run free and that's unconstitutional

517
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,740
How about police and counties and cities just pass law saying we nullify

518
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,420

00:47:56,020 --> 00:48:01,620
America's biggest killers the chart anti-gunners don't want you to see and then it goes directly to fbi.gov

570
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,220
And the Centers for Disease Control their own numbers tobacco use

571
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,460
529,000 conservatively medical errors

572

577
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,900
118,000 alcohol abuse

578
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:38,140
107,000 motor vehicle accidents 34,000 gonna ban cars because they're dangerous well. Don't worry

579
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,420
They want to make you drive robot cars now. That's the whole Google plan so look out

580
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,420
on intentional poisoning

581
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,500
31,000 758 now gotta ban everything poisonous well everything's poisonous, but you can drink too much

586
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,580
non firearm homicides baseball bats ice picks butcher knives rocks

587
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,100
16,799 firearms homicides

588
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:19,860
11,493 in 2011 these numbers always come out a year late, so these just came out a few weeks ago three weeks ago the point is

589
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:23,820
That you've got a much better chance of falling in the shower

590
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,580
Then you and dying than from a firearm and over 70% of those

591
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:34,860
11,000 go look at the fbi.gov and violent crime statistics our gang bangers killing each other

592
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:41,020
Now four thousand still a big number, but but it's nothing compared to everything else. This is a hoax

593
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,020
I want to go back to the police chief sir

594
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,260
You've got the floor here for the balance of the segment

595
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,820
Where would you like to see this go the common sense what you see in your town?

596
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:51,380
How do we get your counsel to get this law passed?

597
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,260
How do people read a copy of it so other towns can introduce it?

598
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,780
I mean this is what we need to do because you've got all these other cities ignoring things that are the law

599
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:05,340
Well, how about we have cities ignore things that are unconstitutional? Well?

600
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,300
receiving phone calls from all across the country from Alaska to California

601
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:18,540

604
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
that one copies

605
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:31,420
of different sheriff's departments all around the country that are asking me for copies they have called and

606
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:37,420
Gave me great support throughout this whole thing, and I would like to see it spread throughout the entire

607
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,020
continental United States yes

608
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:47,020
By up by every means necessary and spread the word to everybody and we're not going to stand idle. We can't stand

609
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,060
and

610
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,340
Just let these bureaucrats in Washington

611
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,180
Ram down

612
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,180
anti constitutional law

613
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:03,620
To the American people it's just not right and I will not my department will not enforce any unconstitutional laws against the Second Amendment

614
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:08,380
Or the Constitution of the United States as far as I'm concerned for the Constitution of Pennsylvania

615
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,900
Well, I know you're sticking your neck out because you love the Republican your family and our future and obviously

616
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,900
I don't put words in your mouth, but

617
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:19,860
Guns are the canary in the coal mine. I'd like you to elaborate on that chief

618
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:27,700
But looking at this it's an example of leadership you do this, and you haven't even put it out publicly yet

619
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,340
Obviously you will see on the city website

620
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,820
And you're already have people all over the country wanting to emulate what you've done

621
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:41,600
And and that's the essence of this we have to simply stand up as leaders and do what's right and others will join us

622
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,740
but if we just stand here and let the tyranny take over as

623
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,940
Churchill said there may come a time when

624
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,860
We have to stand up and fight because it's better to down our feet than as slaves

625
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:58,320
Instead of fighting politically early on when our chance for victory was assured

626
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:03,580
Exactly exactly and God forbid the last thing we want is any kind of violence

627
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,500
hopefully, you know this will be a

628
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,700
Kind of a gateway for other other

629
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:19,580
other people that believe in the Constitution and other law enforcement officials and just the average citizen that could take it make a

630
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,660
Copy of it

631
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,860
Call me get in touch with me make a copy of it take it to their local law enforcement agencies their local sheriff their local

632
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,500
politicians and

633
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:35,780
Have them do the same thing that I'm trying to do and I mean I've been contacted by the old keepers

634
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,940
They're there in support of me the Pennsylvania United PA

635
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:45,300
9 9 12 guys, they're a million members strong throughout the country

636
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,620
They they're backing me. There's just a whole bunch of people

637
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:56,660
Yeah, folks are just looking for men of honor to stand up and you're doing that and this is what can turn the tide

638
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,820
This is what the anti-gunners are so scared of they know

639
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,740
Actual innocence being killed by guns is incredibly rare. They have the statistics. I've been around them

640
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:12,300
These are cold-blooded tyrants, you know, all the pro-gunners are always so polite and go what's wrong with these people?

641
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,620
Look at the statistics. They're not dumb. Most of them are tyrants

642
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:20,460
Sure, you've got people at the grassroots that never grew up around guns that are scared of them

643
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:25,780
But the general establishment people that want our guns they want them to oppress us and look

644
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,900
I've told the police this and the police aren't stupid

645
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:34,020
They know this there's a lot of people aren't turning them in and if a Feinstein gun man goes through and they try to go around

646
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:39,340
Harassing gun owners. It is not going to go. Well and what judge had talked about is going to end up happening

647
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,300
I want to avert that and I agree with you. I think we can

648
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,460
Fix this just by political action. I

649
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,340
Hope so. I hope so out

650
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,740
The last thing like I said, we want if any kind of violent

651
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:55,060
erupting throughout the country

652
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:59,220
I know hopefully this sends a clear message to Washington and to the

653
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,140
The media that we're not going to stand idly by and let them confiscate

654
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:10,260
The Second Amendment or the goal or tamper with the Constitution itself. That's that

655
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,060
We got a band together

656
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,420
Wow

657
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,420

Let me get him on and make sure it's okay to give his number out very

661
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:33,260

But I gotta say what you're doing is is is what will save this country and it almost brings a tear to my eye

671
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:21,500
Because so many people say well, I'll just wait till they come for my guns and we'll have a revolution folks

672
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,540
We that is the last thing we want whoever shoots first loses

673
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:32,260
We want to stand up politically and use that force to defend our freedoms

674
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,980
Not shoot our mouths off, and I've told people this if you won't politically get involved to defend your freedom

675
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,780
It's talk you will never physically defend when the time comes

676
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,700
Correct that you're right on point there right on point. I can't agree with you more

677
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,420

That's between you and God if you don't I feel sorry for you

732

This country has been wealthy and successful because we had more liberty than other nations

733
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,020
Doesn't mean we were perfect

734
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:35,240
But we had some amazing founders and I saw a clip of Michael Moore saying how dare the founders

735
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,620
You know people think that's all set in stone. They fought the greatest empire in the world

736

Calm, Pennsylvania. Police chief proposes Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance Aaron Dykes article Second Amendment Preservation Ordinance

It says prohibitions on federal state local infringement of the right to keep their arms firearms accessories or ammunition

739
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:02,140
And there's a line in here

740
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:08,820
It talks about an act ending in all measures as may be necessary people say oh they'll come get us like they're God or something

741
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:15,860
I'm not Olympus if you simply say no they lose the moral authority and then the gun confiscation never happens if you cower

745
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:39,440
I'd like to say I hope everybody gets behind this and my mayor mayor mayor Mary Lou Hannon

746
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:42,840
She's pro Second Amendment. She's standing behind me on this

747
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:46,280
She can also push the council into adopting this

748
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:53,340
and I just really hope the passes and we all got a band together and stand up and fight the

749
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:54,860
the

750
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:56,860
Treasonous in the in the

01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,140
Washington and the elite

752
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,940
It's just everything that's going on right now in the country. I'm really worried about where we're headed in the next four years

753
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:08,180
it could be very disastrous and

754
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,700
They want to take they're going to start taking our weapons away from us

755
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:18,980
It's just a very it's the start of a very bad situation within the United States

756
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,740
Hopefully people could stand together

757
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:22,980
the

758
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,580
Patriots the mothers the fathers the military the law enforcement

759
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:31,180
These all band together and say enough is enough. We had enough. We're not going to take it no more

760
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,120
We're not going to sit idly by and not and let the government ram

761
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,900
anti-constitutional ball down the throats of the American system

762
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,180
That's right

763
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:45,300
If we just act like it's some mothership that gives us all the orders it's going to do whatever at once and

764
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:49,700
Foreign interests are going to come in and buy it off. We have to

765
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,020
It was a famous African American

766
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,580
Statesman during the Civil War to paraphrase

767
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,340
him he said that

768
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,820
the liberty and freedom is not given it is taken it is demanded and

769
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:11,140
We need the special interest of liberty and the American people and private property and low taxes and freedom

770
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,660
And and and so we've got to get aggressive

771
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:19,340
We've been taken over because we became passive and it's just common sense we either get involved

772
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:25,740
Or we lose everything exactly exactly and we can't do that. We can't I will not sit idly by

773
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:31,900
And let this unconstitutional act that they're trying to get the Congress is trying to pass right now

774
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:34,340
Not the whole Congress. These are some good congressman

775
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:40,460
There's good good good senators in the United States, but just certain ones that have this ideological

776
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:45,540
Anti-american agenda that does not sit well with me. That's right

777
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:51,220
It won't be what and they guilt us into oh, I mean you've heard it. You're a clan member of your own guns

778
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:57,100
You know you're an accessory to murder the NRA or lobbyists for these 20 dead kids

779
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:01,740
It's the government the federal government that made those gun-free zones and the media that

780
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:05,700
Advertised it as the places for Prozac heads to go kill people

781
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:10,820
I mean if they want to put blame out there there are light years more to blame than anybody else

782
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,460
Exactly, they should look in the mirror. They really they really need to a reality check

783
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:17,460
We need to get these people out of office

784
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:22,420
I don't think that they they're committing acts of treason on a daily basis

785
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,780
And it just boggles the boggles my mind as they as an individual

786
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:34,300
And as a police chief that these people are in the position of power that they're in what about your other officers

787
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,780
Are they fired up about this?

788
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:41,740
Yeah, everybody Michael communities pretty much fired up about this that the local communities around me are fired up about it

789
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,660
I've received calls in different

790
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,940
Area chiefs of police that can be congratulate me

791
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:52,140
Others are good because this is how brush fires in the minds of men start according to Jefferson well

792
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:55,620
I want to salute police chief Mark Kessler in Gilberton, Pennsylvania

793
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:58,380
When is your town gonna stand up?

794
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:05,060
Sick of the globalist you Genesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die

795
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,300
Start purifying your water with pro pure my friends

796
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:14,020
I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is pro pure and it's available

It's NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95% easy to set up and use

799
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:36,540
It doesn't require electricity purify water from lakes streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals

800
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:41,420
Which is key save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic

801
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:44,140
Pro pure is the best gravity-fed filter out there

Mainstream media

807
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,500
Government cover-ups

808
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,660
You want answers?

809
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,620
Well, so does he?

810
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,620
live from Austin, Texas

811
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:23,940
Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones

812
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:36,940
Ladies and gentlemen, I was just talking to police chief of a town up in Pennsylvania mark Kessler if you joined us

813
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,740
He was telling me off-air as he left us that

814
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,380
And he also said some on-air that little short segment

815
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:49,280
That police chiefs all over the country are calling him and congratulating him for getting a piece of

816
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,420
Statutory law

817
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:57,420
that can that complies with the Second Amendment of Pennsylvania and the federal Second Amendment to

818
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:03,160
Simply say we're not gonna harass gun owners. We're not going to confiscate guns. This is unconstitutional order

819
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,100
and by the way

820
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,600
Diane Feinstein and it's in the Washington Post yesterday

821
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:14,720
They're saying they may use executive orders or ATF rulemaking and I've been warning you about that

822
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:20,000
But now it's official to just shut down gun shows you name it and I am really ashamed of something

823
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:25,940
That I have and my listeners to a great extent here in Austin have allowed

824
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:30,160
Because we're all guilty of not standing up to these people

825
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:35,920
Have allowed the Austin City Council and the county commissioners

826
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,400
Who are in a story in the Austin American Statesman?

827
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:43,940
To come out and say that they are set to ban

828
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:49,460
Gun shows not just from county and city property the big convention centers

829
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:57,360
They're saying they're set next week to vote the Austin American Statesman reports on a city law and a county law

830
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:03,320
They're working together to ban gun shows period what's next like San Francisco ban gun shops

831
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,920
This is deep in the heart of Texas

832
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,720
Travis County

833
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:15,120
Do I have to name drop here that it was David Ayers my ancestor that raised Colonel Travis's son. I

834
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:22,000
Mean, I've got I've got relatives with counties named after him in Texas and I am ashamed

835
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:26,800
That that Travis County that bears the name of William Barrett

836
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:33,900
Travis is set to ban gun shows and they're talking about gun shops. You know, I said that's next they're there

837
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:39,640
They're starting to talk about that. Here. It is Austin American Statesman city county to consider restricting gun shows

838
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:46,720
And potentially even curtail them on private property within the city limits. The Austin American Statesman has learned and

839
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,420
It goes on Mike Martinez

840
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,200
Mike Martinez, man, you know Mike can't you just be an American?

841
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,560
Mm-hmm

842
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,500
Mexico has taken all their people's guns. They have the highest murder rate. It's almost 60,000 dead in just last five years

843
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:10,920
Women men children our own Justice Department shipped guns into Mexico to blame our Second Amendment and got caught

844
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:18,240
Cuz good be ATF agents blew the whistle and you sit here and call yourself an American. I call you a shameful

845
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,120
Enemy of the Republic and a piece of garbage

846
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:23,120
You

847
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:27,240
Physically want to shut down gun shows

848
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,340
Just you people there's no end to you

849
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:36,640
You know, they were trying to shut down gun shows a few years ago. They were sending an ATF try to set folks up

850
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,780
yeah, I called for a protest of it and then they had a

851
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,000
Local group protest and I showed up at it. They even had provocateurs at it to

852
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,680
Try to go after me

853
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:51,400
I mean listen, they want to use Austin as a case to break open all of Austin

854
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:56,760
Texas into the rest of the country and go after our guns. It is it is just absolutely

855
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,360
amazing

856
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,280
To see this type of stuff going on and if you haven't read the Washington Post article

857
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,320
You really should but can we get that flashback cute back up Obama?

858
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:13,280
I will not take any guns even though it's a state senator. You can find public letters

859
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:20,320
He wrote as question and answer periods for the Chicago Tribune saying I believe all guns semi-auto

860
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,520
rifles handguns bolt-action single-shot

861
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,560
Everything must be banned and I got Dianne Feinstein saying that too

862
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,240
I've got Joe Biden

863
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:37,240
when he introduced the first assault weapons ban calling for an abolition of gun ownership in this country for

864
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:42,280
almost all guns to be turned in the Illinois Statehouse has bills introduced right now and

865
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:47,440
They've got until what Tuesday to get it done. I warned you last week. They could play possum

866
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:53,800
They claim they didn't have the votes word is we've got some calls on this from some good sources. They may try to ram it through

867
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,080
Physically making you turn your guns in

868
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:04,080
Like they've already done in Chicago making it the murder capital of the world at least Mexico doesn't have that crown that trophy that belt

869
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,240
They're just murder capital country-wise

870
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,840
as they took all the guns and

871
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,920
you know, I think all Americans whether your name's John Brown or

872
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,680
Whatever it is, you ought to move down to Mexico, of course

873
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:23,000
They won't let people move down there. If you're an illegal alien down there. They put you in a forced labor camp, but

874
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,360
Wow

875
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,800
Very very dangerous time and see the globalists don't care whether they're unpopular or not

876
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,980
They think homeland security works for them and they're dropping the hammer on us

877
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:39,140
Was it Noel in Illinois that you said had some news on the

878
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,860
Bruce in Illinois

879
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:47,740
Bruce in Illinois, then we'll go to Noel in Illinois and others Bruce. What is your Intel?

880
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:53,500
It was callers last Tuesday started warning us about the gun grab in emails and Wednesday

881
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,700
We covered it and sure enough

882
01:11:54,700 --> 01:12:00,940
We wrote an article Wednesday that made national news and Thursday the bill to confiscate most firearms including

883
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:05,860
Pumped shotguns was introduced and then we thought we shot it down Friday

884
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:12,380
Are you saying other meeting right now and other in session right now to try to get your guns? Yes, sir

885
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,380
Alex on Friday a

886
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:19,140
the gun ban amendments were introduced into the Illinois House and

887
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:23,280
In an unprecedented session at two o'clock today

888
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,940
the Illinois House

889
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:32,080
Judiciary number one committee actually was brung into session to look at the gun ban bill

890
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:35,520
The Speaker of the House Michael Madigan

891
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:41,940
He is so confident that the gun ban bill will pass out of committee that at five o'clock today, Illinois time

892
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:49,000
He is actually going to bring the full house of the Illinois General Assembly the house of the Illinois General Assembly to session now

893
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,220
It originally came out of the Senate and passed committee, but they didn't have a Senate vote

894
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:58,420
Are they gonna try to pass it in the house first? Yeah, they're doing today in an unprecedented vote today

895
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:01,000
I mean all the dirty tricks were done out today Alex

896
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:07,780
This was done so late Friday that even the Illinois State Rifle Association could not get out an alert

897
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:14,860
Listen my gut told me my gut I said it on Thursday and Friday they would they would sneak attack put it back up

898
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:19,480
Illinois State Rifle Association impeccable source they say late-breaking alert

899
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:26,600
And they always sneak this stuff through their criminals next vote on semi-auto ban will take place Sunday shuts down gun shows

900
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:32,720
Shuts down shooting ranges the bill. I saw even shuts down sit the same bill that makes you turn in pump shotguns

901
01:13:32,720 --> 01:13:37,720
Yes, sir. It's the full ban. They snuck this through they put it on a fast track

902
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:41,640
It didn't all right looks red alert right now. Give me the top URL

903
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:47,280
Folks because I want to give out the State Rifle Association actual URL. It's LS

904
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:49,920
Yeah, go ahead. Give me the our URL

905
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:54,160
Is ra.org is ra.org

906
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,280
RSra.org Illinois State Rifle Association

907
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:02,480
Or they got all the phone numbers up there on their front page federal court ruled

908
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:05,760
They can't bar Chicagoans promoting guns to defend themselves

909
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,000
So they're striking back as any globalist would is just take every gun

910
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:11,120
We've got my goodness

911
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:16,440
And they're gonna use this as the model with an executive order the Washington Post reports yesterday

912
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:22,800
Saturday to just have Obama sign an order taking our guns and his plan is to start a civil war

913
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,360
These people are criminals. I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir

914
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:31,840
Well, that is what's happening Alex will see the General Assembly with this vote because this is a dirty-tricks vote

I talked to him Friday and we knew that there was a chance that they were going to introduce it into the Illinois house

926
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:18,800
but we didn't know they were going to fast-track it at that time and

927
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:25,640
Richard had actually left the Capitol and went back to chat. Yeah, when are we gonna stop falling into their traps?

928

That's right from the front lines of the information war

980
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,540
People hear that stuff 17 years ago and go. What are you talking about front lines info war?

981
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:32,780
I was reading Pentagon public documents about how foreign banks were going to take over America. That was their new boss

982
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:39,780
Army War College, it's all public and it's not even classified and how they use info war to control us with lies

983
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:45,700
Doesn't mean the average man and woman in the military is bad. They're great people the globalists that run our military

984
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,460
They're using military mind control

985
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:50,980
Manipulation techniques on us and I'm done

986
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,860
playing games with it and

987
01:20:54,220 --> 01:21:00,020
It doesn't matter how much fancy propaganda you got once people see behind the curtain doesn't matter how fancy the facade is

988
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:04,940
It's over and we are on the march. The Empire is on the run

989
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:12,300
If these crooks in the Illinois state legislature pass a huge gun ban ammo ban most guns

990
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:16,520
I'll be banned the courts are going to shoot it down. We're gonna keep fighting. We're not going away

991
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:23,360
But I told everybody I said we beat this too easily on Thursday and Friday not like it's rocket science

992
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:31,200
They always act this way people like Alex. We had a victory. Come on. Don't don't over Fairmonger and now it's official

993
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:33,200
We can put the Illinois State Rifle Association

Late breaking alert next vote on semi-auto bill will take place right now

996
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:50,600
SB 2899 going back to our guests that alerted us to this Bruce is working as a citizen lobbyist to defend our rights

997
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,960
Thank God somebody is not some foreign banker

998
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,320
You thought you just go to sleep America and keep all your liberties think again

999
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,020
Bruce

1000
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:04,080
When are they voting on this and then if it was in the Senate before?

1001
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:09,880
Will it have to go through the house into the Senate or what's the time frame? What's the order of things here?

1002
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:14,400
Okay. Well Alex the current order is that at two o'clock today the house?

1003
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,840
Judiciary number one committee was brung into session and the bill was introduced or filed for that committee

1004
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:28,860
That bill has to be heard in that committee and then like I said earlier at five o'clock today Michael Madigan the speaker of the Illinois

1005
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:35,960
House was bringing the full house to session at five o'clock with the intent that they're going to be there. Hopefully

1006
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:40,480
For that bill to come out of committee so it can go straight to the floor

1007
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:46,840
We're 22 minutes central time into five. This is happening right now. It's happening right now. Yes, sir

1008
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,360
Yes, sir

1009
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:53,280
And in our Illinois the history of Illinois is a lot of things bad things happen about midnight

1010
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,800
That's right and the way this thing works

1011
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,640
as long as

1012
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,760
Madigan can keep that committee in session until he can

1013
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:08,840
Brow beat somebody to change their vote and make sure that it passes the committee it will then go immediately to the floor of the house

1014
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:11,600
And this General Assembly in Illinois for a vote

1015
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,280
Texas I've stormed the Texas Capitol peacefully the media called it storming

1016
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:23,320
I just marched in with hundreds of people over the TSA the bills been reintroduced to arrest them this time when they grow puss I

1017
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:28,920
Call don't you call for peaceful citizens to go in right now to that committee and to go into those?

1018
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:30,440
the

1019
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,360
Representatives offices and let them know it's your capital

1020
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,360
I say it's time for Illinoisans to take their state back from the Mafia

1021
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,440
Absolutely, Alex. In fact, there's a call out

1022
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:46,440
See that they see the dirty trick about this stunning is the dirty trick about this stunning is it happened late?

1023
01:23:46,640 --> 01:23:51,280
Friday so that people actually couldn't rally and didn't even know what's happening

1024
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:53,680
And then you go home to spend one day with your look look

1025
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:59,440
I knew this would happen, but people said oh Alex come on. Let us have a victory that there they are right now

1026
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,920
They're introducing the bill

1027
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:04,560
Amendment one it is all happening right now ladies and gentlemen this is insane

1028
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:12,920
Believe that this vote was structured in a deliberate attempt to stop people like you and others from great creating the grassroots

1029
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:19,520
Movement and so that people couldn't go to Springfield and couldn't attend these hearings. That's right. Let me say it this way

1030
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,200
Let me say it this way

1031
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:26,080
do you think they're openly introducing bills to take almost all the guns federally and

1032
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:32,240
bragging about it and letting piers Morgan and the Chinese government and the Russian government call for our guns to be turned in with the

1033
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:38,320
UN treaty coming up in March if they weren't planning on doing this okay folks. I know it's unpopular

1034
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:44,480
I know it's unconstitutional. I know when I look in their beady little eyes. They're planning on war

1035
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:51,880
I'm telling you this is it and we can beat them, but people got to admit. There's a fight happening. Well. Yes, sir Alex

1036
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:56,080
I do agree with that now. I do have a slight different take on all this gun control bills

1037
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,560
You know remember Joseph Farah when he came on to your show, and he talked about how he was afraid that

1038
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:08,720
Barack Obama and his controllers would line people up and basically do away with them and remember how you played on the air

1039
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:14,560
No, that's what Bill Ayers told Obama in the FBI files was they were gonna kill put 50 million of us in camps and kill us

1040
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:20,880
Yeah, well understand. You know Barack Obama is a hardcore communist, but Barack Obama understands power and

1041
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:25,600
What brocco I believe is happening here is I believe that this is the beginning of a purge

1042
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,600
You know if Barack Obama can use the color of law

1043
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,080
They're bragging on Democratic sites, this is a way to harass gun owners everywhere

1044
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:40,400
This is how they make us the enemy. This is what Homeland Security's for yes, we'll see this will purge

1045
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:47,420
Obama's critics it will purge his opposition and Obama can in a sense change the demographics in the political

1046
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:51,520
Landscape of the United States and ensure that he and his minions will be in

1047
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:56,160
I don't know why you said we disagree. They've introduced the amendment to making president for life, basically

1048
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,520
Hjres 15 federally I totally concur with you

1049
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:06,880
Yeah, I mean to disagree. I mean I have a different take I mean I believe that this gun control situation is literally a purge I

1050
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:13,280
Believe it's the purge of Obama's. Oh, they've actually all over the Democratic sites that we've got an article coming out tomorrow

1051
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,000
I told Paul about it mother writers like a week ago, but

1052
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:21,280
Soon articles coming out because I see it everywhere. I sent him a bunch of examples to write an article where they go

1053
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:26,720
We hope you don't turn them in we're gonna kill you and these are big official sites. No this is it these people

1054
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:32,440
This is this is Russia 1948

1055
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:39,320
Now you're right and for those that don't know they kill most people after 48, okay, I appreciate your call

1056
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:44,400
Yeah, and see I'm so busy. I can't keep track of everything guy calls it. He says look it up

1057
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:48,060
I look it up there. It is. I look up the Statehouse website look up the video feed

1058
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,700
They're in there debating the bill on the floor of the house right now

1059
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:58,140
They promised they wouldn't reintroduce it on Friday a pack of liars, and I know they're liars

1060
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:04,220
Why did I didn't believe them because I wanted to go home for a day and a half and sit around cook food play with

1061
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:06,380
board games with my children and

1062
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:10,700
Quite frankly go out and shoot my rifle in the backyard because I live out in the country. I mean

1063
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:17,620
But you know what all my neighbors were shooting. I've never heard all my neighbors on three sides of me

1064
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:20,220
Shooting and this weekend. They were all shooting

1065
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:27,480
People get what's going on and again the low-level folks say well, why do you want my guns?

1066
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:34,620
And then the establishment says well for everybody's safety they want our guns to dominate us

1067
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:39,820
Let's jam in a call before we go to break another caller from Illinois Greg in Illinois. You're on the air go ahead

1068
01:27:39,820 --> 01:27:47,340
I don't Alex. Thanks for doing what you do. I just like to tell you how crooked this is

1069
01:27:47,340 --> 01:27:51,500
I want to underline it so everybody else that's listening can understand

1070
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:57,660
It's so crooked like like the previous caller said you know it's unprecedented

1071
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:00,220
They brought told us they weren't going to do anything

1072
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:04,220
And they brought it in on Friday where they couldn't get the word out now

1073
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:12,320
They've got everybody in there doing their thing and we can't I've been trying to call all day all the voicemails are full

But we're not like for affiliates in Illinois

Everybody needs to get there or the state police are coming to take your guns

01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:35,640
You're right. You're right, but it's coming to every other state everybody got to watch it

Thomas Jefferson, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

1132
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,120
It's good to stand for something

1133
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,920
You know the old saying stand for something fall for anything

1134
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,920
You don't stand for something you're like a leaf in the wind my friends

1135
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:44,880
You know if I had to quantify the New World Order global government all it is is a bunch of Bernie Madoff Ken Lay types

1136
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:52,880
Who in the last 200 years got governments and corporations and companies to borrow money from them out of nothing

1137
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:56,880
And now they've got 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives out there and

1138
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,880
Globalism is just a bunch of international crooks only a few thousand of them

1139
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,880
Exempt from all the other laws playing countries off against each other

1140
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:12,880
Getting rid of national sovereignty and basically trying to get governments to lobby

1141
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:18,880
Legislatures to raise taxes to pay corporate welfare to them

1142
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,880
And now they know we're getting awakes they're like hey how about you give us those guns too

1143
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:28,880
And just sit down there and shut up while we militarize and federalize the police and buy all these weapons and

1144
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:30,880
Billions around to ammo and tanks

1145
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,880
Never mind those cameras giving you tickets when you drive down the road from point to point

1146
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,880
Never mind your kids being trained to spy on you

1147
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,880
Never mind the NSA yeah we'll use drones to kill citizens

1148
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,880
Sit down and shut up

1149
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:44,880
You know it's almost a curse to be informed

1150
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,880
It's really not a curse

1151
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:51,880
Even if you were a cynical globalist being informed is very good for business

1152
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:53,880
But I spent

1153
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:56,880
I didn't really talk about Al Gore and his current TV

1154
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:02,880
Deal selling out to Qatar in the Arab emirates over in the Middle East

1155
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:06,880
Until I'd had some time Friday and Saturday to study it a bit

1156
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,880
And I already knew what was going on but I wanted to make sure you know

1157
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,880
That's why I'm so frustrated once I get on air

1158
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,880
Because there's just all this research behind it that I could never put out on air

1159
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,880
Because of time constraints

1160
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,880
But I went and did the research it turns out Forbes already done it all for us

1161
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,880
And it's an article titled Current TV

1162
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:26,880
Sold to Al Jazeera for $500 million deal for Al Gore

1163
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:31,880
Average listenership or viewership was 40,000 people an hour

1164
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:36,880
A B-rate AM station in a major city has 40,000 listeners an hour

1165
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:39,880
They're probably charging $100 an ad

1166
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:41,880
Al Gore was charging $10,000 an ad

1167
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:46,880
That was just big corporations kind of giving him you know their donation to put out anti-gun info

1168
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,880
And it turns out they're talking about Al Gore

1169
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,880
And it turns out they're talking about how it's a foreign run media now here in the US

1170
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:55,880
State run Arab media Al Jazeera

1171
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:58,880
That's bad enough violates a bunch of laws

1172
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:01,880
But the biggest issue of this globalism

1173
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:03,880
Is that he got all this oil money too from it

1174
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:05,880
And he's a hypocrite about that

1175
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:07,880
When he's already been one of the biggest oil men in American

1176
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:09,880
Modern American history and politics

1177
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,880
Occidental petroleum

1178
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,880
He wants a global

1179
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,880
I saw a comment on a YouTube video I did

1180
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,880
Saying you mean we pay our taxes to Al Gore

1181
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,880
And people said well he owns the software for the carbon trading

1182
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,880
No he has a company called Gore and Blood

1183
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,880
In London a Rothschild company

1184
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,880
That you pay carbon taxes to

1185
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:30,880
Where they trade the carbon credits okay

1186
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,880
You pay the money to Al Gore

1187
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:36,880
They couldn't get the feds to ram it through so they got

1188
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:39,880
Counties and cities that were traitorous like Austin Texas to sign on

1189
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:41,880
And yes Austinites

1190
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,880
Through different Austin energy programs

1191
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,880
Pay money to Al Gore

1192
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:47,880
When you turn your light switch on

1193
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,880
That man bear pig fat

1194
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:51,880
Turd of a man

1195
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:52,880
Con artist

1196
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,880
I was watching the Beverly Hillbillies with my children

1197
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:56,880
I let them watch old TV yesterday

1198
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,880
And they had a con artist episode where this con artist

1199
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,880
Comes to their house and

1200
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,880
He takes them to sell them the Hollywood Bowl

1201
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:03,880
And then he takes them to sell them the zoo

1202
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,880
And he goes I tell you what if you buy these from me

1203
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:10,880
I'll throw in this this highway

1204
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:16,880
I mean Al Gore is that type of con artist

1205
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,880
But let me go to your calls I said I'd go to your calls

1206
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:20,880
The issue here is

1207
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,880
Carriage rights

1208
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:24,880
If you've got

1209
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,880
On average about 5 million viewers a day

1210
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,880
It varies in the regulations

1211
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,880
You can force your way on the basic cable

1212
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:32,880
But basic cable gets bigger and bigger

1213
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:34,880
Because of that and charge people

1214
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,880
On average 56 dollars more than double what it was

1215
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,880
When Al Gore is vice president

1216
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,880
Honcho the 96 telecommunications act

1217
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:43,880
So he went and twisted arms

1218
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,880
They admit this in the article

1219
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:48,880
To put current TV on the air five six years ago

1220
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:50,880
With no viewers

1221
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,880
Because he gets an automatic payment

1222
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,880
From everybody with basic cable and basic satellite

1223
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:00,880
And now he gets a foreign government purchase

1224
01:38:00,880 --> 01:38:02,880
Roughly five times what it was even worth

1225
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,880
I mean just amazing

1226
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,880
Amazing and that's just one little

1227
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,880
One little scam

1228
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,880
And it is a scam

1229
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:12,880
I talked about this last week

1230
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,880
Congress gets caught inside our trading

1231
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,880
They go you know what we'll pass a law to outlaw it

1232
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,880
It was already illegal

1233
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,880
But they play that little game

1234
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,880
That bait and switch

1235
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:24,880
We'll pass a law to make it illegal

1236
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,880
They pass a law to legalize it

1237
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,880
Talk about crooks

1238
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:30,880
Frank in New York you're on the air

1239
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,880
Thanks for holding brother go ahead

1240
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,880
How are you Alex?

1241
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,880
Listen I just want to thank you

1242
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,880
For doing what you're doing for the past 17 years

1243
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,880
You've been very knowledgeable

1244
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:42,880
Everything you say is on

1245
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,880
But the whole thing this is Alex

1246
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,880
This is actually that intervention

1247
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,880
This is going to happen regardless of what we do

1248
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,880
I hate to sound so cynical about it

1249
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:52,880
But it's going to happen

1250
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,880
Unfortunately

1251
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,880
Well it is true we've killed

1252
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,880
53 million babies and say they're not babies

1253
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,880
And we've launched

1254
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,880
All these illegal wars and we've become

1255
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,880
Decadent and evil

1256
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,880
Anytime a country becomes decadent and evil it falls

1257
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,880
We'll fall just like Mexico

1258
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,880
Just like North Korea

1259
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,880
That is our future

1260
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:14,880
You know the Rothschilds actually want to create

1261
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,880
Israel I believe you know that as well too

1262
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:20,880
I know the Rothschilds are at the very head

1263
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,880
They're at the very head of wanting to create

1264
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,880
World government absolutely Frank

1265
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:26,880
My point is

1266
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,880
They want to create Israel

1267
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,880
After World War II

1268
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,880
They funded the founding of it

1269
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:34,880
Correct

1270
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:36,880
But my point is that

1271
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:38,880
Without Israel

1272
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,880
This would not happen I know this sounds crazy

1273
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:42,880
But Israel has to happen

1274
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:44,880
For the anti-correct to come back

1275
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,880
That's all I have to tell you

1276
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,880
No I hear you and you know Israel

1277
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:50,880
Every citizen that wants a gun is issued full auto

1278
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:52,880
And we pay for it with our taxes

1279
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,880
But then Israel came out and said

1280
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,880
Their foreign minister said take our guns

1281
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:58,880
It's like oh I pay for your M16

1282
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,880
And Israel said yeah that's right

1283
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,880
Yes and one more thing Alex

1284
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:04,880
Do me a big favor tomorrow night

1285
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:06,880
Can you please kick his ass tomorrow

1286
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:08,880
Piers Morgan I can't stand that

1287
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,880
I'm going to be polite

1288
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,880
Now with the red coat

1289
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:14,880
But I'm sure I'll let him attack me first

1290
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,880
Then I won't physically do anything

1291
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:18,880
He's got a bunch of bodyguards

1292
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,880
Anyways and I'm actually afraid of Piers Morgan

1293
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,880
I'm being sarcastic folks

1294
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
I'm flying up there just for the fun of it

1295
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,880
So we'll see what happens

1296
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,880
Thank you you're on the air go ahead

1297
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,880
Well a couple of suggestions

1298
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,880
For you and I do hope you will consider taking them

1299
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:34,880
To heart first of all

1300
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,880
Every time you mention the whole thing

1301
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,880
About the TSA and the police doing random

1302
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:40,880
Searches on the roads and everything

1303
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,880
You always forget to state the most important thing

1304
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:44,880
And that is that we actually do have

1305
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,880
The right to refuse searches like that

1306
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,880
No no we do but the average cop

1307
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,880
Doesn't know that and it'll beat your brains out or shoot you

1308
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,880
This is totally

1309
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:54,880
Unconstitutional

1310
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,880
I like telling Rosa Parks go to the back of the bus

1311
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:58,880
She didn't have to and absolutely

1312
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:00,880
Have you heard they're signing up all over the country

1313
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,880
Gang checkpoints where they search your vehicle

1314
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,880
I mean this is called martial law

1315
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,880
Yes and I know

1316
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,880
But we shouldn't be afraid to refuse

1317
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,880
Because as long as we have our rights we might as well use them

1318
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:12,880
Whenever we have them so I'm just suggesting

1319
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,880
Make sure you point out we do have the right to refuse

1320
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,880
Whenever you bring that up

1321
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,880
And I also have another suggestion

1322
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,880
The whole thing you did

1323
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,880
About the TSA week

1324
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,880
Has inspired me to suggest

1325
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:26,880
Maybe you do another thing for a day

1326
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,880
Like maybe mock Big Brother

1327
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,880
Because the fact is I know Big Brothers

1328
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,880
Oh no no we don't want to have people go out

1329
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:34,880
And climb up poles and bash

1330
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,880
Security cameras with baseball bats

1331
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,880
We don't want anything illegal to happen

1332
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,880
I mean what would protesting Big Brother week consist of?

1333
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,880
Yeah I know

1334
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,880
I don't want us to break anything but

1335
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:46,880
No no we should just take cancer shots

1336
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,880
Vaccines full of cancer

1337
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,880
Let's talk to Mark in Oregon

1338
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,880
Mark you got one minute we're going to break go ahead

1339
01:41:52,880 --> 01:41:54,880
Hello Alex

1340
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:56,880
Hey buddy

1341
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:58,880
Alex not the main reason I call

1342
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,880
I hope you could hold me after the break for a moment

1343
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:02,880
So I could get to it real quick

1344
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,880
But I think it may be the main reason that I call

1345
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:06,880
I'm not sure

1346
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,880
And I'm not trying to be negative or morbid here Alex

1347
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,880
Or to discourage you in any way

1348
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,880
But I've heard what you've had to say

1349
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:14,880
About Piers Morgan

1350
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,880
You know recently

1351
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,880
And I know it to be true

1352
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,880
We're going to have Mohammed come to the mountain

1353
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,880
Rather than you go to see him

1354
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,880
Oh no I love going into the lion's den

1355
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:26,880
Man I love going into the

1356
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,880
I don't mean that Alex

1357
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:30,880
I mean this is a very

1358
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,880
Accelerated

1359
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,880
Event

1360
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:36,880
Framework that we're living in at this time

1361
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:38,880
And I fear for your safety

1362
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:40,880
My brother

1363
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,880
You know what Obi Wan Kenobi

1364
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,880
Look I got to jump I got to get to everybody

1365
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:46,880
But I appreciate you look look

1366
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:48,880
No more of this stuff

1367
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,880
You know what Obi Wan Kenobi tells Darth Vader

1368
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,880
Strike me down Darth I shall become

1369
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,880
More powerful than you can

1370
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,880
Possibly imagine

1371
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:58,880
I am not worried about anything

1372
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,880
We have witnessed

1373
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,880
Two terrible storms in the east

1374
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,880
But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm

1375
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,880
The most devastating

1376
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:10,880
Economic condition since the great depression

1377
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,880
America's worst drought in agricultural history

1378
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,880
And now the economic

1379
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:16,880
Results of the presidential election

1380
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:18,880
This perfect storm is a huge threat to

1381
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,880
Everyone's food supply

1382
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,880
I just doubled down and got even more supplies

From E Foods Direct and I recommend you do the same

1384
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,880

From E Foods Direct

1386
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,880
I know I won't be standing in a bread line

1387
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:32,880
Trading my freedom for food

1388
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:34,880
I'm taking control of my future

1389
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,880

1417

Agents which quickly evaporate

1418
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:36,880
And leave the silver at the surface

1419
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,880

All right, we've got dozens of calls on the board

1471
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,880
But Mark, Frank, Noel, Ray, Spence, Jeff

1472
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,880
I'm going to get to at least you guys

1473
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:28,880
Mark, make your other point real quick

1474
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,880
Go ahead

1475
01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,880
Okay Alex, and just quickly in passing to my other point

1476
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,880
When you get on Pierce Morgan's show

1477
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,880
If you would please bring up the gross inconsistencies

1478
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,880
Around the Sandy Hook shooting

1479
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,880
Indicating it's a government black op

1480
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:42,880
And perhaps discuss false flags

1481
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,880
False flags in general

1482
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,880
I think it hit it really good

1483
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,880
I really do

1484
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,880
Alex, my main point

1485
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,880
Is that John Moore

1486
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:54,880
And he says eight other public

1487
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:56,880
Figures who have very high level

1488
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,880
Competential sources

1489
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:00,880
In various US federal

1490
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:02,880
Government agencies

1491
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:04,880
All agree across the board

1492
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:06,880
That the scenario is to occur in March

1493
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,880
Where we have the perfect storm

1494
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,880
Of the gun grab

1495
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,880
Having gone on for a bit

1496
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:14,880
Or commencing

1497
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:16,880
Financial collapse

1498
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:18,880
Martial law and then civil war

1499
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:20,880
Well I hope that's not the case

1500
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,880
And if we get the word out

1501
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:24,880
These tyrants won't be able to do this

1502
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,880
But they didn't set up homeland security

1503
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,880
And all the tanks and armor

1504
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,880
And anti-gun training to play deadly winks

1505
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,880
Frank in Louisiana, you're on the air Frank

1506
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,880
Welcome

1507
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,880
Yes Alex, we have to remind these traitors

1508
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,880
That they are literal traitors

1509
01:48:38,880 --> 01:48:40,880
You can't legislate away the bill of rights

1510
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:42,880
And we have to remind them

1511
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,880
That you're in violation of your

1512
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:46,880
Article 6 oath

1513
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:48,880
Supreme contract

1514
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:50,880
To we the people

1515
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:52,880
And by the way we were watching

1516
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,880
The live Illinois Statehouse feed

1517
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:56,880
And when the bill came up they went

1518
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,880
Let's go to closed session

1519
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:00,880
And they turned the video feed off

1520
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,880
To take their guns

1521
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,880
I'm sorry go ahead

1522
01:49:04,880 --> 01:49:06,880
Well they're in violation of the Article 6 oath

1523
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,880
Which when that contract is broken

1524
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,880
You didn't default to that contract

1525
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,880
We don't have to do anything

1526
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,880
Hey this government is not legitimate already

1527
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:16,880
They say our military is under

1528
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,880
NATO UN command last year

1529
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,880
And they have to be

1530
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,880
Reminded that the right of the people

1531
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,880
Clause followed by the infringement clause

1532
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:26,880
Says we have a right

1533
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:28,880
From God as declared

1534
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:30,880
The declaration of independence

1535
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,880
Which is organic law still cited on the

1536
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,880
First pages of the statutes at large

1537
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:36,880
That's right our rights don't come

1538
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:38,880
From government or even the constitution

1539
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,880
Of bill of rights they come from God

1540
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,880
They're unalienable

1541
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,880
They're unalienable they're on record

1542
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:46,880
Great point Frank anything else?

1543
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:48,880
Well one thing that you might

1544
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,880
Just put into the thought process

1545
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,880
Is we have to ask the government

1546
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:54,880
Why are you charging us a heavy progressive

1547
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:56,880
Income tax it's forbidden by the

1548
01:49:56,880 --> 01:49:58,880
Rules of direct apportionment in the constitution

1549
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:00,880
Didn't have it until 1913 it's all

1550
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,880
Paid to the private federal reserve

1551
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:04,880
It's the foreign federal reserve sucking us dry

1552
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:06,880
They brag they're foreign

1553
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:08,880
They call us dumb slaves

1554
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,880
To the public find out what the Goldman Sachs

1555
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:12,880
And people say about you

1556
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:14,880

Madigan his daughter Lisa Madigan

1573

The attorney general of Illinois

1574
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,880
Lost an embarrassing suit when

1575
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,880
The courts ruled that Illinois can't have

1576
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,880
Concealed carry so it's no surprise

1577
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,880
That they're doing this at such

1578
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,880
Rapid speed yeah the answer is

1579
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,880

01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,880
In California they're also trying to totally

1582
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,880
Ban guns there now the few that are still there

1583
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:08,880
Open gun bans being pushed by the

1584
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,880
Globalist who are arming with the teeth against

1585
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,880
Us and all have bodyguards and their own

1586
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,880
Special licenses go ahead

1587
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:16,880
Ray

1588
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,880
Go ahead welcome

1589
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,880
Hi I just wanted to say

1590
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,880
I'm more concerned about

1591
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,880
Bio Holocaust and subsequent nuclear

1592
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:26,880
Holocaust that is probably going to run with

1593
01:51:26,880 --> 01:51:28,880
This gun ban thing that's going on

1594
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,880
Well we got a federal government

1595
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,880
That injected black people with syphilis and

1596
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,880
Gave foreigner kids polio

1597
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,880
And it's all irradiated our soldiers

1598
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:38,880
So how dare you say the government

1599
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,880
Would ever do anything corrupt or illegal

1600
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:42,880
That's impossible I mean the government

1601
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,880
Is run by foreign banks that are

1602
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,880
Eugenicist and say they want world government to

1603
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,880
Cut off resources and kill us I mean

1604
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,880
That's loving Ray I appreciate

1605
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,880
Your call Spence in Missouri

I'm meaning that

1611
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:04,880
Jokingly okay

1612
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,880
Hey listen I was going to tell you again

1613
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,880
Thanks for getting me on the air I'm going to make it quick

1614
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,880
You know where I live up here I think I've

1615
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:12,880
Talked to you once before just for a brief moment

1616
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:14,880
Just south of the big 72,000

1617
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:16,880
Square footer

1618
01:52:16,880 --> 01:52:18,880
Hey listen they've blocked off

1619
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,880
All the caves around here with bars

1620
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,880
They've put concrete

1621
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,880
Up around them

1622
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,880
They're blocking all the highways with cables where you can't cut

1623
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,880
Across they're digging in against us

1624
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:30,880
They're cutting it the foreign occupation is here

1625
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,880
And the cops are dumb enough to march

1626
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,880
Off against the American people holy mackerel

1627
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:36,880
Real quick on the gun man

1628
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:38,880
Listen I have I hope you

1629
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:40,880
Don't mind I started

1630
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,880
Just a small website to try to get people

1631
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:44,880
Informed around here

1632
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:46,880
Because just

1633
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:48,880

01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,880

1635
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,880

ThePatriotPage.com

1637
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:56,880
We're trying to get people

1638
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,880
I've owned to your show

1639
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,880
And I'm trying to buy the magazines from you

1640
01:53:00,880 --> 01:53:02,880
I'm trying to get everything I can

1641
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:04,880
In hardcore literature I've ordered

1642
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:06,880
All of the discs

1643
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,880
I want to get this stuff tangible

1644
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:10,880
So that we can produce this

1645
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:12,880
I've got an IT department

1646
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:14,880
I employ probably 20 people

1647
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:16,880
I'm sick to my stomach with this crap

1648
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,880
No I hear you Spence

1649
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:20,880
And God bless you I appreciate your call

1650
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:22,880
Speaking of magazines

01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:24,880
Absolutely you know he's saying

1652
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:26,880
Where you've gained your life

1653
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:28,880
Realizing that we're all focused on football

1654
01:53:28,880 --> 01:53:30,880
Entertainment, TV

1655
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,880
All these petty things

1656
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,880
While global corporate combines

1657
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,880
Are coming in taking over our government

1658
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:38,880
Socializing the public to make us dependent

1659
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,880
While siphoning and skimming

1660
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:42,880
Off the money overseas

1661
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,880

1662
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,880

1668
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,880
And said this man wants your guns

1669
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:00,880
And broke down he would use executive orders

1670
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:02,880
To go after your guns

1671
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,880

Let's talk to Jeff

1684
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,880
In North Dakota

1685
01:54:30,880 --> 01:54:32,880
You're on the air Jeff go ahead

1686
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,880
Hey Alex how are you doing?

1687
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,880
Good

1688
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,880
Hey I've been spending about the whole entire day

1689
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,880
Trying to get through to these Illinois

1690
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,880
Reps about this gun ban

1691
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,880
They've just turned their phones off

1692
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,880
Yeah they're mafia

1693
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,880
I finally did get through to somebody

1694
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:50,880
Sid Matthias' secretary

1695
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:52,880
Or something

1696
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:54,880
She told me the bill did not get called

1697
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,880
And I thanked her for the

1698
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,880
Information but then you just reported

1699
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:00,880
That they did call the bill

1700
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,880
And they went into committee

1701
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,880
Well they change stuff all the time

1702
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:06,880
But according to the Illinois state rifle association

1703
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,880
And we were watching it and they brought up the bills

1704
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,880
A group of bills including that one

1705
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,880
And they said we're going to closed session

1706
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:14,880
And cut the video feed

1707
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:16,880
Well you know maybe there's still

1708
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,880
Time for us to get some voice in on that

1709
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:20,880
Well my point is

1710
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,880
We now have Dianne Feinstein on record

1711
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,880
In fact you are up to end the show please

1712
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:26,880
All of them saying Mr. and Mrs. America

1713
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,880
Get ready to turn your guns in

1714
01:55:28,880 --> 01:55:30,880
They want our guns, the question is why

1715
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:32,880
What do they have planned?

1716
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:34,880
Total implosion, collectivization

1717
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:36,880
Of America

1718
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,880
Well give Pierce Morgan

1719
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:40,880
A piece of my mind when you see him

1720
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:42,880
You know what

1721
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,880
The last time I flew to New York to be on TV

1722
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:46,880
It was The View

1723
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,880
And that was a couple years ago

1724
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,880
And they were like okay satellite we really want you to

1725
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,880
Fly here and I went no I'm only doing

1726
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,880
Satellite and then I thought you know what

1727
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,880
I want to be in person talking to that guy

1728
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,880
And the first they're like

1729
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,880
You'll be alone with him talking and

1730
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,880
Now we're going to have you know this guy

1731
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,880
Dershowitz or whatever, whatever

1732
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:06,880
I don't care, I'm going to go in there with some

1733
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,880
Common sense facts

1734
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,880
It'll be the biggest audience they've had in a while

1735
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,880
I mean CNN's only got about a half

1736
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:14,880
Million viewers now the derivative of

1737
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:16,880
It the YouTube videos other news picking

1738
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:18,880
It up that'll be tens of millions so I'm

1739
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:20,880
Happy to do it I'm going to fly

1740
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:22,880
Out to New York and

1741
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:24,880
Do that interview

1742
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:26,880
The TSA tries to stop me

1743
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:28,880
Give them a good heads up then I'll just

1744
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:30,880
Do it via satellite oh yeah they I walk

1745
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:32,880
Up and go where are you going what are you doing

1746
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,880
And I'll go you know who I am that's right

1747
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:36,880
You're a troublemaker such a free

1748
01:56:36,880 --> 01:56:38,880
Country that I'm treated like a convicted

1749
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:40,880
Felon doing a perp walk

1750
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:42,880
At a super max I mean it's just

1751
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,880
This whole culture is about

1752
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,880
Training you to be a slave

1753
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:48,880
Felix in New York you're our final caller

1754
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:50,880
Go ahead

1755
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,880
Thank you Alex just two quick things

1756
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:54,880
First of all my mom just suggested

1757
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,880
That you wear a

1758
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,880
Don't tread on me either shirt

1759
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,880
Or maybe a flag

1760
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,880
Because

1761
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:04,880
And secondly I was just

1762
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:06,880
Wondering what time is

1763
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:08,880
Is it being taped or is it going to be live?

1764
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,880
I wouldn't do it if it wasn't live

1765
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:12,880
It's 9 o'clock central 8 o'clock

1766
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,880
Eastern it's not that I mean

1767
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,880
I mean Jesse Ventura goes on there

1768
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:18,880
A lot of other folks on there it should be an interesting

1769
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:20,880
Interview I mean I called for his deportation

1770
01:57:20,880 --> 01:57:22,880
So he'll say how dare you

1771
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,880
Try to violate my first amendment and I'll say you're trying to

1772
01:57:24,880 --> 01:57:26,880
Violate my second amendment you're a foreigner

1773
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
I'll source the Supreme Court ruling

1774
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:30,880
They'll have

1775
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,880
You know Dershowitz come flapping out there

1776
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:34,880

01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:44,880

As well on Wednesday

1783
01:57:46,880 --> 01:58:14,880
In the Republic ladies and gentlemen

1784
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:26,880
We'll be right back.

1785
01:58:46,880 --> 01:58:54,880
We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east

1786
01:58:54,880 --> 01:58:56,880
But we are still in the eye of the perfect storm

1787
01:58:56,880 --> 01:59:00,880
The most devastating economic condition since the Great Depression

1788
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:02,880
America's worst drought in agricultural history

1789
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,880
And now the economic results of the presidential election

1790
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:10,880
This perfect storm is a huge threat to everyone's food supply

1791
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:12,880
I just doubled down and got even more supplies from eFoods Direct

1792
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:14,880
And I recommend you do the same

1793
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:16,880
It's time to get your own supply from eFoods Direct

1794
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:20,880
I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food

1795
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:22,880
I'm taking control of my future

1796
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,880
And you're nuts if you don't do the same

1797
