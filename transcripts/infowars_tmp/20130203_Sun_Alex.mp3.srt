1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We've got it

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,560
Waging war on corruption

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,480
It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,680
It's the day of the big game

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,800
And during the big game Super Bowl 2013

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,800
From the season of 2012

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,320
technically Super Bowl 2012

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,680
We are going to be brainwashed by ads against the Second Amendment

9
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,280
Financed by the globalists and other collaborators against our liberty and the

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,720
exploited

11
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
children of Sandy Hook survivors with their choir

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,960
to tear-jerk and demonize the Second Amendment

13
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,280
Unbelievably

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
opportunistic and disgusting but

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,440
Don't ever expect the criminals that run this system to not be opportunistic and over-the-top. They think you are stupid

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,840
They think you are utterly

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,560
And totally mindless they think there's nothing you won't buy

18
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,760
We're gonna be going over the latest on the Second Amendment today

19
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,600
but there is an article out of Forbes that's excellent that we have linked up at infowars.com and

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,280
prisonplanet.com

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,920
It's also I found it at drudgereport.com on the left-hand side

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,680
NRA winning the influence battle over gun control

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,120
And I don't just believe polls when I hear them or see them. I've studied polls. I've studied statistics

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:56,080
I've studied how they work and I'm able to gauge polls over a long period of time from what I read in quasi

25
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
internal government white papers

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,920
plus what I see on the streets and

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,600
This told me what I already knew they went to one of the biggest and most respected data mining companies

28
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,080
And that's really the polling agency of the future and found that it is a total route of

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,240
the anti-gunners the victim disarmament

30
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,520
a kleptocratic crowd that wants to disarm their quarry

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
In fact, they find with military precision

32
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,240
organically

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,240
individual gun owners

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
supported through the

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,000
NRA that we've taken control of it was under globalist control about 20 years ago

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There's there's no doubt and Larry Pratt agrees with me that that with laser

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,160
Military laser like focus is the quote that we are

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,320
Annihilating the enemy now that that that's a big plush

39
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,720
And it's because we realize they're an enemy a deceptive group who don't want to take guns to keep kids safe

40
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,740
Don't want to register guns to actually stop criminals. They want to target the American people

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,240
We've seen them take the guns in any city the global is during control of we've seen them

42
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,040
Disarmed people in more than 30-something nations the last 50 years or so. We know their game plan. We know their program

43
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,040
we know how it works and

44
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,760
Because we're one of the last countries to hold out like Switzerland

45
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,640
We've we've gotten to have front-row seats to all the tricks and the globalist are global

46
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,560
They run the same program the same plays they switch them up a little bit

47
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,360
But it's basically the same playbook in country after country

48
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,200
They try to take over and not just on guns when they go for the guns

49
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,720
it means they're insecure and they're afraid and politically that they're not going to get away what they've done and

50
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,280
And it means they want to use authoritarianism on the public now that said we're gonna be getting into that

51
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,540
We're gonna be getting into an amazing report up at infowars.com

52
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,940
That ties into like seven other links just to the article that Kurt Nemo did

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,580
And I was even able to find some more we're gonna play some of these clips coming up

54
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
Reverend Jesse Jackson

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,840
To rip off Rush Limbaugh's

56
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,040
He says it but well, that's how Reverend Jackson always says it the Reverend Jesse Jackson

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
says gun supporters are

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Domestic terrorist. I shouldn't laugh

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,440
There was a video saying on the on the comments at info wars calm right for Showtime like 10 minutes for air

60
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,520
I laugh so hard. I could hardly go on air

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,360
You ever laugh so hard it makes you start coughing and you can't quit

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,400
It said Jesse Jackson responds to infowars.com and I thought well

63
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,280
Let me put that we put that YouTube URL in and it was chunk from the goonies

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
And then I realized that actually

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,120
There is a resemblance to Jesse Jackson. I couldn't believe that. Oh

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Oh my gosh, he's the black chunk. Sorry. We're gonna be right back. Stay with us.

67
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,160
You prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms

68
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,800
But if you don't have a home security system

69
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,520
Then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away from home

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,020
Who's watching out for intruders? Check out simply safe

71
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,880
It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless go to get simply safe calm

72
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:28,120
Simply safe is independent and off the grid. It runs on battery power. So even if the grid goes down you are protected

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,800
It's completely customizable so you can use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed get simply safe calm

74
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes

75
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,440
So there's no need to let a stranger into your home

76
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,540
If you move or need to relocate you can take the system with you wherever you go

77
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,320
You aren't always at home, but simply safe will stand guard protecting your property 24 hours a day seven days a week

78
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,240
Again, that's get simply safe calm

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

80
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
Nobody rides for free

81
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,840
Nobody rides for free

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,380
The globalists are not going to make our servicemen women mainly men

83
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,080
Serve two three four five six seven eight nine tours in the last 12 years and not have massive

84
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
suicides

85
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,440
massive

86
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,560
Mental problems massive health problems as well

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,880
Did you know that they make US military personnel?

88
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,800
You can look this up go into combat and force them back into combat when they've had legs blown off

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,300
Oh, you didn't know that. Thank you for joining us. Ladies and gentlemen, it is

90
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,920
Sunday Sunday the third day of February

91
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:19,500
2013 I am Alex Jones your syndicated radio talk show host and I am very very thankful that you have joined us today

92
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:27,620
Wow where to begin number one, there's new numbers out new numbers out 22

93
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,980
Servicemen and women commit suicide every single day

94
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,380
That is more than seven times the previous record from the end of the Vietnam War in

95
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,780
1973 74 75 when they had bad suicides that is

96
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,660
22 military veterans commit suicide

97
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:53,140
Every day and I want you to know they're gonna talk about the veterans and talk about how great they are and talk about how

98
00:07:53,140 --> 00:08:00,020
They love them and and try to connect the veterans and their valor and their their heroism in many cases

99
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,400
to the

100
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,060
Establishment and the criminals that run our government from both political parties and the whole police state

101
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,600
They're setting up and even though a lot of these wars have been fraudulent and wrong and have been done for globalist interest

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,960
Still the men and women of the military that I've met that I know that I've talked to that I've researched

103
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,860
they are the most focused awake people out there and

104
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:30,220
They joined because they wanted to defend this republic and I am sick of all the fake

105
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,780
Patriotism of oh, thank you for your service to the you know to the country and then okay. Well, can I have a job?

106
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:43,980
Oh, I gotta go. I gotta go. There is a demonization program going on behind the scenes against veterans

107
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,700
that's now busting out into the surface and

108
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,500
There is a public cover that all the government and the media and the system loves veterans

109
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,720
There's a lot of charities out there that have been caught raising money for veterans. It really doesn't go to the veterans

110
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,300
And so I just wanted to mention up front today that we're gonna see lots of stuff tonight at the Super Bowl

111
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Connecting football and mom and apple pie, you know to the veterans and in and trying to make the political system look good

112
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,480
They want you to have the memory of America and the Republic and the Bill of Rights and Constitution that our troops reportedly

113
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,980
protect

114
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,840
While they dismantle the entire thing in the background

115
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,900
While they go to combat ground robots, not just drones in the air

116
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,260
Humans, the globalists believe the ruling technocratic class are obsolete

117
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,580
We are not obsolete. The tyrants are obsolete the old

118
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:48,220
oligarchical systems of control that have pledged humanity in every civilization and every culture for more than 6,000 years are

119
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,820
obsolete we either end this this system of dumbing down the public and

120
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:01,100
Of playing grips off against each other and balkanization in divide and conquer or humanity isn't going to make it

121
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,340
All right. We've got a big broadcast lined up for you again

122
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm live here on the all-holy day of Super Bowl Super Bowl Sunday, and I'm here because

123
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:20,580
Football is not America football is not freedom football is a game that has been turned into nothing

124
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,860
But a giant propaganda arm of the globalist and you're going to see ads paid for by the billionaire Bloomberg

125
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,980
Who got his money from insider operations on the stock exchange?

126
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,780
The gangsters got armed guards and helicopters and the rest of it who flies above us

127
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,340
He is sponsoring. He's the main guy giving money to mayors against gun violence like the guns did it themselves

128
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:47,060
And we're gonna play this ad coming up. He's running an ad there's other ads and they're and they're trying to get donations

129
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,220
Out there to create an anti-gun anti-second amendment move across the country. They're gonna have

130
00:10:54,020 --> 00:11:00,220
The little children of Sandy Hook from the choir are being exploited by the globalist mafia

131
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
They're gonna be singing during the halftime

132
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,200
This is this is something I personally

133
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,980
personally and boycotting our country's in deep trouble folks and

134
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,100
I hear all these other talk show hosts about man the good thing about being America's Super Bowl

135
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,620
I'm gonna savor this big game. I'm gonna I want my Bill of Rights and Constitution. I want my factories back

136
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,540
I want my jobs back. I don't want the government shutting down our power plants while China builds three new ones a week

137
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,900
I think going into depression is a bad thing. I'm not watching games. I'm defending my

138
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,900
Constitutional Republic on this Sunday broadcast and I'm not I don't need to be thanked for coming in on a Sunday

139
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,780
It's an honor to be here

140
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:48,980
It's an honor to be on the radio six days a week broadcasting all over the world warning not just the United States

141
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,140
But the planet about the global private crime syndicate known as the New World Order

142
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,820
Okay

143
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,320
Let me stop right there and tell you what's coming up on the Second Amendment front today

144
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,860
Not just the Super Bowl being turned into a giant anti-gun extravaganza anti-liberty extravaganza

145
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:12,460
So Reverend Jesse Jackson says gun supporters are domestic terrorists. The video is up there

146
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,460
He told the Wall Street Journal this

147
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,340
Four days ago and it made it into two newspapers

148
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,140
about Jesse Jackson on gun violence and economic summit

149
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,220
And the big bombshell is he says we're gonna have to have reconstruction we're gonna have to have the North take over the South

150
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,320
Gun owners are racist. They're the new they're the new

151
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,860
What do you call it a confederacy and gay and again, that's a talking point

152
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,800
I got a bunch of clips

153
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,860
We're gonna play right now and then coming into the next segment where on all these different shows you've seen it

154
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,280
You've read it race has nothing to do with it

155
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,020
And they're just injecting this to create division it is

156
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,900
unprecedented and

157
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,260
You've got Bob Schaeffer on CBS saying we defeated Hitler and the Nazis we can defeat gun owners

158
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
We can take their guns on CBS

159
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:11,140
He said the president defeated Hitler or the Nazis know our grandparents and great-grandparents did

160
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Just amazing. We've got other clips of Fox Sports saying look, you know, the NRA gun owners of the Ku Klux Klan

161
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,300
We've got Jesse Jackson saying

162
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,180
And then meanwhile, I see this every few days now. This is just from a few days ago

163
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,740
MSNBC has host on mainly white house saying oh the racist crackers need to give their guns up

164
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,460
Yeah, the Republicans are all just racist crackers

165
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,920
I'd be like using the n-word talk about black people and it's meant to fire up racial division

166
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,580
In this country and then politically correct groups can slam

167
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,380
Anybody that says hey, I don't like you, you know trying to put me down and everybody else will just through guilt

168
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,000
Basically submit to that so that's coming up

169
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
also, Chris Kyle

170
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
the

171
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
Sniper the Navy SEAL sniper was gunned down yesterday up outside, Dallas

172
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,920
With with the head of his foundation and a PTSD marine they reportedly taken out there. He's been arrested there

173
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,840
They've charged him today

174
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,120
And they're saying that this individual and I'll give you his name

175
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,560
This individual who had PTSD and was under psychiatric care Eddie Ray Roth

176
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,160
Is the main suspect in the killing as a three million dollar bond?

177
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:29,600
Now again, you have 22 service people killing themselves a day

178
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,120
And that's why I brought that up and then every couple of weeks

179
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,320
You'll hear about a service person killing their wife or their boss or something

180
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,560
statistically out of

181
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,920
300 and it's now 20 million people. I mean statistically we've shown the statistics FBI gov

182
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Mass shootings are 88 a year

183
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
88 people about half those gang related

184
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,320
Veterans killing people is not even a thousand a year sounds like a big number

185
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,400
But it's not even the top hundred causes of death in this country

186
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,880
But the media creates this illusion and I remember seeing these Homeland Security reports four years ago

187
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,400
When Obama got in suddenly saying veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians, they're the terrorists

188
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,560
They're gonna attack veterans will use IEDs at every city to bomb police departments

189
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,600
Remember that they were given the cops the training and I thought well that doesn't make sense

190
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,760
Sure, you've got troops committing suicide. You've got them putting them on psychotropics that say on the insert

191
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,240
They can make you commit suicide or go on a psychotic rampage

192
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,600
that's there but still those numbers won't be high enough to

193
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,000
The point is they're going to initiate and stage events. I've been saying that I'm not saying this is staged, but it fits the mo

194
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,840
with the psych

All right, we are back live here. I'm gonna race through the key developments in the battle

246
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,660
that's happening right now for the Second Amendment, and we're winning the

247
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,540
War right now, but that doesn't mean we'll continue to win unless we continue to fight and Forbes is a big article

248
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,940
Where they contracted a large data mining firm?

249
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:57,980
It's actually tracking what you're saying not just what fake polls are putting out and they find that we are routing them on the Second

250
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,620
Amendment, but we were routing them on Obamacare and

251
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:08,180
The fact that it was written by the insurance companies as a forced corporate tax to rip people off and would double premiums the first

252
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,180
Year, that's this year. It's now happening

253
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,300
and have the average family yearly premium be

254
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,500
$20,000 a year by

255
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,740
2016 that's now official, but it doesn't matter they got it in place

256
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,540
They're gonna ram it down your throat just because we're winning the fight for hearts and minds doesn't mean we're winning

257
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,180
We have to go a step further night

258
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:35,060
I'm going to get to that Forbes article coming up in our a winning the influence battle over gun control

259
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,220
I'm gonna explain how most of these big polls are fake now. You can tell them a poll is accurate or not

260
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,780
Okay, let's just stop right there

261
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,780
Again up at info wars calm and our other sister site prison planet calm

262
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,140
Reverend Jesse Jackson says gun supporters are

263
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,460
domestic terrorists and the full interview and video

264
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,660
Is up there, but first I wanted to play some other clips

265
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,380
Here is Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports

266
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,740
Elaborating on how he believes the NRA that means gun owners. It's never the Second Amendment

267
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,420
Does it have to talk about that? It's the NRA

268
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,940
It's never we the people that's the NRA speaks for us, and they're the new KKK

269
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:24,240
Nothing racially involved the NRA shut up to train at the end of the Civil War

270
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,040
Northern recruits and soldiers how to shoot

271
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,140
Including blacks has nothing to do with the KKK never has the KKK in the south

272
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,780
Got the first gun control laws passed in

273
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,680
1868 because they didn't want blacks who were newly freed to get guns the truth is the anti-gunners have the KKK history, but

274
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,620
It's just amazing

275
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,020
It's just it's just so incredible. Let's go to that Club

276
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,300
I did not go as far as I would like to go because my thoughts on the NRA

277
00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:02,940
And America's gun culture. I believe the NRA is the new KKK and that the the arming of so many black youth

278
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
and

279
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:12,380
Blowing up our communities with drugs, and then just having an open shooting gallery is the work of people that you know

280
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,540
Obviously don't have our best interests. You know what's funny, and you know what's funny

281
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,100
It drugs in this country when they started crimped

282
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,020
Making me legal in the 30s the first places it was kind of left alone was the lower income areas

283
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,860
So in a way what this guy's actually saying is true

284
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:36,620
That the drugs were allowed in the minority communities and because it was a pretext to you know basically get control of those communities

285
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,620
But that's corrupt mafias

286
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,780
Knowing they could operate somewhere because others would say not in my backyard

287
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,220
They always try to build the chemical plant in the poor neighborhood

288
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,540
They always try to I mean it didn't matter if it's India and all it is is Indians living there

289
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,540
They go put the chemical plant in the poor neighborhood

290
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,380
Thought about race so much as it is about not in my backyard of the rich people

291
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,400
But just injecting the NRA is the new

292
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,060
KKK

293
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:09,900
No, sir the people in New York and Chicago in the last 55 60 years that took all the guns out of your cities

294
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,900
So that only criminals have them so you have the highest crime rates in the world in places like Chicago and New York

295
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,500
Chicago's number one

296
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,660
That's what allowed this culture and MTV promoting gangster rap and cop killer rap

297
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:29,380
Where I just saw some other famous rappers just shot each other last week. I mean I mean, it's crazy

298
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,900
That's that's that's black rappers putting that out and then the media and Sumner Redstone putting it out via Viacom and

299
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,340
MTV

300
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:45,860
That's not my fault. I don't want you to die. I'm sick and tired of hearing because I'm white

301
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,220
I inherently don't like you now a lot of whites who weren't racist hear all this and go well

302
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,340
you know what I don't like you either, but you know what I'm not gonna stoop to the level of Jesse Jackson and

303
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:59,060
People like the individual Jason Whitlock

304
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,100
I mean these people are a joke and they're they're the racist it's clear

305
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,460
And it's how they sit there and are in our in our identity politic people

306
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,980
And notice they always tell whites and conservatives don't be identity politic. You know why they say that because that's effective

307
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,180
It's effective, but see I don't want to just be some gang

308
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,900
I want people to identify with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and

309
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,420
Declaration of Independence and freedom and all men are created equal endowed by their Creator an

310
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,740
idea our founders had that didn't even get expressed to the last few decades I

311
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,940
Have a dream that will judge people by the character of their deeds

312
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,900
The content of what they stand for not off what color they are

313
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:48,860
but let me tell you something the Democratic Party is now the party of institutional racism and aggression and

314
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,740
It's disgusting. Let's go ahead and go to another clip. Here's Jesse Jackson bumbling around, but if you listen to it. He implies that

315
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,140
States rights movement, it's inherently racist

316
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
It's the new Confederacy

317
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,900
Well, what do you call it when the federal government's run by foreign banks?

318
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,740
Overturning the entire Bill of Rights Constitution the states are supposed to step in with a check and a balance. That's the

319
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,540
Three branches of government and then those two are splitting the two again

320
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:23,000
Just like the legislative split in two. It's meant so you don't get a dictator, but oh no. It's just racist

321
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,340
You're Jesse Jackson these weapons. We're not talking about guns for your house and guns for hunting these military pause

322
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,780
It's always the same script back it up, please

323
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,820
I'm not about guns for your house guns for hunting

324
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:43,020
Chicago New York and a bunch of other cities where these people run things with a globalist liberal socialist collectivist authoritarians

325
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,300
they're not really liberals where they run things they take all the guns and then people like

326
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:56,440
Jesse Jackson has bodyguards and a concealed carry and Diane Feinstein does and Bloomberg does and and and Michael Moore has guns and bodyguards

327
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,060
Charlie Sheen who I know well for seven years you'll probably stay at this house 20 times

328
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,100
You know he's like well. I got bodyguards, so nobody needs guns

329
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,980
Hey, Charlie, and I told him this not everybody makes three million dollars a week like you, bro

330
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,100
It's all about oh we feel sorry for the kids

331
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,980
Let's turn the guns in just as a sign

332
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,520
We're sad for him the globalist we should be mad at the globalist the PR

333
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,440
propaganda is using the dead kids to go after our guns

334
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,540
Again here is Jesse Jackson. Oh, we don't want your guns

335
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,140
Which is not for hunting the Second Amendment in for that you know it's a script folks. He knows that

336
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:34,980
He's following a script. They want the government to be able to totally take over while it arms of the teeth against us

337
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Let's go back to that clip here it is

338
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:44,420
I'm not the hot guy's house who killed the people at Aurora. He was right near the airport

339
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,660
Runway he could blow up airplanes with that stuff

340
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:54,820
Well, we're waiting for that. That's like the next step these anti-american people. We're really arming

341
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:01,740
To stop the government from taking our taken they're fighting the government. This is a confederate ideology. This is like serious

342
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,900
So with power to do something about how they feel

343
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,620
And it's places like Chicago. We need Homeland Security not just the local police

344
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,520
Local police if this is Chicago

345
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,260
And this is Chuck's gun shop right here have all guns are killed put the last five years come from this gun shop

346
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,620
Thinking to them and look at it

347
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,820
They know they know what if this is Iraq. You know the guns are made

348
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,180
We're gonna go to break come back with the rest of it

349
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:35,380
I got a bunch of other clips where MSNBC's Finney says you know it's the crackers everything's their fault white people

350
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,720
Evil flows from white people I mean the ultimate bigotry unit just like the Nazis saying evil flows from the Jews

351
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:48,100
But it's okay because it's the Democratic Party run by foreign banks who want to get a race war going in this country

352
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,700
That's their goal. There ain't no doubt. We'll be right back these people are terrorists

Coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network

We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance

399
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,660
You're listening to the Alex Jones show

400
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:26,940
I will give the number out coming up here in the next segment. We'll have open phones in the second hour

401
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,940
We are into the first hour

402
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,140
Early three minutes into it right now. Okay. We just joined us. I played a clip of

403
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
Fox Sports

404
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:42,460
Caster Jason Whitlock is also syndicated columnist saying the NRA is the new KKK and I have

405
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:47,580
similar clips here by well we had Al Sharpton and

406
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:51,180
Say quote, but I forgot to get that clip queued up. We'll play that

407
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:59,660
After these clips if you can find it say that we've got to overcome the south and whites and the Constitution

408
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,620
He even said the Constitution you saw that a few weeks ago on the niche and it's every couple days

409
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,620
I see prominently the talking point by white black Hispanic commentators you name it

410
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,660
That that gun ownership is right there

411
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,740
And they know how politically correct Americans are if they said put your child

412
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:24,540
In ongoing traffic or throw your child into the oven or the microwave or you're racist

413
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,460
I think most Americans would probably go stick their child in the microwave and turn it on and I'm not even being sarcastic

414
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,300
I think we've gotten the politically correct point that if they came to your house and said

415
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:38,940
Slit your rest or your racist the average white American would slit their rest

416
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,860
They would they would absolutely do that

417
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:48,700
All right, let's go ahead and go back to the Jesse Jackson clip. Here it is. I mean you break it you break up the trail

418
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
We used to guns made in Barrington

419
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,500
Rock Island

420
00:34:53,500 --> 00:35:00,060
So the chucks and put us up they make them to sit in they kill we stand around feeling helpless

421
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:07,580
And so you've got some combination in this drug thing and so you've got some combination in this drug thing

422
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,300
And this gun thing of of territorial fights the gun fights over that

423
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,620
Maybe the four percent would kill assault weapons

424
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,380
They kill these other these locks in these magazines where the killing is taking place there

425
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,060
Some others is just shoot out because just because the culture is into

426
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,620
Guns as a remedy my point is probably focused on fiscal clever and debt ceiling over here is this stuff

427
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,660
Is not on the table and it matters it's metastasizing and it's festering

428
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,960
So we're trying to put some focus on this issue of reconstruction

429
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,420
Not just and we need target job for these zones of heavy unemployment

430
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,300
With black males in chicago and new york member around 50 percent employer around 50 big number here in new york

431
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:53,180
But so beyond just the job some plan for reconstruction and we know how to do it. We've done it and we do it around the world

432
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:01,180
All right, let's go ahead and go to msnbc just a few days ago talking about the real problem in america here it is

433
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:08,540
Those, you know crazy crackers on the right like if they start with their very hateful language that is going to kill them in the same

434
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:12,780
06 the death now for republicans is the tone of this conversation

435
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:18,240
They absolutely we had evangelical latinos wanting to meet with howard dean at the dnc

436
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,340
I mean i'm just saying like that's a shift right?

437
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,740
Now this is part of the hoax that the republican party's gone conservatism's dead

438
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,740
Everybody really wants total socialism. Wow. This is a mandate

439
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,220
I'm going to talk about that at the end of the segment when I want to go back to some of these clips

440
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
here first

441
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
Let's go to this next

442
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:45,500
Clip, this is bob shafer on cbs saying presidents could defeat

443
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
racism

444
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,980
The presidents could defeat the nazis. They can defeat the nra i.e

445
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,140
The nazis they can defeat the nra i.e gun owners

446
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,220
They don't want to say gun owners or the second amendment or the bill of rights. They say the nra

447
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,660
First they demonize the nra. They're nazis. They're scum

448
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,580
They're kkk and then by extension you and then now homeland security met on monday with the

449
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,700
Top mayors and sheriffs and police chiefs as you know

450
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,300
And i've got those reports coming up and said no the new terror threat is not al-qaeda

451
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,800
It's gun owners conservatives libertarians what they call domestic extremists

452
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
They're returning veterans

453
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,080
And they're just hyping that of tens of millions of veterans

454
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:33,680
They'll use every week a veteran robs a bank a veteran shoots somebody. Well all veterans did that

455
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,040
Oh, somebody does a mass shooting gets the guns illegally on a bunch of psychotropic drugs doesn't matter

456
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,240
Doesn't matter. It's gun owners killed the children

457
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:50,960
The veteran kills his wife veterans did that doesn't matter statistically and you can look this up at fbi.gov. We've done reports on it

458
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,400
Uh, they've got it broken down in racial groups demographics everything

459
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,480
You know that uh veterans are one of the most law-abiding groups out there. Does it matter what reality is you are bad?

460
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:07,040
You are bad. Let's go ahead and go to this next clip with bob shafer

461
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:14,500
What happened in newtown was probably the worst day in this country's history since 9 11

462
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,520
We found osama bin laden. We tracked him down. We changed the way

463
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,840
Uh that we dealt with that problem

464
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,320
Surely finding osama bin laden surely passing civil rights legislation as linden johnson was able to do and before that

465
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,680
Surely defeating the nazis, uh was a much more formidable task than taking on the gun lobby

466
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:45,200
Uh, this is a turning point, uh in this country and uh, the president is going to have to do more than just make

467
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,800
A speech about it. This is one of the best features i've ever heard him deliver

468
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,280
But it's going to take more than that from the white house. He's going to have to get his hands dirty

469
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,160
He's going to have to get in there and and work this problem until he gets it done

470
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,160
but uh

471
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,640
Unless we figure out a way to make sure that something like newtown never happens again

472
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:14,400
Uh, we're not the country that we once were I think we still are I think there's hope I think something's going to happen

473
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,880
Well, there you go the president, you know, he overcame the nazis so

474
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,080
So he can overcome the gun owners. See we are now the nazis. We they take you are kkk you are nazis

475
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:32,880
Uh, every time i'm see a clip of of msnbc they're saying whites are inherently bad

476
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,360
In fact, i've been hearing it's it's over for conservatives white women support obama

477
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:47,520
White women support obama black support obama hispanics asians and then the media does this victory dance. Oh, it's over

478
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,940
It's all over for the unknown soldier

479
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,440
And this big victory dance that oh man

480
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,200
It's over and again foreign banks are raping you financially. They're robbing you they've raised the different taxes across the board

481
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,040
They've raised the payroll taxes on people making thirty thousand dollars a year

482
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,280
They've raised all these other investment taxes

483
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:18,480
The obamacare plan sets it up where the companies cut their full-time employees back to 25 hours. They don't have to get the uh insurance

484
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:26,080
And the gdp is already shrinking massively. That's the plan get you on welfare, but it matters as long as you feel like you're winning

485
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
now the truth is

486
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,120
The fix was in as I clearly broke down and it's done hard to break down

487
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:39,920
Mitt romney's a globalist mitt romney was for gun control. He helped write the assault weapons ban that passed in his state

488
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,840
semi-auto ban

489
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,360
The truth is he supported carbon taxes. He supported open borders

490
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,160
He supported abortion. Do you want to keep going?

491
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,300
But they they put out the two guys who were almost identical in reality

492
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,600
But they have a political fight with each other romney then becomes a conservative says some good things

493
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:06,400
But it's all for show like a don king boxing match and then obama wins and there's evidence of massive election fraud

494
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,760
I don't just say that there was evidence of fraud against al gore in 2000

495
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,600
I hate al gore, but i'm on record saying there was evidence of fraud against him

496
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:19,300
There is overwhelming evidence that mitt romney really won bev harris a black box voting. He's been a big democrat

497
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,840
It would help make the hbo documentary hacking democracy said she saw a lot more fraud towards romney than towards obama

498
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,020
The fix was in so the republican leadership gendel

499
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
And and even rand who's a good guy

500
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,700
Could be told to come out by their consultants and say we've got to get with the times

501
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,760
And then we'll start winning I guess get with the times become left of mal say tongue on the false paradigm

502
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:53,540
Because that's what's going on in this country. That's what's happening. That's the bill of goods that we've been sold as a society

503
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,060
And it makes me physically

504
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:01,380
Physically nauseous to see this unfolding the truth is congress for about six years. You can look this up

505
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:08,340
Just type it in congress has a nine percent approval rating and some numbers in data mining companies have put out

506
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:14,180
I'm going to go over some of that in the next hour show or maybe the next segment show that it might be as low as

507
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,700
three percent

508
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,340
So ninety something percent of people conservatively

509
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,420
Ninety-one percent conservatively probably more don't like the government

510
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Don't like the government

511
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,420
but if they can get it in a

512
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:34,820
Coke pepsi ford chevy red skin cowboy seattle seahawks versus the eagles, you know, whatever if they can get a fight going

513
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,580
Between two groups then they can get you to join a bandwagon and kind of join one side

514
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,820
total con game oldest trick in the book

515
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,140
false choice

516
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,820
And that's what they've sold

517
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,540
So there are a lot of weak-minded kind of bandwagon folks that have gotten away from obama the last four years

518
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,540
When he didn't deliver all the free goods

519
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,820
They kind of got back on the bandwagon because they want to be winners. Well by saying you like obama. You're a winner

520
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,460

572
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:19,100
Um in the article up at infowars.com linkedin read in the featured news area

573
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,620
reverend jesse jackson says gun supporters are

574
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,780
domestic terrorist and and basically that the you know

575
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:33,500
The new radicalism the new extremism is this new confederacy and that the gun thing's being used to try to again

576
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,980
It's it's just more of what you've heard of well

577
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,840
fox sports commentators saying the nra is the new kkk

578
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:45,200
And and that's what said if you don't like obamacare, you're a racist if you don't like globalism

579
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,360
You're a racist if you don't want to give it up your liberty. You're a racist. It's racial politics

580
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,480
because this country now

581
00:48:52,480 --> 00:49:00,000
If in the under 20s is way more quote minority than it is white, but if there's uh again under this system now

582
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,300
That's fine. They don't want whites having racial politics

583
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,320
Okay, regardless of which side of that thing you're on

584
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:11,440
There's a lot of different sides, but they certainly are going to create racial politics and notice

585
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:17,440
It's a bunch of white limousine liberals who are leading it because they represent these foreign mega banks

586
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,540
That have signed us on to debt slavery. That's the real civil rights violation that we're going under agenda 21

587
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,460
Where globalist corporations are exempt from all these regulations and taxes designed to shut down their competition

588
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,800
That china could have three new coal power plants a week

589
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,800
We can't have any and hundreds have already been shut down the last four years and our power prices are going up and our economy's

590
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,400
Shutting down. So the whole gun thing is also about scripting obama

591
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,440
There should never be another child shot again. And if there is it's gun owners fault. He puts out that false idea

592
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,240
And then diverts everyone from his drone killings arming al-qaeda and libya and syria

593
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:02,340
Uh, the police state the secret arrest the ndaa the continuing torture the banker bailouts

594
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,720
All of this tyranny. They don't want us getting in a populist movement

595
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:13,060
Unified by the bill of rights and constitution and freedom together. They want to unify

596
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,600
Disparate racial groups under a socialist ideology where their chief

597
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,920
Is government versus the middle class which the establishment sees as predominantly white

598
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,360
and so it is a racial ideology and a racial system for the

599
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:36,560
Globalist in what they're doing. They are they are welding together a racial coalition and i've known

600
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,840
so-called progressives that are really smart people and know what's going on, uh, and

601
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:49,680
They they now will people I used to have on as guests they will sit there and say it is racist to not turn your guns

602
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,240
in it is it is racist to not support obamacare

603
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,280
even though it's a rip-off written by insurance companies it is and and it's like a cult they are just

604
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,060
absorbing into the hive borg

605
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:09,120
These are authoritarians and they get a wild reflected glory a lot of humans are designed

606
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:17,280
To get wild reflected group think group power out of tribalism and the government is the big overarching tribe

607
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,500
Welding in all these different groups and it doesn't matter if the government's screwing them

608
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:27,540
It doesn't matter if the government's destroying their future doesn't matter if the government's injecting them with deadly vaccines

609
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,660
full of cancer viruses and aspartame and thousands of foods

610
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:37,380
It doesn't matter because they feel like winners and that's what matters to them

611
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:40,340
They feel

612
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,340
Like hey the government's my government

613
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,300
In fact, we have an al sharp and clip coming up that we will play that one

614
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,140
They're finding the one where he says we've got to get you know, defeat the Constitution

615
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:53,140
He says we've got a we've got to defeat the Constitution. We've got to defeat the South

616
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:55,460
Played that last week

617
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:01,160
We have a clip of sharp and coming up after I play this mayor clip of this new mayor's against gun violence ad

618
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:05,460
Where he says hey forget the Second Amendment. Yeah, it was there to protect you from the government

619
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:13,100
But we got drones now the government's got drones and that's what they say when I'm on these different so-called liberal shows

620
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,420
He's authoritarian shows in in in liberal clothing

621
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,980
Thomas Jefferson was a liberal these aren't liberals. I know I say that every day is so true

622
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:23,380
You got to get that through your head folks, and I'm sitting there

623
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,980
Even before I went on CNN, they're like, oh we don't want to hear it's for guns

624
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,460
the producer was saying to protect you from government the government has drones and

625
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:36,140
I've been on countless shows you hear it everywhere where they say well the government has drones

626
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,340
Yeah, and humans pilot those and they're under quote the Bill of Rights and Constitution

627
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:45,500
They're not they're not under the declaration of war by Congress. They are illegal

628
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,380
They're attacking countries illegally, but the point is we could get back control of them

629
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:55,940
Our government couldn't take over Vietnam our government running our military couldn't couldn't hold Baghdad

630
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:02,780
So I don't want to hear that because there's drones that you know forget it the hive Borg you will be assimilated

631
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:10,020
Nothing can defeat the New World Order. It's our tax money our energy that built this giant military now

632
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,460
They're getting rid of posse commentatis. They've they announced last week. They're gonna use the military

633
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:18,020
for domestic operations to fight terrorists and

634
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:25,700
Now any gun crime any crime where a gun is used is considered terrorism. That's the big announcement in the news

635
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,700
I told you years ago. It was coming

636
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:35,860
So you're now the terrorists the spying the data mining the checkpoints they've announced they're gonna use the NSA to target quote gun crime

637
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,780
They've announced they're gonna use it to target domestic extremists remember

638
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,420
They weren't spying on us five years ago, and then well we're doing it to fight al-qaeda and now forget about al-qaeda

639
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,180
I've never seen an article. I'm gonna get to where they say al-qaeda is on an issue now

640
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:54,020
Well yeah, cuz it works for the globalist publicly even general boykins come out and expose that now

641
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:02,540
Former head of special forces no no no it's you you're the terrorist well no kidding the thing was always set up for us

642
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,980
It was always set up for the federal government to absorb the states and now they're saying

643
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:13,500
Obama is the new Lincoln anyone that opposes what he does is a confederate and now you're seeing it on CNN

644
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:20,580
Fox Wall Street Journal all these different pundits saying the new confederacy is any state that resists

645
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,420
Obama is here. He is coming. He knows best

646
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:31,260
You know they're gonna shut down the plants shut down the factories raise the taxes till they bankrupt everything except insiders that are exempt

647
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,540
And then you'll go on food stamps. You'll go on government assistance, and they're gonna have national compulsory service

648
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,540
They're already announcing it and the Conservatives will say hey

649
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:46,660
don't let those liberals not work since you know a hundred million two hundred million will be on welfare by the time they're done and

650
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,300
Then you're in forced labor

651
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:56,580
They did it under Roosevelt. They're already calling to bring it back, but ten times worse. They're not going to be building national park

652
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:01,900
Lodges this time they're going to absolutely have gun control

653
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:08,940
Checkpoints that's in the FEMA Corps documents from nine years ago in the Baltimore Sun in the Philadelphia Inquirer

654
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:16,020
How they were training the small units of FEMA Corps college students to assist the police in

655
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:23,540
Finding illegal guns and radioing them in and they have these weird red uniforms black trousers and red uniforms

656
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:30,380
Completely fascist you've seen the videos Obama says we need a national you know a defense force a

657
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:36,460
Domestic force just as big and just as strong as our military and then the videos of the training course

658
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:44,660
Sitting there worshipping Obama like it's North Korea doing chants about Obama and doing military drills. I mean it's our typally

659
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,180
authoritarian and

660
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:51,520
Bloomberg who made two billion dollars off of insider deals the evidence is clear in the stock market

661
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:56,640
who wants to tell you what you can drink and what you can eat and what you can do as illegal checkpoints and now body

662
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,880
Scanners all over New York City a goon

663
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:06,480
With his own private security force that that roughs people up in DC the talk radio network reporter who politely asked him a question

664
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,440
Last week this goon wants your guns

665
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,320
To ensure that his quarry his property is defanged

666
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,320
To make sure you're gelded and now today during the Super Bowl coming up

667
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:21,640
They're gonna air this ad like we're children. Please take the guns

668
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:26,640
Please have a background check when they have background checks in 97% of the sales

669
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:33,400
They want it for when you sell to your neighbor or give a gun to somebody where you can't ever transfer a gun again

670
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:38,100
That's what her bill says and every time they register they then confiscate

671
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:45,400
Criminals aren't gonna follow the law anyways, but the children, please take the guns for us. This is how sick it is

672
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,400
Here's that clip from the upcoming ad today?

673
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Shows cute little children

674
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,540
Once supported background and they play patriotic music in the background when they're globalist

675
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:05,160
We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show

676
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,280
No loopholes anywhere for anyone

677
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:14,360
Oh America can do this for us America can do it, please

678
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,720
And and folks 20 years ago

679
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:26,760
20 years ago lop here said that lop ears now said it doesn't work criminals still get guns and he went further

680
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,720
He said the people don't trust the system anymore. That's right

681
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,700
They don't want background checks because they're angels and really want to save kids the globalist could care less

682
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:40,700
The government shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and killed tens of thousands of people

683
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,860
Several thousand confirmed almost 60,000 dead the last six years in Mexico where they've taken all the guns already

Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary

Economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model is to shut down societies and starve

694
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,240

698
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:30,600
Outages are out in the field strategic relocation third edition by Joel Skousen when disaster strikes by Matthew Stein

Coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network

703
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:06,180
From his Central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues

704
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,860
It's alex jones and the GCN radio network

705
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,060
All right, I haven't even scratched the tip of the iceberg, but I'm not gonna make callers wait

706
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:20,500
I'm gonna get to the strange death the very suspicious death of Chris Kyle

707
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:26,620
Who Jesse Ventura has been suing and winning in court Kyle has had no witnesses

708
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:32,540
Jesse had I think like six eyewitnesses that he came he went he spoke at the commencement he left

709
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:36,660
Why would he come to a thing full of seals and say I'm glad seals are dying

710
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:40,340
He never talks like that and then no witnesses to him being beat up

711
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,300
Kyle

712
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,580
Really was gonna probably expose some big wigs in the lawsuit

713
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:51,300
And then he took a lot of vets out who would contact him say they had problems

714
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:57,600
They probably sent a wind-up toy out on him, which has been declassified. They've got these people Sirhan Sirhan you name it

715
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:02,100
I'm gonna give you my to and I don't just say that okay. It's got a lot of telltale signs

716
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:11,000
But a real PTSD crazy would have those sides to we know he's under psychiatric care so the drugs alone do it

717
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,880
We're gonna look at that. Also the good news out of Forbes

718
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:23,680
Where it breaks down from data mining not polling real data mining the gun grabbers are getting their head handed to them

719
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,700
Politically though they could still go forward. They don't care

720
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,480
But this is the big fight. This is the big issue as I said before Obama got reelected

721
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,580
Well, I'll tell you doesn't Wayne LaPierre and others

722
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:43,660
You get a lot of credibility, you know what remind me tomorrow with the nightly news John go get the clips where?

723
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,220
Bob

724
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:51,260
Chapman before he died talked about this too, but the head of the head of gun owners of

725
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,260
America and the head of the NRA

726
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:58,780
Who by the way the head of gun owners of America's back on tomorrow on the nightly news?

727
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,740
They all said that we have our Intel

728
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:07,740
There'll be a huge attack on the Second Amendment once Obama gets back in and Obama and the media said that's a conspiracy theory

729
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,740
And then now look what's happened

730
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,180
So pretty pretty darn

731
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:14,340
pretty darn

732
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:19,900
Amazing that Larry Pratt and so many others said that and it indeed happened, and then we're going to get into

733
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,340
This whole skeet shooting thing and I haven't talked too much about the last few shows because I had

734
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,580
So many other things on the front burner

735
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:34,100
But Obama says I've been out skeet shooting I've never seen a shotgun like that

736
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,620
He's shooting really weird

737
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:42,140
Looks like a smoke gun or something like a pop gun and the White House put it out and said you're not authorized to use

738
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:44,580
This photo it's only for press and media

739
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:49,620
You can't put something out and vaguely say press and media can use it and then nobody else can

740
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,340
Plus it was taken

741
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:57,500
I actually checked into the law and the regulations and precedent on this with fair use if

742
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:02,180
Taxpayer money pays for a film production on a percent taxpayer funded

743
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:04,740
or if a tax

744
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,660
funded operation

745
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:09,580
Put something out there in public domain

746
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:16,060
They can't selectively say who can't use it and the claim that no one has a right to use or alter the photo

747
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,940
Knowing people would photoshop it and people thought it was almost a joke like they were baiting people

748
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:25,420
To create a new meme of Obama shooting the gun. No the White House photos

749
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:30,500
I've been on there now say copyright, and you can't use these well of course we use them

750
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:35,700
I mean just because these criminals say we can't use our property now there

751
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:42,740
It is Obama mocked for releasing skeet shooting photo during gun control debate and people have got him shooting at the Constitution and

752
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:48,820
Like Looney Tunes where the flag comes out of the comes out of the shotgun look at that weird-looking shotgun

753
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:50,820
I got to say that looks like fake smoke

754
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:55,260
That looks I've never seen I've videoed a lot of guns firing

755
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:58,340
I've never seen a shotgun with that weird white thing on the end

756
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:04,140
It looks like a rubber stopper, and then there's that smoke looks fake, and then the porting

757
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,140
I know they've got ports on the side, but

758
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:08,700
And something's weird

759
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:13,380
Something and it's almost like they put this fake stuff out to create the debate

760
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:18,340
I mean like that it wasn't just that they put that out in layers with a computer program problem

761
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:23,540
It had different type fonts within the same typeset, and it was a fake font

762
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,700
That's meant to look like old-fashioned typewriter

763
01:04:25,700 --> 01:04:32,620
But the C's the D's all the letters had the same splats around them with a real typewriter each splat is different even with the

764
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:37,540
Same letter because it's like a fingerprint or a snowflake. I mean it's just it's a hundred percent fake

765
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,860
I mean you understand

766
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:45,460
There's no debating fake fake fake fake fake fake fake and and I've got a good eye anybody's got a good eye

767
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,940
That's work for Photoshop that photo looks fake that photo looks fake

768
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:54,060
Okay, that I've shot more skeet than I'd care to even remember that looks fake

769
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:57,140
What kind of gun is that we'll be right back with your calls?

770
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:02,860
You prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms

771
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:05,060
But if you don't have a home security system

772
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:10,780
And you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection when you're sleeping or away from home

773
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,300
Who's watching out for intruders check out simply safe?

774
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:21,140
It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless go to get simply safe calm

775
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:28,420
Simply safe is independent and off the grid it runs on battery power so even if the grid goes down you're protected

776
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:37,100
It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed get simply safe calm

777
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:42,180
Simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes

778
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:48,100
So there's no need to let a stranger into your home if you move or need to relocate you can take the system with you

779
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:55,620

780
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,500
Again, that's get simply safe calm

781
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:02,580
We are on the march the Empire is on the run

782
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:06,820
Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

783
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:14,060
All right, we're into the second hour here of the Sunday transmission

784
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:17,940
I'm back weekdays 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern time

785
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:25,940
We're going to be right back with a look at what's going on in the world. We're going to be right back with a look at what's going on in the world

786
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:30,580
I'm back weekdays 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern that's 11 a.m.. To 2 p.m.. Central

787
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,820
Thank you so much again for joining us on this Sunday broadcast

788
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:38,140
I'm gonna go to your calls for the next two segments or so

789
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,740
Then I'm gonna get back into Second Amendment news, and then I've also got some Postal Service news

790
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:48,900
They say they're now immune from local traffic laws and when I saw this

791
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,220
Yahoo

792
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,980
Headline I thought a cop must have given them a ticket

793
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:55,820
for

794
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:01,380
Being stopped in a no stopping zone, but they're able to stop as they're putting mail out

795
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:06,300
and then I read the article and it was about them running red lights and

796
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:10,620
speeding through school zones with kids almost being run over and

797
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:15,140
The judges ruled they're immune that is again the new royalty I

798
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:20,100
Mean and again on average post men and women are really good people

799
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:25,820
I I'm not a big fan of government institutions, but this is one of the first American institutions

800
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:29,300
It's pioneering our postal system invented by Benjamin Franklin

801
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:32,980
And I like the competition that there's a bunch of companies out there

802
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:38,660
Like FedEx and and UPS and then a government one you know where they can all compete against each other

803
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:40,600
I don't like the fact that it's subsidized now

804
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,420
I think it kind of subsidizes the other guys in a way

805
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:48,300
But the point is is that the fact that a judge has ruled there above the law

806
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,220
Katie bar the door it's the same with the cops

807
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,620
They don't get in trouble when they're speeding and it's not an emergency

808
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,300
I mean

809
01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:00,380
This is the new governing class where they're above the law and the UN has diplomatic immunity all the rest of it

810
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:05,780
I guess I already got to that didn't I there it is postal services. It's immune from local traffic laws

811
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,340
Running red lights and

812
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:11,460
speeding in

813
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,460
school zones

814
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,540
You know I was never a big speeder in neighborhoods, but now that I have children

815
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,540
I mean, I just drive like five miles an hour

816
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:24,300
When I'm going through neighborhoods, and I still almost have run over people on bikes little kids run out in front of you

817
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:29,900
Just this week. I was cutting through a neighbor going about ten miles an hour and little kids

818
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:34,260
Came shooting out in front of me on their scooters a little kick scooters

819
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:40,020
And I was one like six miles an hour and thank God. I was right. I almost hit one of them

820
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:42,020
I was going six miles an hour

821
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:47,300
And it makes your heart stop it certainly does CJ. Yeah, there it is Postal Service

822
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:52,460
We're immune from local traffic laws my favorite example is the UPS truck driver delivering mail while naked

823
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:56,380
Or USPS excuse me for I did not mean to defame

824
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,420
UPS is a USPS

825
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:04,620
Okay, yeah, I guess the the USPS is immune, but not FedEx and

826
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:08,340
Not UPS okay. I'm gonna go to your calls

827
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:13,340
Then I'm gonna get to NRA winning the influence battle over gun control. I don't just believe an op-ed

828
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:16,580
I don't just believe a poll unless I've done my own back research

829
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:23,060
Because you have internal market studies you can get out that are pretty accurate see corporations want internal market research

830
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:26,380
That's where you find the really accurate stuff

831
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:33,500
Now I'm gonna be getting to some of that a big data mining company. We are routing them on the gun issue, but for one reason

832
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,740
We are sustained and they admit in their algorithms

833
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,500
we're gonna lose the Second Amendment if we don't keep pushing, so they're telling the the

834
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,260
Anti-gun groups just just you know it's a war of stamina

835
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:54,660
And so that's coming up as well and the Chris Kyle Navy SEAL that Ventura suing

836
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:59,820
He got shot and killed yesterday very suspicious. We're gonna be looking at that some but right now

837
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:06,340
Let's go to some of your calls Kim Michael Darryl Zane Jose John Frank Zach Glenn Dan

838
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,740
Scott and others we're going to go to you

839
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:16,200
Let's start at the bottom of the calls this time set at the top. Let's go to Scott in Colorado. You're on the air welcome Scott

840
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,620
Are you doing Alex? I'm doing all right, but I tell you it's getting crazy

841
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,060
Absolutely is Obama's taking over. I

842
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,060
Gotta say that I've never

843
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:31,700
Thought it would move this quick, but but yeah, he says the UN's over our military

844
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:39,300
He can secretly arrest us if he wants. He's arresting good whistleblowers that expose any government criminal activities

845
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,300
It's unprecedented. I

846
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,620
Have a question for you Alex. Yes

847
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
Who's Mallory Mahoney?

848
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,460
Mallory Mahoney is one of our graphics people that works here at the office

849
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:57,140
Wasn't she formerly with Stratford? Yeah, you guys are mentally ill and I appreciate your call

850
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:04,780
you know whenever we hired six graphics people for the magazine and for working in here and the University of Texas is here in

851
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,780
Austin Stratford is like a

852
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,940
Private intelligence gathering firm that in my opinion puts out propaganda

853
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:18,660
It's like a feedback loop to like agree with the Pentagon's they can say look this private group said it somebody worked there for a month

854
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,340
And a half is a unpaid intern and helped write a paper on China

855
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,180
And and I mean what am I gonna do if somebody was ever in the military or somebody ever?

856
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:30,180
In come you how many people you know about a third of the UT?

857
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:35,980
Journalism people that we bring in here for interviews because we heard a couple from UT actually three of them from UT

858
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:39,980
Did you know about half of them or more at war had an internship there?

859
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:44,260
There's not many places to get a media internship the Austin American Statesman

860
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,740
The Austin Chronicle, this is for print the Houston

861
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:56,040
Or the Texas Observer or whatever it's called that's small and then Stratford because it's mainly writing thousands of things a day that is

862
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:59,580
Mental illness you see we're not worried about the New World Order

863
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:02,700
We're not worried about everything else listen people say I work for the government

864
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:10,280
Okay, I wouldn't get up here and say don't take the vaccines the government's pushing that I wouldn't get up here and say criminal elements

865
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:15,220
Of our government were involved in 9-11 because they were or they're running al-qaeda and libya and syria

866
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,700
I mean just use your brain

867
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:21,400
You know what if I work for the government then I'm the worst government agent the planets ever seen

868
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:28,040
Total mental illness and people always say you need to answer this or you need to answer that and no matter how many times I?

869
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,600
Answer something I will still be asked the same mentally ill question over and over again people are looking

870
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,340
See what's happened is the public has lost faith in the mainstream media and the government which?

871
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,420
Overall is a healthy thing the founding father stated that history shows that but they had judgment

872
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:46,420
It doesn't mean that then everything is fake

873
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:55,160
It doesn't mean that I'm I'm Bill Hicks or that I'm I'm really an actor and the professor in

874
01:12:55,420 --> 01:13:02,440
Florida who says that Sandy Hook may have been staged with crisis actors, which they really have that I'm him. I mean mental illness

875
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:04,860
mental illness

876
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,360
But I understand in a society in crisis

877
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,080
you

878
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,880
Know just doesn't believe anything anymore mental illness

879
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,560
Let's go ahead and talk to

880
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,920
Another caller Glenn in New Jersey you're on the air go ahead

881
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,240
Hey Alex Jones, can you hear me? Yes?

882
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,480
Thank you, sir

883
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:28,200
I'm a caller and I got a serious story here a fellow member of we are change

884
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,400
New Jersey has just been arrested here in Jersey City

885
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:39,120
and they're also trying to link this for gun possession and they're trying to link this to the info wars Obama dictator poster contest that

886
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:46,400
We participated in saying that it's extreme to print out print posters of Obama with dictator scum posted at the bottom of this

887
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:48,880
So they're saying in the Jersey Journal. It says right here

888
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:56,480
MJ comm Jersey City police say man had illegal rifle handguns as well as prohibited bullets

889
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:58,760
And so they're getting him for the muzzle

890
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:04,440
Modification the flash suppressor making it an illegal weapon in New Jersey. Yeah for those who don't know there now

891
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,520
They're no magazine. Sure. Sure. I'm glad you called in about this and listen

892
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:12,600
I've told everybody I didn't just say that last hour to have fun

893
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:18,480
They've officially announced gun owners are the number one new terror group along with returning veterans

894
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,520
libertarians and conservatives the government is so authoritarian so of so

895
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:31,160
Absolutely Marxist at the grassroots of the government. It's foreign banks at the top, but they'll use whoever they've got

896
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:33,400
They are so out of control

897
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:38,440
They're openly saying and I've already seen this not the article you're talking about that anyone

898
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:46,160
Criticizing Obama's a terrorist anybody who owns the guns are racist and that we're the new terrorists not al-qaeda and Homeland Security's main job

899
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,040
I'm gonna say that again

900
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,200
Homeland Security's main job is going after the American people now

901
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:55,720
I'm gonna get that headline again from you so I can search engine it during the break and

902
01:14:56,240 --> 01:14:58,040
Get it up there for me

903
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:02,000
But you guys can probably just search Alex Jones. What is my name in the in the article?

904
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:09,880
But they're trying to implicate me because I participated in the video, okay, so they're saying Obama dictator poster contest

905
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,880
The name is Keith Pantaleon

906
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,600
33 of Jersey City was set to appear at

907
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:21,560
$75,000 bail he currently is in carny prison and my name is Glenn Zarmenov. I'm a long time

908
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:24,280
Let's just stop right there brother. Let's just stop right there

909
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:31,360
So they do talk about my contest to to put up signs saying Obama's becoming a dictator that I did three years ago

910
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:37,080

Coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network

962
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,720
Crashing through the lies and disinformation

963
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,840
It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network

964
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,780
We have to politically get good members of the House and Senate federally

965
01:20:25,780 --> 01:20:32,400
But also state legislatures to come out authoritatively and say look these purges are wrong in Connecticut, New Jersey

966
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:35,400
California New York and other states

967
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:41,920
What's happening is and I see these articles all the time now. We're gonna go over a few of them here in just a moment

968
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:44,380
where

969
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:50,880
Not even the the ban of over 10 capacity magazines where you can't physically possess them

970
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,480
Hadn't even fully gone into effect yet and a army veteran no criminal record

971
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,800
Who actually ran a charity for other veterans? They they have a license plate reading software now

972
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:06,440
most police cars in in in major cities have them and

973
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:12,720
They admit because it's on the Southern Poverty Law Center watch list and ADL watch list that whoever they say

974
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,480
Is a group you now are a terrorist you now have no rights returning veterans

975
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:24,040
gun owners we are change is a group that spun off from one of my listeners Luke Rudowski that just goes out and asks

976
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:26,480
journalists you know citizen questions

977
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,800
I'm in there

978
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:36,680
People that don't like the Federal Reserve are in there and and these foreign globalist organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL

979
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,800
They're there saying if you believe in a new world order you're a terrorist and they brainwash the cops

980
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:44,860
They tell them the founding fathers are bad. I'm not joking

981
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:48,720
I have the training videos in my film road to tyranny they tell them all this

982
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:52,960
They have four shows now airing on TV. We're set to air this year

983
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,480
Demonizing the founders

984
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:59,640
Whole sitcoms dramas like I hate Paul Revere

985
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:05,020
This is the new cool thing as Al Sharpton said we quote must is the quote

986
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,720
Overcome the founding fathers

987
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,400
Overcome the Constitution was his exact quote

988
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:18,320
And you're like, but it doesn't make sense we're racist cuz we own guns well a lot of people that aren't white-owned guns

989
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,760
What it's about individualism. It doesn't matter. They're just gonna demonize you so in the news

990
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,920
They say an extremist was arrested now

991
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:30,200
He brought this up and I actually have the article we can punch it up on screen or go to the document cam shot here

992
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,200
for people

993
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,600
Jersey City police say man had illegal rifle

994
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,200
prohibited bullets at home, and they're saying he had over a 10-round mag and

995
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,880
they're saying that he had a

996
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:50,960
Flash depressor on it, which does nothing so this is it. They're gonna come after the gun owners

997
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:54,760
And they're now even in the places that don't have a lot of gun laws

998
01:22:55,000 --> 01:23:00,640
SWAT teaming people because the neighbors said they saw a gun and going you'll never get your hundred guns back because you shouldn't add a

999
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:04,160
Hundred or just like New Orleans where they went to the high and dry areas and took the guns

1000
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:06,160
So so here it is out of Forbes

1001
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:12,520
NRA winning the influence battle over gun control yes, we're winning in the scientific polls

1002
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,240
We're winning in the inner research. We're winning on the internet scans, but they don't care

1003
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:20,800
They're just gonna say we're terrorists and turn homeland security loose on us

1004
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:23,380
the government shipped

1005
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:29,360
20,000 guns and hand grenades into Mexico the memos came out to blame the Second Amendment. They're ruthless

1006
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:35,720
they want our guns while they buy 1.6 billion bullets and armored vehicles and build emergency centers and

1007
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:41,740
federalize the police and set up warrantless checkpoints now like they have in Austin with the the TSA

1008
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:48,840
Totally illegal totally unconstitutional. They're just doing it huge military drills every day in major cities

1009
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:56,600
Terrorizing the public getting us ready for military occupation Army Times admits. They're preparing to have troops on the streets

1010
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:02,120
It's already happening everything. I warned you about 15 16 17 years ago is happening

1011
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:09,120
Because they announced it today government to take control of private pension funds to protect them

1012
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,680
That's the headline at info wars comm

1013
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:17,800
big government announcement Friday and there will be a special tax on top of the

1014
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:24,580
3.8% tax already there on top of pension funds in Obamacare and the 3.8% increase in

1015
01:24:24,580 --> 01:24:28,620
Payroll tax and all the new taxes because they love you

1016
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:34,540
No, it's the governing class is going to take everything. We've got it's happened hundreds of times in other nations

1017
01:24:34,540 --> 01:24:38,140
It's getting ready to happen here now. I got to get to all the callers, but Glenn in, New Jersey

1018
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:42,060
I'll put you on hold after you go. You can give me all the names and facts

1019
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:48,340
I did find where the other blog where they're talking about yeah, this guy who had the 30-round mag

1020
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:54,300
He he had he was part of a poster contest where they put up posters saying Obama was bad

1021
01:24:54,300 --> 01:25:00,340
It should be illegal these are extremists. Oh my gosh. You don't say somebody the government's bad in America

1022
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,340
You don't have freedom of speech, so yes. Thank you for giving us a heads up about that

1023
01:25:05,260 --> 01:25:09,880
As you were saying during the break when I talked to you. They are going to try a purge of gun owners

1024
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:11,260
They're testing it right now

1025
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:16,380
We've got to get back in their face and go you're the terrorist coming in and taking over our country

1026
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:21,460
Saying our military is under foreign control. That's official and saying our guns are illegal go ahead

1027
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,420
absolutely

1028
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:27,820
Thank you Alex Jones for having me. Don't thank me. I won't have time to get all the other callers

1029
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:32,740
Yeah, no more. I'm gonna put you on hold. I'm gonna put you on hold Rush Limbaugh did this 20 years ago

1030
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:36,260
I got to do it. You just got to say dittos folks all we do is say how great I am

1031
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:40,060
I am not great. Okay. I'm angry. I want to keep my liberties

1032
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:44,740
I don't like a bunch of crooks taking over and running my life. Okay. I'm sorry go ahead caller

1033
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,100
Yeah, they basically look. He's in jail right now. He is a friend of mine

1034
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:53,740
We did the poster contest his other blog the Pope post is one of us question mark

1035
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,740
And it says part of his legal troubles might be linked to this video

1036
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:02,700
That he and a friend made in Jersey City and a link to the Facebook post of the Obama poster contest that we entered in

1037
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:03,980
So yeah, they're kind of smear us

1038
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:05,380
They're trying to do a purge right now

1039
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:10,500
Anyone who listens to Alex Jones info wars anyone who supports liberty and I don't even own any firearms

1040
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:14,220
And that's the whole problem here is that I'm just putting up posters out there

1041
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:21,460
On behalf of your poster contest or any other posters. I've done posters on my own exactly look we have an authoritarian government

1042
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:27,660
Obviously authoritarians don't like their slaves being armed the last thing they've taken is our guns

1043
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:34,220
That's the last they've already taken the bank accounts the dollar. They're gonna take everything they need those guns first though

1044
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:38,100
They're gonna go ahead with it and have a civil war they want to get as many

1045
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:44,460
Voluntarily as they can we've got a Stalin or a Hitler in control, but it's bigger than Obama

1046
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:49,780
The Republican leadership's been told you better go along with it. That's why they're saying. Oh, we got a broken wing

1047
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:56,160
We've got to do whatever big government says it's a mandate socialism turn your guns in because they're controlled

1048
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,260
I'm gonna put you on hold I want to get all the info if you write a blurb about it

1049
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:03,080
We can link to it. You're gonna be okay. Don't let them scare you

1050
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:08,840
This is going on where the crime bosses run everything, New York, Chicago areas of Jersey

1051
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:13,080
This is what it's turned into let's jam in another call here. I gotta get to more of these

1052
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,780
Let's talk to Zach in Tennessee. You're on the air Zach

1053
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,560
Yeah, if you need to I don't know if you call the thing today

1054
01:27:23,560 --> 01:27:27,600
It says three well-known Second Amendment supporters young business owners

1055
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,480
And I know you've covered them all on your show Chris Kyle Keith Ratliff the FPS rusher guy

1056
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:39,280
And then also the John the Vinsky and they said they all died under mysterious circumstances within one month

1057
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:41,440
But that's not even that important

1058
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:45,320
Listen it's really starting to emerge that they've got killings

1059
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:52,800
I mean SPS Russian producer was tied up and killed execution style there are more and more pro-gun people getting killed

1060
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,720
There's this video out right now called Yolo it was all over YouTube last weekend

1061
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:04,000
Basically, it's demonizing preppers and saying that anyone who you know doesn't live life on the edge

1062
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It's basically a call to a young generation to do whatever they want and live recklessly

1063
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,240
And then I know you covered the Milwaukee Sheriff on Piers Morgan

1064
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,920
I was going to comment on that but more importantly than that

1065
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:18,760
Bill Maher was demonizing conspiracy theorists about a week or two ago

1066
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:22,340
And you know they were basically he had all these left and rightists on there

1067
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:27,600
And they were saying you know 9-11 shooters are from the left and whoever thinks the birthday thing is fake

1068
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:30,160
Then you know they're from the right, so they're just playing no

1069
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,880
They're saying you're a bad guy if you don't believe the known liars

1070
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:41,440
But being a conspiracy theorist means I don't believe a government and a mainstream media system caught lying

1071
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:48,640
Thousands of times to me that's what it is today if you question if you don't just on the surface believe whatever they say look

1072
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:54,700
How do you know if media is good you judge the tree by its fruits look at the fruits of the political system?

1073
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,260
Absolute tyranny more calls straight ahead

You're listening to the Alex Jones Show

1119
01:33:36,940 --> 01:33:43,940
Alright we're back here and you can hear the frantic voices of the people calling in

1120
01:33:43,940 --> 01:33:47,940
The power structure doesn't want to go after criminals they are criminals

1121
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:53,940
The power structure and it's really bad on the East Coast and other crime syndicate controlled areas obviously

1122
01:33:53,940 --> 01:34:00,940
They want to target the little guys and teach us that they're basically our owners

1123
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:03,940
That's what all of this is about

1124
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:14,940
Now up on screen if you are a TV viewer I have an article out of the Smithsonian magazine

1125
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:21,940
For forty years the Russian family was cut off from all human contact unaware of World War II

1126
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:29,940
In the 1930s they came to their Christian village the Soviet atheist and they mowed down their families mercilessly

1127
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:32,940
This has been declassified by the archives

1128
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:42,940
And in 1978 geologists were flying around looking for outcroppings a hundred and fifty miles from even the smallest town

1129
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:51,940
And the helicopter picked up what tended to look like tilled fields I want to do a whole report on this

1130
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:58,940
And this family of five lived there the mother had starved to death when her children were small one winter

1131
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:03,940
Refusing to eat so they'd have the only food and they were dressed like cavemen everything

1132
01:35:03,940 --> 01:35:10,940
They had walked more than five hundred miles total from their original village because the Soviets were always hunting

1133
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:14,940
They wanted to kill every Christian they could get to didn't matter how much money needed to be spent

1134
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:19,940
And you can go read the full annals of this it was so important to kill Christians

1135
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:26,940
And these were just poor villagers and it describes how they ran into the woods with just a bag of seeds

1136
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:32,940
And then a blight killed their rye crops the mother starved to death but a year later

1137
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:39,940
They live in different camps over the decades that it took them to get a hundred and fifty miles out in the middle of nowhere

1138
01:35:39,940 --> 01:35:48,940
And the Soviets killed conservatively off and on around 50 million people from 1917 through the 1980s

1139
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:56,940
And before the Soviets could basically get to most of them they caught pneumonia probably because their immune systems were so debilitated

1140
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:03,940
Once other humans came around with new strains of viruses most of them died one of them is living today one of the daughters

1141
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:14,940
But you read about you know the things they've said and what they went through and there were tens of thousands they ended up finding decades later in the woods

1142
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:19,940
And exterminated because even though you're living out in the middle of nowhere 50 miles 100 miles it doesn't matter

1143
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:26,940
You need to die because the all-powerful atheist state says so and of course the atheists come and they're gonna have guns

1144
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:32,940
Piers Morgan said he'd like to shoot me and a lot of Buzz Bissinger said he'd like to shoot me

1145
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:38,940
And a lot of others they talk about how they want to kill us these are horrible people very very horrible people

1146
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:47,940
But America is that's why they demonize preppers that's why if you don't trust the system and you want to be self-sufficient they don't like you

1147
01:36:47,940 --> 01:36:52,940
They want you under their control like Bob Dylan wrote in 1983

1148
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:57,940
Yeah I can see someday when even having your own garden they'll be against the law

1149
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:06,940
Yeah it's sundown on the union what was made in the USA sure sounded like a good idea until things got in the way

1150
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:13,940
Yeah we used to grow corn in Kansas now we grow it on the moon and eat it raw

1151
01:37:13,940 --> 01:37:20,940
Talk about somebody that saw the future and that's what's going on here that's what's happening

1152
01:37:20,940 --> 01:37:28,940
That's why they want you shut down when you punch it back up on screen for folks I want to show the viewers out there people watching at Infowarsnews.com

1153
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:37,940
The 40 years the Russian family was cut off from all human contact unaware and just amazing helicopter photos of their little shack they built

1154
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:46,940
No hammers no nails little daughters that were tiny girls when they ran and I was looking at some of the other photos on the deeper in the Smithsonian site

1155
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:56,940
Showing the aerial shots there it is of the terraces they put up on the side of the gorge to grow the few plants that they had they could also keep the seeds from

1156
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:01,940
In the future you run to the hills with your seeds they'll only grow once then they don't grow the next year

1157
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:06,940
It's all about patenting life all about centralized control that's the name of the game

1158
01:38:06,940 --> 01:38:13,940
And that's why they don't want you self-sufficient that's why all over the country now they're saying you can't have a backyard garden you might grow marijuana

1159
01:38:13,940 --> 01:38:22,940
You might see you're guilty until proven innocent you can't trust a prisoner we're all prisoners now that try to grow a garden in your backyard

1160
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:30,940
Don't trust that in America government's got to come look government it's all secret building bunkers and buying billions around ammo but you

1161
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:35,940
Well they're now saying to see something say something main program is do you see guns in people's houses

1162
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:44,940
And the average anti-gunner is such a dumb mindless domesticated creature that they come in your house they see a gun case they call the police

1163
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:51,940
And the police come and take it even though it's not illegal and they go well there was just a report you may sue us try to get your guns back you see that in the news

1164
01:38:51,940 --> 01:39:01,940
Well we've decided you might be a danger the government is here to break us and I'm telling you folks if you don't wake up and realize how much trouble we're in it's all over

1165
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:08,940
This transcends liberal conservative garbage it's down to freedom versus slavery let's talk to Kim in Florida Kim you're on the air

1166
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:21,940
Hello Alex I just want to say the same exact thing that people better wake up because it's unbelievable I just had a very recent visit from ATF

1167
01:39:21,940 --> 01:39:29,940
They I wasn't home at the time but they knew exactly where I was even the name of the company that I work at

1168
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:39,940
Oh it's incredible I had the ATF like a decade ago say that a gun I had didn't have a right serial number randomly they wanted me to come down there

1169
01:39:39,940 --> 01:39:44,940
And it's just a way to harass you if you're not a Mexican drug cartel ship the narcotics and you're a bad guy

1170
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:51,940
And now it is a purge we are the new criminals they want to fill all their new private presence it's us the gun owners

1171
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:56,940
And we're in trouble the cops want to keep their jobs they'll put us in jail all day long

1172
01:39:56,940 --> 01:40:07,940
Oh yeah and you know we were led to believe like ATF works with the police and when we did some inquiring they said well we don't know what ATF is doing

1173
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:09,940
They could be doing whatever they want to do

1174
01:40:09,940 --> 01:40:12,940
What was their claim we need to check a serial number or something?

1175
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:18,940
No I guess because we had purchased several guns in a short period of time

1176
01:40:18,940 --> 01:40:27,940
Oh yeah that's the new thing if you buy even a hundred rounds of ammo they come and visit you like you're dirty and create a bad it's all harassment

1177
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:33,940
I mean I see the reports all over the news where a veteran visited after he bought two new rifles

1178
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:43,940
And again it's all about you're bad you're the perp you're a criminal you did something wrong it's this new psychology that we're now going to learn how to do the perp walk

1179
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:47,940
That's what TSA is all about learning about lining up learn about them putting their hands on you

1180
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:54,940
Where I live now has TSA checkpoints totally illegal violates the tenth amendment the fourth amendment they don't care

1181
01:40:54,940 --> 01:41:07,940
Yeah and my whole reason for calling today is what would be your advice on how to deal with this situation because at the time I wasn't home and they spoke to my husband

1182
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:14,940
Which I was the one that purchased the firearms and as far as I'm concerned they got all the information they needed to know

1183
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:22,940
That's exactly it you say this isn't a straw purchase I bought the guns for us but I bought them legal and lawfully

1184
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:31,940
You're here to try to create a criminal account a criminal file on us you know full well so just get on out of here

1185
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:38,940
And again these are the ones that ship the guns to Mexico and outside of law they tell it was the gun shop that did it to you

1186
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:44,940
When you buy two or more and they wanted a law two years ago they couldn't get it passed so they just did it extra legislatively

1187
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:52,940
This is a big issue now they're saying they may just ban guns without a law just with a rule making and that's what they do

1188
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:58,940
And then they think you're ignorant most of these gun arrests I'm seeing for a flash suppressor or something they're not even illegal

1189
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:06,940
But the juries are so stupid they'll put you in jail for a wrong statute and the lawyers are also corrupt

1190
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:13,940
They'll put you in jail and make you think you got a deal they want to give gun owners a record I'm telling you folks it's a criminal purge

1191
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:19,940
And listen you could turn your guns in they're not gonna stop they're gonna take look listen

1192
01:42:19,940 --> 01:42:26,940
The heirs and others that were Obama's mentors this came out in trials we played the video clip of it being broken down

1193
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:31,940
They said we're gonna put 50 million Americans in forced labor and we're gonna kill 25 million of them

1194
01:42:31,940 --> 01:42:38,940
Their goal is to put us in camps and blow our heads off I mean they want to do what they did in the Soviet Union and they will do it

1195
01:42:38,940 --> 01:42:44,940

01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:07,940
The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse

1226
01:46:07,940 --> 01:46:14,940

In the heart of the resistance, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show

1242
01:47:21,940 --> 01:47:26,940
Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny that you will live under is the exact amount you put up with

1243
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:30,940
The government is run by real live authoritarians

1244
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:34,940
Who have robbed countless third world countries, the IMF and World Bank

1245
01:47:34,940 --> 01:47:37,940
They want to re-educate America

1246
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:42,940
They want to start a civil war, Homeland Security was set up for the American people

1247
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:43,940
It's a lot bigger than Obama

1248
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:45,940
This is a long term strategic plan

1249
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:49,940
The reason the Republican leadership is going along with all this globalism

1250
01:47:49,940 --> 01:47:53,940
Is because they're bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others

1251
01:47:53,940 --> 01:47:57,940
Now I'm not saying this year they're going to come arrest all the gun owners

1252
01:47:57,940 --> 01:47:59,940
Though they're harassing them and arresting veterans

1253
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:02,940
In fact, here's one of the articles right here

1254
01:48:02,940 --> 01:48:06,940
It was just up on Infowars.com, I actually was doing a search on it

1255
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:10,940
Where army veteran arrested for 30-pound mag in New York State

1256
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:13,940
Faces five felonies, had no criminal record

1257
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:15,940
Those mags are illegal now

1258
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:18,940
And people are saying, well we're going to defy it

1259
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,940
And gun shops are saying, we're going to protest

1260
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:22,940
They're like, good, we'll fill the prisons

1261
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:24,940
And they will, they don't care

1262
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:28,940
It's up to juries to nullify unconstitutional laws

1263
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:31,940
And it's time for these politicians to start getting arrested

1264
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:34,940
They're setting themselves up as God

1265
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:35,940
It happens everywhere else

1266
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:37,940
Look how decadent America is

1267
01:48:37,940 --> 01:48:40,940
But we're not all individually decadent

1268
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:42,940
And they think America's dumb

1269
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:44,940
They think we're done

1270
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,940
They think they can take over

1271
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:49,940
And I'm telling you, they're saying gun owners are responsible for all crime

1272
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,940
We're Nazis, we're scum, we're trash

1273
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:55,940
The government needs to defeat us

1274
01:48:55,940 --> 01:48:58,940
This is the nomenclature

1275
01:48:58,940 --> 01:49:02,940
Hitler didn't even say things about Jews like that

1276
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:04,940
Until he'd been in office two or three years

1277
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:07,940
He didn't even write things that radical

1278
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:10,940
They're saying things publicly

1279
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:14,940
That Stalin didn't even say about groups he was wiping out

1280
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,940
So we're being demonized

1281
01:49:16,940 --> 01:49:19,940
I mean, can you imagine if they got up on the TV

1282
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:21,940
And called black people the n-word

1283
01:49:21,940 --> 01:49:23,940
When they're calling whites crackers

1284
01:49:23,940 --> 01:49:24,940
Whites are on there to create division

1285
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:26,940
And they're calling gun owners Nazis

1286
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,940
You're being demonized

1287
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:30,940
But you have American hospitality

1288
01:49:30,940 --> 01:49:33,940
You're like, oh shucks, go ahead now

1289
01:49:33,940 --> 01:49:35,940
And I mean, it's flooding in

1290
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:38,940
People buying ammo are getting ATF visits

1291
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:40,940
And they go to people with no criminal records

1292
01:49:40,940 --> 01:49:43,940
Upstanding members of the society

1293
01:49:43,940 --> 01:49:45,940
I even saw an article where they visited a cop's house

1294
01:49:45,940 --> 01:49:47,940
Who bought 500 rounds of ammo

1295
01:49:47,940 --> 01:49:50,940
It's the idea that we're all bad, government's good

1296
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:53,940
And the small federal family, as they call it

1297
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:55,940
Janet calls it the federal family

1298
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,940
What are they, Sicilian?

1299
01:49:57,940 --> 01:50:00,940
I mean, it's just amazing

1300
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:03,940
Michael, Ian, Genesee, you're on the air

1301
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,940
Thanks for holding

1302
01:50:05,940 --> 01:50:07,940
Yes, I had a really quick idea

1303
01:50:07,940 --> 01:50:10,940
I think you ought to put a news sticker

1304
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:13,940
At the bottom of your new screen there

1305
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:15,940
That has the Bill of Rights

1306
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:17,940
Or you could also put the Constitution

1307
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,940
Because I'm an avid reader

1308
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:20,940
I know a lot of people read

1309
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,940
And you have a lot of information

1310
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:24,940
And this way it would just kind of

1311
01:50:24,940 --> 01:50:27,940
Nail it into these people's heads

1312
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:29,940
I agree, you're talking about on the TV show

1313
01:50:29,940 --> 01:50:31,940
Start having a scroll?

1314
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:33,940
Yes

1315
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:34,940
That makes sense

1316
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:37,940
What do you think about the accelerating gun purge?

1317
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:39,940
Change and all that

1318
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:41,940
I'm sorry, caller?

1319
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:43,940
I said yes, you know, like they do

1320
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:47,940
A news sticker for the New York Stock Exchange

1321
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,940
And they do updates and all that

1322
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:53,940
On the Bill of Rights or the Constitution

1323
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,940
Is that what you called in about?

1324
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:57,940
Yes, that was one of the things

1325
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:59,940
And the other thing is

1326
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:02,940
You know, I remembered watching a movie

1327
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:06,940
Where it was called Kingdom of Heaven or something

1328
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:09,940
And the knight had everyone kneel

1329
01:51:09,940 --> 01:51:12,940
And he said, as of this day, I'm knighting

1330
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:15,940
You all just get out on one knee and make this vote

1331
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:18,940
I think deputies ought to just deputize

1332
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:21,940
Their public like Barney Fife

1333
01:51:21,940 --> 01:51:23,940
And Andy Griffith used to do

1334
01:51:23,940 --> 01:51:26,940
The problem is they've taken over most of the police departments

1335
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:28,940
We've got a lot of good sheriff's departments

1336
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:30,940
Because they at least know about the Constitution

1337
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:32,940
And they're elected, that's the difference

1338
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:34,940
They want to represent the people more and more

1339
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:36,940
It's time for all of us to deputize ourselves

1340
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,940
Before God and country

1341
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:40,940
To understand real authoritarianism

1342
01:51:40,940 --> 01:51:42,940
Has come to our shores

1343
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:44,940
And the globalists think they can totally take over

1344
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:45,940
God bless you Michael

1345
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:47,940
Let's go to Dan in Pennsylvania

1346
01:51:47,940 --> 01:51:49,940
Dan, you're on the air, welcome

1347
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:50,940
Hey, how are you doing Alex

1348
01:51:50,940 --> 01:51:51,940
Good sir, thanks

1349
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:52,940
You and your crew

1350
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:53,940
Thank you for holding

1351
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:55,940
Yeah, I just was wondering if

1352
01:51:55,940 --> 01:52:00,940
If you've seen House Resolution that was introduced 437

1353
01:52:00,940 --> 01:52:03,940
It's the assault weapons ban of 2013

1354
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:05,940
And also 449

1355
01:52:05,940 --> 01:52:09,940
It helps, it provides amnesty for the veterans

1356
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:11,940
To turn in their guns

1357
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:13,940
And register them and for other purposes

1358
01:52:13,940 --> 01:52:15,940
It's really draconian

1359
01:52:15,940 --> 01:52:17,940
I know, I know, it talks about

1360
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:21,940
There's a bunch of gun confiscation and assault weapons bans in there

1361
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:24,940
It was in Feinstein's first version

1362
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:26,940
And it's got language in it

1363
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:28,940
People understand, they're like

1364
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:30,940
We just want to have reasonable background checks

1365
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:32,940
And they've got gun bans

1366
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,940
Where you've got to turn them in like New York just passed

1367
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,940
Their goal is take our guns

1368
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:38,940
While they sit there going, we don't want to take your guns

1369
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:41,940
We don't want to take your guns, they've done that everywhere

1370
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:44,940
You know, they're now taking the single shots and bolt actions in Australia

1371
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:46,940
See, first they take the semi-auto

1372
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:47,940
Then they take everything

1373
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:50,940
What was the particular bill number on that one?

1374
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:52,940
That was 437

1375
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:55,940
It's the assault weapons ban of 2013

1376
01:52:55,940 --> 01:52:57,940
And it has the text up online

1377
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:59,940
But there was also one other one

1378
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:02,940
It's the House Resolution 40, I believe

1379
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,940
I was trying to find it online again

1380
01:53:04,940 --> 01:53:05,940
And my computer froze

1381
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:06,940
Yeah, we found it, punch it up

1382
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:08,940
No, I've seen that one, punch it back up for TV viewers

1383
01:53:08,940 --> 01:53:11,940
For radio listeners, just go to the Library of Congress

1384
01:53:11,940 --> 01:53:13,940
It's HR 437

1385
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:17,940
I armed the military in DC

1386
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:19,940
There's a bill in there that says

1387
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:23,940
You know, to arm the military in the District of Columbia

1388
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:24,940
No, I know

1389
01:53:24,940 --> 01:53:27,940
And that's like Caesar bringing his troops into Rome

1390
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:31,940
Look, in the NDAA bill that passed last year

1391
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:33,940
To supposedly reform it

1392
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:35,940
It continues the secret arrest provision

1393
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:37,940
And just gets rid of posse commentatis

1394
01:53:37,940 --> 01:53:39,940
That's what I'm telling people, folks

1395
01:53:39,940 --> 01:53:41,940
They are going whole hog

1396
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,940
Republicans have gotten real scared

1397
01:53:43,940 --> 01:53:44,940
Yes sir, we'll do whatever we're told

1398
01:53:44,940 --> 01:53:45,940
You're right, we're bad

1399
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:46,940
You're right, you've got a mandate

1400
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:49,940
It's because it is hammer down

1401
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:51,940
I mean, I've never been this concerned

1402
01:53:51,940 --> 01:53:53,940
This is not a game

1403
01:53:53,940 --> 01:53:56,940
This is a revolution by foreign banks

1404
01:53:56,940 --> 01:53:57,940
This is espionage

1405
01:53:57,940 --> 01:53:58,940
God bless you

1406
01:53:58,940 --> 01:53:59,940
Yes, thank you for bringing that up

1407
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,940
Yes, I'm aware of it

1408
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:04,940
That's what I'm telling people

1409
01:54:04,940 --> 01:54:06,940
This isn't a game

1410
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:10,940
By the way, you can buy the February issue of Infowars Magazine

1411
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:12,940
On the cover it says

1412
01:54:12,940 --> 01:54:13,940
Why the tyrants want your guns

1413
01:54:13,940 --> 01:54:17,940
About 80% of the 60 page glossy magazine is on that subject

1414
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,940
It explains how they're going to take your guns

1415
01:54:19,940 --> 01:54:21,940
Why they want to take your guns

1416
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:22,940
Their strategy to do it

1417
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:23,940
Their strategy to beat them

1418
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:26,940
It is available at InfowarsStore.com

1419
01:54:26,940 --> 01:54:28,940
That's InfowarsStore.com

1420
01:54:28,940 --> 01:54:30,940

You can buy them in groups of 10

1424
01:54:34,940 --> 01:54:35,940
Up to 100

1425
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:38,940
In fact, John Bowne was at the public library

1426
01:54:38,940 --> 01:54:39,940
Getting books for his daughter yesterday

1427
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,940
And said he saw a stack of them

1428
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:41,940
Somebody put in there

1429
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:42,940
So good job folks

1430
01:54:42,940 --> 01:54:44,940
You can also get subscriptions at cost

1431
01:54:44,940 --> 01:54:46,940
And you can give subscriptions

1432
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,940
Give subscriptions to people you want to wake up

1433
01:54:48,940 --> 01:54:49,940
Imagine 12 issues

1434
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:52,940
Good chance of waking them up

1435
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:54,940

Or call 888-253-3139

1437
01:54:56,940 --> 01:54:59,940
We've brought back the Obama Joker Tyrant shirt

1438
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:00,940
Redesigned

1439
01:55:00,940 --> 01:55:02,940
Because the first one was a limited edition

1440
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:03,940
Show is this one

1441
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:04,940
Your purchase supports the broadcast

1442
01:55:04,940 --> 01:55:07,940
Let's talk to Zach in Tennessee

1443
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:10,940
Zach in Tennessee

1444
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:11,940
You are on the air

1445
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:13,940
Zach, what is on your mind today?

1446
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:14,940
Yes sir

1447
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,940
I was just holding from earlier

1448
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:17,940
But I was going to tell you

1449
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:19,940
Did you see the Bill Gates article

1450
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:21,940
That he doesn't care about money

1451
01:55:21,940 --> 01:55:22,940
And he goes on to say

1452
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,940
He's spiritual but doesn't believe in religion

1453
01:55:24,940 --> 01:55:26,940
Did you see that one?

1454
01:55:26,940 --> 01:55:27,940
Yes I did

1455
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:28,940
Yes I did

1456
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:30,940
They're bringing in an entire system

1457
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:31,940
We'll look more into that

1458
01:55:31,940 --> 01:55:32,940
I'm telling you

1459
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:33,940
It's a total global revolution

1460
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:34,940
Ladies and gentlemen

1461
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:36,940
Designing high tech to enslave us

1462
01:55:36,940 --> 01:55:37,940
Not to empower us

1463
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,940
It's a total blueprint

1464
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:40,940
It's called a technocracy

1465
01:55:40,940 --> 01:55:41,940
In their own words

1466
01:55:41,940 --> 01:55:43,940
Let's talk to Zane in FEMA Region 3

1467
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:45,940
Formerly Virginia

1468
01:55:45,940 --> 01:55:47,940
Now globalist occupied territory

1469
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,940
Go ahead Zane

1470
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:49,940
You're welcome to the airwaves

1471
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:50,940
Hey Alex

1472
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:51,940
How's it going?

1473
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:52,940
Pretty good

1474
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:53,940
I read an article

1475
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:55,940
I work in one of the few factories

1476
01:55:55,940 --> 01:55:56,940
Left here in Virginia

1477
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:59,940
And someone had posted this article

1478
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:01,940
It was out of a magazine

1479
01:56:01,940 --> 01:56:02,940
And it was saying that

1480
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:04,940
The way they're going to get the gun grab

1481
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:05,940
Is they're going to make it

1482
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:07,940
Where you can't afford to have a gun

1483
01:56:07,940 --> 01:56:09,940
They're going to make you get insurance

1484
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:10,940
On your guns

1485
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:11,940
Have you heard anything about that?

1486
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:12,940
Yes, no

1487
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,940
They've got state and federal bills

1488
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:15,940
Insurance is a power to tax

1489
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:17,940
The power to tax is the power to destroy

1490
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:20,940
They're hitting us with a thousand torpedoes right now

1491
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:23,940
They're hitting us from every single angle

1492
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,940
And we've got to take their attack

1493
01:56:25,940 --> 01:56:27,940
And show how they're authoritarians

1494
01:56:27,940 --> 01:56:28,940
With bodyguards

1495
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:30,940
And how they've taken guns everywhere else

1496
01:56:30,940 --> 01:56:32,940
And how this is a plan to enslave us

1497
01:56:32,940 --> 01:56:33,940
And turn it back on them

1498
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:35,940
We have to go on the offense

1499
01:56:35,940 --> 01:56:36,940
Or we're going to lose everything

1500
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:37,940
Well that's for sure

1501
01:56:37,940 --> 01:56:39,940
I am sick and I am tired

1502
01:56:39,940 --> 01:56:41,940
And everybody that hears this

1503
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,940
Needs to be sick and tired

1504
01:56:43,940 --> 01:56:44,940
Exactly

1505
01:56:44,940 --> 01:56:46,940
I mean we are being enslaved

1506
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:48,940
Being upset is what got us our liberty

1507
01:56:48,940 --> 01:56:50,940
We need to get upset and awake again

1508
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,940
God bless you

1509
01:56:51,940 --> 01:56:52,940
And I meant to get to this

1510
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:53,940
And I didn't

1511
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:54,940
I'll cover it tomorrow on the weekday show

1512
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:56,940
NRA winning the influence battle

1513
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:58,940
Over gun control

1514
01:56:58,940 --> 01:56:59,940
Appinions

1515
01:56:59,940 --> 01:57:00,940
Appinions

1516
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:02,940
Is one of the biggest data mining

1517
01:57:02,940 --> 01:57:03,940
Public groups

1518
01:57:03,940 --> 01:57:07,940
And the company breaks down

1519
01:57:07,940 --> 01:57:09,940
Off a variety of data mining

1520
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:10,940
What they found

1521
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:12,940
And they have found that second amendment advocates

1522
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:15,940
Are absolutely trouncing the gun grabbers

1523
01:57:15,940 --> 01:57:16,940
And this is a

1524
01:57:16,940 --> 01:57:18,940
Again non-partisan

1525
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:20,940
Non-political analysis of it

1526
01:57:20,940 --> 01:57:22,940
And it says gun rights advocates

1527
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:24,940
Have more stamina than gun control advocates

1528
01:57:24,940 --> 01:57:27,940
Gun rights advocates show military coordination

1529
01:57:27,940 --> 01:57:28,940
With laser focus

1530
01:57:28,940 --> 01:57:30,940
Well yeah because we're people that actually work

1531
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:31,940
And live in the real world

1532
01:57:31,940 --> 01:57:34,940
Any mainline person that supports gun control

1533
01:57:34,940 --> 01:57:35,940
Who isn't a tyrant

1534
01:57:35,940 --> 01:57:37,940
Is just a jellyfish

1535
01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:38,940
They think the government loves them

1536
01:57:38,940 --> 01:57:39,940
And wants to help them

1537
01:57:39,940 --> 01:57:42,940
Government wants to inject you with cancer viruses

1538
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:43,940
And put you six feet under

1539
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:44,940
After you're done working

1540
01:57:44,940 --> 01:57:46,940
