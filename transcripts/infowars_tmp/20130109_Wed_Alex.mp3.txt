big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
Alex Jones
ladies and gentlemen it is Wednesday the ninth day of January 2013 and if you go
up to infowars.com we have on the site the video of Piers Morgan last night
where he said he'd like to have me back on again which I'm ready to do via
satellite whenever he wants and they went on to talk about they hope my kids
don't get killed while my children were in the room and I thought that was
cryptic and then the next guest comes on three of them and says that Piers Morgan
needs to shoot me with a semi-auto and then the daughter of governor Huntsman
ambassador Huntsman says that she'd like to see him dressed up in a uniform
because it's okay he see that he has the authority it was all scripted and then
Piers Morgan says maybe I'll wear my brother's uniform he always talks about
how his brother is in the military and then he tells the Marine who's on it was
excellent by the way that bottom dollar that guy's a listener I want to get him
on if one to get him on since last week he was listening and the Marines you
know explains that we have guns protect ourselves from government not about
hunting and Piers is like well you've done a great job in all your combat you
can have guns but but the citizens can't so I'm ready to debate you Piers Morgan
in fact if you wanted to have a moderator with a time clock and then say
I could present my questions you could present your questions they could
present their questions that way obviously you could still rig it with
you can even have your own moderator as long as it's I have the same amount of
time you could have even you know rig it where people send in the tweets that you
choose from I just want to be able to ask my five questions and we have an
hour-long debate and instead of having a half million viewers I think you're
noticing this now you'd have about five million ten million maybe like CNN you
used to have I mean folks know we don't want to be lectured all day and hear the
Second Amendment demonized over and over and over again at nauseum I mean people
know and they know that statistically mass shootings are as rare as the tooth
fairy they know you're pulling on heartstrings that's why they've tuned
out and you know that and by the way when I was talking to their producers
off-air before I got on they went and looked up the radio stations were on
they went and got the numbers they have numbers they know how to get unlisted
numbers of people that even have somebody else get on the phone I mean
it's definitely government type stuff and they knew they said oh no we know
you have three million listeners a day we know you have 15 million a week we
know and pierce morgan on airs like you have an incredible reach you shouldn't
have it and guess who else said that Glenn Beck I saw 15 minutes last night
on YouTube of him yesterday starting a show that made me really ashamed for him
and we're gonna have jakari Jackson in here later to play some of the clips I
mean went on for hours but it's it's 15 minutes long we'll play a few clips of
it he said I'm a liar he said I am spooky these are quotes I'm dangerous
I'm a fascist and that and and then I'm a liar
I'm a call me a fat idiot yeah and and you know a bunch of other stuff and he
also well his minion called me a fat idiot and he also said that people come
up to him saying they bought 1.6 billion bullets and he said this guy is lying to
you don't believe him and that's why I don't like Glenn Beck and folks you know
I don't attack Michael Savage Rush Limbaugh any of them okay I mean I don't
want Rush Limbaugh to have a heart attack and die so that I get his radio
stations literally I'm not that kind of guy so I'm not like mad at Glenn Beck
because you know he's made hundreds of millions of dollars I'm mad at him
because he's always been there behind the scenes trying to keep me down and he
lies to his audience and then tells them I'm a liar I mean if anybody is a
manipulating sack of garbage it's it's it's Glenn Beck I mean you're the liar
you little nanny

we now take you live to the Central Texas command center in the heart of the
resistance you are listening to the Alex Jones show
all right ladies and gentlemen the biggest story in the country right now
is my appearance Monday night on piers Morgan last night the Daily Show
responded Conan O'Brien responded they did stuff like superimpose a gun in my
hand shooting piers Morgan with the real video from the show it's like something
out of the running man there's the proof that mad dog Ben Richards is really the
brooder the brutal butcher of Bakersfield I mean they could put my
head on Obama's and you know have me walking around saying whatever they want
or putting whatever they want in my hands and and obviously it's comedy but
it still puts out the archetypal image that we as gun owners are violent and
bad meanwhile ladies and gentlemen the founder of SPS Russian the biggest gun
show in the world not just on YouTube about a hundred million viewers on
average a month just on YouTube biggest gun show in the world was tied up at his
offices he's a gun manufacturer and shot in the back of the head execution style
the biggest gun show in the world the founder dead and it's in the back of the
local Georgia papers that it's a state police murder investigation he was
executed assassin mafia style tied up in a chair expertly shot in the back of the
head execution style we have also discovered in military times that other
gun manufacturers and people are dying mysteriously now you remember the head
of the Northeast Intelligence Network who I want to work on getting on
tomorrow Doug Hagman maybe even pop in the day of
eating do it he said two weeks ago on this show but I want to go back and find
the clip it's one thing me to say oh he was on the show and said this and new
listeners like yeah I bet we have to like it's why we gotta hire some more
crew because you guys are working really hard but I need staff to go back and go
okay that was the not the last interview with the interview before last it was
like two weeks ago we've got to go into that interview and he says my federal
source he's got a lot of those sources says there's going to be a purge he goes
assassinations of pro gun leaders and it'll look like you get mugged or crack
dealers go after you and that's why whenever I was being stalked in New York
by what looked like police and normally again you're going to CNN you're walking
ten blocks because they wanted to have a car deliver us I said no I'll walk I
wanted some exercise I want to wake back up as I've been up since 5 a.m. and you
know one guy pops out looks like a cop on a street you're walking up ten blocks
taking turns it goes hey Alex Jones I'm a big fan and you think okay that guy's a
listener but then it happens with another guy then you see other guys with
the with the windbreakers and the obvious cop type I mean once you've been
around this a hundred times you know what it looks like not and I've been
around Bloomberg a few times where he has like 15 detectives around him that's
just security that's exactly how they act the whole confident thing where they
act like gangsters basically these type of detectives
I've been around quite a few of them in in Los Angeles too but they're more like
assassin types look like more like old special forces types in Los Angeles but
the point is is that basically I describe them as people out of central
casting from The Sopranos same look same confident face same deal like you know
I've done a lot of bad things to people and you know enough to where it wasn't
that I was scared at a physical level it was in my gut I said you need to live to
fight another day something's bad here are they gonna drop something on you
what's gonna happen and it kept happening and then they were in the
hotel we left that night that's why I didn't basically sleep took us a long
time to get to New Jersey I mean I left you know you're in hotels paying cash
just because when you've got I know let's not exaggerate seven detectives
following you and looking at you like they want to
kill you it's a serious situation and I didn't know that the day before that
SPS Russian founder had been murdered and I didn't know that some other it's
all pro-gun gun show people they canceled three shows on Discovery that
were top-rated including Jesse James's by the way I got his number and know him
I've said now's the time to get on the show I just need to go ahead and get him
on talk about what happened behind the scenes with that he lives here in Austin
as a listener and all of this is just happening and and then last night I'm
sitting there and imagine this there's a big storm our satellite dishes out blown
out or whatever I live in the country Ron Paul's coming up by the way and our
Internet's not working too good for whatever reason and so I go okay I guess
we'll watch Piers Morgan so we're watching it on the computer and they've
got the first guest on going gee I hope Alex Jones's kids don't get killed and
that guy just comes off like an absolute scripted actor just my view on it I feel
sorry for his loss or whatever but one of the victims families from Aurora and
he's like I sure hope nothing happens to his kids on your own appears like I
sure hope to and my kids are like what four years old eight years old ten years
old and I said oh it's nothing the the internet feed of the show live starts
cutting out so I'm in there reading books to him we're in the bedroom
watching your TV on the computer my wife's there and it cuts back on and
there's a Daily Beast reporter on there a senior reporter and he's saying you
need to get a gun and and shoot Alex Jones and then the daughter of
ambassador Huntsman says oh I'd love that we're gonna play it here in a
moment and then Piers Morgan says you know I
could dress up with my brother's uniform
so this is just very bizarre and then there's all the quotes about how groups
want to kill the NRA president or go after Larry Pratt mother Larry Pratt's
popping in today he's gonna be on Piers Morgan tonight head of Gun Owners of
America so this is a type of stuff going on and even more prominent gun owners
because if I was the globalist I even said privately around here I said if
this is true they'll kill people like F's FPS Russia because if you don't know
what that is it's the most popular gun show in the world it's online and it's
probably had 10 times the viewers of top shows on Discovery Channel that they've
now just canceled
600 million views on YouTube alone and they were accelerating it took them a
couple years to get a hundred million views and now the last year or so they
got another 500 million views they've got all these other platforms with
hundreds of millions of views I mean they were dominating making guns fun
they started getting girls in bikinis out there shooting machine guns and I
said if this purge is real they will go after those guys first because see I'm
here politically trying to wake people up what really works is making guns fun
and sexy and now that guy's dead and some other people have been killed I've
got a video an article up at info works calm about it some other prominent
pro-gun people have died mysteriously and I'm getting followed by guys that
are looking at me like they want to kill me
and and again I'm telling CNN security when they're walking aside I go I want
to go out the mall entrance it's open and they go no you're going out this way
and I knew the entrance was right behind me to the mall there's a big mall it's
built into a mall and I didn't want to have a confrontation I was like all
right start rolling your camera as we're walking out so we catch one of the
detectives and he turns what looks like one of the detectives you know in
talking into a sleeve and walks into the wall walks into the corner it was that
pathetic and there's other guys and dudes like you want to get footage I
think he heard some of it last night I didn't I couldn't watch the nightly news
shows I was driving home at that time he did air it and there's like two more of
them coming down cops like this and I go taxi and we jump in a taxi and I'm like
don't drive me to my hotel drive me somewhere else we drive a few blocks
over and I walk up and now the streets blocked off in front of our hotel I'm
like that's it I walk in there's more of the guys sitting there waiting for us
with newspapers looking up we come in I'm like let's get out of here and these
guys were in suits so let me tell you there may be the beginning of a purge
against gun owners and we cannot and they're gonna go after those of us that
are prominent if I get pulled over and the cop claims I pulled a gun on them
it's not true if I get shot in the head I mean I've seen they executed a CIA guy
a few years ago at Carney was his last name in Houston and they just get him
out of the car he steps out and they just the cop shoots him in the head the
news said well that's okay he's allowed to do that and he'd been blowing the
whistle according to our NSA source well I have one it one NSA source and then
one that's public I have Wayne Madsen and he confirmed what our other source
said
so if they just pull me over to shoot me in the head hey I'm a martyr just know
it's on canary in the coal mine if they if I'm found dead in a hotel room with a
hooker I don't go to hotel rooms with hookers I don't use illegal drugs I
don't even use prescription drugs I mean I've had like broken legs before and
didn't want to take the painkillers that makes me nauseous
if if a if I get run over walking down the street you can bet I was killed if
I'm struck by a bolt of lightning you can bet I was it was a setup another way
they'll do it is if I get carjacked
I mean they killed a Palestinian activist who was a professor who wasn't
doing anything and his arms and legs were duct tape and his throat slit in
the ear and I had to lose a progressive Muslim group pretty mainline and I had
the imam call me I think he may have been on the show and they talked about
they got the body from the APD and then it later came out in the news and he'd
been tortured to death and he was all bound with duct tape and the police said
well you can you can be get bound with duct tape and slit your own throat and
stuff and throw yourself into Lake Austin which is really a river Colorado
River they call it like Austin I'm sorry they changed name again it's now
Ladybird Lake maybe they'll call it you know possum lake next I don't know but
if I get found with duct tape I mean it's like Fannie Malick the Arkansas
medical examiner under Clinton where people have their arms and legs cut off
machine gun in a trash pile and they'd say the person killed themselves you
cannot chop your arms and legs and head off it's like when they killed Gary Webb
the Pulitzer Prize winner on Dark Majesty and Dark Alliance the CIA drug
dealing he had a new book coming out totally documenting it even more and I
talked to friends of his said his house was getting broken into he'd moved he'd
seen Special Forces guys from his two-story sliding down the drainage
poles like in a movie and they had him sign a deal saying that he was you know
gonna commit suicide that shot him twice in the head first they blew his jaw off
they really killed him with a shotgun the police had a revolver so just just
get it straight folks they may start killing us stay with us

Eastern it's 9 a.m. to noon Pacific 10 to 1 Mountain 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
central in fall Wars calm and prison planet calm are the websites prison
planet TV streams the video the radio and nightly news and of course we also
have the audio streams at info Wars calm as well we're on xm 166 and over a
hundred and almost 150 am an FM affiliates across the country Ron Paul
is coming up I was just walking back there and CNN was re-airing a clip of
what we're about to play here so this is the message being sent out this is what
they said on CNN last night on Piers Morgan before they called for me to be
shot in the next panel here is a clip from Piers Morgan I don't want Alex
Jones to get the phone call at three o'clock in the morning that one of his
children have been shot and killed by somebody who shouldn't have a handgun or
a rifle or a automatic weapon I don't want him to get that phone call no I
think that's the reason that is the whole point of you yeah that is the
whole point okay and so I'm watching that and then the next panel comes on
and again this article is up at info Wars calm you can go to the site Piers
Morgan and guests discuss shooting Alex Jones it's the bottom of the featured
news we're gonna move it back to the top of the featured news it's also a drudge
report calm on the left-hand side by the Piers Morgan photos an easy way to find
it and here you have in this clip Daily Beast writer Buzz Bissinger says Piers
Morgan should pop Alex Jones with a semi-automatic weapon then Abby Huntsman
it looks like her father with a wig on the governor and ambassador to China top
globalist just absolute New World Order pusher said I'd love to see that in
uniform because that's psych warfare oh you're in a uniform you kill him it's
okay and peers does maybe I'll wear my brothers who's been in the military so
Piers Morgan is saying I'll borrow my brother's uniform to shoot Alex Jones
now people can say oh that must be a joke if I would have said hey Piers
Morgan I might get a gun and shoot you I guarantee you they would have
arrested me on the spot and they had the plainclothes detectives they're milling
around inside now I guarantee it and this is becoming a story some picked up
by several newspapers because they all basically get their their newsroom info
from drudge report calm I appreciate drudge putting that up there because I
need to I need coverage of this or I'm I mean we're all hanging together here are
we hang separate I mean this is really coming down to the wire and they're in
there finding the Doug Hagman clip from two weeks ago where he said they're
gonna start killing prominent proponents of the Second Amendment and I noticed
that they're saying I'm dangerous I shouldn't have a platform Glenn Beck
said the exact same thing we're getting clips of that for later and I got to
tell you it's creepy this is not the type of attention I like but I've got to
do it all I can do is speak up and get in their face and try to get folks out
of their trance and I just prayed to God help me do a good job and that's what I
did and yeah I'm the guy in the arena it's easy to be the critic out there but
what about the person in the arena who's got the dust in their eyes and who's
bloodied in the fight who knows the great you guys print me the Teddy
Roosevelt cloak I want to cover that let's go ahead and now go to this clip
of a man that looks completely deranged
the author of Friday Night Lights it's actually pretty good book up there
fantasizing and I've been around these people behind the scenes with quote
liberals all they ever talk about is how they want to shoot us and kill us see
they're not liberals they're authoritarians and here is the clip
where they fantasize about dressing up in uniforms and shooting me here it is
but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you
need it is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a
semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to see that I borrow
my brother's you think guns are more guns are the answer here I mean there
are a lot they keep saying to me more guns that's crime more guns that's crime
in fact that's just not backed up by any real evidence it's not and and we talked
about that's not true not intend to live in a society the modern society that we
live in today I mean just they always tell us what the founders stood for
ladies and gentlemen since guns proliferated the last 20 years I've
shown you the statistics about 50 times I'm not gonna do it again fbi.gov over
20% crime rate drop in the last 16 17 years but now you look at it and most of
it in the last five to six years 11 to 12 percent of it depending on how you
cut it has happened just since 2007 and that's the new crime numbers from 2011
they come out a year later they're very accurate statistics compiled by local
police departments and integrated with federal numbers violent crimes get
reported and violent crime is down because criminals are getting their butt
shot off everywhere by the way of the 11,000 people the diver here most of its
gang bangers and the rest is suicide it's a very small portion of innocence
but see out of 315 million people they can show a one guy shooting his wife
once a week and make it sound like it's an epidemic all right we'll be back

well it's our first visit with Ron Paul of 2013 he is now the former
congressman the first time I interviewed him he was running for Congress again I
guess back in 95 96 and he'd been in Congress once before as a libertarian
and of course went back as a Republican and he has been our greatest defender of
Liberty worldwide loved and admired he's got big announcements coming up soon
I've heard the rumors and I'll see if he'll give us any hint but he joins us
obviously to talk about the fiscal cliff that he said we've already gone over a
long time ago what's happening with that the Sandy Hook shooting the announcements
of the NSA openly spying on us it's like everything Ron Paul talked about 15
years ago and got called a conspiracy theorist is now just out in the open and
former congressman and really Omni Budsman of Liberty worldwide thank you
so much for spending time with us did you have a good Christmas yep very good
family got here we had a lot of fun and didn't solve any world problem I wish I
need to learn how to unplug as well Wow you know you heard what I threw out
there sir where would you like to start first well the things that I've talked
about is mostly well the general you know deterioration of our individual
freedoms and our liberties in our market but I think the big thing as I went down
my career dealt with you know financial and the economy and I think both major
parties and most members of Congress are in total denial as to what the real
problem is because they think it's just a budget you know well if we change this
number raise taxes cut spending you know pretend to cut spending we saw the
problem and I think it's much bigger than I think first off the country is
bankrupt we're insolvent we can't pay the bills and they won't admit it I mean
we have these obligations of 220 trillion dollars a national debt of 16
trillions we're the biggest born debtor nation ever and that is ignored and they
they talk about you know what they're going to do with tinkering with the tax
code and and they talk about cuts which aren't cut there it's just all deceit
and trying to fool the people into believing that they can tinker with a
budget but I think the problem is is government is too big they don't follow
the Constitution they don't know what the rule of government ought to be in a
free society and they don't admit we're bankrupt and oftentimes I've used this
saying that are we going to go over the cliff well in many ways we're over the
cliff in that we're not going to retrace ourselves if you're over a cliff you
just don't have a chance to climb back up and we really don't we're not going
to have enough people in Congress in the next go around or do we have them now we
have better people now and we're gonna have some people speaking for us but we
can't go back and all of a sudden balance our budget remove the
regulations and protect our liberties all we have to do is listen to our
president what his plans are but the Republicans aren't you know doing a
whole lot more because we have we're doing we're facing a situation where it
took a hundred years for our governments and our schools to indoctrinate our
people to accepting the idea that the role of government ought to be to take
care of us and provide perfect safety and make sure nobody falls through you
know the net and and take care of people and the whole world and I think we have
to address the subject what should the role of government be the founders made
an attempt at it they wrote a constitution we don't obey it and to me
if we would accept the notion that the role of government is to protect our
freedoms to provide some national defense for us providing a sound
currency and protect our liberties there would be no warfare state and there'd be
no welfare state and nobody wants to address that you know in all this talk
neither and there's neither Republicans or Democrats would even suggest about
cutting the militarism the only talk was should we increase the military
expenditures by 18% or 20 the people who wanted 18% were castigated for slashing
national defense instead they were you know unpatriotic so that is where the
mess is I see the mess that we're in a problem of education the consequence of
a hundred years of control of many generations indoctrinating them into bad
economic policy and bad foreign policy congressman you've talked about
globalism the Bilderberg group people like that but it's now in the financial
times of London it's in hundreds of papers that we can probably pull some up
and put them on screen where they announce global government by the six
mega banks and I listen to Bloomberg Financial on XM and they brag that
they've conquered Europe with debt they've signed the Europeans on to
derivatives they've got them dependent on socialism but most of the debt is
actually the central bank's debt that are really private and now I see them
wrecking us congressman on purpose to make us debt slaves while also making us
dependent I mean surely they know the facts even the Congressional Budget
Office as you know three four years ago said we were bankrupt all these other
government economists have admitted this so you're not just somebody studied
economics you're also a medical doctor it's kind of like a patient that's got
cancer all over their body this is already a done deal so what's your take
on my statement that we've been maneuvered into rack and ruin by loan
sharks I mean I think it's important to not just say they're a bunch of buffoons
in DC Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and others in my research are just mafia
organizations that want us as basically debt slaves on a sharecropping
plantation partially true but it also involved indoctrination through through
education it's just not ten or fifteen people who get together and all of a
sudden they can change people's minds people endorse Keynesianism they endorse
the Federal Reserve they endorse us being the policeman of the world and we
should have these wars in the Middle East so they have been indoctrinated and
yes there are a few who are going to benefit but you know I don't I can't
read into their minds I don't know they sit back and say you know what we're
going to bankrupt the country and cause its chaos I think they try to get away
with manipulating and maneuvering and benefiting themselves both with power
and money and philosophically it doesn't doesn't work out so they have to react
so they take advantage of it sort of like taking advantage don't let a major
crisis and go to waste I mean they create the problems they think they're
going to get away with it and then when the crisis hits they make use of it and
they say well we had well we have to do they're motivated by money and power and
they have to control sure they're smart enough to on a daily basis say well
we're going to do a and B is going to be resolved I think there are mostly
unintended consequences that occur and they and they react I'd like to get
people to react differently I agree with you that at the mid level even the upper
levels obviously it's just a corrupt system people been born into now but I'm
talking about the hundred and twelve point plan that got leaked out of the
World Bank when Joseph stick let's resign the Nobel Prize winner economics
in 2002 it talked about how they manipulated third world countries into
bankruptcy to take control and it discussed doing it to the west so at
Bilderberg from our sources but also at Davos they I've got Herman von Ruppe
head of the EU saying we're going to use the financial crisis to bring in the New
World Order well you know that may be and I don't know every individual who
makes these plans but I do know that I meet a lot of people who believe I mean
you take a guy like Bernanke I think Bernanke actually believes that joke you
know I think he really believes that he's been sent here by the Creator to
make sure we never have a Great Depression before because they didn't
put the money fast enough I don't think he he sits and says and goes much
further than this because he has invested a lifetime into proving this
ideology I think he's wrong he's determined to prove he's right so he
creates truly sure it's in these people that you're talking about they know
what's going on and they line up and they get involved and they learn how to
manipulate the system for political reasons so we we know that our president
has an agenda and it's very very clear so he works his agenda with the system
that exists I agree with you there's different factions who only care about
themselves and together the the perfect for me you're saying he thinks he's
right you think you're right sir you know I watch a speech that's in our film
matrix of evil you gave in 2003 at McKinney roughs right outside Austin
here in South Austin and you laid out everything that was going to happen how
they'd use the drones here how they'd have the NSA spy on us how they would
use the Patriot Act on the citizens how how when they collapse things they would
use that to take full control how the derivatives bubble would work it's like
you're a prophet but you're not you were in there in the committees you've
studied history you know what was gonna happen you said the stimulus would work
you said all these things wouldn't work you said that the Republicans would vote
to raise taxes $1 of cuts for every 41 and spending increases 77% of Americans
with tax increases on payroll I mean it's like the lying and what's happened
is we've been eased into this tyranny and so now you're here saying well we'll
see who's gonna be proven right you've been proven right congressman toot your
own horns well I will keep tooting my horn about what I believe in because I
think there are those who do exactly what you're talking about I remember
very clearly George Bush senior you know when the WTO came in and you say that
now so much of these plans are out in the open and I think George Bush put him
out in the open when he said I saw a major ad I think was in the New York
Times or something that we put on the third leg of the New World Order before
that you couldn't say New World Order out loud I mean or you were a complete
idiot or a nut job but he put it out he says we have it now we have the WTO we
we have the IMF and we have the World Bank and I think yes but they have a
philosophic belief that world government is good and some of them believe it
because they think world government just like world communism is is good and and
some people who join communism they were sincere they thought it was good but
others are driven by power they're driven by wealth and control and they're
they're psychopathic and they want to use force against people so I think they
feed on each other is what I think happens but I think if you get but all
governments reflect popular opinion and there's no I agree with you I've heard
you say over and over again this is happening because we become lazy
decadent slobs I work some days 18 hours a day but I'll be honest compared to my
dad or somebody like his dad who grew up on farms they enjoy working they can fix
anything they I mean my dad I call him at 3 in the morning and he'll come help
me and I worry because I mean I'm a shadow of my dad he's a shadow of his
dad I'm not teaching my kids to work that hard like I I mean I I think we
really are degenerating and I'm not I'm not romanticizing old-timers I just know
that people used to be closer to the ground more street smart and harder
working more independent and not as decadent and there is a feedback loop of
decadence now that's almost impossible to escape well I know exactly what you're
talking about would agree with you to a great deal but also look for the
positive things because if I look at the young people that come out for my
rallies I see young people who are very dedicated they're very principled their
idealistic and they're not decadent when it comes to computers and the Internet
they're pretty darn smart and I don't know the technology but I know how
valuable it is and I'm able to use it and get other people to help me so in
that sense I become the optimist because technology so far in most of all of
history has always been used to enhance the power of the state and to kill
people you know this is one time if we're smart enough that we ought to be
able to use this technology and spread information you do it all the time you
you know about the technology we're spreading this message so I I get to be
optimistic that all we have to do is continue this and that is why in my
farewell speech the most dangerous trend that we have to stop is the threat to
our civil liberties our ability to resist you know what is the what are
these people how many people are going to be arrested you know and put in
secret prisons and how often are we going to be able to maintain our First
Amendment rights and our Second Amendment rights that is the protection
of civil liberties it's most important but the best way to do is awaken a
generation and we have the tool and it's the internet and we have a very
responsive young group and they what happens to the establishment they eat
this out of us they do it with every generation to make you feel like you're
a bad guy because you think freedom is good now our job and we have these tools
is to make sure that this whole new generation knows that freedom their
instincts are right we're all natural believers in Liberty we're all
libertarian in the sense that we want to be left alone but it's beaten out of us
by our system the movies that schools the government all these things so I see
a tremendous opportunity and I hope I'm not totally deceiving myself but I'll
keep working with the assumption that we can change people's mind yes sir and to
be clear I was speaking in generalities like you did in your powerful farewell
address from Congress that's gone so viral out there thank God thanks to
drudgereport.com and other big sites that posted it millions and millions of
views just on the internet alone that obviously there are the Liberty loving
people who are a growing minority but it's it's pretty much the wheat from the
chaff people are either getting totally mind blown and accepting any level of
corruption or they're getting more and more active and we have to take heart as
you've said 5% started and won the Revolutionary War well we're trying to
win an inflow war we've got more like 25 30 percent now that are awake all we've
got to do is wake up others and then we're gonna take the country back and so
there's a race by the authoritarians to take over but that there's good factions
people need to know that yeah you're absolutely right and the thing that's on
our side is not only has our message grown in popularity and we've been able
to spread it but the opportunity is the absolute failure of their system
communism you don't hear people come on you know I'm a communist I think the
communism is gonna take over the world communism failed it fell apart the
Soviet system doesn't exist but Keynesianism the planned economy
welfareism inflationism it's failing it's failed over and over again and they
keep saying capitalism has failed no that's a big challenge we have to make
sure that we don't get blamed it isn't capitalism fail they haven't ever
really even tried total free market and that's what we should force on them I
agree with you moving quickly there are other points campaign for liberty dot o
RG I've been told you know a little bit here a little bit there from different
folks you've got three big things that are going to be announced soon a can you
give us any sneak peek and B when will this announcement come a Ron Paul
a lot of things I've been talking about and planning for they're not quite ready
but there's a possibility I'll be able to do some type of programming you know
on the internet not on regular TV and if that works out you know I think we can
get a big audience for what we're doing I'm going to be very interested in
promoting homeschooling because I talk about education all the time and I think
the public school system is feeling and you know it isn't the rich people that
are taking their kids you know doing the homeschooling but I think average people
and even poor people can salvage their children from the system by by
homeschooling and I'm also going to be touring the colleges soon I will be
starting that so I'll continue to do that so I have a lot of things that I
can do but they're not all firm yet that's right but I mean I heard about a
Ron Paul theatrical release Ron Paul TV and something else I heard is being
planned I want to make sure you know little birds tell me this and that but
you know I keep my ear to the ground all I know is very exciting and I'm not
taking this moment to bash Glenn Beck I've tried to be nice to him but he says
he's not a leader of the libertarian movement because he told me that your
supporters four years ago we're gonna blow us up with bombs and that we did
Oklahoma City and then he keeps you know saying that we shouldn't get in the
government's face I mean my only deal with Glenn Beck is he says I'm dangerous
and basically shouldn't be on the air Piers Morgan basically says that as well
and then now he tells me that he's my leader and he's now going to become Ron
Paul and Alex Jones I guess mix to do you have any comments on that not too
much because I don't know exactly what he's talking about all I can do is speak
for myself what I believe in on what I'm trying to do and I've been pretty much
upfront on you know what the principles are and in which direction we should go
and effort I I think I do one thing differently than others and that is I try
to stick to you know ideas rather than personalities and of course we've already
mentioned the president and I mentioned George Bush but over the years I
basically don't attack the individuals I don't surely attack sure but you didn't
call him a demagogue when he said that your supporters want to blow up
buildings that's for sure but generally speaking I don't I don't do the
personality thing that is doesn't mean that matter of fact if you do the
personality thing you get a lot more attention but I don't want it to distract
if people want they'll try to entice me to say what should we do with Bernanke
how should we punish them remember what our governor said that we should do with
them I I might agree with it I might even say things along that way but most
of the time I'll go and say it's the system it's the system of the Federal
Reserve no I agree I agree is what I want to concentrate some people will
concentrate on different things they'll have different tactics and different
viewpoints and I think I think that's fine no no listen I think Glenn Beck
does a lot of great work and has gotten better and better he is just
systematically I don't in fight you'll never hear my show talking about other
people that are in the Liberty Movement he just routinely says I'm he said I
made up the 1.6 million bullets even though that's AP Reuters direct federal
purchases you know I'm making up the police state I'm making up NSA spying
your supporters want to blow buildings up I mean he is trying to gatekeep and
I'm just warning you that that unless you join with Sauron dr. Paul he's gonna
he's gonna stab you in the back and I'm only saying that like kind of like a
chart when you're coming into a bay in a boat I'm just marking the chart dr. Paul
but you're a smart guy you know that we've only got about six seven minutes
left in closing Sandy Hook and now the Feinstein bill and others to make us
physically turn them in not just go back and re-register with the ATF at their
pleasure now they want to just open where they decide law-abiding citizens
turning their guns in what is your take on that and are you concerned about a
purge or persecution of gun owners well I'm concerned about their
inconsistency they want to get rid of guns because somebody used a gun and did
some violence but we all know that more people are getting killed with hammers
and fists and knives so they're not very they're not very consistent they see an
opportunity they they they want to get rid of the guns some people believe
they're dangerous and want to get rid of them and other people want to get rid of
them because they know that guns can resist the government tyranny and some
people like the idea that governments become tyrants and they should run
things as long as the government kills children it's okay so they want to
protect that you know all that scandal and outcry which much of it was
justified seeing kids getting killed it's a horror but at the same time how
about those people who are saying okay this is an excuse to take away the
rights of people who use guns to defend their family how many of them are
shouting and screaming about the children that our drones are killing on
a daily paid basis because they're Muslim kids and different color and
they're overseas and and nobody has to line them up and shoot them we can do it
by directing drones from this country that doesn't even count so that's that's
what their whole goal is is to distract us from some of the horrors that
government perpetuate and the way they destroy our liberties and they
perpetuate the violence I mean compared to the violence that governments have
perpetuated on the people versus what the people do to each other there's no
contest historically government's the number one killer as you know university
studies out of Hawaii and others 292 million people killed the 20th century
non-military combatants we have a red alert serve that just came out while you
were on with us drugs report calm weekly standard AP you name it Obama White
House threatens executive action to physically confiscate the firearms
Biden has now given a speech sir they've got a bunch of state reps and federal
reps I've literally got over 10 articles they're all calling for executive orders
and Obama is saying now that he may he'll do everything in his power
including executive orders ladies and gentlemen this is what we feared
congressman constitutionally that's beyond a constitutional crisis as a
constitutional expert sir if he signs an order ordering we turn in our guns what
does that mean well she'd go without saying that he's gone way too far it
also should go without saying that he's acting with the use of illegal violence
and he becomes the violent person to say that if you don't any this is not new
he's been doing this you know an environmental regular if Congress moves
too slowly well I'll write an executive order but he didn't invent the executive
order and assigning orders you know I'll ignore this it's it's a bipartisan
accelerating and getting dictatorial that s our military orders us to turn
our guns in doesn't that make him a dictator if he just says I'll do
whatever I want well it's certainly the dictatorial move on that if the American
people had been a little better versed maybe they wouldn't have reelected them
so I do not say that he is a dictator like some of the 20th century dictators
that killed 290 million people but these are dictatorial moves they're very very
dangerous and people say to me why are you worried about you know the military
arresting Americans citizens National Defense Authorization Act there's only
one or two people were involved yeah but the principles 100% when you establish
your pencil so what he's doing is perpetuating a principle of putting
more power into the presidency and it's very very dangerous
the president under NDAA we're almost out of time sir will you will you turn
in your semi-autos well I might not even have anything to turn in for for that
purpose but I don't think the American people will I've always assumed that the
line in the sand may well be drawn if the federal agent marches in
unannounced and they say well give me your gun and give me your gold I don't
think they're there we'll do that you know come when I think the American
people will highly resent it and I resist so you think I was right then
telling piers Morgan if they try to confiscate the guns it will start 1776
part two well I put them in the same words but I think I said something very
similar to what you're saying well god bless you sir I hope we can get you back
again in a month what are any other websites that are important to plug just
campaign for liberty dot o-r-g we'll be listing some new things there because
we're making some other webpage I'm gonna have a a home page unfortunately I

ladies and gentlemen if you just joined us former congressman Ron Paul was on
the transmission and while he was on the news broke in the weekly standard and
other publications that Joe Biden they said executive orders they're set to use
executive orders to ban our guns and make us turn them in they've got 11
different bills turned in to do background checks and huge federal taxes
to buy ammo try to make you register ammo you already have I mean this is it
and they're probably gonna stage some more shootings this has all the looks
the last two Colorado and Sandy Hookup being partially are all staged and I
told you they were on drugs that's all coming out and it's all weird government
funding and bizarreness at every level so we're in a lot of trouble and and and
a lot of people are gonna cower to the system and go along with it that's why
it's such a dangerous shine that Glenn Beck well normally wouldn't even you
know give attention here on air because I don't want to be in rivalries with
people I mean I was watching last night cuz I was sent the clip with him and his
sidekicks and they were just literally look scared and freaked out and said
I'm spooky and scary and look completely freaked out that I'm getting news
attention because they're egomaniac narcissist okay I don't go great I'm on
TV on in thousands of newspapers it's like oh man great now I've really got to
watch what I say I mean this is about defeating the globalist that's what I
want I mean I wouldn't be up here putting it on the line calling for
second American Revolution peacefully before it gets violent I said that
because I can see they're gonna make their move we got to get real aggressive
we're gonna lose it but Oh piers Morgan and Becker like don't be aggressive sit
down and shut up they always tell constitutionalist libertarians what
quote conservatives that and later Jakari Jackson's gonna pop in at the
bottom of the next hour because he's in there it's like hours of this Glenn Beck
stuff we're trying to condense it down to a few minutes I'm a liar I sit on a
pile of lies I'm a fascist I'm spooky I'm scary I'm fat I lie to my listeners
you know there's no 1.6 billion bullets and then with lawyers at the end of it
you tell lawyers told him this he says now none of this may be true this is
just my opinion you better look it up yourself acting like don't look it up
and find out it's true knowing most people won't look it up and I mean he's
on a lot of the same radio stations as me I mean and he's saying don't believe
Alex don't listen to him this man shouldn't be popular same thing piers
Morgan saying cuz you guys are establishment okay and you know I pray
to God that I don't have a bad temper I pray to God that I can tell the truth
and be accurate I'm not perfect but you know what I don't like people saying I'm
a liar on purpose and then I'm a bad person and then I want a violent
revolution if we don't say hey don't try it and get the word out and say a
takeover is illegitimate there's gonna be one Ron Paul a senior statesman
historian economist just said there will be a revolution if they come for the
guns it's a fact you think I like being at the very front of the line on that
man I live in the real world folks I go into the arena and I wish more you would
have actually ever been in it yourselves I had a guy call me last week ago you've
never served the military so I don't trust you what does that even mean I
have served in the front lines of the battle for this Republic for 17 years I
have been threatened and physically attacked and crawled through hell and
psychological warfare attacks and dirty tricks and everything you can my family
threatened not because I'm a hero because I've got to defeat these people
and they know I am getting out to tens of millions a week and we're growing
they can see our exponential growth and this is the time they'll come after us
and they demonize you first before they go after you all these years Alex Jones
doesn't exist who's that all of them say that now he has a huge audience tens of
millions look out he's bad getting and I mean it really hurt me with Glenn Beck
and his weird little yuppie effeminate host how it's all calculated and
snake-like to deceive the audience while telling them that I'm trying to deceive
my audience before God I never try to deceive you doesn't mean I'm not
imperfect to make mistakes sometimes before God I'm real and before God I
know Glenn Beck he is a serpent my gut in his actions his fruits he is a demon

ladies and gentlemen we are in a maximum red level alert it's all happening just
like Sarah Brady promised she said he's gonna get the guns in the second term
don't worry just like he told Rahm Emanuel in the first campaign four years
ago stop saying we're gonna ban their guns it even happened in a press
conference for the press meeting he said shut up we'll get these people in our
own time these bitter clingers went to San Francisco and he said we'll get
their guns we got a kid in first and I'm supposed to sit there with known liars
like Piers Morgan going I don't want your guns I just want to ban them there
were no riots in England there's no crime increases we took the guns total
red alert look at drudgereport.com and we've got our stories where we're being
death-threaded up at info Wars calm and prison planet calm if you just joined us
high noon sheriff Biden NRA showdown he's there telling the NRA created by
the federal government at the end of the Civil War to go ahead and get in line
like you did to 63 in 68 and don't think they won't betray us you better call the
NRA folks we got Larry Pratt coming up the bottom of the hour this is an
emergency situation bang-bang Cuomo to announce sweeping gun laws including
bans Iowa lawmaker calls for confiscation of guns period Connecticut
lawmaker calls for background checks to buy ammo members of Congress have
introduced a legislation to do that gun sales soar in Atlanta and then look at
that that is proper reporting Hitler and Stalin White House threatens executive
orders on guns we have a video of Biden's talking about that we're gonna go
to in a moment but Vice President Joe Biden revealed that President Barack
Obama might use an executive order to deal with guns this is all going up at
info Wars calm right now but it's all up now at drudgereport.com get it get go
there get these links and say see we told you so I told you in the in the
December issue came out three weeks before Sandy Hook came out in late
November I said they're gonna sign executive orders there's gonna be mass
shootings and folks are gonna look they're gonna be false flags I believe
these are false flags they have all the earmarks we know Oklahoma City was here
they go you say the government in Oklahoma City criminal elements they did
fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment that even came out in CBS News
they did it to blame the Second Amendment and as Larry Pratt has said if
they'd stage fast and furious they'd stage Aurora the president is going to
act said Biden giving some comments to the press before a meeting with victims
of gun violence there are executive orders there are executive action that
can be taken yeah it's called dictatorship as Ron Paul said that's a
dictatorial move we haven't decided what this is yet but we're compiling it with
the help of the Attorney General and the rest of the cabinet members as well as
legislative action that we believe is required it's critically important we
act the president is going to act the president has said we're going to react
and they're gonna go get this rubber stamp with it says the Attorney General
and the task force as the president said we have got Holder scheduled for a
meeting that's currently taking place in the White House and they're gonna wait
till he gets inaugurated you watch and they're gonna drop a hammer on us
they're gonna say all right if you get a letter from the ATF because they already
do this to veterans we already know what they're gonna do you got to come into
the ATF for an evaluation they're gonna make you do a psychological evaluation
that's a total fraud we're gonna make you see a government psychiatrist it's
gonna cost tens of billions of dollars they're gonna do it and they're gonna
take your guns and they're gonna pick people that look kooky and act weird but
who are law-abiding to kill and say well they deserve it they fire them a SWAT
team and they're gonna attack police stations and blameless I mean this is
these are guys that wrote memos during the last four years saying we need
staged terror attacks to blame on libertarians conservatives and
constitutionalists and Glenn Beck even to his credit before he left Fox said
here's all their quotes about how they're gonna stage terror attacks and
he said blame me ie Glenn Beck no they said they were gonna blame anti new world
order people I mean they're saying they were gonna do this and blame us okay and
a lot of folks are gonna decide to cower to this if you cower they fully take
over I mean believe me it's not fun to get up here and me and these people's
faces it's not fun but it's got to be done they're going for broke now that
lots of threatening things got said to me while I was at CNN lots of little
cryptic things and I didn't say all that on air because people wouldn't believe
it I told you that yesterday I said I'm holding back I told you and I shot a
video that night and I left New York to go to New Jersey where I was taking off
in Newark and got like two hours sleep was I got to New Jersey because we had
Planco's police in the hotel following us around we turned down a street a guy
would step out you know all of his police I saw guns under there you know
they were like oh were you doing how you doing I mean this was this was bad
waiting for us at CNN waiting when we came out I mean it's super creepville
like they were on a rabbit hunt or something and I you know lived to fight
another day got out of there got out of Bloomberg's crime syndicate operation
since then they're making cryptic comments about my family and my children
being killed on Piers Morgan and I thought okay honey that's not a veiled
threat let's wait and see but it was said creepily with a lot of relish and
re-aired again on CNN and then they had the writer for the Daily Beast and it
was clearly scripted say we need to have you kill Alex the next time you seem
with a semi-auto you buy legally as if buying legally is what did it and then
the daughter of Huntsman top globalist minion says ooh ooh yeah peers I want to
see you do it in a uniform baby and peers is like I'll wear my brother's
uniform which he's in the military reportedly like it's okay like then the
message is the uniforms gonna kill you we're gonna play that clip
FPS Russian founder tied to a chair killed execution style gun manufacturing
company owner the TV show was a side thing they did that's why they were
level four level five till they got cannons and stuff for that show dead
killed execution style nothing stolen no guns no money at his factory number one
gun show in the world three shows canceled off discovery I'm talking to
some of the folks soon involved with the shows about what happened on the scenes
it's a purge folks they can't beat our gun culture they're gonna try to kill it
and right now it's going well Doug Hagman said his federal source said they
are planning if Larry Pratt gets run over if Wayne LaPierre gets shot if I
get pulled over and they say I pull a gun on a cop folks I normally
occasionally carry firearms I have decided to make the announcement and I'm
not gonna carry firearms for the time being so that it's on a record that I do
not have firearms so they can't set me up if they strike me down that's God's
will it's in God's hands you're like locks I thought you're all about defense
and 7076 peacefully but defend yourself yeah but I've prayed about it and it's
important that I say I'm planning no offensive actions and and and you know
if they try to set me up or try to bury a pipe bomb on my property is the ATF
done a lot of people obviously you know if they come to my house or shoot me or
something I'm not I'm not you know if the ATF comes and bust in I'm not gonna
pick up a gun and then they may be coming to kill me because that's the
message they're sending that's what mafia's do they killed thousands of
Mexicans hundreds of US citizens five police officers so pray for us but but
if they kill me I was murdered okay if they kill me I was murdered and I've
told you the last few months even before this happened I said something big is
about to happen I can see the writing on the wall so pray for us ladies and
gentlemen and again I've always had really bad cedar allergy it's gotten
really bad so I've had like a lot of chest cold but when I went to New York
and I can barely breathe when I came back I can barely breathe and stuff like
Benadryl doesn't work I'm gonna have to go to the doctor since that's why I've
sounded even more Clint Eastwood style with a voice because it's just
completely shot and I really need to rest as well I am overwhelmed I'm not in
fear I just love God and and and I'm sad for America I'm sad for my family I'm
sad that it's come to this I know I'm right about what I'm saying and Piers
Morgan Glenn Beck the entire media are saying I shouldn't be on the air and I'm
dangerous and I want violence and none of that's true and and they're saying
I'm a liar and then that I want to deceive people and all I ever wanted was
freedom nothing more all I ever wanted was decency and honor yes I have a
temper about bullies it's it's a hot button I don't bullies really get me
upset and it's probably because I got beat up no exaggeration probably 50
something times my bullies before I learned to fight back and now it's just
instinctive I get really upset and that's why I blow up is because I'm not
good at running and I knew these were police in New York and I had to swallow
my prize a few times almost got in their faces and I thought no that's what they
want so I got out of there but I never wanted to be the real leader of the
Liberty movement Ron Paul is more more of a statesman but he's 76 77 now what
is he 76 look up his age and unfortunately for all intensive purposes
I am the leader because other people like Ted Nugent others they don't get
the whole picture Rand Paul is such a statesman you know that he's just not
really leading right now he should be all over the he should be all over the
place climbing the walls trying to defend the Second Amendment right now
like Ron Paul's doing and I'm not criticizing it was just now is the time
to act Ron Paul 77 just had his birthday that's right a few months ago
media wise Matt Drudge is the leader when it comes to getting the word out
for whatever reasons is a focal point what I've called for they know that I've
got the biggest audience and and and I am in grave danger and the weird thing
is it doesn't scare me it's more like
crossing a river it's it's it's it's actually peaceful in a way but very
saddening that we are in the hands of criminals real criminals hardcore
tyrants and if we don't come out and say they're trying to become dictators it's
over we either back them down or it's over let's go to this clip here ladies
and gentlemen let's go ahead and go to clip of Biden's ten they're going to use
executive orders here it is executive orders executive action that can be
taken we haven't decided what that is yet but we're compiling it all with help
with the Attorney General and all the rest of the cabinet members as well as
legislative action we believe is required so I appreciate you very much
being here oh he appreciates the media very much being there we're gonna go to
bright and come back one more segment than Larry Pratt's joining us he'll be
on piers Morgan tonight battling right for him and again I just pray that God
makes me strong no matter what the course is not strong to face this that's
easy for me to do I asked God to give me the intellect and the and the and the
strength to communicate the message to the people to turn the tide please God
I'm weak I hope people will pray to give me strength weekend by GMO stressed out

one the raw probiotic again ladies and gentlemen I come off like a maniac a lot
of times and it's because I get hyped up about this I mean I know I'm right about
it as more and more stuff comes true I'm just completely freaked out at my core
and I'm flailing around trying to get people to wake up and get out of their
coma and you know what it isn't pretty sometimes but it's effective and that's
why the enemy's pulling out the stops against us and if they kill if any more
gun because it's not just FPS Russian there's been some other deaths of
prominent gun manufacturers that's why other gun manufacturers are like you
know we're getting out of the business you know you said they're meeting with
the NRA today telling them there's gonna be an executive order you get in line
don't you thugs get it you could get 99% of gun owners to turn their guns in the
1% is 1.5 million people it's a guaranteed civil war as Ron Paul said
that doesn't mean I want one I'm the last person that wants one but Glenn
Beck and CNN take out of context what I've said and say that I want a violent
revolution and that's ahead of a setup so if I get killed I want investigations
and I will never commit suicide but again he who's in us is greater than he
who is in the world and I need your prayers folks I believe in it I know
it's real people say well you're not a goody two-shoes Christian while you play
rock and roll sometimes it's not about that I love God my heart loves God I
know I'm like dirty rags to God but God knows I love innocence and beauty and
decency okay and that's what matters and that's why they always attack those of
us that have good hearts and say we're not for real because they're not for
real
now here's the clip which clip do we have first the guy going he helps my
kids don't get killed on CNN yeah yeah yeah let's go to the Daily Beast
go with Piers Morgan when they agree that that I need to be shot by Piers
Morgan but they'll dress him up in a uniform so it's okay then Piers goes
yeah I'll wear my brother's uniform now you people say it's a joke if I said
kill ki double hockey sticks anybody with a gun I would be arrested and by
the way I should be I said you break in my house I'm gonna kill you that's legal
and lawful to say yeah I've said Piers Morgan anybody you know tries to lay a
hand on me I'll defend myself that's different they they are fantasizing and
I've been around these authoritarians that call themselves leftist how many
times I told you I've been around them they'll come up to me when I've been at
countless democratic events covering them and they'll say you know one day
we're gonna kill you I'm like I thought you're a liberal yeah you know we're not
I mean these people are demons okay I don't know how else to explain it to you
and they can't control themselves if you're a radio listener you got to see
this pig this guy on the show who is the writer Buzz Bissinger this darling of
the left and him he looked when he talks about killing me he looks like he's
about to have an orgasm I'm serious I mean these people these people are sick
and that's why we have our guns Bissinger you understand that let's go
and go to the club here it is but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for
the only reason I think you needed is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to
see that I don't think guns are more guns are the answer here I mean there
are so she goes on to say yeah oh you wear a uniform then it's okay and then
appears oh yeah I'll get my brothers so they're all agreeing yeah yeah let's
kill Alex and that's a message just like they know if they said everybody go to
this suit place they've got the best soup in town there'd be a line 50 feet
long outside of it and everybody advertise if you're crazy go kill kids
at schools nobody's there with guns to protect them then that becomes self
fulfilling that's what advertisement is and they're on there saying and it's
other shows too somebody ought to kill Alex Jones that's what they're saying
and I had to run the gauntlet of their cops with guns getting in our faces the
ten blocks up there out of there waiting for us all over us I came out and said I
don't want to go out that I'm gonna go out the main entrance the guy goes with
the security goes you're going out the front I go I know there's detectives out
there getting our faces stuff and I think there's gonna be a bunch of me
goes you're going out and that punk security guard you got his suit like he
was FBI got off on he goes oh no you're going out that door and they were all
out there waiting you know I didn't do the tough guy thing no what do you guys
want I just went taxiing by the grace of God one was right there and we jumped at
it and left and then they were at our hotel okay I don't know what they were
planning you got the clip of them talking about my kids this is this was
on the same show last night here it is I don't want Alex Jones to get the phone
call at three o'clock in the morning that one of his children have been shot
and killed by somebody who shouldn't have a handgun or a rifle or a automatic
weapon I don't want him to get that phone call those eyes kind of sparkle a
little bit when it got to that part I'm not stupid okay and you know what you
know what I'm gonna do I got my course plotted I'm gonna accelerate speed and
I'm gonna politically ram you I'm committed everything my entire being
don't you know doing this only gives me the power to stand up against you a full

ladies and gentlemen it is now the top story at info wars calm and drugs report
calm with the video we played it earlier White House threatens executive orders
on guns I told you that was coming Larry Pratt executive director of Gunners of
America told you that there have been a lot of tweets sent out calling for my
death calling for Larry Pratt's death calling for Wayne LaPierre's death at
the NRA they say we killed the children they say it's our fault I guess we killed
the people that died or been injured in that big ferry crash we got it we got a
van ferries now bad things happen there's seven and a half billion people
in the world are close to it 315 million here they wave the bloody shirt of 20
poor dead shelter we pray for their families and then tell us we did it when
they're the ones that made them victim disarmament zones and I told you they're
going to use an executive order the ATF last year started telling gun shops what
to do outside law and they told him hey don't argue when he's reelected we'll do
whatever we want I talked to multiple gun show people in Tennessee in Arizona
in California and Austin we broke that they were being given memos and they
said well there's no law this law didn't pass they said well you do what we say
we're gonna shut you down we found an eye that wasn't dotted literally and now
when you go in to do your background it's all put in a computer it all go
when you call the feds it's all computerized you're already registered
they're now saying they're going to physically take the semi-autos like
Diane Feinstein said mr. mrs. America get ready to turn your guns in that's a
quote and then Piers Morgan says I don't want your guns I just want you to turn
all these in and then I get angry at him and then he says I'm dangerous I
shouldn't have guns when I have no criminal record and then the next night
last night and the man we're about to talk to he's scheduled to be under
tonight Larry Pratt Piers Morgan doesn't have a big audience but when it's a gun
debate it goes in all the other news and tens of millions probably a hundred
million I mean this is the biggest story in the last two days is what I did with
Piers Morgan and that wasn't my full plan it was part of it if he pulled bull
I was gonna get his face because all he ever does is bully people so I gave him
his own medicine back and put him on notice because I realized what Ron Paul
said last hour he said the line in the sand is the guns there will be a
revolution he agreed with me if they come to take the guns it will happen
folks I don't want this to happen I'm not planning to physically resist I'm a
media person I'm a general okay they're gonna use this to purge and persecute
gun owners and it is going to be an unmitigated nightmare for police and
military who even if you try to carry it out I mean it's a death sentence and the
glow that's the globalist plan they've been preparing for this and police are
like you're right if this happens it's gonna be horrible but they wouldn't dare
yes they will and they're getting it ready for another executive order with
the next mass shooting you know will happen with all their hyping and now we
have them saying Larry I called you this morning to get you on when you were
driving into work have you had a chance to see the CNN clip now where the host
and his two guests talk about shooting me and agree it's okay as long as they
wear a uniform Alec I haven't had a chance to even look at a clock non-stop
but I'll tell you what you were just discussing this executive order that is
something that I believe I might have even talked about on your show because
you've been nice enough to have me on so many times but sometime well in the last
year it occurred to me these guys don't have the votes in Congress and after the
election it was clear they didn't have the votes in Congress for the next
Congress either but Obama has shown by what he's done in other areas such as
immigration he'll just bloody well do what he wants and issue an executive
order against the law against the Constitution hey when you're socializing
the country you know what's a few broken laws here and there they were they were
only put on the books by a bunch of dead people that aren't here anymore it's our
country now and I want it because I got elected and so I think he believes he
might have been elected King although even the British King has far less power
than what he's presuming but I saw what they would do if you assume the guy is
lawless and you don't have to be a prophet and I'm not a prophet but I
could see that that would be for him the course of least resistance that's where
his water would flow if you will and he's doing it well I had Ron Paul on and
he just heard me right basically paraphrase what he said he agreed that
they're they want a civil war they know what they're doing if they think they're
going to get 160 million gun owners to turn their guns in there will be a
percentage that's not going to go along with it well it's very very very
critical that if anything bad comes down that it'd be very clear that it was the
government initiating violence remember Lexington and Concord that day's battle
was started by the British because I think his name was Preston or Prescott
the captain on Lexington green said hold your fire until until fired upon and if
I recall correctly there were a couple of guys that died almost immediately
following that order because the British did fire for quite a few of them but
that gave them the high ground moral high ground and I think it's absolutely
essential that that be that we hold our fire that we even be willing to perhaps
be the first one down because we are in a war of ideas of monster culture clash
and it's absolutely essential that we be perceived as the law abiding once as the
lawful ones that we need to make it understandable that there are two kinds
of rebels there's the rebel who goes out in the mountains on his own and is out
there kind of like Robin Hood shooting people and then there's the rebel that
comes with a badge if they're act if either one of them are acting outside
the law that makes them a rebel and I know they the statists of our time can't
get it through their head that they could be the rebels but the Constitution
was put up to strictly limit what the federal government can do well that's
profound what you said when Lenin took over and then Stalin they were rebels
and they and they even call us counter revolutionaries that's what Bill Ayers
and Obama in his training they know they're the rebels that's why they
operate like this and are buying 1.6 million bullets and armored vehicles and
demonizing real Americans because they are an occupying rebel enemy force
against the Republic and you're absolutely right so we need to remember
the Battle of Lexington that ultimately went very poorly for the British that
day because our guys insisted that the moral high ground be theirs and that may
take a lot more courage than would be needed to go and hide behind a rock and
shoot which they did later in the day but to stand there at first naked
against the British ball that was coming down at him out of those muskets that
that was real courage but they knew why they were there and in fact their
preacher had preached on that the Sunday before and he was there with him because
he believed as much as they did what he'd been preaching about I believe he
died I don't remember that but that's entirely possible because it was not a
fun day for either side the British ultimately lost about a quarter to a
third of their entire regiment that they sent out some 800 guys that many made it
back and more importantly we were able to get to London ahead of the British
couriers and point out what had happened and who had fired first and that it was
this oppressive government that we've been hollering about for four and six
years and formal petitions and petitions of rights bills of rights all those
kinds of things we're going over to the British mainland being published in
their newspapers and then it finally came to that and so I think we have to
remember that history the history that's not being taught in our government
schools sure but our forefathers did it right and god willing yes sir we'll do
it right I can't believe we're to the point that we're having to talk about
1775 1776 I mean this is this is not a joke and I had John a few weeks ago and
I said from all I've seen this with the greatest assault ever and you said it's
shaping up to be that undoubtedly now Larry Pratt of gun owners dot o-r-g this
is clearly the greatest assault ever certainly in my lifetime if for a while
I've been comparing it to Columbine but I'm beginning to think that they are
much bolder than they were even back in Columbine and one of the guys here made
a suggestion which I still think could well be the case and that is they've
overreached what Diane Feinstein has proposed in her legislation is so far
beyond what she excuse me got enacted in 94 that they're essentially with a few
exceptions coming for it all her much-vaunted statement after she'd
enacted her quote-unquote limited gun ban of 1994 was well I just didn't have
the votes otherwise I'd have said mr. and mrs. America turn them all in well
we know what her objectives are so we shouldn't be fooled she's told us and
she's now indicating that she wants more now I think she's getting greedy and I
think we can use that against her and god willing that's exactly what about an
executive order I mean Congress has got to start impeachment now with just
Biden and defunding without money guarantee Alex none of these Jaspers
here inside the beltway our volunteers they're extremely well paid I'm sure
that 99% of your listeners would love to have what this 1% that works here in the
government class is being paid this is definitely something that can be solved
partially by money if if we can get a get around the Speaker of the House who
is like a downed tank blocking a bridge and if somehow we can build another
bridge or get him off the bridge in some way then I think we could actually enact
spending measure that had a proviso in it none of these funds may be used for
the implementation of executive order whatever it might be sure go ahead
they're out of gas at that point you have always again been a very measured
calm person and I'm like that in private when I get wound up I get very very
upset and you know did that with Piers Morgan because he's always been a bully
I was not gonna let him bully me so I just you basically dominated him but I
want to play you a clip here because this is what was said last night amongst
other things they said they hope my children don't end up dead and and then
there was this so I'm gonna play it for you now Piers Morgan and guests discuss
shooting Alex Jones Daily Beast writer Buzz Bissinger says Piers Morgan should
pop Alex Jones with a semi-automatic weapon then Huntsman's daughter Abby
Huntsman of the Huffington Post says I'd love to see that laughter in a uniform
Piers Morgan I'd borrow my brother's uniform who reportedly is an army
officer so I guess if it's a uniform it's okay I want to play this clip and
get your take on it here it is but what do you need a semi-automatic weapon for
the only reason I think you needed is Pierce challenge Alex Jones to a boxing
match show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally and pop them I'd love to
see that I'll borrow my brother's uniform and then there was talk of
I hope my children don't get killed I mean and this is entering a whole
another level of people what they did there is reveal the heart of the
leftist the leftist is about force they're about imposing their
righteousness on us slubs that don't know what's good for us and it's such a
delightful topic to talk about offing some loudmouth like Alex Jones that'll
teach those bumpkins a thing or two won't it I guess it will my children
were there watching when their deaths were being discussed I mean they're
clearly trying to terrorize the entire American people with these shootings
while they're horrible statistically it's one of the rarest forms of death
right along with our general murder rate which is declining and I was just
looking at something that happily if my son Eric pulled something up it's quite
good there's an under reporting of murder data in England which has always
held up as the country that's so wonderful compared to ours British crime
I'm quoting from the finding reporting tactics keep murder rates artificially
low and then this is a quote from a report from the inspect what of
constabulary suppose that three men kill a woman during an argument outside of
bar they are arrested for murder but because of problems with
identification quote or a friend the main witness is dead charges are
eventually dropped in American crime statistics the event counts as a
three-person homicide but in British statistics it counts as nothing at all
and then the report is quoted directly here with such differences this is
British 2000 with such differences in reporting criteria comparisons of u.s.
homicide rates with British homicide rates is a sham that's the British cop
group the inspectorate of constabulary well can I have that headline cuz I've
got the Telegraph and others admitting that they're the crime capital of Europe
Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in the world because of course they have
more guns but but you can just type in Britain or England the crime capital of
Europe people are beat stabs you know but yeah I read all the time where if
you fistfight someone raping your wife that busts in your house you they throw
the book at you you know the farmer who'd been robbed three times defending
himself and they threw him in prison I mean they probably give some condoms to
the guy that was raping your wife and tell him to clean up his act amazing I
know I mean but see that's on purpose they want that's a criminal government
with trying to team up with the criminals why do they why do they love
crime-ridden cities run by mafias well because we're then terrorized and we
must depend all the more for our quote protection on the very authorities that
have put us into that predicament to begin with and I don't know whether
they're accepting it in England although it is as the Telegraph said two days
after that Piers Morgan interview it is the third it is the fourth most violent
country in the world violent crime which would include murder but also rape and
everything else and that's what watered down numbers because I've seen those
numbers before that they just let murder I mean they don't even investigate when
they come to your house and you and your wife are chopped up I mean it's just
like you could have the neighbor running around with a hand in their you know
hand of a chopped off person they just say oh no big deal right they do not
believe in self-defense that farmer it was infamous that up in the little town
of Norfolk in England had after the like the third home invasion by the same
gypsy gang members that had been terrorizing the whole area he shot one
of them in the dark of night who was coming up the stairs actually shot both
of them and killed one of them and for that they gave him a life sentence which
now he's out of jail because happily British public opinion finally focused
on that outrage and see see that's what scares me is that I'm a I'm still a
young man 38 but I've got aches and pains and things and you know problems
now from a you know life of action I can't imagine once I get old and all I
can depend on is the gun I mean if two guys are coming up my stairs I'm gonna
get so angry even if they're pretty tough I can probably deal with them but
not when I'm 65 70 I need that firearm and more and more now you know I mean
as I get older by more and more I try to avoid physical stuff it's just natural
we need to equalize things for for the infirm the old the women handicap I mean
the real liberal thing to do is to arm women exactly exactly and to make it so
that unarmed children can be protected by their teachers the janitors whatever
and schools rather than insist for now 20 years that if we just say no guns at
schools everything will be fine well everything is not fine that's where most
of our men in fact that's where all of our mass murders have occurred in
whatever kind of gun I hope you can get that out tonight with Piers Morgan's

about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans this is really
scary stuff defense experts warn that this odd device poses the gravest threat
we've ever known in fact just a few weeks ago former Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning about this
deadly threat I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may
be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up
that's why my friend just created a free video at weird device calm that exposes
this threat and blows the doors off the conspiracy go watch the shocking video
at weird device calm right now to discover exactly what it is plus
discover the number one way you and your family can survive this deadly attack
I'm not sure how long this video be online so go to weird device calm before

yeah the Daily Beast of Newsweek is making jokes about their writers say I
need to be shot and killed appears Morgan agreeing just amazing but you can
see the full video at info Wars calm also drugs report calm has it Larry Pratt
is scheduled to be on there tonight Larry I mean how big a deal is this I
don't feel like I'm putting the words into it properly how big of a deal is it
with with Biden saying don't worry they'll be executive orders and we're
going to take the recommendation of Attorney General Eric Holder who's the
fast and furious architect I mean why we need to bring that up when he earlier
had said even before he made it clear that they would go executive order but
two three four days ago sometime last week maybe it was sent to some anti-gun
group we're gonna have gun control by the end of January well wait a minute
the Congress couldn't even vote to adjourn for an ice cream social that
fast I mean it's just come on it's not gonna happen then that just reinforces
what you and I've been talking about clearly they're gonna go executive order
against us and so what Biden is is up to is setting the stage for this very act
of lawlessness and for them to talk about offing you I've just found that on
your page and it's great that you've got it there I think people ought to go to
your info wars calm and this is what needs to be this needs to go viral
people need to see that the left it's sort of like Che Guevara the Cuban
executioner for Fidel Castro he was literally the chief executioner and he
would have people executed even during breakfast time well he he wanted to see
that so he had a wall cut out of his office onto the body long onto the
shooting wall so that he could see the executions of the men women and children
taking place and he would have his breakfast you know while all of this
blood was flowing from those horrible people and that's the that's the tone
that I get that way what you were being subjected to was the Tata Che Guevara
had it right you know you know I also pulled up the quotes he even wrote
papers that are public he actually it's not propaganda he called Mexicans sub
humans he called poor Indians sub humans he called him trash he said who it
quotes who cares how many brown people die and and then I see Hispanics wearing
his shirt everywhere and he said they were animals I mean people just have no
idea that these communists are a bunch of elitists that like to kill people and
typically are the biggest races in history it's the status who like to pick
on a target population a minority population and of course in our country
that would be black or Mexican or somebody like that it's not the right
that is out making fun of or even threatening minority population we're
the ones that are talking about empowerment we're the ones that are
talking about let this man be what he can be don't tie him down Larry this is
our best interview ever things are very serious we've got to get Congress to
make a statement obviously saying no executive order on the guns Supreme
Court's ruled knock it off I know you'll call on that I mean that's basically the
battle plan correct sir seems to be we're in for a pretty rough ride I
think we're gonna win but this is a fight all hands on deck people better be

shooting that they stage are allowed to happen or wind up what I call a wind-up
toy get a mentally ill person profile them and send them out

introduced right now in Congress thank you for joining us
Weekly Standard is reporting that we already played the Biden video clip
earlier we'll play it again CNN is talking about the death of my children
they hope my children don't die but they do want to shoot me they said they want
Piers Morgan to kill me and then Piers Morgan agreed that would be a good idea
if you're a new listener and I'm not joking the videos up at info wars.com
drugreport.com has it on the left-hand side and by the way you did find the
Hagman clip of him two weeks ago right good job he's on a couple times what was
the date on that the 27th so like I said about two weeks ago a little shot two
weeks ago he said there's gonna be a purge of gun owners gun leaders are
gonna be killed according to his federal source and his source is real believe me
I wish his source wasn't real mm-hmm and he said the plan is a total takeover and
they're gonna use the NDAA to do it I'm not trying to scare people if we don't
talk about this is gonna happen and I've already got plainclothes cops all over
my butt when I was in New York SPF Russian the number one gun show in the
world hundred million viewers a month sometimes even more killed execution
style in Georgia at his gun factory tied up to a chair and shot in the back of
the head it isn't being investigated as a homicide assassination a bunch of
other gun people are being assassinated run over cars catching on fire being
shot it's it's it's not good it is not good and see I'm somebody that's had
people call up who are listening to my phone lines and tell me what I was
talking about to intimidate me I've been physically attacked I know people I've
interviewed who oh I got a big book coming out it totally double proves the
CIA is dealing drugs and the guy a month later gets shot twice in the head and
the police Gary Webb you know rules that he shot shot himself and blew his jaw
off and then shot himself again in the head they said that's quite normal again
I will not commit suicide and I don't use illegal drugs and just anything
happens to me I was murdered I want to get that straight and just pray for me
folks but if they do kill me that's part of God's plan now again life's a very
short thing anyways and it's a real service to humanity to stand up against
tyranny and so I'm on it I'm absolutely honored that I'm now the number one
enemy I mean we're watching MSNBC CNN back there I mean every time we walk
back there we got multiple TVs on its Alex Jones Alex Jones guns guns they're
all evil get them they're now defending themselves and no maybe he should be
killed I mean it's like they're just scum 800 to 5 at 9 92 31 800 to 5 at 9 9
2 3 1 jakari jacks is gonna be popping in for about 10 minutes to give us his
take on Glenn Beck at the bottom of the hour
Glenn Beck just absolutely has always for about seven years done everything he
can behind the scenes and in front of us pet masses to sabotage me and I get he
was always just unbelievable what he would do he admits to other local radio
rivals in shock jock stuff back when he was the other big liberal shock jock and
he just absolutely it wants me gone he said I should basically shouldn't be on
the air I'm dangerous I'm a fascist I'm scum I'm a liar that I want a violent
revolution when I desperately want the opposite
and he said I can't be trusted not bad definitely trying because he knows I'm
getting on more and more radio stations to inoculate his listeners and people to
not listen to the show because we're effective folks and Glenn I'm not trying
to be you but okay I'm for real I'm not playing it safe Jack okay I never said
Ron Paul was a terrorist and his supporters are terrorists and you need
to have the army quote used on him Ron Paul agreed he's a demagogue in the
first hour I never got up and said there weren't FEMA camps and then put lies out
he said that they're they didn't buy 1.6 billion bullets I said my gosh I can't
believe he's doing that it's well known it's national mainstream news after we
broke it at the end he said now I may be wrong about all this check it out for
yourself I mean it was so manipulative to cover himself I mean Wow and he's
there I mean yeah his he's got a bunch of FBI guys around him he's totally
handled folks totally handled he said that I said he's a CIA agent I said
there's always been government influence Glenn Beck's FBI handled and that's even
come out and it's just man look enjoy your life long after I'm gone bro all
right I really cared about humanity and people that have discernment know I'm
for real and you're and it doesn't hurt me that you're attacking that I'm a real
person and saying I'm a fraud and long it's that you're lying to your good
listeners who are good people I said I'd go to your calls it's just I got CNN
sanity to be killed I'm talking about my kids on air cryptically I got so much
stuff going on and then and then I see this clip and I couldn't even watch it
all and then I thought it suppose he went on for hours just how I'm this evil
fascist that's a quote and how I'm Van Jones and all this stuff and how I lie I
don't lie about 9-eleven I said we don't know exactly what happened there we just
know that the government left the hijackers in and that's been declassified
mainstream news look it up Michael Springman with a whistle and there were
drills of the same thing happening that day and I said it's going to be used to
build Homeland Security to go after constitutionalist because that was
always the plan and now it's happened I saw what's sad about this I saw a clip
and I'll go to your calls I saw a clip of Glenn Beck because I don't watch a
show I'm too busy but sometimes I see clips online and I even meant to play it
on air last week never got around to it most stuff I give to him we never even
get to and he was talking about how Obama runs al-qaeda and they're killing
people in Libya and Syria it was back in October and now he killed the ambassador
to cover something up and how the Turkish ambassador was there to get the
missiles and of course it was what we'd all broken a long time ago and put in
the news you know we we forced it out there and then now mainstream news is
covering it and I was like wow he's saying the
government runs al-qaeda the hijacked government that that's what I said 11
years ago I mean it's a fact bud and he says he's un-American he says that the
US government blew up the towers
there are all sites all sorts of parasites that get inside animals you
know if tapeworms are in a dog's stomach I don't go to the dog and and poison it
and say the dog is a tapeworm the US government is full of tapeworms okay
tapeworms in the government did this I mean can you get that I know you get
that but you think your audience is stupid and see I don't think people are
stupid let's play the clip one more time if you
just joined us of them saying on CNN that I need to be shot and then piers
Morgan agreeing along with miss Huntsman here it is but what do you need a
semi-automatic weapon for the only reason I think you needed is Pierce
challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match show up with a semi-automatic that you
got legally and pop them I'd love to see that and again they oh I'd love to see
that yeah I'll wear my brother's uniform haha yeah we hope your kids don't get
killed Jones played that club a few times already hope your kids hope your
kids don't get some night hope your kids don't get killed some night and then oh
we need to shoot there's the daughter of the guy that helps go over to China and
make sure our media and cover the big slave camps let's go ahead and talk to
Jared and Texas you're on the air go ahead I was a curious if certain guns
are outlawed how do you think that they'll they'll confiscate them like did
you think that the government's physically going to come to people's
houses but they know have these guns no not in phase one they're going and I
already knew they do this but I've talked to my sources what the training
is they're gonna set up gang checkpoints on the highway it's already begun all
over the country federally funded totally illegal martial law checkpoint
it'd be martial law slowly implemented and then they'll say we got a record you
got these firearms you'll be like huh you know half the time you know how many
guns you bought how many years ago you know or who you sold to a buddy or what
you traded and then and then you'll be like oh yeah I got some guns well
doctor all right let's get you out of that vehicle and take you on and I got
you admitting you got those guns and then they're gonna serve a search warrant
on your house that's and then they're gonna you know take down everything on
your computer plant stuff on you whatever that's the new culture and all
the crime labs all the big ones have been caught framing people and then
they'll tell you we're gonna you plea bargain on this and you know all right
we want you to work as a spy now and other gun owners and that's just how it
works and it's targeting us for political persecution like Jews and
Nazi Germany or or or free market people in Russia and maybe this is their
takeover this is what it's gonna look like and it's a way to go after
everybody and then they'll pick like Mormon break-off groups they think they
can demonize or groups like the Davidians and they're gonna go out and
blow up their churches burn them down and and say look you're gonna die if you
don't turn your guns in and so that'll be their plan and then people will start
fighting back it's guaranteed Ron Paul agreed in the first hour and we're not
happy we need to stop that and then the Civil War will begin and they're just
gonna say we're going after everybody and and so that's that's what they're
planning is that answer your question yeah but I also do you think that
that'll be local law enforcement as far as you know sheriff absolutely they've
got it multi-jurisdictional SWAT team people who've been profiled and been
found that they'll do whatever they're told some will be criminals in the force
summer just totally do right to do whatever they're told others will do it
for the paycheck and then the rest will all be on a patrol right and take us a
little old ladies and that's already set up they're already doing the training
nationwide they told them be ready in the next two months to begin highway
checkpoints and they've already started the highway checkpoints but and they're
already going through cars and taking your guns and you know they'll
selectively you know well Alex Jones has semi-autos he didn't turn in and you
know come SWAT team me and you know say I made a wrong move I mean you know
it'll be a big bag I mean you know that's what men do is they kill American
Patriots and it'll be like man I killed a grizzly bear look I got the big
Patriot look at him look at him we shot him five times look at him flop around
while I'm bleeding out on the ground that's how they work that's how they
stomp your brains out like Nazi Germany tell they take your wives and break
their noses and that's what they want to do and put your kids in forced labor
camps they're not gonna get away with it looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves

it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out of the strong man
stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit
belongs the man who was actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and
sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errors who comes short again and
again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does
actually strive to do the deeds who knows the great enthusiasms the great
devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end
the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst of it if he fails at least
fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and
timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat Teddy Roosevelt said that in a
speech in Paris France the 23rd of April 1910 there's a full speech there type in
man in the arena and that is where this will lead drones secret arrest torture
that's already on the books they're trying the police for it I wanted to
debate Alan Dershowitz who says that whoever they want they should be able to
grab and torture people like that is liberal that is a good idea if the
government's real just disappear you kill your torture and people like man
that's liberal yeah that Alex Jones he's dangerous we need to get his guns on the
government he's guns so we can torture and kill you well that's liberal they're
like and then the next night they're like yeah we ought to kill Alex Jones
yeah I'd be really fun to kill him hey they're on power trips let's go to
secrets of the Fed in New Jersey go ahead thanks for holding
hey Alex thanks for taking my call I wanted to go into a couple solutions
people always are on here criticizing you that you don't give solutions which
really I just said Congress needs to start impeachment now or needs to say
you can't sign executive orders taking guns all I give is solutions that's
armchair quarterbacks bitching that I'm in the arena go ahead oh look I agree
with you and it's funny that you just had that quote from Roosevelt my father
actually had bought that for me when I was a child and it hung on my wall when
I was growing up but the point is is that the solutions is the information
it's up to the listeners to go out and do something with it for instance my
friends and I you know we're listeners and we decided we needed to take action
we started a Facebook page we started a website we've got a hundred and forty
thousand people on our Facebook page we started this website four months ago
we've got 91,000 hits on our website yesterday and I'm nobody I'm just some
guy you go engage the enemy exactly and I'm gonna say this if they shut me up
who's gonna take my place I don't care if they end up destroying me I'm not
happy about it but I I'm committed I want you guys to know your leaders
exactly we've got to be these are these are not boss hogs that just want to run
things these are killers don't people if you like I know they're killers we
better bend over no no no they want to gut this country I'm sorry go ahead no
you're absolutely right and the point is is that every piece of information is a
bullet and unless you go out there and use that bullet the information you know
this is metaphor here but unless you go out and use that information and pass it
along it's worthless these this is the tools either you're gonna end up
spreading information now or shedding blood later so it's up to us to go out
and do that beyond that when it comes to guns the solution is very simple I
remember I brought home my first pistol the 357 Magnum I showed it to my wife
and she got so scared she went and hid behind the door little did she know that
the door wasn't gonna do much the block at 357 but she was terrified of the
thing so I brought her to the range and next thing you know her Facebook picture
is her at the range people enjoy shooting and there's a hundred and
sixty million of us if we convert one more person we win that's why they want
them now that's why they had to advertise the schools as the places to
kill people and use their Prozac heads to do it
yep next time you go to the range bring someone who is on a fence about guns for
someone who's never shot a gun before and I guarantee you 99% of those people
are gonna be enthusiasts and ask you when look look how they try to convert
people to communism and collectivism to get them under their control we've got
to convert them to liberty god bless you great points my friend let's talk to
Bill and Virginia you're on the air go ahead

and the misquotes and stuff that they were doing or just amazing no they said
things that I never said and they repeated them over and over again and
and then they said I should have my guns taken I'm dangerous when the next night
they said I should be killed not only said that but they said you were
basically crazy and all your listeners were too it's amazing and then they said

time for you to choose a side you're listening to Alex Jones by the way I had
the shipping department back there with all the great products we carry at

last few weeks because you don't plug anything and I've refused all these on
air live sponsors most talk show hosts you know every segment or plugging thing

to hire more reporters make films crews have contests I'm just so focused
tunnel vision I'm not even plugging stuff despite that we have a hundred
thousand copies of these we're down to two thousand copies of the first issue

them in groups of ten up to a hundred at cost to give to people big-color glossy

them up to hand out at your dental office to hand out at your barbershop
whatever you can buy 10 copies for 14 bucks 100 copies for even less per
capita and when you get a subscription people are like it's $59 for 12 issues
yeah they don't let you send these media mail it's like two dollars and 40
something cents to mail each magazine so close to half the cost is just the
shipping then there's the handling that we sell these not that it's bad to make
money we sell the subscriptions fifty nine ninety five for twelve of these at
cost it's at our cost now I do intend to get enough subscribers to make it
profitable because then I want to syndicate it and have local in followers

TV info wars news calm the true future of the Internet okay pre Glenn Beck
everything we do for over a decade he rips off and copies and that's why he's
always been trying to keep me off Fox I found out he'd want me on there when I
came to be a guest once he's throwing a fit that was told by other Fox host oh
my gosh Glenn Beck tells people he won't have on the show that you know you
shouldn't go on his show I mean he goes around to everybody I even know the
names of prominent people who've told me this and if Beck ever challenges me you
know some of them didn't even say I couldn't say it but I still haven't I
don't want to create a controversy I don't sit up here speaking of that the
point is get a prison planet on TV membership I don't get up here and in an
attack Glenn Beck except that when I have seen things like him come out and
say I FEMA camps are real I'm gonna expose them this is three years ago and
then what that guy's always said they don't exist and I predicted and I waited
till a few days before so that so so wouldn't be me shaping their show
because I knew from insiders he had like five guys watching everything I do but
you go to his website it's our stories rewritten I mean most of them I mean
what he charges for his online TV what he does the truth lives here all of it
and then I've talked to the insiders I've talked to multiple people over and
over again about man Glenn Beck done like you sponsors everybody I mean he
rush Limbaugh isn't out to get me Michael Savage isn't out to get me I
mean I wish them well I don't agree with everything they say or do but they're at
least pro-gun and you know constitutionalists at some level I mean
I I'm not but I found out Glenn Beck would do stuff like he admits this like
call up the other shock jock when he was a liberal talk show host you have 15
years ago or so and say I'm glad your wife had a miscarriage I read those
reports and just really nasty stuff I mean he's a demon he's a demon and the
thing is he covers a lot of good stuff he's gotten better over the years so
every time I wanna I saw him in a video last week saying the government runs
al-qaeda in Libya and Syria and it's horrible well I mean yeah we know that
we've been saying it for two years then he says I'm a traitor because I say
elements of the government run al-qaeda and I have all these historians and
experts on and then I hate America and then I'm a fascist and and just on and
on and on and the issue is my uncle said I don't want to hear about Glenn Beck
ever again I can't stand him well he moved to Texas he goes around all the
people I get on my show that live here in Texas and talks trash about me it's
just ongoing and I'm sick of it and now he knows we're gaining all these
affiliates as he loses affiliates we're rising while he's falling which I don't
he's got hundreds of millions of dollars he'll be able to reach people in TV but
he's announced I'm the libertarian leader I'm the libertarian talk shows I'm
the cutting edge I've got reporters all over the world like we do I've got the
reporters I and it's my my model which I haven't had the time or energy to even
fully deploy and I'm watching this guy who who rips me off for everything and I
wouldn't care if he was a good guy because the necessities the mother of
invention the greatest form of flattery is imitation I wouldn't care if it
wasn't so personal and if he didn't do dirty tricks constantly and edit what I
say and misconstrue and do horrible things and if he wasn't that cynical
fake snot nose type like Piers Morgan who is into how they're smart and you're
dumb and they're manipulating and then he says I'm doing that buddy I got a
good brain about the world works but there's not a bunch of calculation once
I decide what direction I'm going I'm more like a rhinoceros so don't sit
there and claim I'm some oily shifty person I make mistakes but they're not
on purpose you say I'm not a conservative you're right I'm a
constitutionalist because the word conservative doesn't mean anything
today means Mitt Romney okay I'm not that you know they say I'm so right-wing
I'm left all this baloney man I'm for justice I'm against killing kids with
drones who are innocent I'm against warrantless wiretapping the left claim
they were all against that when they're all part of the same thing to get into
power I realize that too so when Bush is in I'm called a communist and when
Obama's in I'm called a right-winger or a fascist and Beck said almost exactly
what Piers Morgan said I'm dangerous it's bad I have a big audience on and on
and on after saying I had no audience and he said that I was lying about 1.6
million bullets but then at the end he went now I may be wrong about all this
you can see the little guy's been talking to lawyers better check out what
I said man that that's like this is a work of fiction you know I say check out
what I said to see it for yourself don't just believe me that's my old saying
that he says all the time just it's like listening to myself but twisted he takes
he admits it too by the way they talked to insiders was in the New York Magazine
article Oprah Winfrey Alex Jones it's kind of a fusion of those two fake
emotionalism and let me tell you why I know Glenn Beck's really bad because
again he's going after me to tell his audience don't listen to him he's
dangerous he's bad I'll tell you why he's doing this because he's so cynical
and so worldly and so and I hope he's got a good side every time I hope I just
see the nastiness that he said he was going blind for macular degeneration I've
had dr. Blaylock all these brain surgeons neurosurgeons optometrist on that
aspartame is what alcohol based it breaks down into that what alcohol makes
go blind it causes macular degeneration starts dissolving the cornea and the
nerve connections and so I wrote an article saying hey Glenn you're asking
for sympathy and you're out you know at this at this rehabilitation center for
weeks and all this I said I said Glenn man stop drinking Diet Coke I see you
every time on your show with one he makes a big deal out of it and he
attacked me and told me I was a joke and scum I mean look Glenn Beck knows that's
bad he talks about eugenics no one talked about that I put it on the map
I'm not even proud of that I'm just trying to warn people so in a way it's
good he's ripping us off them but the problem is he's doing it so he can
control the movement and be a gatekeeper that's the issue and he's doing it at a
time when the enemy is coming against me and calling for me to be shot on CNN
last night and I'm being followed around by folks and harassed I mean folks I'm
Alex Jones we even got some video do show to these guys going like this and
turning up against walls when we come by I mean all over the place you walk in
the hotel there they are it's like what in Hades is going on I mean I got I mean
this is real they're on TV saying ought to be shot and this guy doesn't even
want me to say when Drudge Matt Drudge and he had a story yesterday about the
EU documenting it's killing people and make them go blind and how they may ban
it actually something reasonable going on even though they use a tyranny some
of their bureaucrats know it's really bad it's in most products down since
over 10,000 I know of and to make a long story short here Drudge had another
story up yesterday just warning people just hey oh by the way look they're
admitting this is hurting you just a normal thing hey by the way don't drink
antifreeze I mean it's it's it's it's spiritual sickness and again people are
always sending emails or comments get team up with Glenn Beck and I don't try
to say anything about him because I know because I get I hear from listeners
every week or so he's making stine remarks and you know it doesn't get to
me in an ego level it hurts me to know that he is to take over
that's his job is to be the Patriot he's the guy we're all supposed to go to and
I just hope if something happens to me folks that other leaders stand up and
spring up and are out there that's what I try to do with reporters and others
that are here is that is that we just can't let them have these Judas coats
and you can look at anybody and say hey they're a Judas coat they're a Judas
coat I've been accused of that but with Glenn Beck man I mean he said Ron Paul
supporters want to blow up buildings and the army should be used against him if
you're like I never heard that just search it you'll use the army on on on
Ron Paul supporters or Ron Paul says he's a demagogue I mean at key points
when he was about to win primaries he came out and said Ron Paul people are
liberals they want to blow up buildings like Oklahoma City I mean and he's just
really duplicitous and now he says he is Ron Paul and he's our leader well I'm
not your leader and neither is Glenn Beck you've got to be your leader to
turn this around Jakari Jackson we've got this clip that I mean tell us your
view on this because you were talking about this morning and you could break
down the video clip what's your take on this and tell us what clips coming up
here the clip from the Glenn Beck show I don't normally watch Glenn Beck guys
here at the office said hey check this out and so I took a look at it and it's
like so I never watched the show but it's what I expected to see it's just
Alex Jones is bad he talked about your your visit on Pierce Morgan and they
said here's this guy Alex Jones going on Pierce Morgan the first they didn't want
to mention you by name then one the guy slipped up said Alex Jones you know
Glenn Beck was referring you to another guy that crazy guy that fascist that
that whatever this guy who shreds the Constitution or something to this
deceiver yeah he stands on a mountain of lies and says he's pro-constitution and
he says he's you know debunked FEMA camps and all these other things you
know forgot to put you know we have all the bills we have all this the name of
it civilian inmate labor camp program model states health emergency powers act
civilian internment of facilities the emergency internment facilities the
executive orders the army manuals right and I sent all that kind of stuff to him
during his month-long investigation three years ago right but it's it's a
hit piece you know people do what they do and you know he had his guys they
with them they're laughing about you know you and how you hang out with
Charlie Sheen one of the guys try to do Alex impression and actually you know I
guess he was saying he want to have some type of sex well well well they didn't
say it well they've said before that I've yeah I must have you know I've
been doing something in the shower which is obvious I could own them for that but
whatever and the point is I knew Charlie Sheen before he went back into drugs
he'd been off drugs for over a decade right really smart guy and I went out to
LA quite a bit you know but to be on TV shows and stuff and I just got you know
obviously I went out there when he was getting off drugs he was pretty wild the
media was saying he didn't go to the hospital for hernia and I had seen him
when he'd come back from surgery right he'd been out swimming I said man I've
seen you you know I've seen your hernia then they go yeah in the shower with him
having sex you know they didn't say this yesterday they said it before and again
this is the type of bizarreness that that goes on from these people let's go
ahead and play did you get it all in there where I'm a fascist and all this
oh yeah it's about a minute long but I think I got everything in there that
they said okay let's go ahead and go to that clip right now here it is
Piers Morgan whose clear agenda is gun control and watch his face whose whose
clear agenda is the government is out of control which it is Alex Jones is using
this so he can be more popular and more people will talk about him so now they
immediately books the madman this is how they like every tea party or to seem
like that guy the screaming moron the fat moron I think is psycho I don't know
what he is except a conspiracy theorist you cannot say I'm for the Constitution
and and and declare it standing on a mountain of deceit that sounds like the
ravings of a fascist I'm not the FEMA camp guy this guy's a real day wow this
is the guy who was convincing 50% of Democrats that George W Bush was
responsible for bringing down the World Trade Center and if you don't agree with
him you don't just you don't just disagree you're in on it he is he is a
really he's a really spooky guy you know I'm somebody who's been spooked by evil
and who's standing up as best I can and just asking God to give me guidance and
I'm it I'm in the arena and Glenn you were a liberal shock jock guy that had
wars with all the other talk shows in every city you were in you've you've
admitted it but I'm not in some war with you bud okay I want to try to be a
friend but I've watched you I've been told man Glenn Beck doesn't tells people
that he won't have him on if they ever have you on and you're told this four or
five times and then you Garrett Fox and they go Glenn Beck's throwing a fit you
can't come on interesting that he just like Piers Morgan did it wasn't about
the issues it wasn't about the things you're talking about like the the 1.6
billion bullets it's that Alex Jones said it and we didn't have time to put
it in that clip but he says if you got your dad story from info Wars it must
not be true that there's 1.6 billion bullets being bought by the government
and so on same thing when Piers Morgan you know he has you on the show and it's
not about you know gun rights and this and that it's about being deported which
you know yeah that is something you are a part of but the larger issue is gun
rights in this country and he completely ignores and just why do you want to
deport me why do you want to deport me and even said it at the beginning of the
interview with Pierce we got a bunch of foreigners telling us what to do nobody
put up with this right obviously you're not getting deported I told him that
before the show I said nobody's gonna deport you it's to point out you're here
telling us what to do and nobody else would put up with that and he goes back
into it on the show but the my issue is if you watch the whole clip of them they
are freaked out and upset that I'm in the media right and and and again this
isn't some big breakthrough for us this is a great time of danger we already had
a giant audience when Piers Morgan goes you have a huge audience you have too
much power you're dangerous Glenn Beck says the exact same thing right you said
George Bush blew this up when I said government knew about it government
opened the doors for these people governments running Al-Qaeda today Glenn
I mean I should get an apology from Glenn Beck but they're trying to get
conservatives to hear me and go well everything he says must be bad because
if we get aggressive we win notice how the so-called left is always aggressive
with us right but then we're not supposed to go hey man stop lying and
saying you know what my guns the bills are introduced Morgan right just when
Pierce Morgan he had Larry Pratt on he was yelling at him called him stupid and
all this and that and when he's you know when you're there he's sitting there all
all calm and collected then the next night he's like oh I just let Alex Jones
make fun of me and and yell at me and stuff and even I had to make a joke
about it last night when I did the the intro for the tonight the the nightly
news show and I said that appears Morgan's master strategy was to sit
there while you threw facts at him and say nothing you know that was his master
strategy and then the next I said of course once you're gone you're back here
in Texas then he comes out Alex Jones this and Alex Jones that well what's
amazing about the Glenn Beck bullet quote we'll have to play that tomorrow
we don't have time I take a few calls after this is that you know you see the
deception he's going oh somebody brought it to me and I'm like oh that guy that's
all lies and then later is like it might even be true but she can't believe it
and then later oh don't don't I might be wrong check it because he knows
absolutely well there's links the federal government admitting it but he's
gonna sit there and say I'm alive hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the

I'll do a little bit over here I'll take your calls and I'm gonna go debate fake
liberal authoritarian Tom Hartman on his radio show and a bunch of other stuff
you know I have to get myself right with God and realize just how serious all
this is and that's what I mean it's very sick to watch people engage in media
tricks against their audience it just disgusts me it's like I don't even
hate Glenn Beck or Piers Morgan or that Daily Beast guy saying I should be
killed I hate the hypocrisy that I'm the bad guy while they're lying about me and
saying I should be killed jacari before we take a few calls here in this segment
the next any other points you'd like to add well just you know we were watching
the the Piers Morgan last night me and some of the guys here at the studio and
I couldn't believe just you know the clip you've been playing this guy says
yeah we should kill Alex Jones and they're gonna spin and say oh we were we
were joking about it but if you said something like that it'd be some big
some big story about oh look at look at this evil gun guys just like with the
NRA after the Sandy Hook that people said hey go kill the NRA and that's
perfectly fine well we think the cops were all over us not so much for
intimidation now but because they were scared like Oh Alex Jones is coming you
know what's gonna happen it's like come on man you guys I know you think it's
tough to be authoritarians it's bad it'll destroy the country it was even if
you're evil it will destroy productivity right I mean we did this is we've gone
down this road this is bad for the enforcers I mean you guys really want to
play dictator I think they do that's exactly I mean I as a nightmare and I'm
thinking you know the thing is I could be a selfish person shut up play along
leave the country whatever and survive my spirit can't let me jakar right my
flesh says man don't do this for my spirits in control it's like you're
gonna do it right you're going all the way and then to have some sniveling
usurper liar say that I am a deceiver makes me angry you work behind the
scenes here we trying to deceive people no we're not trying to deceive people I
mean I don't know Glenn Beck's agenda I don't know Pierce Morgan's agenda but
what we do here what what this is this is this is real this is that came out
three weeks before it all started I said this is you're coming for our guns and
we've been telling people forever that that they want your guns that Obama
wants your guns but you know even though he's saying it in debates in these
different forms people didn't want to believe it and now it's coming all out
and it's now it's that shift it was they're not coming for your guns and now
you shouldn't care that they're coming for your gun we're gonna kill Alex but
that's nice too yeah that's perfectly fine well I mean they're always talking
about how they want to put us in forced labor camps and stuff right
Belafonte is like well what else can Obama do put his detractors in camps I
mean and then I've got the bills and I've got the the orders and that's like
that doesn't exist Alex is bad I'm willing to come up here folks and tell
you what's going on have you been on the army dot Mel and seen the FEMA camp
documents for yourself I've seen it I mean they just hope you don't go look it
up folks I mean it's all out there in your face all you have to do is look for
it I mean according now announcing gang checkpoints all over the country
reported on that where you pull up and they search your car right go and take
your shirt off we'll see if you're a gang member who's got any guns in here
right that's martial law boys and girls all the while they can give you a
cavity search you and everybody in your vehicle using the same glove yeah again
a cavity search is obviously illegal right unless it's an emergency now it's
we're gonna do it all and they're just like and then in the DPS like yeah
that's that's good mm-hmm it's all about see what we can get away with people
people just won't stand up to it because they believe I don't I don't understand
it yeah because they believe these other guys that even though you're physically
being assaulted that doesn't exist the FEMA camp doesn't exist the the cavity
checks roadside don't exist because we say it doesn't now the NSA is like yeah
we're listening all of you that weren't shut up right you're a kook because you
don't like it I thought I was a kook I thought I was a kook because I said it
was going on yeah see we're not good guys now that we're right we're even
worse your car the NSA told me I was crazy I could find their their place on
the Google map so I'm crazy for I can knock it you're there in an admitted
NSA basis in the papers they're like this isn't an NSA base I'm like you're
across the street from a Walmart man what what what are you what are you
doing out here the guy's like I asked the guy I asked the guy Alex I said what
is this place is like I can't tell you what this place is I was like man I

all right final segment here a little overdrive starting it to everybody I'll
try tomorrow I'll try my best you know I can't stand what I do on radio I'm just
doing the best job I can bill in Virginia finish your point about a FEMA
announcement you heard go ahead thanks Alex for taking my call again yeah
yesterday on a local radio station here in Virginia they did a PSA from FEMA and
it kind of concerned me a little bit because of listening to your show
basically they said they put out a few points that we all should have three
days of water and food duct tape and plastic to seal doors and windows and
some sort of high-quality dust mask for any biological or other attack yeah and
let's be clear they break in now and take control and they always start with
that next it'll be report illegal guns I've already seen them do this a few
years ago you're just in the beginning stages our cell phones now are getting
FEMA overrides which we knew were coming now they're saying it's gonna be
messages from the president forced onto your phone yeah they were very urgent
about saying doing it in January and making sure it's done this month yeah I
don't know they want you know everything collapses they tried to keep you safe
but your cookie if you get a year supply you're only supposed to be a week supply
or a three-day supply it's all psych warfare why is FEMA wired into the
internet kill switch now all the radio all the TV UHF VHF cable they all are
wired in to put out whatever messages they want but they don't need to take
over they've already got their messages going out except talk radio and there's
only a few hosts that'll tell it like it is I mean and we're gonna lose
everything I see good signs by a lot of conservatives are really getting the
hardcore now because they better it's time to admit I've been right Ron Paul's
been right other it's classic tyranny folks it's time to admit we've been
right okay I mean that's what's so frustrating is that we we don't want to
be proven right the rest of the way okay I appreciate your call my brother
Scott in California you're on the air and disagrees goes ahead hey I was just
calling because I wanted to comment on the CNN interview and I you know I'm one
of I think many that think that you did more harm to the cause of you know the
libertarian freedom-oriented sure cuz Piers Morgan told you some no no not at
all I've been listening to you since 2003 and you calling him a redcoat doing
the British accent doing everything I mean imagine if he was black and you
would have done the stereotypical black accent so you're you're a former liberal
who's now become a libertarian because because look look look bloody I'll make
fun of the snot-nosed upper-class twits that they even make fun of over in
England all day long okay I'll do that all I want and the point is we put it in
their face about what was happening and again could I've done a better job
absolutely but I'm in the arena I'm in the arena you understand that you
quintessentially fit every single stereotype it was they use those
stereotypes of what they don't want us to be because that's winning our founders
murdered people according to the British redcoats who abused our rights killed
them okay I'm not calling for that I got in their face oh are you concerned about
them saying I need to be shot last night oh that's just funny ha ha ha but me
getting in their face that's not good right no you're the one that's always
ranting about COINTELPRO and that's exactly what you were doing you were
controlled opposition dude well you know what I am myself and I believe what I
did was right getting mad at him so I appreciate your call COINTELPRO goes
around and tries to get people to fight with each other and in fighting COINTELPRO
does what you just did I don't think you're COINTELPRO that's just an old
60s 70s term one form of psychological warfare they engage in the cognitive
infiltration that Sunstein talks about it's more important here's the deal but
I told you about three months ago they were gonna come with executive orders
for the guns now it's a fairmonger it's now happening so I tell you what I'm
just you know what you go out there you build the media organization and you
engage the globalist no you're not gonna do that you're gonna spend all day
running around on every website every message board on how bad I am you're
not even sophisticated enough to know that actually helps me okay you don't
understand that in a brain-dead mass of people I'm there to shake them out of
their coma go read the best minutes of television ever
James James Rappaport's article I should read that John Rappaport it is it is
powerful it explains it get him out the hypnosis
